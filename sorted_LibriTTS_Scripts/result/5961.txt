START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SAMUEL THE SEEKER Produced by Charles Franks Charles Aldarondo and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team SAMUEL THE SEEKER By Upton Sinclair CHAPTER I Samuel said old Ephraim Seek and ye shall find He had written these words upon the little picture of Samuel s mother which hung in that corner of the old attic which served as the boy s bedroom and so Samuel grew up with the knowledge that he too was one of the Seekers Just what he was to seek and just how he was to seek it were matters of uncertainty they were part of the search Old Ephraim could not tell him very much about it for the Seekers had moved away to the West before he had come to the farm and Samuel s mother had died very young before her husband had a chance to learn more than the rudiments of her faith So all that Samuel knew was that the Seekers were men and women of fervor who had broken with the churches because they would not believe what was taught holding that it was every man s duty to read the Word of God for himself and to follow where it led him Thus the boy learned to think of life not as something settled but as a place for adventure One must seek and seek and in the end the way of truth would be revealed to him He could see this zeal in his mother s face beautiful and delicate even in the crude picture and Samuel did not know that the picture was crude and wove his dreams about it Sometimes at twilight old Ephraim would talk about her and the tears would steal down his cheeks The one year that he had known her had sufficed to change the course of his life and he had been a man past middle life too a widower with two children He had come into the country as the foreman of a lumber camp back on the mountain Samuel had always thought of his father as an old man Ephraim had been hurt by a vicious horse and had aged rapidly after that He had given up lumbering it had not taken long to clear out that part of the mountains Now the hills were swept bare and the population had found a new way of living Samuel s childhood life had been grim and stern The winter fell early upon the mountain wilderness the lake would freeze over and the roads block up with snow and after that they would live upon what they had raised in the summer with what Dan and Adam Samuel s half brothers might bring in from the chase But now all this was changed and forgotten for there was a hotel at the end of the lake and money was free in the country It was no longer worth while to reap the hay from the mountain meadows it was better to move the family into the attic and take boarders Some of the neighbors even turned their old corncribs into sleeping shacks and advertised in the city papers and were soon blossoming forth in white paint and new buildings and were on the way to having hotels of their own Old Ephraim lacked the cunning for that kind of success He was lame and slow tending toward stoutness and having a film over one eye and Samuel knew that the boarders made fun of him even while they devoured his food and took advantage of him This was the first bitterness of Samuel s life for he knew that within old Ephraim s bosom was the heart of a king Once the boy had heard him in the room beneath his attic talking with one of the boarders a widow with a little daughter of whom the old man was fond I ve had a feeling ma am he was saying that somehow you might be in trouble And I wanted to say that if you can t spare this money I would rather you kept it for I don t need it now and you can send it to me when things are better with you That was Ephraim Prescott s way with his boarders and so he did not grow in riches as fast as he grew in soul Ephraim s wife had taught him to read the Bible He read it every night and on Sundays also and if what he was reading was sublime poetry and a part of the world s best literature the old man did not know it He took it all as having actual relationship to such matters as trading horses and feeding boarders And he taught Samuel to take it that way also and as the boy grew up there took root within him a great dismay and perplexity that these moral truths which he read in the Book seemed to count for so little in the world about him Besides the Bible and his mother Ephraim taught his son one other great thing that was America America was Samuel s country the land where his fathers had died It was a land set apart from all others for the working out of a high and wonderful destiny It was the land of Liberty For this whole armies of heroic men had poured out their heart s blood and their dream was embodied in institutions which were almost as sacred as the Book itself Samuel learned hymns which dealt with these things and he heard great speeches about them every Fourth of July that he could remember he had driven out to the courthouse to hear one and he was never in the least ashamed when the tears came into his eyes He had seen tears even in the summer boarders eyes once or twice when on a quiet evening it chanced that the old man unlocked the secret chambers of his soul For Ephraim Prescott had been through the War He had marched with the Seventeenth Pennsylvania from Bull Run to Cold Harbor where he had been three times wounded and his memory was a storehouse of mighty deeds and thrilling images Heroic figures strode through it there were marches and weary sieges prison and sickness and despair there were moments of horror and of glory visions of blood and anguish of flame and cannon smoke there were battle flags torn by shot and shell and names of precious memory which stirred the deep places of the soul These men had given their lives for Freedom they had lain down to make a pathway before her they had filled up a bloody chasm so that she might pass upon her way And that was the heritage they handed to their children to guard and cherish That was what it meant to be an American that one must hold himself in readiness to go forth as they had done and dare and suffer whatever the fates might send Such were the things out of which Samuel s life was made besides these he had only the farm with its daily tasks and the pageant of Nature in the wilderness of day and night and of winter and summer upon the mountains The books were few There was one ragged volume which Samuel knew nearly by heart which told the adventures of a castaway upon a desert island and how step by step he solved his problem Samuel learned from that to think of life as made by honest labor and to find a thrill of romance in the making of useful things And then there was the story of Christian and of his pilgrimage the very book for a Seeker with visions of glory not too definite leaving danger of premature success And then much later some one left at the place a volume of the Farm Rhymes of James Whitcomb Riley and before Samuel s eyes there opened a new vision of life He had been happy but now suddenly he realized it He had loved the blue sky above him and the deep woods and the sparkling lake but now he had words to tell about them and the common tasks of his life were transfigured with the glory of song So one might milk the cow with stirrings of wonder and mow in the meadows to the rhythm of Knee deep in June From which you may divine that Samuel was what is called an Enthusiast He was disposed to take rosy views of things and to believe what he was told especially if it was something beautiful and appealing He was given to having ideals and to accepting theories He would be stirred by some broad new principle and he would set to work to apply it with fervor But you are not to conclude from this that Samuel was a fool On the contrary when things went wrong he knew it and according to his religion he sought the reason and he sought persistently and with all his might If all men would do as much the world might soon be quite a different place CHAPTER II Such was Samuel s life until he was seventeen and then a sad experience came to the family It was because of the city people They brought prosperity to the country everyone said but old Ephraim regretted their coming none the less They broke down the old standards and put an end to the old ways of life What was the use of grubbing up stumps in a pasture lot when one could sell minnows for a penny apiece So all the men became guides and camp servants and the girls became waitresses They wore more stylish clothes and were livelier of speech but they were also more greedy and less independent They had learned to take tips for instance and more than one of the girls went away to the city to nameless and terrible destinies These summer boarders all had money Young and old it flowed from them in a continuous stream They did not have to plow and reap they bought what they wanted and they spent their time at play with sailboats and fishing tackle bicycles and automobiles and what not How all this money came to be was a thing difficult to imagine but it came from the city from the great Metropolis to which one s thoughts turned with ever livelier interest Then one August came a man who opened the gates of knowledge a little Manning was his name Percival Manning junior partner in the firm of Manning Isaacson Bankers and Brokers with an address which had caused the Prescott family to start and stare with awe It was Wall Street

none	none	Percival Manning was round and stout and wore striped shirts and trousers which were like a knife blade in front also he fairly radiated prosperity His talk was all of financial wizardry by which fortunes were made overnight The firm of Manning Isaacson was one of the oldest and most prosperous in the street so he said and its junior partner was in the confidence of some of the greatest powers in the financial affairs of the country And alas for the Prescott family which did not read the magazines and had never even heard of a bucket shop Adam the oldest brother took mister Manning back to Indian Pond on a fishing trip and Samuel went along to help with the carries And all the way the talk was of the wonders of city life Samuel learned that his home was a God forsaken place in winter something which had never been hinted at in any theological book which he had read Manning wondered that Adam didn t get out to some place where a man had a chance Then he threw away a half smoked cigar and talked about the theaters and the music halls and after that he came back to the inexhaustible topic of Wall Street He had had interesting news from the office that day there was a big deal about to be consummated the Glass Bottle Trust was ready for launching For nearly a year old Harry Lockman You ve heard of him no doubt he built up the great glass works at Lockmanville said Manning No Adam confessed that he had never heard of Lockman that shrewd and crafty old multi millionaire who had gone on a still hunt for glass bottle factories and now had the country in the grip of the fourteen million dollar Glass Bottle Securities Company No one knew it as yet but soon the enterprise would be under full sail And won t the old cormorant take in the shekels though chuckled Manning That might be a good sort of thing for a man to invest in said Adam cautiously Well I just guess laughed the other If he s quick about it Do you suppose you could find out how to get some of that stock was the next question Sure said Manning that s what we re in business for And then as luck would have it a city man bought the old Wyckman farm and the trustees of the estate came to visit Ephraim in solemn state and paid down three crisp one thousand dollar bills and carried off the canceled mortgage And the old man sat a tremble holding in his hands the savings of his whole lifetime and facing the eager onslaught of his two eldest sons But Adam he protested It s gambling It s nothing of the kind cried the other It s no more gambling than if I was to buy a horse because I knowed that horses would be scarce next spring It s just business But those factories make beer bottles and whisky bottles exclaimed the old man Does it seem right to you to get our money that way They make all kinds of bottles said Adam how can they help what they re used for And besides put in Dan with a master stroke of diplomacy it will raise the prices on em and make em harder to git There s been fortunes lost in Wall Street said the father How can we tell We ve got a chance to get in on the inside said Adam Such chances don t happen twice in a lifetime Just read this here circular added Dan If we let a chance like this go we ll deserve to break our backs hoeing corn the rest of our days That was the argument Old Ephraim had never thought of a broken back in connection with the hoeing of corn There were four acres in the field and every spring he had plowed and harrowed it and planted it and replanted what the crows had pulled up and all summer long he had hoed and tended it and in the fall he had cut it stalk by stalk and stacked it and then through October sitting on the bare bleak hillside he had husked it ear by ear and gathered it in baskets if the season was good perhaps a hundred dollars worth of grain That was the way one worked to create a hundred dollars worth of Value and Manning had paid as much for the fancy mounted shotgun which stood in the corner of his room And here was the great fourteen million dollar Glass Bottle Trust with properties said to be worth twenty five million and the control of one of the great industries of the country and stock which might easily go to a hundred and fifty in a single week Boys said the old man sadly it won t be me that will spend this money And I don t want to stand in your way If you re bent on doing it We are cried Adam What do you say Samuel asked the father I don t know what to say said Samuel It seems to me that three thousand dollars is a lot of money And I don t see why we need any more Do you want to stand in the way demanded Adam No I don t want to stand in the way said Samuel And so the decision was made When they came to give the order they found themselves confronted with a strange proposition they did not have to buy the whole stock it seemed they might buy only the increase in its value And the effect of this marvelous device would be that they would make ten times as much as they had expected to make So needless to say they bought that way And they took a daily paper and watched breathlessly while Glass Bottle Securities crept up from sixty three and an eighth to sixty four and a quarter And then late one evening old Hiram Johns the storekeeper drove up with a telegram from Manning and Isaacson telling them that they must put up more margin Glass Bottle Securities was at fifty six and five eighths They sat up all night debating what this could mean and trying to lay the specters of horror The next day Adam set out to go to the city and see about it but he met the mail on the way and came home again with a letter from the brokers regretfully informing them that it had been necessary to sell the stock which was now below fifty In the news columns of the paper they found the explanation of the calamity old Henry Lockman had dropped dead of apoplexy at the climax of his career and the bears had played havoc with Glass Bottle Securities Their three thousand dollars was gone It took them three days to realize it it was so utterly beyond belief that they had to write to the brokers and receive another letter in which it was stated in black and white and beyond all misunderstanding that there was not a dollar of their money left Adam raged and swore like a madman and Dan vowed savagely that he would go down to the city and kill Manning As for the father he wrote a letter of agonized reproach to which mister Manning replied with patient courtesy explaining that he had had nothing to do with the matter that he was a broker and had bought as ordered and that he had been powerless to foresee the death of Lockman You will remember he said that I warned you of the uncertainties of the market and of the chances that you took Ephraim did not remember anything of the sort but he realized that there was nothing to be gained by saying so Samuel did not care much about the loss of his share of the money but he did care about the grief of his father which was terrible to see The blow really killed him he looked ten years older after that week and he failed all through the winter And then late in the spring he caught a cold and took to his bed and it turned to pneumonia and almost before anyone had had time to realize it he was gone He went to join Samuel s mother He had whispered this as he clutched the boy s hand and Samuel knew that it was true and that therefore there was no occasion for grief So he was ashamed for the awful waves of loneliness and terror which swept over him and he gulped back his feelings and forced himself to wear a cheerful demeanor much too cheerful for the taste of Adam and Dan who were more concerned with what their neighbors would think than they were with the subtleties of Samuel s faith The boy had been doing a great deal of thinking that winter and after the funeral he called a council of the family Brothers he said this farm is too small for three men Dan wants to marry already and we can t live here always It s just as Manning said I don t want to hear what that skunk said growled Adam Well he was right that time People stay on the land and they divide it up and get poorer and poorer So I ve made up my mind to break away I m going to the city and get a start What can you do in the city asked Dan I don t know said Samuel I ll do my best I don t expect to go to Wall Street and make my fortune You needn t be smart growled Dan But the other was quite innocent of sarcasm What I mean is that I ll have to work said he I m young and strong and I m not afraid to try I ll find somebody to give me a chance and then I ll work hard and learn and I ll get promoted I ve read of boys that have done that It s not a bad idea commented Adam Go ahead said Dan The only thing is began Samuel hesitatingly I shall have to have a little money for a start Humph said Adam Money s a scarce thing here How much ll ye want asked the other Well said the boy I want enough to feel safe For if I go I promise you I shall stay till I succeed I shan t play the baby How do you expect to raise it was the next question I thought replied Samuel that we might make some kind of a deal let me sell out my share in the farm You can t sell your share said Adam sharply You ain t of age Maybe I m not was the answer but all the same you know me And if I was to make a bargain I d keep it You may be sure I ll never come back and bother you Yes I suppose not said Adam doubtfully But you can t tell How much do you expect to git asked Dan warily Well I thought maybe I could get a hundred dollars said the other and then he stopped hesitating Adam and Dan exchanged a quick glance Money s mighty scarce hereabouts said Adam Still said Dan I don t know I ll go to the village tomorrow and see what I can do So Dan drove away and came back in the evening and there was another council he produced eight new ten dollar bills It was the best I could do he said I m sorry if it ain t enough and then he stopped I ll make that do said Samuel And so his brother produced a long and imposing looking document Samuel was too polite to read it but signed at once and so the bargain was closed And that night Samuel packed his few belongings in a neat newspaper bundle and before sunrise the next morning he set out upon his search CHAPTER III He had his bundle slung over his back and his eighty dollars pinned tightly in an inside pocket Underneath it his heart beat fast and high he was young and he was free the open road stretched out before him and perpetual adventure beckoned to him Every pilgrimage that he had ever read of helped to make up the thrill that stirred him as he stood on the ridge and gazed at the old farmhouse and waved his hand and turned and began his journey The horse was needed for the plowing and so Samuel walked the six miles to the village and from there the mail stage took him out to the solitary railroad station He had three hours to wait here for the train and so he decided that he would save fifteen cents by walking on to the next station Distance was nothing to Samuel just then Halfway to his destination there was a fire in a little clearing by the track and a young man sat toasting some bread on a stick Hello he said You re hittin her lively Yes said Samuel The stranger was not much older than he but his clothing was dirty and he had a dissipated leering face You re new at this game aren t you said he What game asked Samuel The other laughed Where ye goin To New York Goin to hoof it all the way No gasped the boy I m just walking to the next station Oh I see What s the fare Six thirty seven I think Humph Got the price hey Yes I ve got the price Samuel said this without pride Well you won t have it long if you live at that rate commented the stranger Why don t you beat your way How do you mean asked Samuel Nobody but a duffer pays fare said the other There ll be a freight along pretty soon and she stops at the water tank just below here Why don t you jump her Samuel hesitated I wouldn t like to do that he said Come said the other sit down And he held out a piece of his toast which Samuel accepted for politeness sake This young fellow had run away from school at the age of thirteen and he had traveled all over the United States following the seasons and living off the country He was on his way now from a winter s holiday in Mexico And as Samuel listened to the tale of his adventures he could not keep the thought from troubling him how large a part of eighty dollars was six thirty seven And all in a single day Come said the young fellow and they started down the track The freight was whistling for brakes far up the grade And Samuel s heart thumped with excitement They crouched in the bushes not far beyond the tank But the train did not stop for water it only slowed down for a curve and it thundered by at what seemed to Samuel an appalling rate of speed Jump shouted the other and started to run by the track He made a leap and caught and was whirled on half visible in a cloud of dust Samuel s nerve failed him He waited while car after car went by But then he caught hold of himself If anyone could do it so could he For shame He started to run There came a box car empty with the door open and he leaped and clutched the edge of the door He was whirled from his feet his arms were nearly jerked out of him He was half blinded by the dust but he hung on desperately and pulled himself up A minute more and he lay gasping and trembling upon the floor of the car He was on his way to the city After a while Samuel began to think and then scruples troubled him He was riding free but was he not really stealing And would his father have approved of his doing it He had begun his career by yielding to temptation And this at the suggestion of a young fellow who boasted of drinking and thieving Simply to start such questions was enough with Samuel and he made up his mind that when he reached the city the first thing he would do would be to visit the office of the railroad and explain what he had done and pay his fare Perhaps an hour later the train came to a stop and he heard some one walking by the track He hid in a corner ashamed of being there Some one stopped before the car and the door was rolled shut Then the footsteps went on There came clankings and jarrings as of cars being shifted and then these ceased and silence fell Samuel waited for perhaps an hour Then becoming restless he got up and tried the door It was fast The boy was startled and rather dazed He sat down to think it out I suppose I m locked in till we reach New York he reflected But then why didn t they go Perhaps we re on a siding waiting for the passenger train to pass was his next thought and he realized regretfully that he would have been on that train But then as hour after hour passed and they did not go on a terrible possibility dawned upon him He was left behind on a siding Two or three trains went by and each time he waited anxiously But they did not stop Silence came again and he sat in the darkness and waited and wondered and feared He had no means of telling the time and doubtless an hour seemed an age in such a plight He would get up and pace back and forth like a caged animal and then he would lie down by the door straining his ears for a sound thinking that some one might pass unnoticed through the thick wall of the car By and by he became hungry and he ate the scanty meal he had in his bundle Then he became thirsty and he had no water The realization of this made his heart thump It was no joking matter to be shut in at one could not tell what lonely place to suffer from thirst He sprang up and began to pound and kick upon the door in a frenzy But he soon tired of that and crouched on the floor again listening and shivering half with fear and half with cold It was becoming chillier so he judged it must be night up here in the mountains there was still frost at night There came another train a freight he knew by the heavy pounding and the time it took to pass He kicked on the door and shouted but he soon realized that it was of no use to shout in that uproar The craving for water was becoming an obsession He tried not to think about it but that only made him think about it the more he would think about not thinking about it and about not thinking about that and all the time he was growing thirstier He wondered how long one could live without water and as the torment grew worse he began to wonder if he was dying He was hungry too and he wondered which was worse of which one would die the sooner He had heard that dying men remembered all their past and so he began to remember his with extraordinary vividness and with bursts of strange and entirely new emotions He remembered particularly all the evil things that he had ever done including the theft of a ride for which he was paying the penalty And meantime with another part of his mind he was plotting and seeking He must not die here like a rat in a hole There must be some way He tried every inch of the car of the floor and ceiling and walls But there was not a loose plank nor a crack the car was new And that suggested another idea that he might suffocate before he starved He was beginning to feel weak and dizzy If only he had a knife He could have cut a hole for air and then perhaps enlarged it and broken out a board He found a spike on the floor and began tapping round the walls for a place that sounded thin but they all sounded thick how thick he had no idea He began picking splinters away at the juncture of two planks Meantime hunger and thirst continued to gnaw at him At long intervals he would pause while a train roared by or because he fancied he had heard a sound Then he would pound and call until he was hoarse and then go on picking at the splinters And so on for an unknown number of hours but certainly for days and nights And Samuel was famished and wild and weak and gasping when at last it dawned upon his senses that a passing train had begun to make less noise that the thumping was growing slower The train was stopping He leaped up and began to pound Then he realized that he must control himself he must save his strength until the train had stopped But suppose it went on without delay He began to pound again and to shout like a madman The train stopped and there was silence then came sounds of cars being coupled and meantime Samuel was kicking and beating upon the wall He was almost exhausted and in despair when suddenly from outside came a muffled call Hello For a moment he could not speak Then Help Help he shrieked What s the matter asked the voice I m locked in he called How d you get in They locked me in by accident I m nearly dead Who are you I was riding in the car A tramp hey Serves ye right Better stay there No No screamed the boy in terror I m starving I ve been here for days For heaven s sake let me out I ll never do it again If I let you out said the voice it s my business to arrest you All right cried Samuel Anything but don t leave me here There was a moment s silence Have you got any money asked the voice Yes Yes I ve got money Don t yell so loud How much Why what How much I ve got eighty dollars All right Give it to me and I ll let you out Frantic as he was this staggered Samuel I can t give you all my money he cried All right then said the other Stay there No no he protested Wait Leave me just a little I ll leave you five dollars said the voice Speak up Quick All right said Samuel faintly I ll give it to you Mind No nonsense now No Let me out I ll bat you over the head if you try it growled the voice and the boy stood trembling while the hasp was unfastened and the door was pushed back a little The light of a lantern flashed in through the crack blinding him Now hand out the money said the stranger standing at one side for safety Yes said Samuel fumbling with the pin in his waistcoat But I can t see to count it Be quick I ll count it And so he shoved out the wad Fingers seized it and then the light vanished and he heard the sound of footsteps running For a moment he did not understand Then Give me my five dollars he yelled and rolled back the door and leaped out He was just in time to see the figure with the lantern vanish among the cars up the track He started to run up the track and tripped over a tie and fell headlong into a ditch When he scrambled to his feet again the long train was beginning to move and the light of the lantern was nowhere to be seen CHAPTER IV Samuel s money was gone but he was suffering too keenly from hunger and thirst to worry about it for more than a minute Then the thought came to him he was here in a lonely place at night and the train was going If he were left he might still starve He ran over and caught the iron ladder of one of the freight cars and drew himself up and clung there Later on he climbed on top of the car but the wind was too cold he could not stand it and had to climb down again And then he realized that he had left the bundle of his belongings in the empty car Fortunately for him the train began to slow up at the end of an hour or so and peering out Samuel saw lights ahead Also there were lights here and there in the landscape and he realized that he had come to a large town The east was just beginning to turn gray and faint shadows of buildings were visible Samuel got off and walked up the track very carefully for he was stiff as well as weak There was a light in one of the offices at the depot and he looked in at the window and saw a man seated at a desk writing busily He knocked at the door Come in said a voice and he entered Please may I have a drink of water he asked Over there in the corner said the man scarcely looking up from his papers There was a bucket and dipper and Samuel drank The taste of the water was a kind of ecstasy to him he drank until he could drink no more Then he stood waiting I beg pardon sir he began timidly Hey said the man I m nearly starved sir I ve had nothing to eat for I don t know how long Oh exclaimed the other So that s it Get out You don t understand began Samuel perplexed Get out cried the man That don t go in here No beggars allowed Beggars The word struck Samuel like a whip lash I m no beggar he cried wildly I And then he stopped He had been going to say I will pay for it He went out burning with shame and on the spot he took his resolution come what might he would never beg He would not put a morsel of food into his mouth until he had earned it Across from the depot was a public square and a broad street with trolley tracks Samuel walked down the street and then feeling weak and seeing a dark doorway he went in and crouched in a corner For a while he dozed and then it was daylight People were passing He got more water at a fountain and felt better He went down one of the poorer streets where a man was opening a shop There was food in the window fruit and bread and the sight made him ravenous But he asked for work and the man shook his head Samuel went on Shops were opened here and there and everywhere he asked for a job for any little thing to do and always it was No Now and then he caught a whiff of some one s breakfast bacon frying and coffee or hot bread in a bake shop But each time he gripped his hands together and set his teeth He would not beg He would find work And so on through the morning He went into stores big and little Sometimes they answered politely sometimes gruffly but no one hesitated a moment He went past warehouses where men were loading wagons surely there would be work here He spoke to a busy foreman in his shirt sleeves How often must I tell you no cried the man But you never told me before protested Samuel with great earnestness Get out said the man There are so many of you how the devil can I tell There were so many And suddenly Samuel realized that he had passed a good many poor looking men upon the streets And were they all hunting jobs and not finding them Perhaps some were even begging and getting nothing by that He went on with a blank terror in his soul He gazed at the people he passed on the street some of them had kindly faces surely they would have helped him had they known But there was no way for him to let them know no way but to be a beggar He came to the suburbs and asked at the houses But no one wanted anything done It was noon and people were at luncheon he caught odors as doors were opened He went back into the city because he could not stand it He was feeling weaker and he was afraid with a ghastly fear Pretty soon he might not be able to work It was a new idea to Samuel that a man might starve in the midst of civilization He could hardly believe it and grew half delirious as he thought about it What would happen at the end Would they let him lie down and die in the street Or was there some place where starving men went to die So the day passed and he found nothing Several people advised him to get out of town this was no place to look for work they said Apparently something was the matter with the place but they did not stop to tell him what This was the first large town Samuel had ever seen and under other circumstances he would have gazed at it with wonder He passed great buildings of brick and stone and trolley cars and a fire engine house and many other strange sights He came to a great high fence inclosing many acres of buildings dingy and black with smoke there were tall chimneys and rows of sheds and railroad tracks running in He passed other factories huge brick buildings with innumerable windows and many blocks of working men s houses small and dirty frame structures with pale faced children in the doorways The roads and sidewalks here were all of black cinders and it was hot even in May And then he came to a steel bridge and crossed a river and the road broadened out and he climbed a hill and found himself walking upon a macadamized avenue lined with trees and with beautiful residences overlooking the ridge Rich people lived here evidently and Samuel stared marveling at the splendor He came to a great estate with a stone gateway and iron railings ten feet high and an avenue of stately elm trees there were bright green lawns with peacocks and lyre birds strutting about and a great colonial mansion with white pillars in the distance Fairview read the name upon the gates And then again Samuel remembered his appetite Surely amid all this luxury there would be some chance for him He started up the path He had got about halfway to the house when a man who was tending the flowers caught sight of him and came toward him What are you doing here he called before he had come halfway I m looking for some work began Samuel Do you want to get your head punched shouted the man What do you mean by coming in here Why what s the matter asked the boy perplexed Get out you loafer cried the other And Samuel turned and went quickly A loafer So for the first time it occurred to him to look at his clothes which were muddy from his tumble in the ditch And no doubt his face and hands were dirty also and his hair unkempt and his aspect unprepossessing enough for an applicant for labor At any rate it was clear that this was not the part of the town to seek it in so he went back across the bridge Twilight had fallen and the stores were shutting up Soon everything would be closed and that night he felt that he would perish And so at last desperation seized him He bolted into the first lighted place he saw It was a saloon empty save for a man in white behind the bar I m no beggar shouted Samuel Hey said the man I say I m no beggar I ll come back and pay you I m starving I must have something to eat Gee whiz said the man I was never in a saloon in my life before added Samuel as he realized the character of the place But please please give me something to eat Hully gee young feller exclaimed the bar keeper You do it great You ought to be an actor Step up and feed your face What stammered Samuel perplexed EAT said the other and pointed Maybe you understand that And Samuel turned and saw a lot of food set out upon a counter He rushed to it and began At the first taste a kind of madness seized him and he ate like a wild beast gulping things For several minutes he did this while the other watched curiously Then he remarked Say you d better quit What asked Samuel seizing more food I say quit said the man Just for your own good I see your story s true an a little rest won t hurt you Samuel gazed longingly at the food desiring more handfuls Come over here said the man What happened to you I was locked in an empty freight car Humph That s a new one How long What day is this Friday I was locked in Wednesday morning It seemed longer It s long enough commented the barkeeper I was robbed Samuel went on A man took all my money And then the old shame started up in him Don t think I m a beggar I ll work and pay for this That s all right said the barkeeper Be easy Haven t you anything I can do Some wood to split We don t burn wood Or some cleaning up Samuel looked round The place did not seem very neat to him I ll scrub the floors for you he said We have em scrubbed in the early morning replied the man Well let me come and do it said Samuel Go on said the other You ll be ready for more feed then I ll come just the same sir If you take my advice the bartender observed you ll get out of this town Lockmanville s a poor place to hunt jobs in Samuel started Lockmanville he gasped Yes said the other Don t you know where you are I didn t know said the boy Lockmanville The one where the big glass works are That s the one And where old Henry Lockman lived What about it asked the other Nothing said Samuel only my father invested all his money in Lockman s company and lost it Gee said the bartender Maybe if I told them said the boy they d give me some work here Maybe said the other only the works is shut down Shut down cried Samuel and then added On account of his death No they always close in summer But this year they closed in March Times is bad Oh said Samuel So there s plenty of men looking for jobs in Lockmanville the other continued an some of the other factories is closed too the cotton mill is only runnin half time I see Old Lockman used to say there was too many glass works the barkeeper added An the fellers he bought out went an built more So there you are

none	none	I m coming back in the morning said Samuel doggedly All right said the other with a smile if you don t forget it Then a couple of customers entered Run along now said he And Samuel went the more readily because he realized that he had been all this time in a saloon a place of mystery and wickedness to him He started down the street again A fine cold rain had begun to fall What was he to do He felt warm having feasted But there was no use in getting wet He glanced into the doorways as he passed and seeing a dark and empty one crouched inside Lockmanville What a curious coincidence And there were hundreds in the town out of work It seemed a strange and terrible thing Could it be that they let people starve as he was starving people they knew Could it be that they went on about their business and paid no attention to such a thing He must get out they told him But how Would the railroad take him if he explained Or would the people on the way give him work He had got some food at last but only by begging And was he expected to beg There came footsteps outside A man strode into the doorway and took hold of the door and tried it Then he turned to go out Samuel moved his foot out of the way Hello said the man Who s that Only me said Samuel Get up there commanded the other He got up and a hand seized him by the collar Who are you He was jerked into the light before he had a chance to reply More bums growled the voice and Samuel terrified saw that he was in the grasp of a policeman Please sir I m not doing any harm he began Come said the policeman Where to he cried But the other merely jerked him along A sudden wild horror seized Samuel You re not going to arrest me he exclaimed Sure said the other Why not But he exclaimed I ve not done anything I can t help it I He started to drag back and the man twisted a huge hand in his collar choking him Do you want to be hit he growled So Samuel went on But sobs shook him convulsive sobs of terror and despair and tears of shame rolled down his cheeks He was going to jail What s the matter with you said the policeman after a bit Why don t you be quiet You ve no business to arrest me wailed the boy I haven t done anything and I couldn t help it I ve no place to go and no money And it s not my fault You can tell that to the judge replied the other But but what have I done Why Shut up said the officer and gave another twist at his throat And after that Samuel was quiet CHAPTER V In the station house a fat sergeant sat dozing upon his throne Another vagrant said the policeman as if to say there was no special need to rouse himself What was he doing the sergeant asked Sleeping in a doorway was the reply By this time Samuel had come to realize the futility of protest He accepted his fate with dumb despair He gave the information the sergeant asked for Samuel Prescott aged seventeen native born from Euba Corners occupation farmer never arrested before All right said the man and went back to his nap and Samuel was led away and after a pretense at a search was shoved into a cell and heard the iron door clang upon him He was alone now and free to sob out his grief It was the culmination of all the shame and horror that he could ever have imagined first to have to beg and then to be locked up in jail He knew now what they did with men who were out of work and starving He lay there weeping and then suddenly he sat up transfixed From the cell next to him had come a cry a horrible blood curdling screech more like the scream of a wild cat than any human sound Samuel listened his heart pounding There came the voice of a man from across the corridor Shut up you hag And after that bedlam broke loose The woman Samuel realized at last that the scream had come from a woman broke forth into a torrent of yells and curses Such hideous obscenities such revolting blasphemies he had never heard in his life before he had never dreamed that life contained within it the possibility of such depravity It was like an explosion from some loathsome sewer and its source was the lips of a woman For ten minutes or so the tirade continued until it seemed to the boy that every beautiful and sacred thing he had ever heard of in his life had been defiled forever Then a jailer strolled down the corridor and with a few vigorous and judicious oaths contrived to quell the uproar Samuel lay down again and now he had a chance to make another discovery He had felt sharp stinging sensations which caused him to scratch himself frantically Then suddenly he realized that he was lying upon a mattress infested with vermin The discovery sent him bounding to the middle of the floor It set him wild with rage Such a thing had never happened to him in his life before for his home was a decent and clean one This was the crowning infamy that they should have taken him helpless as he was and shut him up in a filthy hole to be devoured by bedbugs and lice In the morning they brought him bread and coffee and after a couple of hours more waiting he was taken to court It was a big bare room with whitewashed walls There were a few scattered spectators a couple of policemen and several men writing at tables Seated within an inclosure were a number of prisoners dull and listless looking One by one they stepped up before the railing and faced the judge there would be a few muttered words and they would move on Everything went as a matter of routine which had been going that way for ages The judge who was elderly and gray haired looked like a prosperous business man in a masquerade costume Samuel s turn came and he stood before the bar His name was read and the charge vagrancy Well said the judge mechanically What have you to say for yourself Samuel caught his breath It s not my fault sir he began Your honor prompted the policeman who stood at his elbow Your honor said Samuel I lost all my money And I ve been trying to find work your honor Have you any friends in town No your honor How long have you been here Only since yesterday your honor How did you get here I came in on a freight train your honor I see said the judge Well you came to the wrong place We re going to put an end to vagrancy in Lockmanville Thirty days Next case Samuel caught his breath Your honor he gasped Next case repeated the judge The policeman started to lead Samuel away Your honor he cried frantically Don t send me to jail And fighting against the policeman s grip he rushed on It s not my fault I m an honest boy and I tried to find work I haven t done anything And you ll kill me if you send me to jail Have mercy Have mercy The policeman shook him roughly But there was something so genuine in Samuel s wail that the judge said Wait How could I help it if I was robbed the boy rushed on taking advantage of his chance And what could I do but ask for work I was brought up honest your honor It would have killed my father if he d thought I d be sent to jail He brought me up to earn my living Who was your father asked the judge His name was Ephraim Prescott and he was a farmer You can ask anyone at Euba Corners what sort of a man he was He d fought all through the war he was wounded four times And if he could be here he d tell you that I don t deserve to go to jail There was a moment s pause What regiment was your father in asked the magistrate He was in the Seventeenth Pennsylvania your honor Be careful boy said the other sternly Don t try to deceive me I don t want to deceive you your honor protested Samuel What brigade was the Seventeenth Pennsylvania in In the Third Brigade your honor And who commanded it General Anderson that is until he was killed at the battle of Chancellorsville My father was there I was there too said the judge My father used to tell me about it exclaimed Samuel with sudden eagerness His brigade was in the right wing and they had a double line of trenches And the rebels charged the line with cavalry They charged a dozen times during the day and there were big trees cut down by the bullets My father said the rebels never fought harder than they did right there Yes said his honor I know I was one of them Everyone within hearing laughed and Samuel turned crimson I beg pardon your honor he said That s all right said the judge And then he added gravely Very well Samuel we ll give you another chance for your father s sake But don t let me see you here again No your honor said Samuel Then he added quickly But what can I do Get out of Lockmanville said the other But how When I ve no money If your honor could only help me to some work No said the judge I m sorry but I ve found jobs for three men this week and I don t know any more But then began Samuel I ll give you a dollar out of my own pocket the other added Your honor cried Samuel startled I don t want to take money You can send it back to me when you get a job said the judge holding out a bill Take it Prisoner discharged Next case Samuel took the money and was turning away when a man who had been sitting in a chair near the magistrate suddenly leaned forward Judge he said if I may interrupt Why surely professor said the other pleasantly I may possibly be able to find something for the boy to do Ah that will be fine He seems to be a capable young fellow and might be worth helping The very thing professor Samuel this is Professor Stewart of Lockman College Samuel was very glad to meet the professor He was a trim little gentleman with a carefully cut black beard and gold rimmed eyeglasses Here is my card he said and if you ll come to see me to morrow morning at my house we ll see what we can do Thank you very much said the boy and put the card in his pocket Then realizing suddenly that the policeman had let go of his arm and that he was free he turned and made his way through the gate A diverting episode said the professor Yes said the judge with a smile We have them now and then you see Samuel went out with a glow in his heart At last he had got a start He had got underneath the world s tough hide and found kindness and humanity after all It had been a harrowing experience but it would not happen again He had now one definite purpose in mind He walked straight out of town and down the river road until he came to a sufficiently solitary place Then he took off his clothes and sat down on the bank and performed a most elaborate toilet For half an hour at least he scrubbed his head with sand and water and combed his hair out with his fingers And then he went over his clothing inch by inch At least he would be through with one hideous reminder of his imprisonment After which he dressed again and went back to town and found the saloon where he had eaten Hello said his friend Finnegan the bar keeper Back again I came to explain about this morning said Samuel I couldn t come because they put me in jail Gee said the other but then he added with a laugh Well it was a wet night Samuel did not reply I ll come to morrow morning he said You d better get out of town sonny advised the other I m all right The judge gave me a dollar Humph A dollar won t last forever No But I ve got the promise of a job There was a gentleman there Professor Stewart from the college Hully gee said Finnegan I know that guy A little runt with a black beard I guess so said Samuel dubiously I seen his pitcher in the paper said the other He s one of them reformers always messin into things Maybe that s why he was at the court observed Samuel Sure thing He s a professor of sociology an such things an he thinks he knows all about politics But we handed him a few last election just you bet Who s we asked Samuel The organization said Finnegan the Democrats o course Them reformers is always Republicans the better element an all that That means the rich guys that have their own little grafts to work This perfessor was a great friend of old Henry Lockman an the old man used to run this town with his little finger But they had a big strike here three years ago and too many men got hit over the head So it ll be a long day before there s any more reform in Lockmanville I see said Samuel They make a great howl about the saloons an all the rest added the barkeeper But when the Republicans ran things my boss paid his little rake off just the same you can bet But you needn t tell that to the perfessor I won t said the boy What you goin to do now asked the other I don t know I guess I ll have to get something to eat first You ll find the cheapest way is to buy a glass of beer and then feed over there No said Samuel startled I I think I d rather not do that Well so long said Finriegan with a laugh You ll see me to morrow morning said Samuel as he went out CHAPTER VI Samuel went to a bake shop and bought a loaf of bread and sat on the bench of the public square and devoured it bit by bit It was the cheapest thing he could think of and quantity was what counted just then Next he had to find a room to spend the night He knew nothing about hotels and lodging houses he walked through the workingmen s quarter of the town scanning the cottages hesitatingly At last in the doorway of one he noticed a woman standing an elderly woman very thin and weary looking but clean and with a kindly face So he stopped Please said he could you tell me any place where I could hire a room The woman looked at him For how long she asked I m not quite sure he said I want it for one night and then if I get a job I may want it longer A job in Lockmanville said the woman Well I ve the promise of one he replied There can t be very many said she I ve two rooms I ve always rented she added but when the glass works shut down the men went away One of them owed me three dollars too I I m not able to pay very much said Samuel Come in responded the woman and he sat down and told her his story And she told him hers missus Stedman was her name and her husband had been a glass blower He earned good wages five dollars a day in the busy season But he worked in front of a huge tank of white hot glass and that was hard on a man And once on a hot day he had gone suddenly dizzy and fallen upon a mass of hot slag and been frightfully burned in the face They had carried him to the hospital and taken out one eye And then because of his family and the end of the season being near he had gone to work too soon and his wound had gone bad and in the end he had died of blood poisoning That was two years ago said missus Stedman And I got no damages We ve barely got along this year s been worse than ever It s the panic they say It seemed as if everything was shutting down It must be very hard on people here said Samuel I ve got three children all girls said missus Stedman and only one old enough to work That s Sophie she s in the cotton mill and that only started again last month And they say it may run on half time all the year I do sewing and whatever I can to help but there s never enough Samuel forgot his own troubles in talking with this woman His family had been poor on the farm but they had never known such poverty as this And here were whole streets full of people living the same sort of life hanging over the abyss of destruction and with no prospect save to struggle forever missus Stedman talked casually about her friends and neighbors and new glimpses came to make the boy catch his breath Next door was missus Prosser whose husband was dying of cancer he had been two years dying and they had five small children And on the other side were the Rapinskys a Polish family they had been strong in the possession of three grown sons and had even bought a phonograph And now not one of them had done a stroke of work for three months To have been robbed and put in jail seemed a mere incident in comparison with such bitter and I lifelong suffering and Samuel was ashamed of having made so much fuss He had stated with some trepidation that he was just out of jail but missus Stedman had not seemed to mind that Her husband had been in jail once during the big glass strike and for nothing more than begging another man not to take his job It was arranged that Samuel was to pay her thirty five cents for his supper and bed and breakfast and if he wished to stay longer she would board him for four dollars a week or he might have the room alone for a dollar The two young children came in from school they were frail and undersized little girls with clothing that was neatly but pitifully patched And shortly after them came Sophie Samuel gave a start of dismay when he saw her He had been told that she worked in the cotton mill and was the mainstay of the family and he had pictured a sturdy young woman such as he had seen at home Instead here was a frail slip of a child scarcely larger than the others Sophie was thirteen as he learned afterwards but she did not look to be ten by his standards She was grave and deliberate in her movements and she gazed at the stranger with a pair of very big brown eyes This is Samuel Prescott said her mother He is going to spend the night and maybe board with us How do you do said Sophie and took off the shawl from her head and sat down in a corner The boy thought that this was shyness upon her part but later on he realized that it was lassitude The child rested her head upon her hand every chance that she got and she never did anything that she did not have to The next morning bright and early Samuel was on hand at the saloon greatly to the amusement of his friend Finnegan He got down on his hands and knees and gave the place such a scrubbing as it had never had before since it was built And in return Finnegan invited him to some breakfast which Samuel finally accepted because it would enable him to take less from the Stedmans Professor Stewart had not specified any hour in his invitation He lived in the aristocratic district across the bridge and Samuel presented himself at his door a little before eight Professor Stewart told me to come and see him he said to the maid Professor Stewart is out of town said she Out of town he echoed He s gone to New York said she He was called away unexpectedly last night When will he be back He said he d try to be back the day after tomorrow but he wasn t sure Samuel stared at her in consternation What did you want she asked He promised me a job Oh said she Well can t you come back later on And then seeing that Samuel had nothing better to do than to stare at her dumbly she closed the door and went about her business Samuel walked back in a daze It gave him a new sense of the world s lack of interest in him Probably the great man had forgotten him altogether There was nothing to do but to wait and meantime he had only sixty cents He could not stay with missus Stedman that was certain But when he came to tell her she recurred to a suggestion he had made There were a few square yards of ground behind her house given up mostly to tomato cans If he would plant some garden seed for her she would board him meanwhile And so Samuel went to work vigorously with a borrowed spade Two days passed and another day and still the professor had not returned It was Saturday evening and Samuel was seated upon the steps of the house resting after a hard day s work Sophie was seated near him leaning back against the house with her eyes closed The evening was warm and beautiful and gradually the peace of it stole over her And so at last she revealed herself to Samuel Do you like music she asked Very much indeed said he Not everybody does she remarked I mean real music such as Friedrich plays I don t know said Samuel Who is Friedrich He s a friend of mine Sophie answered He s a German boy His father s the designer at the carpet works And he plays the violin I should like to hear him said he I ll take you she volunteered I generally go to see them on Sunday afternoons It s the only time I have So the next day Samuel met the Bremers Their cottage was a little way out in the country and they had a few trees about it and a flower bed But the house was not large and it was well filled with a family of nine children Johann the father was big and florid with bristling hair He was marked in the town because he called himself a Socialist but Samuel did not know that His wife was a little mite of a woman completely swamped by child bearing Most interesting to Samuel was Friedrich who played the violin a pale ascetic looking boy of fifteen with wavy hair and beautiful eyes Music was a serious rite with the Bremers The father played the piano and the next oldest son to Friedrich was struggling with a cello and when they played the whole family sat in the parlor even the tiny tots round eyed and silent Samuel knew some patriotic songs and a great number of hymns and a few tunes that one heard at country dances But such music as this was a new revelation of the possibilities of life He listened in a transport of wonder and awe Such wailing grief such tumultuous longing such ravishing and soul tormenting beauty Friedrich had only such technique as his father had been able to give him together with what he had invented for himself his bowings were not always correct and he was weak on the high notes but Samuel knew nothing of this he was thinking of the music And he needed no one to tell him about it he needed no criticisms and no commentaries Across the centuries the souls of Schubert and Beethoven spoke to him telling their visions of the wonderful world of the spirit toward which humanity is painfully groping It was impossible for him to keep from voicing his excitement and this greatly delighted the Bremers who craved for comprehension in a lonely place His sympathy gave wings to their fervor and they played the whole afternoon through and then Johann invited them to stay to supper so that they might play some more in the evening You should haf been a musician he said to Samuel You vas made for it They had a supper such as the boy had missed for some time a great platter of cold boiled meat and a bowl of hot gravy and another bowl of mashed potatoes with no end of bread and butter Also there was some kind of a German pudding and to the stranger s dismay a pitcher of beer in front of Johann After offering some to his guests he drank it all and also he ate a vast supper Afterwards he dozed while Friedrich played yet more wonderful music and this gave Samuel a new insight into the life of the family and into the wild and terrible longing that poured itself out in Friedrich s tones The father was good natured and sentimental but sunk in grossness and the mother was worn out with the care of her brood and beneath all this burden the soul of the boy was crying frantically for life The exigencies of trade demanded endless variety of designs in carpets and rugs and so all day Johann Bremer stood in front of a great sheet of cardboard marked off in tiny numbered squares on which he painted with many colors For this he received thirty dollars a week and his son received twelve dollars as his assistant painting in the same colors upon all the squares of certain numbers and so completing a symmetrical design It was a very good job and Johann prodded his son to devote his energies to the evolving of new designs But the boy hated it all thinking only of his music And his music meant to him not sentimental dreaming but a passionate clutch into the infinite a battle for deliverance from the bondage of the world So Johann himself had been in his youth when he had become a revolutionist and before beer and gravy and domesticity had tamed him No one said a word about these things It was all in the playing And now and then Samuel stole a glance about the room and discovered yet another soul s tragedy Sophie too was drinking in the music and life had crept into her face and her breath came quick and fast and now and then she furtively brushed away a tear Afterwards as they walked home she said to Samuel I don t know if it s good for me to listen to music like that Why not he asked if it makes you happy But it makes me unhappy afterwards It makes me want things And I get restless and when I go back to the factory it s so much harder What do you do in the factory asked Samuel I m what they call a bobbin girl I tie the threads on the bobbins when they are empty Is it very hard work No you mightn t think so But you have to stand up all day and it s doing the same thing all the time the same thing the whole day long You get dull you never think about anything And then the air is full of dust and the machinery roars You get used to it but I m sure its bad for you They walked for a while in silence Do you like to imagine things asked Sophie suddenly Yes said he I used to said she when I was younger It was so strange to Samuel to notice that this slip of a child always spoke of herself as old Why don t you do it now he asked I m too tired I think But I ve a lot of pictures up in my room that I cut out of magazines that people gave me Pictures of beautiful things birds and flowers and old castles and fine ladies and gentlemen And I used to make up stories about them and imagine that I was there and that all sorts of nice things were happening to me Would you like to see my pictures Very much said Samuel I think of things like that when I listen to Friedrich I ve a picture of Sir Galahad he s very beautiful and he stands at his horse s head with a sword in his hand I used to dream that somebody like that might come and carry me off to a place where there aren t any mills But I guess it s no use any more Why not asked the other It s too late There is something the matter with me I never say anything because it would make mother unhappy but I m always tired now and every day I have a headache And I m so very sleepy and yet when I lie down I can t sleep I keep hearing the mill Oh cried Samuel involuntarily I don t mind it so much said the child There s no help so what s the use It s only when I hear Friedrich play then I get all stirred up They walked on for a while again He s very unhappy she said finally I suppose so replied Samuel Tell me he asked suddenly Isn t there some other work that you could do What I m not strong enough for hard work And where could I make three dollars a week Is that what they pay you Yes that is when we are on full time Does it make all the girls sick he inquired There s that girl who came in this afternoon she seems well and strong Bessie you mean But it s just play for her you see She lives with her parents and stops whenever she feels like it She just wants to buy dresses and go to the theater But that girl we passed on the street to day Helen Davis Ah yes but she s different again She s bad Bad echoed Samuel perplexed There was a brief pause It was not easy for him to adjust himself to a world in which the good were of necessity frail and ill and the bad were rosy cheeked and merry How do you mean he asked at last And Sophie answered quite simply She lives with a fellow The blood leaped into Samuel s face Such a blunder for him to have made But then the flush passed giving place to a feeling of horrified wonder For Sophie was not in the least embarrassed she spoke in the most matter of fact tone And this from a child of thirteen who did not look to be ten I see said he in a faint voice A good many of the girls do it she added You see they move about so much the mills close and so a girl has no hope of marrying But mothers says it s wrong just the same And Samuel walked home the rest of the way in silence and thinking no more about the joys of music CHAPTER VII On Monday morning Samuel found that Professor Stewart had returned and he sat in the great man s study and waited until he had finished his breakfast It was a big room completely walled with crowded bookshelves in the center was a big work table covered with books and papers Samuel had never dreamed that there were so many books in the world and he gazed about him with awe feeling that he had come to the sources of knowledge That was Samuel s way Both by nature and training he had a profound respect for all authority He believed in the majesty of the law that was why it had shocked him so to be arrested He thought of the church as a divine institution whose ministers were appointed as shepherds of the people And up here on the heights was this great College a temple of learning and this professor was one who had been selected by those in the seats of authority and set apart as one of its priests So Samuel was profoundly grateful for the attention which was given to him and was prepared to pick up whatever crumbs of counsel might be dropped Ah yes the professor said wiping his glasses with a silk handkerchief Samuel let me see Samuel Prescott sir Yes Samuel Prescott And how have you been I ve been very well sir I meant to leave a message for you but I overlooked it I had so many things to attend to in the rush of departure I er I hope you didn t wait for me I had nothing else to do sir said Samuel The truth is continued the other I m afraid I shan t be able to do for you what I thought I could Samuel s heart went down into his boots You see said the professor a trifle embarrassed my sister wanted a man to look after her place but I found she had already engaged some one There was a pause Samuel simply stared Of course as the man is giving satisfaction you see it wouldn t do for her to send him away And Samuel continued to stare dumb with terror and dismay I m very sorry said the other no need to tell you that But I don t know of any other place But what am I to do burst out Samuel It s really too bad remarked the other And again there was a silence Professor Stewart said Samuel in a low voice what is a man to do who is out of work and starving God knows said the professor And yet again there was silence Samuel could have said that himself he had the utmost faith in God And after a while the professor himself seemed to realize that the reply was inadequate You see he went on there is a peculiar condition here in Lockmanville There was an attempt to corner the glass industry and that caused the building of too many factories and so there is overproduction And then besides that they ve just invented a machine that blows as many bottles as a dozen men But then what are the men to do asked Samuel The condition readjusts itself said the other The men have to go into some other trade But then the cotton mills are on half time too Yes there are too many cotton mills But then in the end there will be too many everything That is the tendency said the professor There are foreign markets of course But the difficulty really goes deeper than that Professor Stewart paused and looked at Samuel wondering perhaps if he were not throwing away his instruction But the boy looked very much interested even excited Most of our economists are disposed to blink the truth said he But the fact is there are too many men Samuel started It was precisely that terrible suspicion which had been shaping itself in his own mind There is a law went on the other which was clearly set forth by Malthus that population tends continually to outrun the food supply And then the surplus people have to be removed I see said Samuel awestricken But isn t it rather hard It seems so to the individual To the race it is really of the very greatest benefit It is the process of life Please tell me Samuel s look seemed to say If you will consider Nature Professor Stewart continued you will observe that she always produces many times more individuals than can possibly reach maturity The salmon lays millions of eggs and thousands of young trees spring up in every thicket And these individuals struggle for a chance to live and those survive which are strongest and best fitted to meet the conditions And precisely the same thing is true among men there is no other way by which the race could be improved or even kept at its present standard Those who perish are sacrificed for the benefit of the race Now strange as it may seem Samuel had never before heard the phrase the survival of the fittest And so now he was living over the experience of the thinking world of fifty or sixty years ago What a marvelous generalization it was What a range of life it covered And how obvious it seemed one could think of a hundred things perfectly well known which fitted into it And yet he had never thought of it himself The struggle for existence The survival of the fittest A few days ago Samuel had discovered music And now he was discovering science What an extraordinary thing was the intellect of man which could take all the infinitely varied facts of life and interpret them in the terms of one vast law Samuel was all aglow with excitement at the revelation I see he said again and again I see It is the law of life said the professor No one can escape from it And then said Samuel when we try to change things when we give out charity for instance we are working against Nature and we really make things worse That is it replied the other And Samuel gave a great sigh How very simple was the problem when one had seen it in the light of science Here he had been worrying and tormenting his brain about the matter and all the time he was in the hands of Nature and all he had to do was to lie back and let Nature solve it Nature never makes mistakes said Professor Stewart Of course in this new light Samuel s own case became plain Those who are out of work are those who have failed in the struggle he said Precisely said the professor And that is because they are unfit Precisely said the professor again As Herbert Spencer has phrased it Inability to catch prey must be regarded as a falling short of conduct from its ideal And of course in an industrial community the prey is a job Who is Herbert Spencer asked Samuel He is recognized as the authority in such matters said the other And then pondered Samuel those who have jobs must be the fit And the very rich people the ones who make the millions and millions they are the fittest of all Er yes said the professor And of course that makes my problem clear I m out of a job and so I must die The professor gazed at Samuel sharply But it was impossible to mistake the boy s open eyed sincerity He had no thought about himself he was discovering the laws of life I m so glad you explained it to me he went on But all these thousands of men who are starving to death they ought to be told it too What good would it do asked the other Why they ought to understand They suffer and it seems to them purposeless and stupid But if you were to explain to them that they are being sacrificed for the benefit of the race don t you see what a difference it would make I don t believe they would take the suggestion kindly said the professor with a faint attempt to smile But why not asked Samuel Wouldn t it sound rather hypocritical so to speak coming from a man who had succeeded Not at all You have a right to your success haven t you I hope so You have a job began Samuel and then hesitated I don t know how a professor comes to get his job he said But I suppose that the men who make the great fortunes the ones who are wisest and best of all they give the money for the colleges don t they Yes said Professor Stewart And then said Samuel I suppose it is they who have chosen you Again the professor darted a suspicious glance at his questioner Er one might put it that way he said Well then that is your right to teach and you could explain it Then you could say to these men There are too many of you you aren t needed and you must be removed But the professor only shook his head It wouldn t do he said And Samuel pondering and seeking as ever came to a sudden comprehension I see he exclaimed What is needed is action Action Yes it s for us who are beaten to teach it and to teach it in our lives It s a sort of revival that is needed you see But I don t see the need laughed the other interested in spite of himself That s because you aren t one of us cried Samuel vehemently Nobody else can understand nobody It s easy to be one of the successes of life You have a comfortable home and plenty to eat and all But when you ve failed when you re down and out then you have to bear hunger and cold and sickness And there is grief and fear and despair you can have no idea of it Why I ve met a little girl in this town She works in the cotton mill and it s just killed her by inches body and soul And even so she can only get half a day s work and the mother is trying to support the little children by sewing and they re all just dying of slow starvation This very morning they asked me to stay to breakfast and I refused because I knew they had only some bread and a few potatoes and it wasn t enough for one person You see it s so slow it s such a terribly long process this starving people off by inches And keeping them always tormented by hope Don t you see Professor Stewart And just because you don t come out honestly and teach them the truth Because you won t say to them The world is too full and you ve got to get out of the way so as to give us a chance Why look sir you defeat your own purposes These people stay and they keep on having more children and everything gets worse instead of better and they have diseases and vices they ruin the whole world What s the use of having a world if it s got to be like this town crowded with hovels full of dirty people and sick people and starving and miserable people I can t see how you who live up here on the heights can enjoy yourselves while such things continue Um no said Professor Stewart and he gazed at Samuel with knitted brows unable for the life of him to feel certain whether he ought to feel amused or to feel touched or to feel outraged As for Samuel he realized that he was through with the professor The professor had taught him all that he had to teach He did not really understand this matter at all that was because he belonged to the other world the world of successful and fit people They had their own problems to solve no doubt This non comprehension was made quite clear by the professor s next remark I m sorry to have disappointed you he said If a little money will help you No said the other quickly You mustn t offer me money How can that be right That would be charity Ahem said the professor Yes But then you mentioned that you hadn t had any breakfast Hadn t you better go into the kitchen and let them give you something But what is the use of putting things off cried Samuel wildly If I m going to preach this new idea I ve got to begin But you can t preach very long on an empty stomach objected the other To which Samuel answered The preaching has to be by deeds And so he took his departure and Professor Stewart turned back to his work table upon which lay the bulky manuscript of his monumental work which was entitled Methods of Relief A Theory and a Programme Some pages lay before him the top one was headed Chapter LXIII Unemployment and Social Responsibility And Professor Stewart sat before this title and stared and stared CHAPTER VIII Samuel meantime was walking down the broad macadam avenue debating his problem The first glow of excitement was over and he was finding difficulties The theory still held but in the carrying out of it there were complications For one thing it would be so hard to spread this doctrine For if one tried to teach it by words he seemed a hypocrite as the professor had said and on the other hand if one simply practiced it who would ever know Suppose for instance that he starved to death during the next few days That would be only one person removed and apparently there were millions of the superfluous The truth was that Samuel in discussing the theory had applied it only to himself But now he pictured himself going home to tell missus Stedman that she must give up her futile effort and take herself and her three children out of the way of the progress of the race And he realized that he could never do it he was not equal to the task Doubtless it was because he was one of the unfit It would need some one who did not know them some one who could approach the matter from the purely scientific standpoint Then there was another difficulty graver yet Did not this doctrine really point to suicide Would it not be the simplest solution of his problem if he were to climb down to the river and tie a stone about his neck and jump in Samuel wished that he had thought to ask the professor about this For the idea frightened him he had a distinct impression of having been taught that it was a dreadful sin to take one s own life The trouble seemed to lie in the dull and unromantic nature of the life about him If only there had been some way to die nobly and heroically for the good of others If only there was a war for instance and a call for men to perish on the ramparts Or a terrible pestilence so that one could be a nurse But there was nothing at all but this low starving to death and while other people lived in plenty Samuel thought of the chance of finding some work which involved grave peril to life or limb but apparently even the danger posts were filled The world did not need him either in life or death So there was nothing for it but the starving Having eaten nothing that day Samuel was ready to begin at once he tightened his belt and set his teeth for the grapple with the gaunt wolf of hunger And so he strode on down the road pining for a chance to sacrifice himself and at the very hour that the greatest peril of his life was bearing down upon him He had passed Fairview the great mansion with the stately gates and the white pillars He had passed beyond its vast grounds and had got out into the open country He was walking blindly it made no great difference where he went And then suddenly behind him there was a clatter of hoofs and he turned and up the road he saw a cloud of dust and in the midst of it a horse galloping furiously Samuel stared there was some kind of a vehicle behind it and there was a person in the vehicle A single glance was enough for him to realize it was a runaway To Samuel the thing came as a miracle it was an answer to his prayer And it found him ready The chance was offered him and he would not fail not he He did not falter for a second He knew just what he had to do and he was ready resolute and alert and tense He moved into the center of the road The horse came on galloping at top speed it was a blooded horse swift and frantic with fear and terrible to see Samuel spread out his arms and then in a flash the creature was upon him It swerved to pass him and the boy wheeled leaped swiftly and flung himself at the bridle He caught it his arms were wrenched but he hung on and jerked himself up The horse flung him to one side but with a swift clutch Samuel caught him by the nostrils with one hand and gripped fast Then he drew himself up close and hung grimly his eyes shut with a grasp like death And he was still hanging there when the run away stopped and the occupant leaped from the vehicle and rushed to help him My God he cried but that was nerve He was a young fellow white as a sheet and trembling in every muscle How did you do it he panted I just held on said Samuel God but I m thankful to you exclaimed the other You ve saved my life Samuel still clung to the horse which was quivering with nervousness He d never have got away from me but one rein broke See here And he held up the end What started him asked Samuel Nothing said the other a piece of paper likely He s a fool always was And he shook his fist in the horse s face exclaiming By God I ll tame you before I finish with you Look out said Samuel You ll start him again And again he clutched the horse which started to plunge I ve got him now said the other He ll quiet down Hold fast Samuel continued and then he put his hand to his forehead and swayed slightly I I ll have to sit down a moment I m afraid I feel sort of dizzy Are you hurt cried the stranger anxiously No he said no but I haven t had anything to eat to day and I m a little weak Nothing to eat cried the other What s the matter Why I ve been out of a job Out of a job Good heavens man have you been starving Well said Samuel with a wan smile I had begun to He sat down by the roadside and 
7939_120318_000015_000000	train-clean-360	the other stared at him 
none	none	Do you live in Lockmanville he asked No I just came here I left my home in the country to go to New York and I was robbed and lost all my money And I haven t been able to find anything to do and I d just about given up and got ready to die My God cried the other in dismay Oh it s all right said Samuel I didn t mind The stranger gazed at him in perplexity And Samuel returned the gaze being curious to see who it was he had rescued It was a youth not more than a year or two older than himself The color had now come back into his face and Samuel thought that he was the most beautiful human being he had ever seen He had a frank open face and laughing eyes and golden hair like a girl s He wore outing costume a silk shirt and light flannels things which Samuel had learned to associate with the possession of wealth and ease Also his horse was a thoroughbred and with a rubber tired runabout and a silver mounted harness the expensiveness of the rig was evident Samuel was glad of this because it meant that he had rescued some one of consequence some one of the successful and fit people Just as soon as you re able come hold the horse said the stranger and then I ll fix this rein and take you back and get you something to eat Oh no said Samuel Don t bother That s all right Hell man cried the other Don t you suppose I m going to do anything for you Well I hadn t thought began Samuel Cut it out exclaimed the other I ll set you up and find you a job and you can have a decent start Find him a job Samuel s heart gave a great throb For a moment he hardly knew how to take this how it would fit into his new philosophy But surely it was all right for him to take a job Yes he had earned it Even if some one else had to be turned out even so he had proven his fitness He had won in the struggle He had a place among the successful and he could help Sophie and her mother He got up with eagerness and held the horse Do you think you can manage him he asked Oh yes said the other I ll chance it anyhow And he leaped into the runabout and took the reins Now he said and Samuel got in and they sped away back toward town Don t say anything about this accident please said the young man suddenly I won t said Samuel My friends are always teasing me because I drive horses he explained Why not asked the other Well everybody drives motors nowadays But my father stood by horses and I learned to be fond of them We never had but one horse on the farm observed Samuel But I was fond of him What is your name inquired the stranger and Samuel told him Also he told him where he had come from and what had happened to him He took particular pains to tell about the jail because he did not want to deceive anyone But his companion merely called it an infernal outrage Where were you going now he asked I d just left Professor Stewart s replied Samuel What Old Stew How do you come to know him He was at the court And he said he d get me a job and then he found he couldn t Do you know him Oh yes I had him at college you know Oh do you go to the college I used to till my father died Then I quit I hate study Samuel was startled I suppose you don t need to he said after a pause No said the other My father thought the world of Old Stew he added but he used to bore the life out of me How d you find him Well answered Samuel you see I haven t had any of your advantages I found what he told me very wonderful What did he tell you Well he explained to me how it was I was out of a job There are too many people in the world it seems and I was one of the unfit I had failed in the struggle for existence and so I had to be exterminated he said The devil he did exclaimed the stranger Samuel wished that the young man would not use so many improper words but he presumed that was one of the privileges of the successful I was very grateful to him he went on because you see I hadn t understood what it meant But when I realized it was for the good of the race then I didn t mind any more His companion stole a glance at him out of the corner of his eye Gee he said I had quite an argument with him I wanted him to see that he ought to teach the people There are thousands of people starving here in Lockmanville and would you want to starve without knowing the reason No said the other I don t think I should And again he looked at his companion But the conversation was interrupted there For some time they had been passing the place with the ten foot iron railing and now they came to the great stone entrance with the name Fairview carved upon it To Samuel s surprise they turned in Where are you going he asked Home said the other And Samuel started Do you live here he gasped Yes was the reply Samuel stared at the familiar driveway with the stately elms and the lawns with the peacocks and lyre birds This is one of the places where I asked for work he said They ordered me out The deuce they did exclaimed the other Well they won t order you out now There was a pause You haven t told me your name put in Samuel suddenly I thought you d guess said the other with a laugh How could I Why don t you know what place this is No said Samuel What And his companion replied It s the Lockman place Samuel caught his breath and clutched at the seat The Lockman place he panted and then again The Lockman place He stared ahead at the great building with the broad porticos and the snow white columns He could hardly credit his ears I m the old man s son added the stranger genially Albert s my name They call me Bertie CHAPTER IX Properly to understand the thrill which this revelation brought to Samuel one would have to consider the state of his mind With all the power of his being Samuel was seeking for excellence and a great and wise man had explained to him what were the signs by which this quality was known And in the struggle for existence old Henry Lockman had succeeded more than any other man of whom Samuel had ever heard in his life He owned these huge glass works and many others all over the country He owned the trolley roads and the gas works and the water works the place had been named after him and the great college also For many years he had even run the government of the town so Finnegan had stated And here was this huge estate his home a palace fit for a king How great must have been the excellence of such a man And what benefits he must have conferred upon the world to have been rewarded with all this power and glory And here was his son a youth in aspect fitting perfectly to Samuel s vision a very prince of the blood yet genial and free hearted noblesse oblige To him had descended these virtues and excellences and all the estates and powers as the sign and symbol thereof And now had come a poor ignorant country boy and it had fallen to his fortune to save the life of this extraordinary being And he was to have a chance to be near him and to serve him to see how he lived and to find out the secret of his superior excellence There was no snobbery in Samuel s attitude he felt precisely as another and far greater Samuel had felt when his sovereign had condescended to praise his dictionary and the tears of gratitude had started into his eyes They drove up before the palace and a groom came hurrying up Phillips said young Lockman look at that rein The groom stared aghast Take it and show it to Sanderson the other continued Ask him if I don t pay enough for my harness that he gets me stuff like that Yes sir said the groom They alighted and crossed the broad piazza which was covered with easy chairs and tables and rugs In the entrance hall stood a man in livery Peters said the young man this is Samuel Prescott I had some trouble with my horse and he helped me He hasn t had anything to eat today and I want him to have a good meal Yes sir said the man Where shall I serve it sir In the morning room We ll wait there And mind you bring him a plenty Yes sir said Peters and went off Meantime Samuel had time for a glance about him Never had he heard or dreamed of such magnificence It was appalling beyond belief The great entrance hall went up to the roof and there was a broad staircase of white marble with galleries of marble and below a marble fireplace big enough to hold a section of a tree Beyond this was a court with fountains splashing and visions of palms and gorgeous flowers and on each side were vistas of rooms with pictures and tapestries and furniture which Samuel thought must be of solid gold Come said his companion and they ascended the staircase Halfway up however Samuel stopped and caught his breath Before him there was a painting There is no need to describe it in detail suffice it to say that it was a life size painting of a woman entirely naked and that Samuel had never seen such a thing in his life before He dropped his eyes as he came near to it They went along the gallery and entered a room dazzlingly beautiful and bright It was all done in white satin the front being of glass and opening upon a wide balcony There were flowers and singing birds and in the panels most beautiful paintings representing wood nymphs dancing These airy creatures also were innocent of anything save filmy veils but they were all about the room and so poor Samuel had no way to escape them He sought for light within his mind and suddenly he recollected the illustrated Bible at home Perhaps the peerless beings who lived in such palaces had returned to a state of guiltlessness such as had existed before the serpent came Young Lockman flung himself into an easy chair and proceeded to cross question his companion He wanted to know all about the interview with Old Stew and afterwards having managed to divine Samuel s attitude to himself he led him to talk about that which Samuel did with the utmost frankness Gee but you re a queer duffer was Lockman s comment but Samuel didn t mind that The butler came with the meal carrying it on a big tray and with another man to carry a folding table and yet another to help Such a display of silver and cut glass Such snowy linen and such unimaginable viands There were piles of sandwiches each one half a bite for a fairly hungry man There was jellied game and caviar and a pate of something strange and spicy Nothing was what one would have expected there were eggs inside of baked potatoes and ice cream in some sort of crispy cake The crackers looked like cakes and the cakes like crackers and the cheese was green and discouraging But a bowl of strawberries and cream held out a rich promise at the end and Samuel took heart Fall to said the host and then divining the other s state of mind he remarked You needn t serve Peters and the men went away to Samuel s vast relief Don t mind me added Lockman laughing And if there s any question you want to ask all right So Samuel tasted the food of the gods a kind of food which human skill and ingenuity had labored for centuries to invent and for days and even weeks to prepare Samuel wondered vaguely where all these foods had come from and how many people had had a hand in their preparation also he wondered if all those who ate them would become as beautiful and as dazzling as his young friend The friend meanwhile was vastly diverted and was bent upon making the most of his find I suppose you d like to see the place he said I should indeed said Samuel Come and I ll show it to you that is If you re able to walk after the meal The meal did not trouble Samuel and they went out and took a stroll And so the boy met with yet another revelation of the possibilities of existence If there was anything in the world he would have supposed he understood it was farming but here at Fairview was farming as it was done by the methods of Science At home they had had some lilac bushes and a row of peonies here were acres of greeneries filled with flowers of gorgeous and unimaginable splendor and rare plants from every part of the world At home it had been Samuel s lot to milk the cow and he had found it a trying job on cold and dark winter mornings and here was a model dairy with steam heat and electric light and tiled walls and nickel plumbing and cows with pedigrees in frames and attendants with white uniforms and rubber gloves Then there was a row of henhouses each for a fancy breed of fowl some of them red and lean as herons and others white as snow and as fat and ungainly as hogs And then out in front at one corner of the lawn was the aviary with houses for the peacocks and lyre birds and for parrots and magpies and innumerable strange birds from the tropics Also there were dog kennels with many dozens of strange breeds Father got those for me said young Lockman He thought I d be interested in agriculture Well aren t you asked Samuel Not very much said the other carelessly Here s Punch what do you think of him The occasion for this was a dog the most hideously ugly object that Samuel had ever seen in his life I I don t think I d care for him he said hesitatingly He s a Japanese bulldog observed the other He cost three thousand dollars Three thousand dollars gasped the boy in horror Why should anyone pay so much for a dog That s what he s worth said the other with a laugh They went to see the horses which were housed in a palace of their own There were innumerable rows of stalls and a running track and endless acres of inclosures Why do you have so many horses asked Samuel Father ran a stock farm said the other I don t have much time to give to it myself But who rides the horses asked Samuel Well I go in for sport replied Lockman I m supposed to be quite a dab at polo I see said the boy though to tell the truth he did not see at all not having the least idea what polo was If you re interested in horses I ll have them find you something to do here Lockman went on Oh thank you said the boy with a thrill That will be fine He could have spent all day in gazing at the marvels of this place but his host was tired now and started back to the house It s lunch time he said Perhaps you are hungry again They came out upon the piazza and sat down And then suddenly they heard a clatter of hoofs and looked up Hello exclaimed the host Here s Glad A horse was coming up the road at a lively pace The rider was seated a straddle and so Samuel was slow to realize that it was a woman It was only when he saw her wave her hand and call to them that he was sure She reined up her horse and a groom who followed her took the rein and she stepped off upon the piazza and stood looking at them She was young and of extraordinary beauty She was breathing fast and her hair was blown about her forehead and the glow of health was in her cheeks and Samuel thought that she was the most beautiful object that he had ever beheld in all his life He stared transfixed he had never dreamed that anything so wonderful could exist in the world He realized in a sudden glow of excitement what it was that confronted him She was the female of this higher species she was the superior and triumphant woman Hello Bertie she said Hello the other replied and then added This is my cousin Miss Wygant Glad this is Samuel Prescott The girl made a slight acknowledgment and stared at Samuel with a look in which curiosity and hauteur were equally mingled She was a brunette with dark hair and an almost Oriental richness of coloring She was lithe and gracefully built and quick in her motions There was eager alertness in her whole aspect her glance was swift and her voice imperious One could read her at a glance for a person accustomed to command impatient and adventurous passionate and proud I ve had an adventure said her cousin by way of explanation Samuel here saved my life And Samuel thrilled to see the sudden look of interest which came into the girl s face What she cried Yes said the other Spitfire ran away with me You don t mean it Bertie Yes The rein broke He started near the gate here and ran three or four miles with me Bertie cried the girl And what happened Samuel stopped him How It was splendid Glad the nerviest thing I ever saw He just flung himself at the rein and caught it and hung on He saved my life beyond question And now Samuel burning up with embarrassment faced the full blaze of the girl s impetuous interest How perfectly fine she exclaimed then Where do you come from she asked He s just off a farm said Lockman He was on his way to New York to make his fortune And think of it Glad he d been robbed and he d been wandering about town begging for work and he was nearly starving

none	none	so gasped the girl She took a chair and indicated to Samuel to sit in front of her Tell me all about yourself she said and proceeded to cross question him about his life and his adventures Poor Samuel was like a witness in the hands of a prosecutor he became hopelessly confused and frightened But that made no difference to the girl who poured a ceaseless fire of questions upon him until she had laid his whole life bare She even made him tell about Manning the stockbroker and how the family had lost its money in the collapse of Glass Bottle Securities And then her cousin put in a word about his adventure with Old Stew and Samuel had to tell that all over again and to set forth his sociological convictions Miss Wygant and her cousin meantime exchanging glances of wonder and amusement At last however they tired of him and fell to talking of a dance they were to attend and a tennis tournament in which they were to play And so Samuel had a chance to gaze at Miss Wygant and to feast his eyes upon her beauty He could have dreamed of no greater joy in all this world than to watch her for hours to study every detail of her features and her costume and to see the play of laughter about her mouth and eyes But then came the butler announcing luncheon and Samuel rose in a panic He had a sudden vision of himself being asked to the table to sit under Miss Wygant s merciless survey I think I d better go now he said All right said young Lockman Will you come to morrow morning and we ll fix things up I ll come said Samuel What are you going to do with him asked the girl He likes to take care of horses said Lockman No exclaimed the other promptly that won t do Why not asked he Because Bertie you don t want to make a stable boy out of him He has too many possibilities For one thing he s good looking Samuel flushed scarlet and dropped his eyes He felt again that penetrating gaze All right said Lockman What can you suggest I don t know I m sure But something decent He doesn t know enough to be a house servant Glad No but something outside Couldn t he learn gardening Are you fond of flowers Samuel Yes ma am said Samuel quickly Well then make a gardener out of him said Miss Wygant and that settled Samuel s destiny The boy took his departure and went home almost running in his excitement He was transported into a distant heaven of bliss he had been seated among the gods he was to dwell there forever after His new patron had given him a five dollar bill and before he reached the Stedman home he stopped in a grocery store and loaded up his arms with bundles And then seized by a sudden thought he went into a notion store and set down his bundles and purchased a clean white linen collar and a necktie of royal purple and brilliant green already tied so that it would always be perfect in shape Then he went into the Stedmans and the widow and the youngest children sat round and listened open eyed to his tale And then came Sophie and he had to tell it all over again The girl s eyes opened wide with excitement when he came to the end of his recital Miss Wygant she exclaimed Miss Gladys Wygant Yes said Samuel You ve heard of her I ve seen her exclaimed Sophie eagerly Twice You don t mean it he said Yes Once she came to our church festival at Christmas Does she belong to your church It s the mission Great folks like her wouldn t want us in the church with them She goes to saint Matthew s you know up there on the hill But she came to the festival at the mission and helped to give out the presents And she was dressed all in red something filmy and soft like you d see in a dream And oh Samuel she was so beautiful She had a rose in her hair and such a sweet perfume you could hardly bear it And she stood there and smiled at all the children and gave them the presents She gave me mine and it was like seeing a princess I wanted to fall down and kiss her feet Yes said Samuel understandingly And to think that you ve met her cried Sophie in ecstasy And talked with her Oh how could you do it I I don t think I did it very well said Samuel What did you say to her I don t remember much of it I never heard her voice said Sophie She was talking the other time I saw her but the machinery drowned it out That was in the mill she came there with some other people and walked about looking at everything We were all so excited You know her father owns the mill No I didn t know it replied Samuel He owns all sorts of things in Lockmanville They re very very rich And she s his only daughter and so beautiful everybody worships her I ve got two pictures of her that were in the newspapers once Come you must see them And so the two rushed upstairs and over the bed were two faded newspaper clippings one showing Miss Gladys in an evening gown and the other in dimity en princesse with a bunch of roses in her arms Did you ever see anything so lovely asked the girl I made her my fairy godmother And she used to say such lovely things to me She must be very kind you know no one could be so beautiful who wasn t very very good and kind No said Samuel She must be I m sure And then a sudden idea came to him Sophie he exclaimed she said I was good looking I wonder if I am And Sophie shot a quick glance at him Why of course you are she cried You stupid boy Samuel went to the cracked mirror which hung upon the wall and looked at himself with new and wandering interest Don t you see how fine and strong you are said Sophie And what a bright color you ve got I never thought of it said he and recollected the green and purple necktie And to think that you ve talked with her exclaimed Sophie turning back to the pictures and she added in a sudden burst of generosity I tell you what I ll do Samuel I ll give you these and you can put them in your room You mustn t do that he protested But the girl insisted No no I know them by heart so it won t make any difference And they ll mean so much more to you because you ve really met her CHAPTER X Samuel presented himself the next morning and was turned over to the head gardener and duly installed as an assistant Let me know how you re getting along was young Lockman s last word to him And if there s anything else I can do for you come and tell me Thank you very much sir said the boy gratefully but without realizing how these magic words pronounced in the gardener s hearing would make him a privileged character about the place an object of mingled deference and envy to the other servants It was a little world all in itself the Fairview menage Without counting the stable hands and the employees of the different farms it took no less than twenty three people to minister to the personal wants of Bertie Lockman And they were divided into ranks and classes with a rigid code of etiquette upon which they insisted with vehemence A housekeeper s assistant looked with infinite scorn upon a kitchen maid and there had to be no less than four dining rooms for the various classes of servants who would not eat at the same table All this was very puzzling to the stranger but after a while he came to see how the system had grown up It was just like a court and the privileged beings who waited upon the sovereign necessarily were esteemed according to the importance of the service they performed for him and the access which they attained to his person A good many of these servants were foreigners and Samuel was pained to discover that they were for the most part without any ennobling conception of their calling They were much given to gluttony and drinking and there was an unthinkable amount of scandal and backbiting and jealousy But it was only by degrees that he realized this for he had one great motive in common with them they were all possessed with a sense of the greatness of the Lockmans and none of them wanted anything better than to talk for hours about the family and its wealth and power and the habits and tastes of its members and their friends It was Katie Reilly a bright little Irish damsel the housekeeper s sewing girl who first captured Samuel with her smile she carried him off for a walk in spite of the efforts of the second parlor maid and Samuel drank up eagerly the stream of gossip which poured from her lips Master Albert that was what they all called him was said to have an income of over seven hundred thousand dollars a year What he did with such a sum no one could imagine he had lived quite alone since his father s death The house had always been run by Miss Aurelia old mister Lockman s sister a lady with the lumbago and a terrible temper but she had died a couple of years ago mister Lockman had taken great interest in his stock farm but very little in his house and Master Albert took even less spending most of his time in New York Consequently everything was at sixes and sevens and he was being robbed most terribly But in spite of all his relatives suggestions he would not have anyone to come and live with him Master Albert was still a minor and his affairs were managed by mister Hickman the family lawyer and also by his uncle mister Wygant The latter was a manufacturer and capitalist also a great scholar so Katie said It was he Samuel had seen that afternoon in the automobile a tall and very proud looking man with an iron gray mustache He lived in the big white house just after you climbed the ridge and Miss Gladys was his only daughter She had been old mister Lockman s favorite niece and he had left her a great deal of money People were always planning a match between her and Master Albert but that always made Miss Gladys very angry They both declared they were not in love with each other and Katie was inclined to think this was true Miss Gladys had been away to a rich boarding school and she wanted to visit some friends at Newport but her father wanted her to stay with him and that made her discontented She was very beautiful and everybody was her slave But oh I tell you when she s angry said Katie with a shake of her head This little Irish girl was a rare find for Samuel because her brother was the fellow to Miss Gladys s maid and so there was nothing she could not tell Samuel about his divinity He learned about Miss Gladys s beautiful party dresses and about her wonderful riding horse and about her skill at tennis and even her fondness for chocolate fudge Miss Gladys had been to Paris the summer before and her family had a camp in the Adirondacks and they went there every August in an automobile and flew about on a mountain lake in a motor boat the shape of a knife blade Katie wanted to talk about Samuel a part of the time and even perhaps about herself but Samuel plied her with questions about Miss Wygant He had her two pictures folded away in his vest pocket and all the time that he trimmed the hedges he listened for the sound of her horse s hoofs or for the chug of her motor And then one blissful morning when he was carrying in an armful of roses for the housekeeper he ran full upon her in the hall His heart leaped so that it hurt him and instead of passing straight on as he should have done he stood stock still and almost spilled his roses on the floor Miss Gladys s face lighted with pleasure Why it s Samuel she exclaimed Yes Miss Gladys said he And how do you like your position Very well Miss Gladys he replied and then feeling the inadequacy of this he added with fervor I m so happy I can t tell you I m very glad to hear it she said And I m sure you fill it very well I ve done the best I can Miss Gladys said he There was a moment s pause You find there is a good deal to learn she inquired Yes he answered But you see it s about flowers and I was always interested in flowers And again there was a pause and then suddenly Miss Wygant flung a question at him Samuel why do you look at me like that Samuel was almost knocked over Why why he gasped Miss Gladys I don t Ah she said but you do Poor Samuel was in an agony of horror I I really he stammered I didn t mean it I wouldn t for the world He stopped utterly at a loss and Miss Wygant kept her merciless gaze upon him Am I so very beautiful she asked This startled Samuel into lifting his eyes He stared at her transfixed and at last he whispered faintly Yes Tell me about it she said and her look shook him to the depths of his soul He stood there trembling he could feel the blood pouring in a warm flood about his throat and neck Tell me she said again You you are more beautiful than anyone I have ever seen he panted You are not used to women Samuel No said he I m just a country boy She stood waiting for him to continue The girls there he whispered they are pretty but you you And then suddenly the words came to him You are like a princess he cried Ah if you ever find your tongue she said with a smile and then after a pause she added You don t know how different you are Samuel Different he echoed Yes You are so fresh so young You would do anything for me wouldn t you Yes he said You d risk your life for me as you did for Bertie And Samuel answered her with fervor that left no room for doubt I wish there was a chance she laughed But there s only this dull every day round There was a pause the boy dropped his eyes and stood trembling Where are you going with the roses she asked I m to take them to the housekeeper Let me have one She took one from the bunch and he stood watching while she pinned it to her dress You may bring me some now and then she said with one of her marvelous smiles Don t forget And then as she went on she touched him upon the hand At the touch of her warm living fingers such a thrill passed through the boy as made him reel It was something blind and elemental outside of anything that he had dreamed of in his life She went on down the hall and left him there and he had to lean against a table for support And all that day he was in a daze with bursts of rapture sweeping over him She was interested in him She had smiled upon him She had touched his hand He went home that evening on purpose to tell Sophie and the two of them talked about it for hours He told the story over and over again And Sophie listened with her eyes shining and her hands clasped in an ecstasy of delight Oh Samuel she whispered I knew it I knew she d appreciate you She was so beautiful I knew she must be kind and good CHAPTER XI A week passed and Samuel did not see his divinity again He lived upon the memory of their brief interview and while he trimmed the hedges he was dreaming the most extravagant dreams of rescues and perilous escapes For the first time he began to find that his work was tedious it offered so few possibilities of romance If only he had been her chauffeur now Or the guide who escorted her in her tramps about the wilderness Or the man who ran the wonderful motor boat that was shaped like a knife blade Samuel continued to ponder and was greatly worried lest the commonplace should ingulf him So little he dreamed how near was a change Bertie Lockman had been away for a few days visiting some friends and he came back unexpectedly one afternoon Samuel knew that he had not been expected for always there were great bunches of flowers to be placed in his room The gardener happened to be away at the time the motor arrived and so Samuel upon his own responsibility cut the flowers and took them into the house He left them in the housekeeper s workroom and then set out to find that functionary and tell her what he had done So in the entrance to the dining room he stumbled upon his young master giving some orders to Peters the butler As an humble gardener s boy Samuel should have stepped back and vanished Instead he came forward and Bertie smiled pleasantly and said Hello Samuel Good afternoon Master Albert said Samuel And how do you like your work the other asked I like it very well sir he replied and then added apologetically I was bringing some flowers The master turned to speak to Peters again and Samuel turned to retire But at that instant there came the sound of a motor in front of the house Hello said Bertie Who s that and turned to look through the entrance hall Peters went forward to the door and so Samuel was left standing and watching A big red touring car had drawn up in front of the piazza It was filled with young people waving their hands and shouting Bertie Oh Bertie The other appeared to be startled Well I ll be damned he muttered as he went to meet them Of course Samuel had no business whatever to stand there He should have fled in trepidation But he as a privileged person had not yet been drilled into a realization of his place And they were such marvelous creatures these people of the upper world and he was so devoured with the desire to know about them There were two young men in the motor of about his master s age and nearly as goodly to look at And there were four young women of a quite extraordinary sort They were beautiful all of them nearly as beautiful as Miss Gladys and perhaps it was only the automobile costumes but they struck one as even more alarmingly complex They were airy ethereal creatures with delicate peach blow complexions and very small hands and feet They seemed to favor all kinds of fluffy and flimsy things they were explosions of all the colors of the springtime There were leaves and flowers and fruits and birds in their hats and there were elaborate filmy veils to hold the hats on They descended from the motor and Samuel had glimpses of ribbons and ruffles of shapely ankles and daintily slippered feet They came in the midst of a breeze of merriment with laughter and bantering and little cries of all sorts You don t seem very glad to see us Bertie one said Cheer up old chap nobody ll tell on us cried one of the young men And we ll be good and go home early added another of the girls One of the party Samuel noticed particularly because she looked more serious and hung back a little She was smaller than the others a study in pink and white her dress and hat were trimmed with pink ribbons and she had the most marvelously pink cheeks and lips and the most exquisite features Samuel had ever seen in his life Now suddenly she ran to young Lockman and flung her arms about his neck Bertie she exclaimed it s my fault I made them come I wanted to see you so badly You aren t mad with us are you No said Bertie I m not mad Well then be glad cried the girl and kissed him again Be a good boy do All right said Bertie feebly I ll be good Belle We wanted to surprise you added one of the young fellows You surprised me all right said Bertie a reply which all of them seemed to find highly amusing for they laughed uproariously He doesn t ask us in said one of the girls Come on Dolly let s see this house of his And so the party poured in Samuel waited just long enough to catch the rustle of innumerable garments and a medley of perfumes which might have been blown from all the gardens of the East Then he turned and fled to the regions below One of the young men he learned from the talk in the servants hall was Jack Holliday the youngest son of the railroad magnate it was his sister who was engaged to marry the English duke The other boy was the heir of a great lumber king from the West and though he was only twenty he had got himself involved in a divorce scandal with some actor people Who the young ladies were no one seemed to know but there were half whispered remarks about them the significance of which was quite lost upon Samuel Presently the word came that the party was to stay to dinner And then instantly the whole household sprang into activity Above stairs everything would move with the smoothness of clockwork but downstairs in the servants quarters it was a serious matter that an elaborate banquet for seven people had to be got ready in a couple of hours Even Samuel was pressed into service at odd jobs something for which he was very glad as it gave him a chance to remain in the midst of events So it happened that he saw Peters emerging from the wine cellar followed by a man with a huge basket full of bottles And this set Samuel to pondering hard the while he scraped away at a bowl of potatoes It was the one thing which had disconcerted him in the life of this upper world the obvious part that drinking played in it There were always decanters of liquor upon the buffet in the dining room and liquor was served to guests upon any and every pretext And the women drank as freely as the men even Miss Gladys drank a thing which was simply appalling to Samuel Of course these were privileged people and they knew what they wanted to do But could it be right for anyone to drink As in the case of suicide Samuel found his moral convictions beginning to waver Perhaps it was that drink did not affect these higher beings as it did ordinary people Or perhaps what they drank was something that cheered without inebriating Certain it was that the servants got drunk and Samuel had seen that they took the stuff from the decanters used by the guests It was something over which he labored with great pain of soul But of course all his hesitations and sophistries were for the benefit of his master that it could be right for Samuel himself to touch liquor was something that could not by any chance enter his mind The dinner had begun and Samuel went on several errands to the room below the butler s pantry and so from the dumb waiter shafts he could hear the sounds of laughter and conversation And more wine went up it was evidently a very merry party The meal was protracted for two or three hours and the noise grew louder and louder They were shouting so that one could hear them all over the house They were singing songs wild rollicking choruses which were very wonderful to listen to and yet terribly disturbing to Samuel These fortunate successful ones he would grant them the right to any happiness it was to be expected that they should dwell in perpetual merriment and delight But he could hear the champagne corks popping every few minutes And COULD it be right for them to drink It grew late and still the revelry went on A thunderstorm had come up and was raging outside The servants who were not at work had gone to bed but there was no sleep for Samuel he continued to prowl about restless and tormented The whole house was now deserted save for the party in the dining room and so he crept up by one of the rear stairways and crouched in a doorway where he could listen to the wild uproar He had been there perhaps ten minutes He could hear the singing and yelling though he could not make out the words because of the noise of the elements But then suddenly above all the confusion he heard a woman s shrieks piercing and shrill and he started up and sprang into the hall Whether they were cries of anger or of fear or of pain Samuel could not be certain but he knew that they were not cries of enjoyment He stood trembling There rose a babel of shouts and then again came the woman s voice No no you shan t I say Sit down you fool Samuel heard Bertie Lockman shout And then came another woman s voice Shut up and mind your business I ll tear your eyes out you devil shrilled the first voice and there followed a string of furious curses The other woman replied in kind and Samuel made out that there was some kind of a quarrel and that some of the party wanted to interfere and that others wanted it to go on All were whooping and shrieking uproariously and the two women yelled like hyenas It was like the nightmare sounds he had heard from his cell in the police station and Samuel listened appalled There came a crash of breaking glass and then suddenly in the midst of the confusion he heard his young master cry Get out of here and the dining room door was flung open and the uproar burst full upon him A terrible sight met his eyes It was the beautiful and radiant creature who had kissed Bertie Lockman her face was now flushed with drink and distorted with rage her hair disheveled and her aspect wild and she was screaming in the voice which had first startled Samuel Bertie had grappled with her and was trying to push her out of the room while she fought frantically and screamed Let me go Let me go Get out of here I say cried Bertie I mean it now I won t Let me be exclaimed the girl Hurrah shouted the others crowding behind them Young Holliday was dancing about waving a bottle and yelling like a maniac Go it Bertie Give it to him Belle This is the end of it cried Bertie I m through with you And you get out of here I won t I won t screamed the girl again and again Help And she flung one arm about his neck and caught at the doorway But he tore her loose and dragged her bodily across the entrance hall Out with you he exclaimed And don t ever let me see your face again Bertie Bertie she protested I mean it he said Here Jack Open the door for me Bertie No shrieked the girl but then with a sudden effort he half threw her out into the darkness There was a brief altercation outside and then he sprang back and flung to the heavy door and bolted it fast Now by God he said you ll stay out The girl beat and kicked frantically upon the door But Bertie turned his back and staggered away reeling slightly That ll settle it I guess he said with a wild laugh And amidst a din of laughter and cheers from the others he went back to the dining room One of the other women flung her arms about him hilariously and Jack Holliday raised a bottle of wine on high and shouted Off with the old love on with the new And so Bertie shut the door again and the scene was hid from Samuel s eyes CHAPTER XII For a long while Samuel stood motionless hearing the swish of the rain and the crashing of the thunder as an echo of the storm in his own soul It was as if a chasm had yawned beneath his feet and all the castles of his dreams had come down in ruins He stood there stunned and horrified staring at the wreckage of everything he had believed Then suddenly he crossed the drawing room and opened one of the French windows which led to the piazza The rain was driving underneath the shelter of the roof but he faced it and ran toward the door The girl was lying in front of it and above the noise of the wind and rain he heard her sobbing wildly He stood for a minute hesitating then he bent down and touched her Lady he said She started Who are you she cried I m just one of the servants ma am She caught her breath Did he send you she demanded No said he I came to help you I don t need any help Let me be But you can t stay here in the rain he protested You ll catch your death I want to die she answered What have I to live for Samuel stood for a moment perplexed Then as he touched her wet clothing again common sense asserted itself You mustn t stay here he said You mustn t But she only went on weeping He s cast me off she exclaimed My God what shall I do Samuel turned and ran into the house again and got an umbrella in the hall Then he took the girl by the arm and half lifted her Come he said Please But where shall I go she asked I know some one in the town who ll help you he said You can t stay here you ll catch cold What s there left for me she moaned What am I good for He s thrown me over and I can t live without him Samuel got the umbrella up and held it with one hand then with his other arm about the girl s waist he half carried her down the piazza steps That she devil was after him she was saying And it was Jack Holliday set her at it damn his soul I ll pay him for it She poured forth a stream of wild invective Please stop pleaded Samuel People will hear you What do I care if they do hear me Let them put me in jail that s all I m fit for I m drunk and I m good for nothing and he s tired of me So she rushed on all the way toward town Then as they came to the bridge she stopped and looked about Where are you taking me she asked To a friend s house he said having in mind the Stedmans No she replied I don t want to see anyone Take me to some hotel can t you There s one down the street here he said I don t know anything about it I don t care Any place The rain had slackened and she stopped and gathered up her wet and straggled hair There was a bar underneath the hotel and a flight of stairs led up to the office They went up and a man sitting behind the desk stared at them I want to get a room for this lady said Samuel She s been caught in the rain Is she your wife asked the man Mercy no said he startled Do you want a room too No no I m going away Oh said the man and took down a key Register please Samuel took the pen and then turned to the girl I beg pardon he said but I don t know your name Mary Smith she answered and Samuel stared at her in surprise Mary Smith she repeated and he wrote it down obediently The man took them upstairs and Samuel after helping the girl to a chair shut the door and stood waiting And she flung herself down upon the bed and burst into a paroxysm of weeping Samuel had never even heard the word hysterics and it was terrifying to him to see her he could not have believed that so frail and slender a human body could survive so frightful a storm of emotion Oh please please stop he cried wildly I can t live without him she wailed again and again I can t live without him What am I going to do Samuel s heart was wrung He went to the girl and put his hand upon her arm Listen to me he said earnestly Let me try to help you What can you do she demanded I ll go and see him I ll plead with him perhaps he ll listen to me All right she cried Anything Tell him I ll kill myself I ll kill him and Dolly both before I ll ever let her have him Yes I mean it He swore to me he d never leave me And I believed him I trusted him And Samuel clenched his hands with sudden resolution I ll see him about it he said I ll see him to night And leaving the other still shaking with sobs he turned and left the room He stopped in the office to tell the man that he was going But there was nobody there and after hesitating a moment he went on The storm was over and the moon was out with scud of clouds flying past Samuel strode back to Fairview with his hands gripped tightly and a blaze of resolution in his soul He was just in time to see the automobile at the door and the company taking their departure They passed him singing hilariously and then he found himself confronting his young master Who s that exclaimed Bertie startled It s me sir said Samuel Oh Samuel What are you doing here I ve been with the young lady sir Oh So that s what became of her I took her to a hotel sir Humph said Bertie I m obliged to you The piazza lights were turned up and by them Samuel could see the other s face flushed with drink and his hair and clothing in disarray He swayed slightly as he stood there Master Albert said Samuel very gravely May I have a few words with you Sure said Bertie He looked about him for a chair and sank into it

none	none	he asked It s the young lady Master Albert What about her She s very much distressed sir I dare say She ll get over it Samuel Master Albert exclaimed the boy you ve not treated her fairly The other stared at him The devil he exclaimed You must not desert her sir It would be a terrible thing to have on your conscience You have ruined and betrayed her WHAT cried the other and gazed at him in amazement Did she give you that kind of a jolly She didn t go into particulars said the boy My dear fellow laughed Bertie Why I ve been the making of that girl She was an eighteen dollar a week chorus girl when I took her up That might be Master Albert But if she was an honest girl Nonsense Samuel forget it She d had three or four lovers before she ever laid eyes on me There was a pause while the boy strove to get these facts into his mind Even so he said you can t desert her and let her starve Master Albert Oh stuff said the other What put that into your head I ll give her all the money she needs if that s what s troubling her Did she say that N no admitted Samuel disconcerted But Master Albert she loves you Yes I know said Bertie and that s where the trouble comes in She wants to keep me in a glass case and I ve got tired of it He paused for a moment and then a sudden idea flashed over him Samuel he exclaimed Why don t you marry her Samuel started in amazement What he gasped It s the very thing cried Bertie I ll set you up in a little business and you can have an easy time Master Albert panted the boy shocked to the depths of his soul She s beautiful Samuel you know she is And she s a fine girl too only a little wild I believe you d be just the man to hold her in Bertie paused a moment and then seeing that the other was unconvinced he added with a laugh Wait till you ve known her a bit Maybe you ll fall in love with her But Samuel only shook his head Master Albert he said in a low voice I m afraid you ve not understood the reason I ve come to you How do you mean This all this business sir it s shocked me more than I can tell you I came here to serve you sir You don t know how I felt about it I was ready to do anything I was so grateful for a chance to be near you You were rich and great and everything about you was so beautiful I thought you must be noble and good to have deserved so much And now instead I find you are a wicked man The other sat up The dickens he exclaimed And it s a terrible thing to me went on Samuel I don t know just what to make of it See here Samuel demanded the other angrily Who sent you here to lecture me I don t see how it can be the boy exclaimed You are one of the fit people as Professor Stewart explained it to me and yet I know some who are better than you and who have nothing at all And Bertie Lockman after another stare into the boy s solemn eyes sank back in his chair and burst into laughter Look here Samuel he exclaimed You aren t playing the game How do you mean sir If I m one of the fit ones what right have you got to preach at me Samuel was startled Why sir he stammered Just look went on Bertie I m the master and you re the servant I have breeding and culture everything and you re just a country bumpkin And yet you presume to set your ideas up against mine You presume to judge me and tell me what I ought to do Samuel was taken aback by this He could not think what to reply Don t you see went on Bertie following up his advantage If you really believe what you say you ought to submit yourself to me If I say a thing s right that makes it right If I had to come to you to have you approve it wouldn t that make you the master and me the servant No no Master Albert protested Samuel I didn t mean quite that Why I might just as well give you my money and be done with it insisted the other Then you could fix everything up to suit yourself That isn t what I mean at all cried the boy in great distress I don t know how to answer you sir but there s a wrong in it But where How Master Albert blurted Samuel it can t be right for you to get drunk Bertie s face clouded It can t be right sir repeated Samuel And suddenly the other sat forward in his chair All right he said Maybe it isn t But what are you going to do about it There was anger in his voice and Samuel was frightened into silence There was a pause while they stared at each other I m on top exclaimed Bertie I m on top and I m going to stay on top don t you see The game s in my hands and if I please to get drunk I get drunk And you will take your orders and mind your own business And what have you to say to that I presume sir said Samuel his voice almost a whisper I can leave your service Yes said the other and then either you ll starve or else you ll go to somebody else who has money and ask him to give you a job And then you ll take your orders from him and keep your opinions to yourself Don t you see Yes said Samuel lowering his eyes I see All right said Bertie and he rose unsteadily to his feet Now if you please said he you ll go back to Belle wherever you ve left her and take her a message for me Yes sir said Samuel Tell her I m through with her and I don t want to see her again I ll have a couple of hundred dollars a month sent to her so long as she lets me alone If she writes to me or bothers me in any way she ll get nothing And that s all Yes sir said Samuel And as for you this was all right for a joke but it wouldn t bear repeating From now on you re the gardener s boy and you ll not forget your place again Yes sir said Samuel once more and stood watching while his young master went into the house Then he turned and went down the road half dazed Those had been sledge hammer blows and they had landed full and hard They had left him without a shred of all his illusions His work that he had been so proud of he hated it and everything associated with it And he was overwhelmed with perplexity and pain just as before when he had found himself in jail and it had dawned upon him that the Law an institution which he had revered might be no such august thing at all but an instrument of injustice and oppression In that mood he came to the hotel Again there was no one in the office so he went directly to the room and knocked There was no answer he knocked again more heavily I wonder if she s gone he thought and looked again at the number to make sure he was at the right room Then timidly he tried the door It opened Lady he said and then louder Lady There was no response and he went in Could she be asleep he thought No that was not likely He listened for her breathing There was not a sound And finally he went to the bed and put his hand upon it Then he started back with a cry of terror He had touched something warm and moist and sticky He rushed out into the hall and as he looked at his hand he nearly fainted It was a mass of blood Help Help the boy screamed and he turned and rushed down the stairs into the office The proprietor came running in Look shouted Samuel Look what she s done Good God cried the man And he rushed upstairs the other following With trembling fingers the man lit the gas and Samuel took one look and then turned away and caught at a table sick with horror The girl was lying in the midst of a pool of blood and across her throat from ear to ear was a great gaping slit Oh oh gasped Samuel and then I can t stand it And holding out one hand from him he hid his face with the other Meantime the proprietor was staring at him See here young fellow he said What is it asked Samuel When did you find out about this Why just now When I came in You ve been out Why of course I went out just after we came I didn t see you No I stopped in the office but you weren t there Humph said the man maybe you did and maybe you didn t You can tell it to the police The police echoed Samuel and then in sudden horror Do you think I did it I don t know anything about it replied the other I only know you brought her here and that you ll stay here till the police come By this time several people had come into the room awakened by the noise Samuel without a word more went and sank down into a chair and waited And half an hour later he was on his way to the station house again this time with a policeman on either side of him and gripping him very tightly And now the charge against him was murder CHAPTER XIII The same corpulent official was seated behind the desk at the police station but on this occasion he woke up promptly The chief had better handle this he said and went to the telephone Where s this chap to go asked one of the policemen We re full up said the sergeant Put him in with Charlie Swift The chief ll be over in a few minutes So once more Samuel was led into a cell and heard the door clang upon him He was really not much alarmed this time for he knew it was not his fault and that he could prove it But he was sick with horror at the fate of the unhappy girl He began pacing back and forth in his cell Then suddenly from one corner growled a voice Say when are you going to get quiet Oh I beg pardon said Samuel I didn t know you were here What are you in for asked the voice For murder said Samuel And he heard the cot give a sudden creak as the man sat up What he gasped I didn t do it the boy explained hastily She killed herself Where was this asked the man At the Continental Hotel And what did you have to do with it I took her there Who was she Why she called herself Mary Smith Where did you meet her Up at Fairview At Fairview exclaimed the other Yes said Samuel The Lockman place ALBERT Lockman s place Yes How did she come to be there Why she was a friend of his She was there to dinner What gasped the man How do you know it I work there replied Samuel And how did she come to go to the hotel Master Albert turned her out said Samuel And it was raining and so I took her to a hotel For the love of God exclaimed the other and then he asked quickly Did you tell the sergeant that No said the boy He didn t ask me anything The man sprang up and ran to the grated door and shook it Hello Hello there he cried What s the matter growled a policeman down the corridor Come here quick cried the other and then through the grating he whispered Say tell the cap to come here for a moment will you What do you want demanded the policeman Look here O Brien said the other You know Charlie Swift is no fool And there s something about this fellow you ve put in here that the cap ought to know about quick The sergeant came Say said Charlie Did you ask this boy any questions No said the sergeant I m waiting for the chief Well did you know that girl came from Albert Lockman s place Good God no He says she was there to dinner and Lockman turned her out of the house This boy says he works for Lockman Well I m damned exclaimed the sergeant And so Samuel was led into a private room A minute or two later the chief strode in McCullagh was his name and he was huge and burly with a red face and a protruding jaw He went at Samuel as if he meant to strike him What s this you re givin us he cried Why why stammered Samuel in alarm You re tryin to tell me that girl came from Lockman s roared the chief Yes sir And you expect me to believe that It s true sir What re you tryin to give me anyhow demanded the man But it s true sir declared Samuel again You tell me she was there at dinner Yes sir Come Quit your nonsense boy But she was sir What do you expect to make out of this young fellow But she was sir Apparently the chief s method was to doubt every statement that Samuel made and repeat his incredulity three times each time in a louder tone of voice and with a more ferocious expression of countenance Then if the boy stuck it out he concluded that he was telling the truth By this exhausting method the examination reached its end and Samuel was led back to his cell Did you stick to your story asked his cellmate Of course said he Well if it is true remarked the other there ll be something doing soon And there was About an hour later the sergeant came again and entered He drew the two men into a corner See here young fellow he said to Samuel in a low voice Have you got anything against young Lockman No replied Samuel Why If we let you go will you shut up about this Why yes said the boy if you want me to All right said the sergeant And you Charlie we ve got you dead you know Yes said the other I know And there s ten years coming to you you understand Yes I guess so All right Then will you call it a bargain I will said Charlie You ll skip the town and hold your mouth I will Very well Here s your own kit and you ought to get through them bars before daylight And here s fifty dollars You take this young fellow to New York and lose him Do you see I see said Charlie All right went on the sergeant And mind you don t play any monkey tricks I m on said Charlie with a chuckle And without more ado he selected a saw from his bag and set to work at the bars of the window The sergeant retired and Samuel sat down on the floor and gasped for breath For about an hour the man worked without a word Then he braced himself against the wall and wrenched out one of the bars then another wrench and another bar gave way after which he packed up his kit and slipped it into a pocket under his coat Now he said come on He slipped through the opening and dropped to the ground and Samuel followed suit This way he whispered and they darted down an alley and came out upon a dark street For perhaps a mile they walked on in silence then Charlie turned into a doorway and opened the door with a latch key and they went up two flights of stairs and into a rear room He lit the gas and took off his coat and flung it on the bed Now make yourself at home he said Is this your room asked Samuel Yes was the reply The bulls haven t found it either But I thought we were to go out of town exclaimed the other Humph laughed Charlie Young fellow you re easy Do you mean you re not going cried Samuel What When I ve got a free license to work the town Samuel stared at him amazed You mean they wouldn t arrest you Not for anything short of murder I think But but what could you do Just suppose I was to tip off some newspaper with that story Not here in Lockmanville but the New York Howler we ll say I see gasped Samuel Charlie had tilted back in his chair and was proceeding to fill his pipe Gee sonny he said they did me the greatest turn of my life when they poked you into that cell I ll get what s coming to me now How will you get it asked the boy I m a gopherman said the other What s that asked Samuel You ll have to learn to sling the lingo said Charlie with a laugh It s what you call a burglar Samuel looked at the man in wonder He was tall and lean with a pale face and restless dark eyes He had a prominent nose and a long neck which gave him a peculiar alert expression that reminded Samuel of a startled partridge Scares you hey he said Well I wasn t always a gopherman What were you before that I was an inventor An inventor exclaimed Samuel Yes Have you seen the glass blowing machines here in town No I haven t Well I invented three of them And old Henry Lockman robbed me of them Robbed you gasped the boy amazed Yes said the other Didn t he rob everybody he ever came near I didn t know it replied Samuel Guess you never came near him laughed the man Say where do you come from anyhow Tell me about yourself So Samuel began at the beginning and told his story Pretty soon he came to the episode of Glass Bottle Securities My God exclaimed the other I thought you said old Lockman had never robbed you I did answered Samuel But don t you see that he robbed you then Why no It wasn t his fault The stock went down when he died But why should it have gone down when he died except that he d unloaded it on the public for a lot more than it was worth Samuel s jaw fell I never thought of that he said Go on said Charlie Then Samuel told how he was starving and how he had gone to Professor Stewart and how the professor had told him he was one of the unfit His companion had taken his pipe out of his mouth and was staring at him And you swallowed all that he gasped Yes said Samuel And you tried to carry it out You went away to starve But what else was there for me to do asked the boy But the Lord ejaculated the other When it came time for ME to starve I can promise you I found something else to do Go on he said after a pause and Samuel told how he had saved young Lockman s life and what happened afterwards And so he was your dream exclaimed the other You were up against a brace game Sammy But how was I to know protested the boy You should read the papers That kid s been cutting didoes in the Tenderloin for a couple of years He wasn t worth the risking of your little finger to say nothing of your life It seems terrible said Samuel dismayed The trouble with you Sammy commented the other is that you re too good to live That s all there is to your unfitness You take old Lockman for instance What was all his fitness It was just that he was an old wolf I was raised in this town and my dad went to school with him He began by cheating his sisters out of their inheritance Then he foreclosed a mortgage on a glass factory and went into the business He was a skinflint and he made money they say he burned the plant down for the insurance but I don t know Anyway he had rivals and he made a crooked deal with some of the railroad people gave them stock you know and got rebates And he had some union leaders on his pay rolls and he called strikes on his rivals and when he d ruined them he bought them out for a song And when he had everything in his hands and got tired of paying high wages he fired some of the union men and forced a strike Then he brought in some strike breakers and hired some thugs to slug them and turned the police loose on the men and that was the end of the unions Meanwhile he d been running the politics of the town and he d given himself all the franchises there was nobody could do anything in Lockmanville unless he said so And finally when he d got the glass trade cornered he formed the Trust and issued stock for about five times what the plants had cost and dumped it on the market for suckers like you to buy And that s the way he made his millions that s the meaning of his palace and all the wonders you saw up there And now he s dead and all his fortune belongs to Master Albert who never did a stroke of work in his life and isn t fit enough to be a ten dollar a week clerk And you come along and lie down for him to walk on and the more nails he has in his boots the better you like it And there s the whole story for you Samuel had been listening awe stricken The abysmal depths of his ignorance and folly Now he s got his money said the other and he means to keep it So there are the bulls to slam you over the head if you bother him That s called the Law And then he hires some duffer to sit up and hand you out a lot of dope about your being unfit and that s called a College Don t you see Yes whispered Samuel I see His companion stabbed at him with his finger All that was wrong with you Sammy he said was that you swallowed the dope That s where your unfitness came in Why take his own argument Suppose you hadn t given up Suppose you d fought and won out Then you d have been as good as any of them wouldn t you Suppose for instance you d hit that son of a gun over the head with a poker and got away with his watch and his pocketbook then you d have been fitter than he wouldn t you Samuel had clutched at the arms of his chair and was staring with wide open eyes You never thought of that hey Sammy But that s what I found myself facing a few years ago They d got every cent I had and I was ready for the scrap heap But I said Nay nay Isabel I d played their game and lost but I made a new game and I made my own rules you can bet You mean stealing cried the boy I mean War replied the other And you see I ve survived I m not pretty to look at and I don t live in a palace but I m not starving and I ve got some provisions salted away But they had you in jail Of course I ve done my bit twice But that didn t kill me and I can learn things even in the pen There was a pause Then Charlie Swift stood up and shook the ashes out of his pipe Speaking of provisions he said these midnight adventures give you an appetite And he got out a box of crackers and some cheese and a pot of jam Move up he said and dip in You ll find that red stuff the real thing My best girl made it One of the things that bothered me in jail was the fear that the bulls might get it Samuel was too much excited to eat But he sat and watched while his companion stowed away crackers and cheese What am I going to do now he said half to himself You come with me said Charlie I ll teach you a trade where you ll be your own boss And I ll give you a quarter of the swag until you ve learned it What gasped Samuel in horror Be a burglar Sure said the other What else can you do I don t know said the boy Have you got any money Only a few pennies I hadn t got my wages yet I see And will you go and ask Master Albert for them No said Samuel quickly I ll never do that Then you ll go out and hunt for a job again I suppose Or will you start out on that starving scheme again Don t cried the boy wildly Let me think Come Don t be a summer boarder exclaimed the other You ve got the professor s own warrant for it haven t you And you ve got a free field before you you can help yourself to anything you want in Lockmanville and the bulls won t dare to lift a finger You ll be a fool if you let go of such a chance But it s wrong protested Samuel You know it s wrong Humph laughed Charlie And he shut the top of the cracker box with a bang and rose up You sleep over it he said You ll be hungry to morrow morning That won t make any difference cried the boy Maybe not commented the other and then he added with a grin Don t you ask me for grub For that would be charity and if you re really one of the unfit it s not for me to interfere with nature And so all the next day Samuel sat in Charlie s room and faced the crackers and cheese and the pot of jam and wrestled with the problem He knew what it would mean to partake of the food and Charlie knew what it would mean also and feeling certain that Samuel would not partake upon any other terms he left the covers off the food so that the odors might assail the boy s nostrils Of course Samuel might have gone out and bought some food with the few pennies he had in his pocket But that would have been merely to postpone the decision and what was the use of that And to make matters ten times worse he owed money to the Stedmans for he had lived upon the expectation of his salary In the end it was not so much hunger that moved him as it was pure reason For Samuel as we know was a person who took an idea seriously and there was no answer to be found to Charlie s argument Doubtless the reader will find a supply of them but Samuel racked his wits in vain If as the learned professor had said life is a struggle for existence and those who have put money in their purses are the victors and if they have nothing to do for the unemployed save to let them starve or put them in jail then on the other hand it would seem to be up to the unemployed to take measures for their own survival And apparently the only proof of their fitness would be to get some money away from those who had it Had not Herbert Spencer the authority in such matters stated that inability to catch prey shows a falling short of conduct from its ideal And if the good people let themselves be starved to death by the wicked would that not mean that only the wicked would be left alive It was thoughts like this that were driving Samuel he had Bertie Lockman s taunts ringing in his ears and for the life of him he could not see why he should vacate the earth in favor of Bertie Lockman So breakfast time passed and dinner time passed and supper time came And his friend spread out the contents of his larder again and then leaned over the table and said Come and try it once and see how you like it And Samuel clenched his hands suddenly and answered All right I ll try it Then he started upon a meal But in the middle of it he stopped and set down an untasted cracker and gasped within himself Merciful Heaven I ve promised to be a burglar The other was watching him narrowly Ain t going to back out he asked No said Samuel I won t back out But it seems a little queer that s all CHAPTER XIV The meal over Charlie Swift took out a pencil and paper Now said he To business Samuel pulled up his chair and the other drew a square This is a house I ve been studying It s on a corner these are streets and here s an alley This is the side door that I think I can open There s a door here and one in back here Fix all that in your mind I have it said the boy You go in and here s the entrance hall The front stairs are here What I m after is the family plate and it s up on the second floor I ll attend to that The only trouble is that over here beyond the library there s a door and somebody sleeps in that room I don t know who it is But I want you to stay in the hall and if there s anyone stirs in that room you re to dart upstairs and give one whistle at the top Then I ll come And what then This is the second floor said Charlie drawing another square And here s the servant s stairway and we can get down to this entrance in the rear that I ll open before I set to work On the other hand if you hear me whistle upstairs then you re to get out by the way we came If there s any alarm given then it s each for himself I see said Samuel and gripped his hands so that his companion might not see how he was quaking Charlie got out his kit and examined it to make sure that the police had kept nothing Then he went to a bureau drawer and got a revolver examined it and slipped it into his pocket They kept my best one he said So I ve none to lend you I I wouldn t take it anyway stammered the other in horror You ll learn said the burglar with a smile Then he sat down again and drew a diagram of the streets of Lockmanville so that Samuel could find his way back in case of trouble We don t want to take any chances said he And mind if I get caught I ll not mention you wild horses couldn t drag it out of me And you make the same promise I make it said Samuel Man to man said Charlie solemnly and Samuel repeated the words How did you come to know so much about the house he asked after a while Oh I ve lived here and I ve kept my eyes open I worked as a plumber s man for a couple of months and I made diagrams But don t the police get to know you Yes they know me But I skip out when I ve done a job And when I come back it s in disguise Once I grew a beard and worked in the glass works all day and did my jobs at night and again I lived here as a woman A woman gasped the boy You see said the other with a laugh there s more ways than one to prove your fitness And he went on narrating some of his adventures adventures calculated to throw the glamour of romance about the trade of burglar Samuel listened breathless with wonder We d better get a bit of sleep now said Charlie later on We ll start about one And he stretched himself out on the bed while the other sat motionless in the chair pondering hard over his problem There was no sleeping for Samuel that night He would carry out his bargain that was his decision But he would not take his share of the plunder except just enough to pay missus Stedman And he would never be a burglar again At one o clock he awakened his companion and they set out through the deserted streets They crossed the bridge to the residential part of town and then at a corner Charlie stopped There s the place he said pointing to a large house set back within a garden They gazed about The coast was clear and they darted into the door which had been indicated in the diagram Samuel crouched in the doorway motionless while the other worked at the lock Samuel s knees were trembling so that he could hardly stand up The door was opened without a sound having been made and they stole into the entrance They listened the house was as still as death Then Charlie flashed his lantern and Samuel had quick glimpses of a beautiful and luxuriously furnished house It was nothing like Fairview of course but it was finer than Professor Stewart s home There was a library with great leather armchairs and in the rear a dining room where mirrors and cut glass flashed back the far off glimmer of the light There s your door over there whispered Charlie And you d better stay behind those curtains So Samuel took up his post the light vanished and his companion started for the floor above Several times the boy heard the stairs creaking and his heart leaped into his throat but then the sounds ceased and all was still The minutes crawled by each one seemed an age He stood rooted to the spot staring into the darkness half hypnotized by the thought of the door which he could not see and of the person who might be asleep behind it Surely this was a ghastly way for a man to have to gain his living it were better to perish than to survive by such an ordeal Samuel was appalled by the terrors which took possession of him and the tremblings and quiverings which he could not control Any danger in the world he would have faced for conscience sake but this was wrong he knew it was wrong And so all the glow of conviction was gone from him What could be the matter Why should Charlie be so long Surely he had had time enough to ransack the whole house Could it be that he had got out by the other way that he had planned to skip town and leave Samuel there in the lurch And then again came a faint creaking upon the stairs He was coming back Or could it by any chance be another person He dared not venture to whisper he stood tense with excitement while the sounds came nearer it was as if some monster were creeping upon him in the darkness and folding its tentacles about him He heard a sound in the hall beside him Why didn t Charlie speak What was the matter with him What And then suddenly came a snapping sound and a blinding glare of light flashed up flooding the hallway and everything about him Samuel staggered back appalled There was some one standing there before him He was caught Thus for one moment of dreadful horror And then he realized that the person confronting him was a little girl She was staring at him and he stared at her She could not have been more than ten years old and wore a nightgown trimmed with lace She had bright yellow hair and her finger was upon the button which controlled the lights For fully a minute neither of them moved Then Samuel heard a voice whispering Are you a burglar He could not speak but he nodded his head And then again he heard the child s voice Oh I m so glad I m so glad she repeated again and her tone was clear and sweet I d been praying for it But I d almost given up hope Samuel found voice enough to gasp Why My mamma read me a story said the child It was about a little girl who met a burglar And ever since I ve been waiting for one to come There was a pause Are you a really truly burglar the child whispered I I think so replied Samuel You look very young she said And the other bethought himself I m only a beginner he said This is really my first time Oh said the child with a faint touch of disappointment But still you will do won t you Do for what asked the boy in bewilderment You must let me reform you exclaimed the other That s what the little girl did in the story Will you Why why yes gasped Samuel I I really meant to reform Then suddenly he thought he heard a sound in the hall above He glanced up and for one instant he had a glimpse of the face of Charlie peering down at him What are you looking at asked the child I thought that is there s some one with me stammered Samuel forgetting his solemn vow Oh two burglars cried the child in delight And may I reform him too I think you d better begin with me said Samuel Will he go away do you think Yes I think he s gone now But you you won t go yet will you asked the child anxiously You ll stay and talk to me If you wish gasped the boy You aren t afraid of me she asked Not of you said he But if some one else should waken No you needn t think of that Mamma and grandma both lock their doors at night And papa s away Who sleeps there asked Samuel pointing to the door he had been watching That s papa s room said the child and the other gave a great gasp of relief Come said the little girl and she seated herself in one of the big leather armchairs Now she continued tell me how you came to be a burglar I had no money said Samuel and no work Oh exclaimed the child and then What is your work I lived on a farm all my life said he My father died and then I wanted to go to the city I was robbed of all my money and I was here without any friends and I couldn t find anything to do at all I was nearly starving Why how dreadful cried the other Why didn t you come to see papa Your father said he I didn t want to beg It wouldn t have been begging He d have been glad to help you I I didn t know about him said Samuel Why should he He helps everyone said the child That s his business How do you mean Don t you know who my father is she asked in surprise No said he I don t My father is doctor Vince she said and then she gazed at him with wide open eyes You ve never heard of him Never said Samuel He s a clergyman said the little girl A clergyman echoed Samuel aghast Somehow it seemed far worse to have been robbing a clergyman And he s so good and kind went on the other He loves everyone and tries to help them And if you had come to him and told him he d have found some work for you There are a great many people in Lockmanville out of work said Samuel gravely Oh but they don t come to my papa said the child You must come and let him help you You must promise me that you will But how can I I ve tried to rob him But that won t make any difference You don t know my papa If you should tell him that you had done wrong and that you were sorry you are sorry aren t you Yes I m very sorry Well then if you told him that he d forgive you he d do anything for you I know If he knew that I d helped to reform you he d be so glad I did help a little didn t I Yes said Samuel You helped You you weren t very hard to reform somehow said the child hesitatingly The little girl in the story had to talk a good deal more Are you sure that you are going to be good now Samuel could not keep back a smile Truly I will he said I guess you were brought up to be good reflected the other I don t think you were very bad anyway It must be very hard to be starving It is indeed said the boy with conviction I never heard of anyone starving before went on the other If that happened to people often there d be more burglars I guess There was a pause What is your name asked the little girl Mine is Ethel And now I ll tell you what we ll do My papa s on his way home his train gets here early in the morning And you come up after breakfast I ll make him wait for you And then you can tell it all to him and then you won t have any more troubles Will you do that You think he won t be angry with me asked Samuel No I m sure of it And he won t want to have me arrested Oh dear me exclaimed Ethel with an injured look Why my papa goes to see people in prison and tries to help them get out I ll promise you truly Very well said Samuel I ll come And so they parted And Samuel found himself out upon the street again with the open sky above him and a great hymn of relief and joy in his soul He was no longer a burglar CHAPTER XV Samuel walked the streets all that night For he fully meant to do what he had promised the child and he did not care to go back to Charlie Swift and face the latter s protests and ridicule At eight the next morning tired but happy he rang the bell of doctor Vince s house Ethel herself opened the door and at the sight of him her face lighted up with joy and she turned crying out Here he is And she ran halfway down the hall exclaiming He s come I told you he d come Papa A man appeared at the dining room door and stood staring at Samuel There he is papa cried Ethel beside herself with delight There s my burglar doctor Vince came down the hall He was a stockily built gentleman with a rather florid complexion and bushy beard Good morning he said Good morning sir said Samuel And are you really the young man who was here last night Yes sir said Samuel The worthy doctor was obviously disconcerted This is quite extraordinary he exclaimed Won t you come in They sat down in the library I don t want you to think sir said Samuel quickly that I come to beg Your little girl asked me Don t mention that said the other If the story you told Ethel is really true I should be only too glad to do anything that I could Thank you sir said Samuel And so you really broke into my house last night exclaimed the other Well well And it is the first time you have ever done anything of the sort in your life The very first said the boy But what could have put it into your head There was another person with me said Samuel you will understand that I would rather not talk about him I see said the other He led you to it Yes sir And you have never done anything dishonest before No sir You have never even been a thief No exclaimed Samuel indignantly The other noticed the tone of his voice But why did you begin now he asked I was persuaded that it was right said Samuel But how could that be Had you never been taught about stealing Yes sir replied the boy but it s not as simple as it seems I had met Professor Stewart Professor Stewart echoed the other Yes sir the professor at the college But what did he have to do with it Why sir he told me about the survival of the fittest and how I had to starve to death because I was one of the failures And then you see sir I met Master Albert Master Albert Albert Lockman sir And the professor had said that he was one of the fit and I saw that he got drunk sir and did other things that were very wicked and so it did not seem just right that I should starve I can see now that it was very foolish of me but I thought that I ought to fight and try to survive if I possibly could And then I met Char that is a bad man who offered to show me how to be a burglar The other had been listening in amazement Boy he said are you joking with me Joking echoed Samuel his eyes opening wide And then the doctor caught his breath and proceeded to question him He went back to the beginning and made Samuel lay bare the story of his whole life But when he got to the interview with Professor Stewart the other could contain himself no longer Samuel he exclaimed this is the most terrible thing I have ever heard in my life How do you mean sir You have been saved providentially saved as I firmly believe But you were hanging on the very verge of a life of evil and all because men in our colleges are permitted to teach these blasphemous and godless doctrines This is what they call science This is our modern enlightenment The doctor had risen and begun to pace the floor in his agitation I have always insisted that the consequence of such teaching would be the end of all morality And here we have the thing before our very eyes A young man of decent life is actually led to the commission of a crime as a consequence of the teachings of Herbert Spencer Samuel was listening in consternation Then it isn t true what Herbert Spencer says he exclaimed True cried the other Why Samuel don t you KNOW that it isn t true Weren t you brought up to read the Bible And do you read anything in the Bible about the struggle for existence Were you taught there that your sole duty was to fight with other men for your own selfish ends Was it not rather made clear to you that you were not to concern yourself with your own welfare at all but to struggle for the good of others and to suffer rather than do evil Why Samuel what would your father have said if he could have seen you last night his own dear son that he had brought up in the way of the Gospel Oh sir cried Samuel struck to the heart My boy exclaimed the other Our business in this world is not that we should survive but that the good should survive We are to live for it and to die for it if need be We are to love and serve others we are to be humble and patient to sacrifice ourselves freely The survival of the fittest Why Samuel the very idea is a denial of spirituality what are we that we should call ourselves fit To think that is to be exposed to all the base passions of the human heart to greed and jealousy and hate Such doctrines are the cause of all the wickedness of all the materialism of our time of crime and murder and war My boy do you read that Jesus went about worrying about His own survival and robbing others because they were less fit than He Only think how it would have been with you had you been called to face Him last night The shame of this was more than Samuel could bear Oh stop stop sir he cried and covered his face with his hands I see it all I have been very wicked Yes exclaimed the other You have been wicked The tears were welling into Samuel s eyes I can t see how I did it sir he whispered I have been blind I have been lost I am a strayed sheep And then suddenly his emotion overcame him and he burst into a paroxysm of weeping I can t believe it of myself he exclaimed again and again I have been out of my senses The doctor watched him for a few moments Perhaps it was not altogether your fault he said more gently You have been led astray No no cried the boy I am bad I see it it must be I could never have been persuaded if I had not been bad It began at the very beginning I yielded to the first temptation when I stole a ride upon the train And everything else came from that it has been one long chain Let us be glad that it is no longer said doctor Vince and that you have come to the end of it Ah but have I cried the boy wildly Why not Surely you will no longer be led by such false teaching No sir But see what I have done Why I am liable to be sent to jail for I don t know how long You mean for last night asked the doctor But no one will ever know about that You may start again and live a true life Ah cried Samuel but the memory of it will haunt me I can never forgive myself We are very fortunate said the other gravely if we have only a few things in our lives that we cannot forget and that we cannot forgive ourselves The worthy doctor had been anticipating a long struggle to bring the young criminal to see the error of his ways but instead he found that he had to use his skill in casuistry to convince the boy that he was not hopelessly sullied And when at last Samuel had been persuaded that he might take up his life again there was nothing that would satisfy him save to go back where he had been before and take up that struggle with starvation I must prove that I can conquer he said I yielded to the temptation once and now I must face it But Samuel protested the doctor it is no man s duty to starve You must let me help you and find some useful work for you and some people who will be your friends Don t think I am ungrateful cried the boy but why should I be favored There are so many others starving right here in this town And if I am going to love them and serve them why should I have more than they have Wouldn t that be selfish of me Why sir I d be making profit out of my repentance I don t quite see that said the other Why sir Isn t it just because I ve been so sorry that you are willing to help me There are so many others who have not been helped some I know sir that need it far more than I do and have deserved it more too It seems to me my boy that is being too hard upon yourself and on me I cannot relieve all the distress in the world I relieve what I find out about And so I must help you And don t you see that I wish to keep you near me so that I can watch after your welfare And perhaps who knows you can help me The harvest is plenty you have heard and the laborers are few There are many ways in which you could be of service in my church Ah sir cried Samuel overwhelmed with gratitude if you put it that way I put it that way most certainly said doctor Vince You have seen a new light you wish to live a new life Stay here and live it in Lockmanville there is no place in the world where it could be more needed All this while the little girl had been sitting in silence drinking in the conversation Now suddenly she rose and came to Samuel putting her hand in his Please stay she said And Samuel answered Very well I ll stay So then they fell to discussing his future and what doctor Vince was going to do for him The good doctor was inwardly more perplexed about it than he cared to let Samuel know I ll ask mister Wygant he said perhaps he can find you a place in one of his factories mister Wygant echoed Samuel You mean Miss Gladys s father Yes said the doctor Do you know Miss Gladys I have met her two or three times said the boy They are parishioners of mine remarked the other And Samuel gave a start Why he exclaimed Then you you must be the rector of saint Matthew s Yes was the reply Didn t you know that The boy was a little awed He had seen the great brownstone temple upon the hill a structure far more splendid than anything he had ever dreamed of Have you never attended asked the doctor I went to the mission once said Samuel referring to the little chapel in the poor quarters of the town A friend of mine goes there Sophie Stedman She works in mister Wygant s cotton mill I should be glad to have you come to the church said the other I d like to very much replied the boy I didn t know exactly if I ought to you know I am sorry you got that impression said doctor Vince The church holds out its arms to everyone Well began Samuel apologetically I knew that all the rich people went to saint Matthew s The church does not belong to the rich people put in the doctor very gravely the church belongs to the Lord And so Samuel overflowing with gratitude and happiness joined saint Matthew s forthwith and all the while in the deeps of his soul a voice was whispering to him that it was Miss Gladys church also And he would see his divinity again CHAPTER XVI Samuel went back in great excitement to the Stedmans to tell them of his good fortune And the family sat about in a circle and listened to the recital in open eyed amazement It was a wonderful thing to have an adventurer like Samuel in one s house But the boy noticed that Sophie did not seem as much excited as he had anticipated She sat with her head resting in her hands And when the others had left the room Oh Samuel she said I feel so badly to day I don t see how I m going to go on Listen Sophie he said quickly That s one of the first things I thought about I can give you a chance now How do you mean I can get doctor Vince to help you find some better work Did he say he would asked the child No was the reply but he is so good to everyone And all the rich people go to his church you know He said he wanted me to help him so I shall find out things like that for him to do And Samuel went on pouring out his praises of the kind and gentle clergyman and striving to interest Sophie by his pictures of the new world that was to open before her I m going to see him again to morrow he said Then you ll see Samuel announced the doctor when he called the next morning I have found a chance for you And Samuel s heart gave a great leap of joy It appeared that the sexton of saint Matthew s was growing old They did not wish to change but there must be some one to help him The pay would not be high but he would have a chance to work in the church and to be near his benefactor The tears of gratitude started into his eyes as he heard this wonderful piece of news I ll see more of Miss Gladys the voice within him was whispering eagerly Doctor he said after a pause I ve some good news for you also What is it asked the other It s a chance for you to help some one Oh said the doctor It s little Sophie Stedman said Samuel and he went on to tell how he had met the widow and about her long struggle with starvation and then of Sophie s experiences in the cotton mill But what do you want me to do asked the other with a troubled look Why said Samuel we must save her We must find her some work that will not kill her But Samuel protested the other There are so many in her position and how can I help it But doctor She can t stand it I know my boy It is a terrible thing to think of Still I can t undertake to find work for everyone But she will die cried the boy Truly it is killing her And doctor she has never had a chance in all her life Only think how would you feel if Ethel had to work in a cotton mill There was a pause I honestly can t see began the bewildered clergyman It will be quite easy for you to help her put in the boy because you see mister Wygant belongs to your church But what has that to do with it Why it s mister Wygant s mill that she works in Yes said the doctor But I Surely exclaimed Samuel you don t mean that he wouldn t want to know about it Ahem said the other and again there was a pause It was broken by Ethel who had come in and was listening to the conversation Papa she exclaimed wouldn t Miss Gladys be the one to ask Samuel gave a start The very thing he said And doctor Vince after pondering for a moment admitted that it might be a good idea You will come to church with me to morrow said Ethel And if she is there we ll ask her And so Samuel was on hand trembling with excitement and painfully conscious of his green and purple necktie He sat in the Vince s pew at Ethel s invitation and directly across the aisle was Miss Wygant miraculously resplendent in a springtime costume yet with a touch of primness becoming to the Sabbath She did not see her adorer until after the service when they met face to face Why Samuel she exclaimed You are here Yes Miss Gladys he said I m to work in the church now You don t tell me she responded I m to help the sexton he added And he belongs to the church too put in little Ethel And oh Miss Gladys won t you please let him tell you about Sophie About Sophie said the other She s a little girl who works in your papa s mill Miss Gladys And her family s very poor and she is sick and Samuel says she may die Why that s too bad exclaimed Miss Gladys Tell me about her Samuel And Samuel told the story At the end a sudden inspiration came to him and he mentioned how Sophie had received her Christmas present from Miss Gladys and how she had kept her pictures in her room And of course Miss Wygant was touched I will see what I can do for her she said What would you suggest I thought said he boldly that maybe there might be some place for her at your home That would make her so happy you know I will see said the other Will you bring her to see me to morrow Samuel I will said he and then he chanced to look into her face and he caught again that piercing gaze which made the blood leap into his cheeks and the strange and terrible emotions to stir in him He turned his eyes away again and his knees were trembling as he passed on down the aisle He stood and watched Miss Gladys enter her motor Then he bade good by to Ethel and her mother and hurried back into the vestry room to tell doctor Vince of his good fortune The good doctor had just slipped out of his vestments and was putting on his cuffs I am so glad to hear it he said It was the very thing to do Yes said Samuel And doctor I ve thought of something else What is that Samuel I ll have to have a minute or two to tell you about it I m just going to dinner now began the doctor I ll walk with you if I may said Samuel It s really very important All right responded the doctor in some trepidation I thought of this in the middle of the night explained the boy when they had started down the street It kept me awake for hours doctor Vince I think we ought to convert Master Albert Lockman Convert him echoed the other perplexed Yes sir said the boy He is leading a wild life and he s in a very bad way Yes Samuel said the clergyman It is terrible I know We must labor with him exclaimed Samuel He must not be allowed to go on like that Unfortunately said doctor Vince hastily it wouldn t do for me to try it You see the Lockmans have always been Presbyterians and so Bertie is under doctor Handy s care But is doctor Handy doing anything about it persisted the other I really don t know Samuel Because if he isn t we ought to doctor Vince Something must be done My boy said the doctor perhaps it wouldn t be easy for you to understand it But there is a feeling would it be quite good taste for me to try to take away a very rich parishioner from another church But what have his riches to do with it asked the boy Unfortunately Samuel it costs money to build churches and most clergymen are dependent upon their salaries you know The good doctor was trying to make a jest of it but Samuel was in deadly earnest I hope he said that you are not dependent upon the money of anyone like Master Albert Um no said the doctor quickly Understand me please went on the other It s not simply that Master Albert is wrecking his own life I suppose that s his right if he wants to But it s what he can do to other people It s his money doctor Vince Just think of it he has seven hundred thousand dollars a year And he never earned a cent of it and he doesn t know what to do with it Doctor you KNOW that isn t right No said the clergyman it s very wrong indeed But what can you do about it I don t know doctor I haven t had time to think about it I ve only just begun to realize it But I thought if somebody like yourself some one he respects could point it out to him he might use his money to some good purpose If he won t why then he ought to give it up The other smiled I m afraid Samuel he d hardly do that But doctor things can t go on as they are Right here in this town are people dying of starvation And he has seven hundred thousand dollars a year Can that continue No I trust not my boy It will be better some day But it must be left to evolution Evolution echoed Samuel perplexed Do you believe in evolution Why said the other embarrassed what I mean is that there are vast social forces at work great changes taking place But they move very slowly But why do they move so slowly objected the boy Isn t it just because so many people don t care Why Samuel If everyone would take an interest in them then they would happen quickly The two walked on for a minute in silence Finally the clergyman remarked Samuel you take a great interest in social questions Yes sir said the boy You see I have been down at the bottom and I know how it feels Nobody else can possibly understand not even you sir with all your kind heart You don t know what it means sir you don t know what it means Perhaps not my boy said the other But my conscience is far from easy I assure you The only thing is we must not be too impatient we must learn to wait But doctor exclaimed Samuel Will the people wait to starve That question was a poser and perhaps it was just as well that doctor Vince was nearing the steps of his home I must go in now Samuel he said But we will talk about these questions another time Yes sir said Samuel we will And the other glanced at him quickly But the boy s face wore its old look of guileless eagerness CHAPTER XVII Samuel walked away still pondering at the problem Something must be done about Master Albert that was certain Before he went in to his dinner he had thought of yet another plan He would appeal to Miss Gladys about it He would get her to labor with the prodigal At eight o clock the next morning he and Sophie called at Miss Wygant s home They went to the servants entrance and the maid who opened the door sent them away saying that Miss Gladys never rose until ten o clock and would not see anyone until eleven So they went home again and came at eleven and they were taken to a sitting room upon the second floor and there Miss Gladys met them clad in a morning gown of crimson silk And so this is Sophie she exclaimed Why you poor poor child And she gazed at the little mill girl with her stunted figure and pinched cheeks and her patched and threadbare dress and Sophie in her turn gazed at the wonderful princess tall and stately glowing with health and voluptuous beauty And you work in our cotton mill she cried How perfectly terrible And do you mean to tell me that this child is thirteen years old Samuel Yes Miss Gladys said he She turned quickly and pressed a button on the wall Send missus Harris here she said to the man who answered missus Harris is our housekeeper she added to Samuel I will consult her about it The consulting was very brief missus Harris this is Sophie Stedman a little girl I want to help I don t know what she can do but you will find out I want her to have some sort of a place in the house and it mustn t be hard work But Miss Gladys said the other in perplexity I don t know of anything at all You can find something was the young lady s reply I want her to have a chance to learn Take her downstairs and have a talk with her about it Yes Miss Gladys said missus Harris and so Samuel was left alone with his goddess He sat with his eyes upon the floor He was just about to open the great subject he had in his mind when suddenly Miss Gladys herself brought it up Samuel she asked why did you leave my cousin s Samuel hesitated I I don t like to say Miss Gladys Please tell me she insisted I left it he replied in a low voice because I found that he got drunk Oh said the girl when was this It was last Wednesday night Miss Gladys Tell me all about it Samuel I I don t like to he stammered It s not a story to tell to a lady I already know something about it from my maid said she Jack Holliday was there wasn t he Yes ma am And some women Yes ma am How many Samuel Four Miss Gladys Tell me about them Samuel What sort of women were they It was very hard for Samuel to answer these questions He blushed as he talked but Miss Gladys appeared not at all disconcerted in fact she was greedy for the details You say her name was Belle I wonder if it was that girl from The Maids of Mandelay Was she a dancer Samuel I don t know Miss Gladys And what became of her I took her to a hotel Miss Gladys And what then Samuel stopped short I really couldn t tell you he said But why not Because I promised Whom did you promise I promised the sergeant Miss Gladys The sergeant A policeman you mean Yes ma am But what what did the police have to do with it They took me to jail Miss Gladys They thought that I did it Did what And again the boy shut his lips Listen Samuel pleaded the other You know that I am Bertie s cousin And he s all alone And I m responsible for him Oh Miss Gladys cried the boy If you only would try to help him I meant to ask you But how can I help him if you keep me in ignorance And so Samuel blurted out the whole story And Miss Gladys sat dumb with horror She killed herself She killed herself she gasped again and again Yes Miss Gladys said Samuel And it was awful You can t imagine it I read of the suicide in the paper But I never dreamed of Bertie There was a moment s pause It must be a dreadful thing for him to have on his conscience began the boy He must have been frightened to death said she And then she added quickly Samuel you haven t told anyone about this Not a soul Miss Gladys You are sure I m sure ma am You didn t tell doctor Vince I just told him that I had left because Master Albert got drunk Miss Gladys That was the truth Yes said she and then You always tell the truth don t you Samuel I try to he replied You are very good aren t you she added Samuel blushed No he said gravely I m not good at all The other looked at him for a moment and then a smile crossed her face I ve heard a saying she remarked Be good and you ll be happy but you ll miss a lot of fun Samuel pondered I think that is a very terrible saying he declared earnestly Miss Gladys laughed And she went on to cross question him as to the suicide satisfying her curiosity as to the last hideous detail Then she looked at Samuel and asked suddenly Why do you wear that hideous thing Samuel started What thing he asked That tie Why he said I got that specially He stopped embarrassed and the other s peal of laughter rang through the room Take it off she said She got up and came to him saying I couldn t stand it With trembling fingers he removed the tie And she took off the beautiful red ribbon that was tied about her waist and cut it to the right length Put that on she said and I ll show you how to tie it And Samuel stood there rapt in a sudden nightmare ecstasy She was close to him her quick fingers were playing about his throat Her breath was upon his face and the intoxicating perfume of her filled his nostrils The blood mounted into his face and the veins stood out upon his forehead and strange and monstrous things stirred in the depths of him There she said that s better and stepped back to admire the result She smiled upon him radiantly You have no taste Samuel she said I shall have to educate you Yes Miss Gladys he responded in a low voice And listen she went on you will come to see Sophie now and then won t you Yes yes he said quickly And come some time when I am here He caught his breath and gripped his hands and answered yet again Yes Don t be afraid of me added the girl gently You don t appreciate yourself half enough Samuel Then there came voices in the hall and Miss Gladys turned and the housekeeper and Sophie came in Well she asked She doesn t know anything at all said missus Harris But if you want her taught I suppose she could run errands and do sewing Very good said the other And pay her well Will you like that Sophie Yes Miss whispered the child in a faint voice She was gazing in awe and rapture at this peerless being and she could hardly find utterance for two words All right then said Miss Gladys that will do very well You come to morrow Sophie And good by Samuel I must go for my ride now Good by Miss Gladys said Samuel And please don t forget what you were going to say to Master Albert

none	none	 Samuel went home walking upon air He had found a place for himself and a place for Sophie And he had got the reforming of Bertie Lockman under way 
7939_120318_000002_000003	train-clean-360	Truly the church was a great institution the solution of all the puzzles and problems of life 
none	none	And fortunate was Samuel to be so close to the inner life of things Then suddenly on a street corner he stopped short A sign had caught his eye John Callahan Wines and Liquors Bernheimer Beer Do you know what that place is he said to Sophie That s where my friend Finnegan works Who s Finnegan asked the child He s the barkeeper who gave me something to eat when I first came to town He s a good man even if he is a barkeeper Samuel had often found himself thinking of Finnegan for it had been altogether against his idea of things that a man so obviously well meaning should be selling liquor And now suddenly a brilliant idea flashed across his mind 
7939_120318_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Why should he continue selling liquor 
none	none	And instantly Samuel saw a new duty before him 
7939_120318_000007_000004	train-clean-360	He must help Finnegan 
none	none	And forgetting that it was time for his dinner he bade good by to Sophie and went into the saloon Well young feller exclaimed the Irishman his face lighting up with pleasure and then seeing the boy s new collar and tie Gee you re moving up in the world I ve got a job said Samuel proudly
7939_120318_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 I m the assistant sexton at saint Matthew s Church 
none	none	You don t say Gone up with the sky pilots hey Samuel did not notice this irreverent remark He looked around the place and saw that they were alone Then he said very earnestly mister Finnegan may I have a few minutes talk with you Sure said Finnegan perplexed What is it It s something I ve been thinking about very often said Samuel You were so kind to me and I saw that you were a good hearted man And so it has always seemed to me too bad that you should be selling drink The other stared at him
7939_120318_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 Gee he said are you going to take me up in your airship 
none	none	mister Finnegan said the boy I wish you wouldn t make fun of me For I m talking to you out of the bottom of my heart And Samuel gazed with so much yearning in his eyes that the man was touched in spite of the absurdity of it Go on he said I ll listen It s just this said Samuel It s wrong to sell liquor 
7939_120318_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Think what drink does to men 
none	none	I saw a man drunk the other night and it led to what was almost murder 
7939_120318_000018_000004	train-clean-360	Drink makes men cruel and selfish 
7939_120318_000018_000005	train-clean-360	It takes away their self control 
7939_120318_000018_000006	train-clean-360	It makes them unfit for their work 
none	none	It leads to vice and wickedness It enslaves them and degrades them Don t you know that is true mister Finnegan Yes admitted Finnegan I reckon it is 
7939_120318_000019_000001	train-clean-360	I never touch the stuff myself 
none	none	And still you sell it to others Well my boy I don t do it because I hate them But then why DO you do it
7939_120318_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 I do it said Finnegan because I have to live 
none	none	It s my trade it s all I know
7939_120318_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 It seems such a terrible trade exclaimed the boy 
none	none	Maybe said the other
7939_120318_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 But take notice it ain t a princely one 
7939_120318_000025_000002	train-clean-360	I m on the job all day and a good part of the night and standing up all the time 
none	none	And I don t get no holidays either and I only get twelve a week And I ve a wife and a new baby 
7939_120318_000025_000004	train-clean-360	So what s a man to do 
none	none	Now strange as it may seem this unfolded a new view to Samuel He had always supposed that bartenders and saloonkeepers were such from innate depravity Could it really be that they were driven to the trade The bare idea was enough to set his zeal in a blaze Listen he said Suppose I were to find you some kind of honest work so that you could earn a living Would you promise to reform Do you mean would I quit Callahan s Why sure I would Ah exclaimed the boy in delight
7939_120318_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 But it d have to be a steady job put in the other 
7939_120318_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 I can take no chances with the baby 
none	none	That s all right said Samuel I ll get you what you want Gee young feller exclaimed Finnegan
7939_120318_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 Do you carry em round in your pockets 
none	none	No said Samuel but doctor Vince asked me to help him and I m going to tell him about you 
7939_120318_000034_000000	train-clean-360	And so forthwith he made his way to the doctor s house and was ushered into the presence of the unhappy clergyman 
7939_120318_000034_000001	train-clean-360	He stated his case and the other threw up his hands in despair 
none	none	Really he exclaimed this is too much Samuel 
7939_120318_000035_000001	train-clean-360	I can t find employment for everyone in Lockmanville 
7939_120318_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 But doctor protested Samuel I don t think you understand 
none	none	This man wants to lead a decent life and he can t because there s no way for him to earn a living
7939_120318_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 I understand all that Samuel 
none	none	But doctor what s the use of trying to reform men if they re chained in that way There was a pause I m afraid it s hopeless to explain to you said the clergyman But you ll have to make up your mind to it Samuel there are a great many men in the world who want jobs and it seems to be unfortunately true that there are fewer jobs than men
7939_120318_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said the other but that s what Professor Stewart taught men And you said it was wicked of him 
none	none	Um said the doctor taken aback Don t you see went on Samuel eagerly
7939_120318_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 It puts you right back with Herbert Spencer 
none	none	If there are more men than there are jobs then the men have to fight for them And so you have the struggle for existence and the survival of the greedy and the selfish If Finnegan wouldn t be a barkeeper then he and his family would starve and somebody else would survive who was willing to be that bad 
7939_120318_000044_000000	train-clean-360	The boy waited 
7939_120318_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 Don t you see that doctor Vince he persisted 
7939_120318_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I see that said the doctor 
7939_120318_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 And you told me that the only way to escape from that was to live for others to serve them and help them 
7939_120318_000046_000001	train-clean-360	And isn t that what I m trying to do 
none	none	Yes my boy that is so But what can we do
7939_120318_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Why doctor aren t you the head of the church 
7939_120318_000048_000001	train-clean-360	And the people come to you to be taught 
none	none	You must point out these things to them so that there can be a change But WHAT change Samuel I don t know sir I m groping around and trying to find out But I m sure of one thing that some people have got too much money Why doctor Vince there are people right in your church who have more than they could spend in hundreds of years Perhaps so said the other But what harm does that do Why that s the reason that so many others have nothing 
7939_120318_000052_000001	train-clean-360	Only realize it right at this very moment there are people starving to death and here in Lockmanville 
7939_120318_000052_000002	train-clean-360	They want to work and there is no work for them I could take you to see them sir girls who want a job in mister Wygant s cotton mill and he won t give it to them 
none	none	But my boy that isn t mister Wygant s fault 
7939_120318_000053_000001	train-clean-360	It s because there is too much cloth already 
7939_120318_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 I ve been thinking about that said Samuel earnestly 
7939_120318_000054_000001	train-clean-360	 And it doesn t sound right to me 
7939_120318_000054_000002	train-clean-360	There are too many people who need good clothes 
none	none	Look at poor Sophie for instance Yes said the other of course 
7939_120318_000055_000001	train-clean-360	But they haven t money to buy the cloth 
none	none	And Samuel sat forward in his excitement Yes yes he cried And isn t that just what I said before They have no money because the rich people have it all 
7939_120318_000057_000000	train-clean-360	There was no reply and after a moment Samuel rushed on Surely it is selfish of mister Wygant to shut poor people out of his mill just because they have no money 
7939_120318_000057_000001	train-clean-360	Why couldn t he let them make cloth for themselves 
none	none	Samuel protested the other That is absurd But why sir Because my boy in a day they could make more than they could wear in a year
7939_120318_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 So much the better doctor 
none	none	Then they could give the balance to other people who needed it and the other people could make things for them Take Sophie She not only needs clothing she needs shoes and above all she needs enough to eat 
7939_120318_000061_000003	train-clean-360	And if it s a question of there not being enough food look at what s wasted in a place like Master Albert s 
none	none	And there s land enough at Fairview to raise food for the whole town I know what I m talking about there because I m a farmer And it s used to keep a lot of race horses that nobody ever rides Samuel said the clergyman gravely that is true and that is very wrong But what can I do And Samuel stared at him
7939_120318_000063_000001	train-clean-360	 Doctor he exclaimed 
none	none	I can t tell you how it hurts me to have you talk to me like that How do you mean Samuel asked the other in bewilderment And the boy clasped his hands together in his agitation You told me that we must sacrifice ourselves and help others You said that was our sole duty And I believed you I was ready to go with you And here I am I want to follow you and you won t lead Those words were like a stab 
7939_120318_000066_000001	train-clean-360	The doctor winced visibly 
none	none	And Samuel winced also his heart was wrung It hurts me more than I can tell you he cried
7939_120318_000067_000002	train-clean-360	 But think of the people who are suffering nobody spares them 
7939_120318_000067_000003	train-clean-360	And how can you be silent doctor how can the shepherd of Christ be silent while some of his flock are living in luxury and others are starving to death 
none	none	There was a long pause 
7939_120318_000068_000001	train-clean-360	doctor Vince sat rigid clutching the arms of his chair 
none	none	Samuel he said you are right I will preach on this unemployed question next Sunday Ah thank you sir thank you exclaimed Samuel with tears of gratitude in his eyes And he took his friend s hand and wrung it Then suddenly a new thought came to him And meantime doctor said he what am I to tell Finnegan CHAPTER XIX One who has all the cares of humanity upon his shoulders as Samuel had is apt to find that it claims a good deal of time Samuel did his best to keep his mind upon the weighty problems which he had to solve but he found that he was continually distracted by the thought of Miss Gladys Again and again her image would sweep over him driving everything else from his mind The vision of her beauty haunted him sending his imagination upon all sorts of strange excursions and adventures She had told him to come again and he wondered how long he should wait He was supposed to come to see Sophie but that of course was absurd for he saw Sophie every night at home He waited three days and then he could wait no longer The hunger to see her was like a fire smoldering in him In the morning at eleven o clock he went to the house and Sophie came to the door I ll tell her you re here said she understanding at once She ran upstairs and came back telling him to come And she s glad Samuel exclaimed the child Won t you come too he asked blunderingly No she told me not to was Sophie s reply So he went upstairs to Miss Wygant s own sitting room and found her in a morning gown even more beautiful than the one she had worn before You don t know how glad I am to see you she said Samuel admitted that he didn t know and he added And I don t know why you should be Miss Gladys Miss Gladys stood looking at him You find things interesting don t you she asked Why yes Miss Gladys he replied And I find things so tiresome Tiresome gasped the boy Here in this house It seems strange to you does it said she Why you have everything in the world he cried Yes and I m tired of everything The boy was looking at her in wonder It s true she said Everybody I meet is uninteresting they live such dull and stupid lives I m shut up here in this town I ve got to spend a whole month here this summer Samuel gazed at her and a wave of pity swept over him He had felt for some time that she was not happy So here was one more duty for him he must help this beautiful young lady to a realization of her own good fortune The thought set him athrill Ah but Miss Gladys he exclaimed Think how much good you do Good said she In what way Why think of Sophie How happy you ve made her Yes she said dully I suppose so And me he exclaimed Have I made you happy she inquired And he answered I have never been so happy in my life All the wonder that was in his soul shone in his eyes and arrested her gaze They stood looking at each other and then she came to him laughing Samuel she said you haven t got that tie right And once more her fingers touched him and her breath was upon him and the glory of her set him on fire A new wave of feeling swept over him and this time it swamped him completely His heart was pounding his brain was reeling and blindly like a drunken man almost without knowing what he was doing he put out his arms and caught her to him And then in an instant horror seized him What had he done She would repel him she would drive him from her He had ruined everything But another instant sufficed to show him that this was not the case And the tide of his feeling swept back redoubled From the hidden regions of his soul there came new emotions suddenly awakened things tremendous and terrifying never guessed by him before His manhood came suddenly to consciousness he lost all his shyness and fear of her She was his to do what he pleased with And he pressed her to him he half crushed her in his embrace She closed her eyes and he kissed her upon the cheeks and upon the lips then he heard her voice faint and trembling Samuel I love you And within him it was like a great fanfare of trumpets for wonder and triumph and delirious joy Suddenly there came a step in the hall outside They sprang apart The door of the room was open and for an instant he saw wild terror in her eyes Then she sank down upon her knees Oh Samuel she exclaimed My ring Your ring he echoed dazed My ring she said again then he heard the voice of missus Harris in the doorway Your ring Miss Gladys I dropped it she said and Samuel sank down upon his knees also They sought under the table It fell here she said It s my solitaire It must have rolled said missus Harris beginning to search Put your head down and look about Samuel commanded Miss Gladys and Samuel obeyed but he did not find any ring They continued the search for a minute missus Harris had come back to the table and suddenly she exclaimed Here it is What cried the other Why I looked there It was under the leg of the table explained the housekeeper Ah said the other and put the precious ring back upon her finger Samuel was overwhelmed with astonishment but it was nothing to what he felt a moment later His goddess turned to him No she said I m sorry Samuel but it s impossible for me to do what you ask me He stared at her perplexed I have found a place for Sophie she went on and that is positively all I can do Miss Gladys he exclaimed Really she said I think you ought not to ask me to do any more I understand that there is a good deal of suffering among the mill people and I do what I can to relieve it But as for taking all the employees into my father s household that is simply absurd The boy could not find words He could only stare at her That s all said Miss Gladys And about those flower seeds do what you can to find them I want them in a few days if I m to use them at all Do you understand Y yes Miss Gladys he stammered He had seen her dart a swift glance at the housekeeper and he was beginning at last to comprehend Bring them to me yourself she added Good by Good by Miss Gladys he said and went out He went downstairs marveling But before he was halfway down the first flight of steps he had forgotten everything except those incredible words Samuel I love you They rang in his head like a trumpet call He could not hold himself in He could not carry away such a secret Sophie went to the door with him and he took her outside and whispered it to her The child stared at him with awe in her eyes Samuel she whispered she must mean to marry you The boy started in dismay Marry me he gasped Marry me Why yes said Sophie What else can she mean That was a poser But but he cried It s absurd It s not Samuel She loves you But I m nothing but a poor boy But Samuel she has plenty of money It had not occurred to Samuel that way but he had to admit that it was true But I m not good enough he protested You are good enough for anyone cried Sophie You are noble and beautiful and she has found it out And she means to stoop and lift you up to her The boy was silent stricken with awe Oh Samuel it is just like in the fairy stories whispered the child You are to be the prince So she went on pouring out the wonder of it to him and thrilling his soul to yet new flights He left her at last and walked down the street half dazed He was to marry Miss Gladys Yes it must be true for she had told him that she loved him And then presumably he would come to live in that great palace How could he ever stand it What would he do And he would be a rich man A great surge of triumph came to him What would the people at home say what would his brothers think when he went to pay them a visit and perhaps to buy the old place But he put these thoughts away from him He must not think of such things it was selfish and ignoble He must think of the good that he would be able to do with all the money He might help the poor at last He and Miss Gladys would devote their lives to this Perhaps some day he might even own the mill where the children worked and he would be able to send them all to school And he would be a member of the Lockman family in a way he might even have some influence over Master Albert And Ethel and doctor Vince how happy they would be when they heard of his good fortune In the end his thoughts left all these things and came back to Miss Gladys After all what counted but that She loved him She was his And like a swiftly spreading fire there came over him the memory of what he had done to her he walked on trembling with wonder and fear It was a kind of madness in his blood It had taken possession of his whole being he would never again be the same He stretched out his arms as he walked down the street because his emotions were greater than he could bear Then suddenly in the midst of the turmoil a sight met his eyes which brought him back to the world Approaching him about to pass him was an old man with a gray beard stooping as he walked and carrying a peddler s basket The disguise was excellent but it did not deceive Samuel for an instant He stood stock still and cried in amazement Charlie Swift The peddler shot a quick glance at him Shut up he muttered and then he passed on and left Samuel staring So with a sudden rush a new set of emotions overwhelmed the boy He was only a week away from the burglary and yet it was an age And how terrible it seemed how almost incredible And here was he about to marry the daughter of a millionaire while his friend and confederate was still skulking in the shadows hiding from the police Of all the distressed people whom Samuel had met in the course of his adventures Charlie Swift was the only one whom he had not benefited And simply to set eyes upon him was to hear in his soul a new call How could he pursue his own gratifications while Charlie was left a prey to wickedness The figure almost passed from sight while Samuel stood wrestling with the problem He shrunk from the task before him he was afraid of Charlie Swift afraid of his cynical smile and of his merciless sneering But his duty was clear before him as clear as that of any soldier who in the midst of love and pleasure hears the bugle call He might not be able to do anything for Charlie But he must try And so he turned and followed the old peddler to his home CHAPTER XX So you ve let them turn you into a mission stiff said Charlie Swift when the two were seated in his room A what exclaimed Samuel perplexed A mission stiff repeated the other One of the guys that gets repentance Samuel experienced a sudden chilling of the ardor with which he had come into the room The old grin was upon the other s face and the boy realized with a sudden sinking of the heart how hard and savage he was Finnegan was a babe in arms compared with Charlie Swift To convert him would be a real task a test of one s fervor and vision Samuel resolved suddenly upon diplomacy They ve been very good to me he said I dare say responded the other indifferently And doctor Vince is really a very good man he went on Humph commented the burglar and then he added quickly You haven t been telling him anything about me Oh no exclaimed the boy Not a word Have you forgotten that I promised you That s all right said Charlie only I just wanted to warn you You can tie up with the church guys if you feel like it only don t mention your lost brothers down in the pit Just you remember that I got some of the doctor s silver The boy gave a start Oh he exclaimed Didn t you know that laughed the other No I didn t know it What did you suppose I was doing all that time while you were watching Samuel said nothing for a minute Why did you pick out doctor Vince he asked suddenly Him Why not I knew his house But a clergyman Does it seem quite fair Oh that s all right laughed the other He s got a plenty It don t have to come out of his salary you know Why not Because he s got a rich wife You didn t suppose he lived in that palace of a house on his own salary did you I hadn t thought anything about it Well he s all right he married one of the richest girls in town And she ll keep his nest feathered There was a pause Don t you think that doctor Vince is a good man asked Samuel I don t know said the other I ve got no quarrel with him But I don t like his trade Doesn t he do a great deal of good to people Maybe said the other shrugging his shoulders To poor people persisted Samuel I dare say admitted Charlie But you ll notice it takes all the sand out of them makes them into beggars And I ain t that sort Why do you think he tries to help them Well he gets paid for it don t he But the other people in the church the ones who pay the money Why do you think they do it The burglar thought for a moment I reckon they do it to make themselves feel good he said To make themselves feel good repeated the other perplexed Sure said the man You take one of those rich women she s got a lot of money that she never earned and she spends all her life amusing herself and ordering servants about And all the time she knows that most of the people the people that do the work are suffering and dying And she don t want to let that make her feel bad so she hires some fellow like your friend the doctor to preach to em and maybe give em a turkey at Christmas And that takes the trouble off her mind Don t you see Yes said the other weakly I see Or else added Charlie take some of those smooth grafters they ve got up there the men I mean They spend six days in the week cutting other people s throats and robbing the public Don t you think it s handy for them to know they can come on Sunday and drop a five dollar bill in the plate and square the whole account Samuel sought for a reply to these cruel taunts I don t think you put it quite fairly he protested Why not demanded the other In the first place men like that wouldn t go to church Charlie stared at him What he exclaimed No said the boy Why not Well why should they care to go And they wouldn t be welcome Charlie burst into laughter You poor kid he exclaimed What have you been doing up there at saint Matthew s anyhow I m the sexton s assistant said Samuel gravely Yes said the other Evidently a sexton s assistant doesn t see much of the congregation I wish you d explain remarked the boy after a pause I hardly know where to begin replied the other They ve such a choice collection of crooks up there Did you ever notice a little pot bellied fellow with mutton chop whiskers looks as if he was eating persimmons all the time You mean mister Hickman Yes that s the chap He s one of the pillars of the church isn t he I suppose so said Samuel He s one of the vestrymen And did you ever hear of Henry Hickman before I know he s a famous lawyer and I was told that he managed the Lockman estate Yes said Charlie and I suppose you don t know what that means No admitted Samuel I don t It means went on the other that he was old Lockman s right hand man and had his finger in every dirty job that the old fellow ever did for thirty years And it means that he runs the business now and does all the crooked work that has to be done for it There was a pause For instance what asked Samuel in a low voice For instance politics said the other Steering the grafters off the Lockman preserve Getting the right men named by the machine and putting up the dough to elect them Last year the Democrats got in in spite of all he could do and he had to buy the city council outright What gasped the boy in horror Sure thing laughed Charlie there was an independent water company trying to break in and the Democrats were pledged to them They say it cost Hickman forty five thousand dollars But do you KNOW that cried the other Know it Sammy Why everybody in town knows it It was a rotten steal on the face of it Samuel was staring at him I can t believe it he exclaimed Nonsense laughed the other Ask round a bit And then he added quickly Why see here didn t you tell me you knew Billy Finnegan the barkeeper Yes I know him Well then you can go right to headquarters and find out His boss John Callahan was one of the supervisors he got the dough Go and ask Finnegan But will he tell exclaimed Samuel I guess he ll tell said Charlie if you go at him right It s no great secret the whole town s been laughing about it Samuel was almost too shocked for words Do you suppose doctor Vince knows it he cried He don t know much if he doesn t was the other s reply A member of his church gasped the boy Oh pshaw laughed the other You re too green Sammy What s the church got to do with business Why look there s old Wygant another of the vestrymen Miss Gladys father you mean Yes old Lockman s brother in law He s the other trustee of the estate And do you suppose there s any rascality he doesn t know about But he s a reformer cried the boy wildly Sure laughed Charlie He made a speech at the college commencement about representative government I suppose you read it in the Express But all the same when the Democrats got in his nibs came round and made his terms with Slattery the new boss and they get along so well it ll be his money that will put them in again next year But WHY cried Samuel dazed For one thing said Charlie because he s got to have his man in the State legislature to beat the child labor bill The child labor bill Surely You knew he was fighting it didn t you They wanted to prevent children under fourteen from working in the cotton mills Wygant sent Jack Pemberton up to the Capital for nothing at all but to beat that law Samuel sat with his hands clenched tightly Before him there had come the vision of little Sophie Stedman with her wan and haggard face But why does he want the children in his mill he cried Why echoed Charlie Good God Because he can pay them less and work them harder Did you suppose he wanted them there for their health There was a long pause The boy was wrestling with the most terrible specter that had yet laid hold upon him I don t believe he knows it he whispered half to himself I don t believe it Who asked the other doctor Vince said the boy And he rose suddenly to his feet I will go and see him about it he said Go and see him echoed Charlie Yes He will tell me Charlie was gazing at him with a broad grin I dare you he cried I am going said the boy simply and the burglar slapped his thigh in delight Go on he chuckled Sock it to him Sammy And come back and tell me about it CHAPTER XXI doctor Vince is at lunch said the maid who answered the bell Please tell him I must see him at once said Samuel It s something very important He went in and sat down in the library and the doctor came looking anxious What is it now he asked And Samuel turned to him a face of anguish Doctor he said I ve just had a terrible experience What is it Samuel I hardly know how to tell you said the boy I know a man a very wicked man and I went to him to try to convert him and to bring him into the church And he laughed at me and at the church too He said there are wicked men in it in saint Matthew s doctor Vince He told me who they are and what they are doing And doctor I can t believe that you know about it that you would let such things go on The other was staring at him in alarm My dear boy he said there are many wicked men in the world and I cannot know everything Ah but this is terrible doctor You will have to find out about it you cannot let such men stay in the church The other rose and closed the door of his study Then he drew his chair close to Samuel Now he said what is it It s mister Wygant said Samuel mister Wygant cried the other in dismay Yes doctor Vince What has he done Did you know that it was he who beat the child labor bill that he named the State senator on purpose to do it The doctor was staring at him The child labor bill he gasped Is THAT what you mean Yes doctor Vince said Samuel Surely you didn t know that Why I know that mister Wygant is very much opposed to the bill He has opposed it openly He has a perfect right to do that hasn t he But to name the State senator to beat it doctor Well my boy mister Wygant is very much interested in politics and of course he would use his influence Why not But doctor Vince it was a wicked thing Think of Sophie But my boy haven t we found Sophie a place in mister Wygant s own home Yes doctor But there are all the others Think of the suffering and misery in that dreadful mill And mister Wygant pays such low wages And he is such a rich man he might help the children if he would Really Samuel began the doctor But the boy seeing the frown of displeasure on his face rushed on swiftly That s only the beginning Listen to me There s mister Hickman mister Hickman mister Henry Hickman the lawyer He has done even worse things And suddenly the clergyman clenched his hands Really Samuel he cried This is too much You are exceeding all patience Doctor exclaimed the boy in anguish It seems to me the doctor continued that you owe it to me to consider more carefully You have been treated very kindly here you have been favored in more ways than one But what has that to do with it cried the other wildly It is necessary that you should remember your place It is certainly not becoming for you a mere boy and filling a subordinate position to come to me with gossip concerning the vestry of my church A subordinate position echoed Samuel dazed But what has my position to do with it It has a great deal to do with it Samuel The boy was staring at him You don t understand me he cried I am not doing this for myself I am not setting myself up I am thinking of the saving of the church What do you mean saving the church Why doctor just see I went to reform a man and he sneered at me He would not have anything to do with the church because such wicked men as mister Hickman were in it He said it was their money that saved them from exposure he said What has mister Hickman done demanded the other quickly He bribed the city council sir He bribed it to beat the water bill doctor Vince got up from his chair and began to pace the floor nervously Tell me doctor cried Samuel Please tell me Surely you didn t know that The other turned to him suddenly I don t think you quite realize the circumstances said he You come to me with this tale about mister Hickman Do you know that he is my brother in law Samuel clutched the arms of his chair and stared aghast Your brother in law he gasped Yes said the other He is my wife s only brother Samuel was dumb with dismay And the doctor continued to pace the floor You see he said the position you put me in Yes said the boy I see It s very terrible But then he rushed on in dreadful anxiety But doctor you didn t know it Oh I m sure please tell me that you didn t know it I didn t know it exclaimed the doctor And what is more I don t know it now I have heard these rumors of course mister Hickman is a man of vast responsibilities and he has many enemies Am I to believe every tale that I hear about him No said Samuel taken aback But this is something that everyone knows Everyone cried the other Who is everyone Who told it to you I I can t tell stammered the boy How does he know it continued the doctor And what sort of a man is he Is he a good man No admitted Samuel weakly I am afraid he is not Is he a man who loves and serves others A man who never speaks falsehood whom you would believe in a matter that involved your dearest friends Would believe him if he told you that I was a briber and a scoundrel Samuel was obliged to admit that Charlie Swift was not a man like that doctor Vince he said quickly I admit that I am at fault I have come to you too soon I will find out about these things and if they are true I will prove them to you If they are not I will go away in shame and never come to trouble you again as long as I live Samuel said this very humbly and yet there was a note of grim resolution in his voice which the doctor did not fail to note But Samuel he protested Why why should you meddle in these things Meddle in them exclaimed the other Surely if they are true I have to You don t mean that if they were proven you would let such men remain in your church I don t think said the doctor gravely that I can say what I should do in case of anything so terrible No was Samuel s reply you are right The first thing is to find out the truth And so Samuel took his departure He went straight to his friend Finnegan Hello exclaimed Finnegan Then What about that job of mine he asked with a broad grin doctor Vince says he will look out for you was the boy s reply But I m not ready to talk about that yet There s something else come up He waited until his friend had attended to the wants of a customer and until the customer had consumed a glass of beer and departed Then he called the bartender into a corner mister Finnegan he said I want to know something very important What is it asked the other Do you know mister Hickman Henry Hickman the lawyer He s not on my calling list said Finnegan I know him by sight I ve heard it said that he had something to do with beating a water bill in the city council Did he You bet your life he did said the bartender with a grin Is it true that he bought up the council You bet your life it s true And is it true that mister Callahan got some of the money Finnegan glanced at the other suspiciously Say he said what s all this about anyhow Listen said Samuel gravely You know that mister Hickman is a member of my church And he s doctor Vince s brother in law which makes it more complicated yet doctor Vince has heard these terrible stories and you can see how awkward it is for him He cannot let such evil doers go unrebuked Gee said the other What s he going to do I don t know said Samuel He hasn t told me that First you see he has to be sure that the thing is true And of course mister Hickman wouldn t tell No said Finnegan Hardly And it isn t easy for the doctor to find out You see he s a clergyman and he only meets good people But I told him I would find out for him I see said Finnegan What I want said the boy is to be able to tell him that I heard it from the lips of one of the men who got the money I won t have to say who it is he ll take my word for that Do you suppose mister Callahan would talk about it The bartender thought for a moment You wait here he said The boss has only stepped round the corner and perhaps I can get the doctor what he wants So Samuel sat down and waited and in a few minutes John Callahan came in He was a thick set and red faced Irishman good natured and pleasant looking not at all like the desperado Samuel had imagined Say John said Finnegan This boy here used to work for Bertie Lockman and he s got a girl works for the Wygants So said Callahan And what do you think went on the other He heard old Henry Hickman talking he says you fellows held him up on that water bill Go on said Callahan Did he say that He did said Finnegan without giving Samuel a chance to reply Well said the other he s a damned liar and he knows it It was a dead straight proposition and we hadn t a thing to do with it There was an independent water company that wanted a franchise and it would have given the city its water for just half Every time I pay my water bill I am sorry I didn t hold out It would have been cheaper for me in the end He says it cost him sixty thousand remarked Finnegan Maybe said the other You can t tell what the organization got All I know is that ten of us fellows in the council got two thousand apiece out of it There was a pause Samuel was listening with his hands clenched tightly Did he pay it to you himself asked Finnegan Who Hickman No he paid it to Slattery and Slattery came here from his office Why is he trying to crawl out of that part of it No not exactly But he makes a great fuss about being held up Yes said Callahan I dare say He s got his new franchise and he and the Lockman estate are clearing about ten thousand a month out of it And my two thousand was gone the week I got it it had cost me twice that to get elected and without counting the free drinks It s a great graft being a supervisor ain t it Why did you do it then asked Samuel in a faint voice I ll never do it again young fellow said the saloon keeper I m the Honorable John for the rest of my life and I guess that ll do me And the next time old Henry Hickman wants his dirty work done he can hunt up somebody that needs the money more than me Then the Honorable John went on to discuss the politics of Lockmanville and to lay bare the shameless and grotesque corruption in a town where business interests were fighting The trouble was apparently that the people were beginning to rebel they were tired of being robbed in so many different ways and they went to the polls to find redress And time and again after they had elected new men to carry out their will the great concerns had stepped in and bought out the law makers The last time it had been the unions that made the trouble and three of the last supervisors had been labor leaders the worst skates of all as Callahan phrased it Samuel listened while one by one the last of his illusions were torn to shreds There had been a general scramble to get favors from the new government of the town and the scramblers seemed to include every pious and respectable member of saint Matthew s whose name Samuel had ever heard There was old mister Curtis another of the vestrymen who passed the plate every Sunday morning and looked like a study of the Olympian Jove He wanted to pile boxes on the sidewalks in front of his warehouse and he had come to Slattery and paid him two hundred dollars And mister Wygant exclaimed Samuel as a sudden thought came to him Is it true that he is back of the organization Good God laughed Callahan Did you hear him say that Some one else told me was the reply Well said the other the truth is that Wygant got cold feet before the election and he came to Slattery and fixed it I know that for Slattery told me We had him bluffed clean I don t think we d ever have got in at all if it hadn t been for his money I see whispered the boy Oh he s a smooth guy laughed the saloon keeper Look at that new franchise got for his trolley road ninety nine years and anything he wants in the meantime And then to hear him making reform speeches That s what makes me mad about them fellows up on the hill They get a thousand dollars for every one we get but they are tip top swells and they wouldn t speak to one of us low grafters on the street And they re eminent citizens and pillars of the church wouldn t it make you sick Yes said Samuel in a low voice that s just what it does It makes me sick CHAPTER XXII Samuel now had his evidence and he went straight back to doctor Vince Doctor he said I am able to tell you that I know I have heard it from one of the men who got the money Who is he asked the doctor I could not tell you that said the boy it would not be fair But you know that I am telling the truth And this man told me with his own lips that mister Hickman paid twenty thousand dollars to Slattery the Democratic boss to be paid to ten of the supervisors to vote against the other company s water bill There was a long pause the doctor sat staring in front of him What do you want me to do he asked faintly I don t know said Samuel Is it for me to tell you what is right And again there was a pause My boy said the doctor this is a terrible thing for me mister Hickman is my wife s brother and she loves him very dearly And he is a very good friend of mine I depend on him in all the business matters of the church Yes said Samuel But he bribed the city council This thing would make a frightful scandal if it were known the other went on Think what a terrible thing it would be for saint Matthew s It is much worse as it is said the boy For people hear the story and they say that the church is sheltering evil doers Think what a burden you place upon me cried the clergyman in distress A member of my own family It is just as hard for me said Samuel quickly In what way On account of mister Wygant sir What of that Samuel had meant to say He is to be my father in law But at the last moment some instinct told him that it might be best to let Miss Gladys make that announcement at her own time So instead he said I am thinking of Sophie It is not quite the same said the doctor and then he repeated his question What do you want me to do Truly I don t know protested the boy I am groping about to find what is right But you must have some idea in coming to me exclaimed the other anxiously Do you want me to expose my brother in law and drive him from the church I suppose said Samuel gravely that he would be sent to prison But I certainly don t think that he should be driven from the church at least not unless he is unrepentant First of all we should labor with him I think And threaten him with exposure I ll tell you doctor said the boy quickly I ve been thinking about this very hard and I don t think it would do much good to expose and punish any one That only leads to bitterness and hatred and we oughtn t to hate any person you know Ah said the doctor with relief The point is the wicked thing that s been done It s this robbing of the people that must be stopped And it s the things that have been stolen Let me give you an example To day I met the man who came here with me to rob your house and I learned for the first time that he had carried off some of your silver Yes said the other And the man asked me to say nothing about what he had done and I promised I felt about him just as you do about your brother in law I wouldn t denounce him and put him in jail But I saw right away that I must do one thing I must make him return the things he had stolen That was right was it not doctor Yes said doctor Vince promptly that was right Very well said the boy and the same thing is true about mister Hickman He has robbed the people He has got a franchise that enables him and the Lockman estate to make about ten thousand dollars a month out of the public And they must give up that franchise They must give up every dollar that they have made out of it That is the whole story as I see it nothing else counts but that You can make all the fuss you want about bribery and graft but you haven t accomplished anything unless you get back the stolen money There was a pause Don t you see what I mean doctor asked Samuel Yes was the reply I see Well said Samuel It would be no use to try it said the doctor They would never do it They wouldn t No Nothing in the world could make them do it Not even if we threatened to denounce them No not even then Not even if we put them in jail doctor Vince made no reply The other sat waiting And then suddenly he said in a low voice Doctor I mean to MAKE them give it up I see it quite clearly now that is my duty They must give it up Again there was silence doctor Vince cried the boy in a voice of pain you surely mean to help me And suddenly the doctor shut his lips together tightly No Samuel he said I do not The boy sat dumb He felt a kind of faintness come over him You will leave me all alone he said in a weak voice The other made no reply Am I not right cried the boy wildly Have I not spoken the truth I don t know the doctor answered It is too hard a question for me to answer I only know that I do not feel such things to be in my province and I will not have anything to do with them But doctor you are the representative of the church Yes And I must attend to the affairs of the church But is it no affair of the church that the people are being robbed There was no reply You give out charity protested Samuel You pretend to try to help the poor And I bring you cases and you confess that you can t help them because there are too many And you couldn t tell how it came to be But here I show you I prove to you what makes the people poor They are being robbed they are being trampled upon Their own government has been stolen from them and is being used to cheat them And you won t lift your voice to help There is nothing that I can do Samuel cried the clergyman wildly But there is There is You won t try You might at least withdraw your help from these criminals My HELP Yes sir You help them You permit them to stay in the church and that gives them your sanction You shelter them and save them from attack If I were to go out to morrow and try to open the eyes of the people no one would listen to me because these men are so respectable because they are members of the church and friends and relatives of yours Samuel exclaimed the clergyman And worse than that sir You take their money you let the church become dependent upon them You told me that yourself sir And you give their money to the poor people the very people they have robbed And that blinds the people they are grateful and they don t understand And so you help to keep them in their chains Don t you see that doctor Vince why it s just the same as if you were hired for that purpose doctor Vince had risen in agitation Really Samuel he cried You have exceeded the limit of endurance This cannot go on I will not hear another word of it Samuel sat heart broken Then you are going to desert me he exclaimed You are going to make me do it alone The other stared What are you going to do he demanded First said Samuel I am going to see these men I am going to give them a chance to see the error of their ways Boy cried the doctor You are mad Perhaps I am was the reply But how can I help that At least exclaimed the other if you take any such step you will make it clear to them that I have not sent you and that you have no sanction from me For a long time Samuel made no reply to this Somehow it seemed the most unworthy thing that his friend had said yet It meant that doctor Vince was a coward No sir he said at last you may rest easy about that I will take the whole burden on my own shoulders There s no reason why I should trouble you any more I think And with that he rose and went out from the house CHAPTER XXIII After Samuel had left doctor Vince a great wave of desolation swept over him He was alone again and all the world was against him For a moment he had an impulse to turn back After all he was only a boy and who was he to set himself up against the wise and great But then like a stab came again the thought which drove him always the thought of the people suffering and starving Truly it was better to die than to live in a world in which there was so much misery and oppression That was the truth he would rather die than let these things go on unopposed And so there could be no turning back there was nothing for him save to do what he could Where should he begin He thought of mister Hickman a most unpromising person to work with Samuel had been afraid of him from the first time he had seen him Then he thought of mister Wygant should he begin with him This brought to his mind something which had been driven away by the rush of events Miss Gladys How would she take these things And what would she think when she learned about her father s wickedness A new idea came to Samuel Why should he not take Miss Gladys into his confidence She would be the one to help him She had helped him with Sophie and she had promised to help with Master Albert And surely it was her right to know about matters which concerned her family so nearly She would know what was best so far as concerned her own father he would take her advice as to how to approach him He went to the house and asked for Sophie Tell Miss Gladys that I want to see her he said and that it s something very very important So Sophie went away and returning took him upstairs Samuel said his divinity it isn t safe for you to come to see me in the afternoons Yes Miss Gladys said he But this is something very serious It s got nothing to do with myself What is it she asked It s your father Miss Gladys My father Yes Miss Gladys It s a long story I shall have to begin at the beginning So he told the story of his coming to the church and of the fervor which had seized upon him and how he had set to work to bring converts into the fold and how he had met a wicked man who had resisted his faith and of all the dreadful things which this man had said When he came to what Charlie Swift had told about her own father Samuel was disposed to expurgate the story but Miss Gladys would have it all and seemed even to be disappointed that he had not more details to give her And Hickman she exclaimed gleefully I always knew he was an old scamp I ll wager you haven t found out the hundredth part about him Samuel Samuel went on to tell about the revelation at Callahan s And you took that to doctor Vince she cried amazed Yes said he And what did he say He wouldn t have anything to do with it And so it s all left to me And what are you going to do now I don t know Miss Gladys For one thing I think I shall have to see your father See my father gasped the girl Yes Miss Gladys But what for To try to get him to see how wicked these things are The other was staring at him with wide open startled eyes Do you mean she cried that you want to go to my father and talk to him about what he s doing in politics Why yes Miss Gladys what else can I do And Miss Gladys took out her handkerchief and leaned down upon the table hiding her face She was overcome with some emotion the nature of which was not apparent The boy was naturally alarmed Miss Gladys he cried You aren t angry with me She answered in a muffled voice No Samuel no Then she looked up her face somewhat red Go and see him Samuel she said You don t mind he cried anxiously No not in the least she said Go right ahead and see what you can do He s a very bad worldly man and if you can soften his heart it will be the best thing for all of us And it won t make any difference in our relationship he asked In our relationship she repeated and then Not in the least But mind of course don t say anything about that to him Don t give him any idea that you know me Of course not Miss Gladys Tell him that you come from the church And give it to him good and hard Samuel for I m sure he s done everything you told me and lots that is worse Miss Gladys gasped the other And mind Samuel she added Come and tell me about it afterwards Perhaps I can advise you what to do next There was a pause while the two looked at each other And then in a sudden burst of emotion Miss Gladys exclaimed Oh Samuel you are an angel And she broke into a peal of laughter and swiftly like a bird upon the wing she leaned toward him and touched his cheek with her lips And then like a flash she was gone and Samuel was left alone with his bewilderment Samuel set out forthwith for mister Wygant s office But just before he came to the bridge mister Wygant s automobile flashed past him and so he turned and went back to the house This time he went to the front door I am Samuel Prescott from saint Matthew s Church he said to the butler And I want to see mister Wygant upon important business mister Wygant sat in a great armchair by one of the windows in his library About him was the most elaborate collection of books that Samuel had yet seen and in the luxurious room was an atmosphere of profound and age long calm mister Wygant himself was tall and stately with an indescribable air of exclusiveness and reserve Samuel clenched his hands and rushed at once to the attack I am Samuel Prescott the sexton s boy at the church he said and I have to talk to you about something very VERY serious Well said mister Wygant Then Samuel told yet again how he had been led into evil ways and how he had been converted by doctor Vince He told the story in detail so that the other might comprehend his fervor Then he told of the converts he had made and how at last he had encountered Charlie Swift And this man would not come into the church he wound up because of the wicked people who are in it The other had been listening with perplexed interest Who are these people he asked Yourself for one said Samuel mister Wygant started Myself he exclaimed What have I done For one thing replied Samuel you work little children in your mill and you named the State senator to beat the child labor bill And for another you make speeches and pose as a political reformer while you are paying money to Slattery so that he will give you franchises There was a silence while mister Wygant got back his breath Young man he cried at last this is a most incredible piece of impertinence And suddenly the boy started toward him stretching out his arms mister Wygant he cried You are going to be angry with me But I beg you not to harden your heart I have come here for your own good I came because I couldn t bear to know that such things are done by a member of saint Matthew s Church For a moment or two mister Wygant sat staring Let me ask you one thing he said Does doctor Vince know about this I went to doctor Vince about it first replied Samuel And he wouldn t do anything about it He said that if I came to you I must make it clear that he did not approve of it I have come of my own free will sir There was another pause You are going to be angry with me cried Samuel again No said the other I will not be angry because you are nothing but a child and you don t know what you are doing Oh said Samuel You are very much in need of a little knowledge of life added the other But mister Wygant exclaimed the boy the things I have said are true They are true after a fashion was the reply And they are very wrong things They seem so to you That is because you know so little about such matters You are corrupting the government of your country mister Wygant The government of my country as you call it consisting of a number of blackmailing politicians who exist to prey upon the business I represent There was a pause You see young man said mister Wygant I have many responsibilities upon my shoulders many interests looking to me for protection And it is as if I were surrounded by a pack of wolves But meantime cried Samuel what is becoming of free government I do not know the other replied I sometimes think that unless the people reform free government will soon come to an end But what are the people to do sir They are to elect honest men with whom one can do business instead of the peasant saloon keepers and blatherskite labor leaders whom they choose at present Samuel thought for a moment Men with whom one can do business he said but what kind of business do you want to do How do you mean asked the other You went to those politicians and got a franchise that will let you tax the people whatever you please for ninety nine years And do you think that was good business for the people There was no reply to this And how much of the property you are protecting was made in such ways as that sir A frown had come upon mister Wygant s forehead But no one could gaze into Samuel s agonized face and remain angry Young man said he I can only tell you again that you do not know the world If I should step out would things be any different The franchises would go to some other crowd that is all It is the competition of capital The competition of capital reflected the boy In other words there is a scramble for money and you get what you can You may put it that way sir And you think that your responsibility ends when you ve got a share for your crowd Yes I suppose that is it There was a pause I see perfectly said Samuel in a low voice There s only one thing I can t understand What is that Why you should belong to the church sir What has this money scramble to do with the teaching of Jesus And then Samuel saw that he had overstepped the mark Really young man said mister Wygant I cannot see what is to be gained by pursuing this conversation But sir you are degrading the church The subject must be dropped said mister Wygant sternly You are presuming upon my good nature You are forgetting your place I have been reminded of my place before said Samuel in a suppressed voice But I do not know what my place is That is quite evident responded the other It is your place to do your work and be respectful to your superiors and keep your opinions to yourself I see that you will get angry with me said the boy I can t make you understand I am only trying to find the truth I want to do what s right mister Wygant I suppose you do began the other I want to understand sir just what is it that makes another person my superior People who are older than you and who are wiser But is it age and wisdom mister Wygant I worked for Master Albert Lockman and he s hardly any older than I And yet he was my superior Yes admitted the other And in spite of the wicked life that he s leading sir What Yes mister Wygant he s drinking and going with bad women And yet he is my superior Ahem said mister Wygant Isn t it simply that he has got a lot of money pursued Samuel relentlessly mister Wygant did not reply And isn t my place simply the fact that I haven t any money at all Again there was no reply And yet I see the truth and I have to speak it And how can I get to a place where I may Really said mister Wygant coldly you will have to solve that problem for yourself Apparently I should have to take part in the scramble for money if it s only money that counts Young man said the other I feel sorry for you you will get some hard knocks from the world before you get through You will have to learn to take life as you find it Perhaps many of us would make it different if we could have our way But you will find that life is a hard battle It is a struggle for existence and the people who survive are the ones who are best fitted And suddenly Samuel raised his hand I thank you mister Wygant he said gravely but I have been all through that part of it before What do you mean asked the other I couldn t explain said he You wouldn t understand me I see that you are another of the followers of Herbert Spencer And that s all right only WHY do you belong to the church Why do you pretend to follow Jesus And suddenly mister Wygant rose to his feet This is quite too much he said I must ask you to leave my house But sir cried Samuel Not another word exclaimed the other Please leave the house And so the conversation came to an end CHAPTER XXIV Samuel had had nothing to eat since morning but he did not feel hungry He was faint from grief and despair To encounter a man of the world like mister Wygant cold and merciless and masterful that was a terrible ordeal for him The man seemed to him like some great fortress of evil and what could he do save to gaze at it in impotent rage He went home and Sophie met him at the door I thought you wanted an early supper Samuel said she Why he asked dully You had something to do at the church tonight Yes he recollected there s to be a vestry meeting and I have to light up But I m tired of the church work Tired of the church work gasped the child Yes he said And then to the amazed and terrified family he told the story of his day s experiences Sophie listened thrilling with excitement And you went to see mister Wygant she cried in awe Oh Samuel how brave of you He ordered me out of his house said the boy bitterly And doctor Vince has gone back on me I have no one at all to help Sophie came to him and flung her arms about him You have us Samuel she exclaimed We will stand by you won t we mother Yes said missus Stedman but what can poor people like us do And then you have Miss Gladys cried Sophie after a moment Miss Gladys he echoed Will she take my part against her own father She told you that she loved you Samuel said the child And she knows that you are in the right I will have to go and see her said Samuel after a little I promised that I would come and tell what happened And I will see her too put in the other Oh I m sure she ll stand by you The child s face was aglow with excitement and Samuel looked at her and for the first time it occurred to him that Sophie was really beautiful Her face had filled out and her color had come back since she had been getting one meal every day at the Wygant s Don t you think Miss Gladys will help mother she asked I don t know said missus Stedman dubiously It s very terrible I can t see why such things have to be You think that Samuel did right don t you cried the child I I suppose so she answered It s hard to say it will make so much trouble And if Miss Gladys were angry then you might lose your place Oh mother cried Sophie And the two young people gazed at each other in sudden dismay That was something they had never thought of You mustn t do it Sophie cried the boy You must leave it to me But why should you make all the sacrifices replied Sophie If it s right for you isn t it right for me But Sophie wailed missus Stedman If you lost this place we should all starve And again they stared at each other with terror in their eyes Sophie said Samuel I forbid you to have anything to do with it But in his heart he knew that he might as well not have said this And missus Stedman knew it too and turned white with fear The boy ate a few hurried mouthfuls and then went off to his work at the church But he did not go with the old joy in his soul Before this it had been the work of the Lord that he had been doing but now he was only serving the Wygants and the Hickmans apparently one always served them no matter where or how he worked in this world You are late said old mister Jacobs the sexton when he arrived Yes sir said Samuel doctor Vince left word that he wanted to see you as soon as you came The boy s heart gave a leap Had the doctor by any chance repented Where is he he asked In the vestry room said the other and the boy went there The instant he entered doctor Vince sprang to his feet Samuel he cried vehemently this thing has got to stop What thing doctor Vince Your conduct is beyond endurance boy you are driving me to distraction What have I done now sir My brother in law has just been here making a terrible disturbance You have been defaming him among the congregation of the church But doctor Vince cried Samuel in amazement I have done nothing of the sort But you must have Everyone is talking about it Doctor said the boy solemnly you are mistaken I went to see mister Wygant as I told you I would Besides that I have not spoken to a single soul about it except just now to Sophie and missus Stedman Oh yes he added quickly and to Miss Gladys Ah exclaimed the other There you have it Miss Gladys is a school friend of mister Hickman s daughter and of course she went at once to tell her And of course she will tell everyone else she knows the whole congregation will be gossiping about it to morrow I am very sorry sir You see the trouble you cause me And I must tell you plainly Samuel that this thing cannot go on another minute Unless you are prepared to give up these absurd ideas of yours and attend to your duties as the sexton s boy it will be necessary for you to leave the church Samuel was staring at him aghast Leave the church he cried Most assuredly declared the other doctor Vince exclaimed the other Do you mean that you would actually try to turn me out of the church I would sir But doctor have you the right to do that The right Why not You have the right to take away my work But to turn me out of the church Samuel cried the distracted clergyman am I not the rector of this church But doctor cried Samuel it is the church of God There was a long pause Finally Samuel took up the conversation again Tell me doctor Vince he said When mister Hickman came to see you did he deny that he had committed that crime I did not ask him replied the other You didn t ask him exclaimed the boy in dismay You didn t even care that much Again there was a pause I asked mister Wygant said Samuel in a low voice And he confessed that he was guilty What cried the other He confessed it his whole conversation was a confession of it He said everybody did those things because that was the way to make money and everybody wanted to make money He called it competition And then I asked him why he came to the church of Jesus and he ordered me out of his house doctor Vince was listening with knitted brows And what do you propose to do now he asked I don t know sir I suppose I shall have to expose him Samuel exclaimed the clergyman in all this wild behavior of yours does it never occur to you that you owe some gratitude to me Oh doctor cried the boy clasping his hands in agony Don t say anything like that to me I do say it persisted the other I saved you and helped you and now you are causing me most terrible suffering Doctor protested Samuel I would do anything in the world for you I would die for you But you ask me to be false to my duty and how can I do that But does it never occur to you that older and wiser people may be better able to judge than you are But the facts are so plain sir And you have never answered me You simply command me to be silent The other did not reply When I came to you went on Samuel you taught me about love and brotherhood about self sacrifice and service And I took you at your word sir As God is my witness I have done nothing but try to apply what you told me I have tried to help the poor and oppressed And how could I know that you did not really mean what you said Samuel protested the other you have no right to say that I am doing all that I can I preach upon these things very often Yes exclaimed the boy but what do you preach Do you tell the truth to these rich people who come to your church Do you say to them You are robbing the poor You are the cause of all the misery which exists in this town you carry the guilt of it upon your souls And you must cease from robbery and oppression you must give up this wealth that you have taken from the people No you don t say that you know that you don t And can t you see what that means doctor Vince it means that the church is failing in its mission And there will have to be a new church somewhere somehow For these things exist They are right here in our midst and something must be done And the boy sprang forward in his excitement stretching out his arms The people are starving Right here about us here in Lockmanville They are starving starving starving Don t you understand doctor Vince Starving The doctor wrung his hands in his agitation Boy he exclaimed this thing cannot go on I cannot stand it any longer But what am I to do sir You are to submit yourself to my guidance I ask you once for all Will you give up these wild courses of yours doctor Vince cried Samuel I cannot I cannot Then I tell you it will be necessary for us to part You will give up your position and you will leave the church The tears started into Samuel s eyes Doctor he cried frantically don t cast me out Don t I beg you on my knees sir I have spoken said the other clenching his hands But think what you are doing protested the boy You are casting out your own soul You are turning your back upon the truth I tell you you must go exclaimed the doctor But think of it It means the end of the church For don t you see I shall have to fight you I shall have to expose you And I shall prevail over you because I have the truth with me because you have cast it out Think what you are doing when you cast out the truth I will hear no more of this cried doctor Vince wildly You are raving I tell you to go I tell you to go Go now And Samuel turned and went sobbing meanwhile as if his heart would break

7939_120325_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Samuel rushed away into the darkness 
none	none	But he couldn t stay away he could not bring himself to believe that he was separated from saint Matthew s forever He turned and came back to the church and stood gazing at it choking with his sobs 
7939_120325_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Then as he waited he saw an automobile draw up in front of the side entrance and saw mister Wygant step out and enter 
7939_120325_000004_000001	train-clean-360	The sight was like a blow in the face to him 
7939_120325_000004_000002	train-clean-360	There was the proud rich man defiant and unpunished seated in the place of authority while Samuel the Seeker was turned out of the door 
none	none	A blaze of rebellion flamed up in him No no they should not cast him off 
7939_120325_000005_000002	train-clean-360	He would fight them he would fight to the very end 
7939_120325_000005_000003	train-clean-360	The church was not their church it was the church of God 
7939_120325_000005_000004	train-clean-360	And he had a right to belong to it and to speak the truth in it too 
none	none	And so just after the vestry had got settled to the consideration of the architect s sketch for the new Nurse s Home there came a loud knock upon the door and Samuel entered wild eyed and breathless Gentlemen he cried I demand a hearing 
7939_120325_000008_000000	train-clean-360	doctor Vince sprang to his feet in terror 
7939_120325_000008_000001	train-clean-360	 Samuel Prescott he exclaimed 
7939_120325_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I have been ordered out of the church proclaimed Samuel 
7939_120325_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 And I will not submit to it 
7939_120325_000009_000002	train-clean-360	I have spoken the truth and I will not permit the evil doers in saint Matthew s to silence me 
7939_120325_000010_000000	train-clean-360	mister Hickman had sprung up 
7939_120325_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 Boy he commanded leave this room 
none	none	I will not leave the room shouted Samuel I demand a hearing from the vestry of this church I have a right to a hearing 
7939_120325_000011_000003	train-clean-360	I have spoken the truth and nothing but the truth 
7939_120325_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 What is the boy talking about demanded another of the vestrymen 
7939_120325_000012_000001	train-clean-360	This was mister Hamerton a young lawyer whose pleasant face Samuel had often noticed 
7939_120325_000012_000002	train-clean-360	And Samuel seeing curiosity and interest in his look sprang toward him 
7939_120325_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t let them turn me out without a hearing he cried 
none	none	Boy exclaimed mister Hickman I command you to leave this room
7939_120325_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 You corrupted the city council shrilled Samuel 
7939_120325_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 You bribed it to beat the water bill 
7939_120325_000015_000002	train-clean-360	It s true and you know it s true and you don t dare to deny it 
7939_120325_000016_000000	train-clean-360	mister Hickman was purple in the face with rage 
none	none	It s a preposterous lie he roared
7939_120325_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 I have talked with one of the men who got the money cried Samuel There was two thousand dollars paid to ten of the supervisors 
7939_120325_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Who is this man cried the other furiously 
none	none	I won t tell his name said Samuel
7939_120325_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 He told me in confidence 
7939_120325_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Aha laughed the other 
none	none	I knew as much It is a vile slander It is true protested Samuel
7939_120325_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 doctor Vince you know that I am telling the truth 
none	none	What reason would I have for making it up I have told you Samuel exclaimed doctor Vince that I would have nothing to do with this matter I will take any member of this vestry to talk with that man declared the boy
7939_120325_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 Anybody can find out about these things if he wants to 
none	none	Why mister Wygant told me himself that he had paid money to Slattery to get franchises And then mister Wygant came into the controversy
7939_120325_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 WHAT he shouted 
none	none	Why of course you did cried Samuel in amazement
7939_120325_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 Didn t you tell me this very afternoon 
7939_120325_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 I told you nothing of the sort declared the man 
none	none	You told me everybody did it that there was no way to help doing it You called it the competition of capital
7939_120325_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 I submit that this is an outrage exclaimed mister Hickman 
none	none	Leave this room sir
7939_120325_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 The poor people in this town are suffering and dying cried Samuel And they are being robbed and oppressed 
none	none	And are these things to go on forever Samuel this is no place to discuss the question broke in doctor Vince
7939_120325_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 But why not sir 
7939_120325_000031_000001	train-clean-360	The guilty men are high in the councils of this church 
7939_120325_000031_000002	train-clean-360	They hold the church up to disgrace before all the world 
7939_120325_000031_000003	train-clean-360	And this is the church of Christ sir 
7939_120325_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 But yours is not the way to go about it boy exclaimed mister Hamerton who was alarmed because Samuel kept looking at him 
none	none	Why not cried Samuel
7939_120325_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 Did not Christ drive out the money changers from the temple with whips 
none	none	This was an uncomfortable saying 
7939_120325_000034_000001	train-clean-360	There was a pause after it as if everyone were willing to let his neighbor speak first 
7939_120325_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Are we not taught to follow Christ s example doctor Vince asked the boy 
7939_120325_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Hardly in that sense Samuel said the terrified doctor 
7939_120325_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 Christ was God 
7939_120325_000036_000002	train-clean-360	And we can hardly be expected 
none	none	Ah that is a subterfuge broke in Samuel passionately You say that Christ was God and so you excuse yourself from doing what He tells you to But I don t believe that He was God in any such sense as that He was a man like you and me He was a poor man who suffered and starved 
7939_120325_000037_000005	train-clean-360	And the rich men of His time despised Him and spit upon Him and crucified Him 
none	none	Here a new member of the vestry entered the arena This was the venerable mister Curtis who looked like a statue of the Olympian Jove Boy he said sternly you object to being put out of the church and yet you confess to being an infidel
7939_120325_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 I may be an infidel mister Curtis replied the other quickly but I never paid two hundred dollars to Slattery so that the police would let me block the sidewalks of the town 
none	none	And mister Curtis subsided and took no further part in the discussion The church cast out Jesus went on Samuel taking advantage of the confusion And it was the rich and powerful in the church who did it And he used about them language far more violent than I have ever used Woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites he said Woe unto you also you lawyers Ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hell And if He were here tonight He would be on my side and the rich evil doers who sit on this board would cast Him out again You have cast Him out already You have shut your ears to the cry of the oppressed you make mockery of justice and truth 
7939_120325_000041_000005	train-clean-360	You are crucifying Him again every day 
none	none	This is outrageous cried mister Hickman
7939_120325_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 It is blasphemy 
7939_120325_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 It must stop instantly put in mister Wygant 
none	none	And Samuel knew that when mister Wygant spoke he meant to be obeyed Then there is no one here who will hear me he exclaimed
7939_120325_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 mister Hamerton won t you help me 
7939_120325_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you want us to do demanded mister Hamerton 
7939_120325_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 I want the vestry to investigate these charges 
none	none	I want you to find out whether it is true that members of saint Matthew s have been corrupting the government of Lockmanville 
7939_120325_000046_000002	train-clean-360	And if it is true I want you to drive such men from the church 
7939_120325_000046_000003	train-clean-360	They have no place in the church sir 
none	none	Men who spend their whole time in trying to get the people s money from them Men who openly declare as mister Wygant did to me that it is necessary to bribe lawmakers in order to make money Such men degrade the church and drag it from its mission 
7939_120325_000046_000006	train-clean-360	They are the enemies the church exists to fight 
none	none	Are we here to listen to a sermon from this boy shouted mister Hickman furiously Samuel leave this room commanded doctor Vince Then there is no one here who will help me I told you you could accomplish nothing by such behavior Leave the room Very well then cried the boy wildly I will go 
7939_120325_000051_000001	train-clean-360	But I tell you I will not give up without a fight 
7939_120325_000051_000002	train-clean-360	I will expose you and denounce you to the world 
7939_120325_000051_000003	train-clean-360	The people shall know you for what you are cowards and hypocrites faithless to your trust 
7939_120325_000051_000004	train-clean-360	Plunderers of the public Corrupters of the state 
none	none	Get out of here you young villain shouted Hickman advancing with a menace And the boy blazing with fury pointed his finger straight into his face You Henry Hickman he cried You are the worst of them all You the great lawyer the eminent statesman 
7939_120325_000053_000003	train-clean-360	I have been among the lowest I have been with saloon keepers and criminals with publicans and harlots and thieves but never yet have I met a man as merciless and as hard as you 
7939_120325_000053_000004	train-clean-360	You a Christian you might be the Roman soldier who spat in Jesus face 
none	none	And with that last thunderbolt Samuel turned and went out slamming the door with a terrific bang in the great lawyer s face 
7939_120325_000055_000000	train-clean-360	For at least a couple of hours Samuel paced the streets of Lockmanville to let his rage and grief subside 
none	none	And then he went home and to his astonishment found that Sophie Stedman had been waiting up for him all this while She listened breathlessly to the story of his evening s adventures Then she said I have been trying to do something too What have you done he asked
7939_120325_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 I went to see little Ethel she replied 
none	none	Ethel Vince he gasped Yes said she She is your friend you know and I went to ask her not to let her father turn you off
7939_120325_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 And what came of it 
7939_120325_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 She cried said Sophie 
7939_120325_000062_000001	train-clean-360	 She was terribly unhappy 
none	none	She said that she knew that you were a good boy and that she would never rest until her father had taken you back You don t mean it cried Samuel in amazement Yes Samuel but then her mother came Oh And what then
7939_120325_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 She scolded me 
7939_120325_000066_000001	train-clean-360	She was very angry with me 
7939_120325_000066_000002	train-clean-360	She said I had no right to fill the child s mind with falsehoods about her uncle 
none	none	And she wouldn t listen to me she turned me out of the house There was a long silence I don t think I did any good at all said Sophie in a low voice We are going to have to do it all by ourselves CHAPTER XXVI Samuel slept not a wink all that night First he lay wrestling with the congregation And then his thoughts came to Miss Gladys and what he was going to say to her This kindled a fire in his blood and when the first streaks of dawn were in the sky he rose and went out to walk Throughout all these adventures his feelings had been mingled with the excitement of his love for her Samuel hardly knew what to make of himself He had never kissed a woman in his life before but now desire was awake and from the deeps of him the most unexpected emotions came surging sweeping him away He was a prey to longings and terrors Wild ecstasies came to him and then followed plunges into melancholy He longed to see her and other things stood in the way and he did not know why he should be so tormented Just to be in love would have been enough But to have been given the love of a being like Miss Gladys peerless and unapproachable almost unimaginable After hours of pacing the streets he called to see her And she came to him her face alight with eager curiosity and crying Tell me all about it She listened almost dumb with amazement And you said that to my father she exclaimed again and again And to mister Hickman And to old mister Curtis Samuel Samuel It was all true Miss Gladys he insisted Yes she said but to say it to them They turned me out of the church he went on Had they a right to do that I don t know she answered Oh my what a time there will be And what are you going to do now she asked after a pause I don t know I wanted to talk about it with you But what do you think of doing I must expose them to the people Miss Gladys looked at him quickly Oh no Samuel she said you mustn t do that Why not Miss Gladys Because it wouldn t do But Miss Gladys It wouldn t be decent Samuel And it s so much more effective to talk with people privately as you have been doing But who else is there to talk to Why I don t know We ll have to think It s your father and mister Hickman I have to deal with Miss Gladys And they won t listen to me any more Perhaps not But then see how much you have done already What have I done Think how ashamed you have made them But what difference does that make Miss Gladys Don t you see they ve still got the money they ve taken There was a pause This is something I have been thinking said Samuel gravely I ve had this great burden laid upon me and I must carry it I have to see the thing through to the end And I m afraid it will be painful to you You may feel that you can t possibly marry me At these words Miss Gladys gave a wild start She stared at him in consternation Marry you she gasped Yes he said and then seeing the look upon her face he stopped Marry you she panted again A silence followed while they gazed at each other Why Samuel she exclaimed Miss Gladys he said in a low voice you told me that you loved me Yes she said but surely And then suddenly she bit her lips together exclaiming This has gone too far Miss Gladys he cried Samuel she said we have been two bad children and we must not go on in this way The boy gave a gasp of amazement I had no idea that you were taking me so seriously she continued It wasn t fair to me Then then you don t love me he panted Why perhaps she replied how can I tell But one does not marry because one loves Samuel He gazed at her speechless I thought we were playing with each other and I thought you understood it It wasn t very wise perhaps Playing with each other whispered the boy his voice almost gone You take everything with such frightful seriousness she protested Really I don t think you had any right Miss Gladys he cried in sudden anguish and she stopped and stared at him frightened Do you know what you have done to me he exclaimed Samuel she said in a trembling voice I am very much surprised and upset I had no idea of such a thing and you must stop before it is too late But I love you he cried half beside himself Yes she said in great agitation and that s very good of you But there are some things you must remember You you let me embrace you Miss Gladys You let me think of you so Why what is a man to do What was I to make of it I had never loved a woman before And you you led me on Samuel you must not talk like this she broke in I can t listen to you It was a misunderstanding and you must forget it all You must go away We must not meet again Miss Gladys he cried in horror Yes she exclaimed you must go You are going to turn me off he panted Oh how can you say such a thing Why think what you have done to me Samuel protested the girl angrily this is perfectly preposterous behavior of you You have no right to go on in this way You never had any right to to think such things How could you so forget your place And he started as if stung with a whip My place he gasped Yes she said I see I see he burst out It s my place again It s the fact that I have no money Why Samuel she exclaimed What a thing to say It s not that It s that and it s nothing but that It never is anything but that It s because I am a poor boy and couldn t help myself You told me that you loved me and I believed you You were so beautiful and I thought that you must be good Why I worshiped the very ground you walked on I would have done anything in the world for you I would have died for you I went about thinking about you all day I made you into a dream of everything that was good and perfect And now now you say that you were only playing with me Using me for your selfish pleasure just as you do all the other poor people Samuel she gasped Just as your father does the children in his mill Just as your cousin does the poor girls he seduces Just as you do everything in life that you touch The girl had turned scarlet with anger How dare you speak to me that way she cried I dare to speak the truth to anyone And that is the truth about you You are like all the rest of them the members of your class You are parasites vampires you devour other people s lives And you are the worst because you are a woman You are beautiful and you ought to be all the things that I imagined you were But you use your beauty for a snare you wreck men s lives with it Stop Samuel I won t stop You shall hear me You drew me on deliberately you wanted to amuse yourself with me to see what I would do And you had never a thought about me or my rights or the harm you might be doing to me And now you ve got tired and you tell me to end it You tell me about my place What am I in the world for but to afford you amusement What are all the working people for but to save you trouble and keep you beautiful and happy What are the children for but to spin clothes for you to wear And you what do you do for them to pay for their wasted lives for all their toil and suffering Samuel Prescott cried the outraged girl I will not hear another word of this Yes that s just what your father said And what your cousin said And what your clergyman said And you can send for the butler and have me put out but let me tell you that will not be the end of it We shall find some way to get at you The people will not always be your slaves they will not always give their lives to keep you in idleness and luxury You were born to it you ve had everything in the world that you wanted from the first hour of your life And you think that will go on forever that nothing can ever change it But let me tell you that it seems different to the people underneath We are tired of being robbed and spit upon And we mean to fight We mean to fight We don t intend to be starved and tormented forever And then in the midst of his wild tirade Samuel stopped and stared with horror in his eyes realizing that this was Miss Gladys to whom he was talking And suddenly a storm of sobs rose in him and he put his hands to his face and burst into tears and turned and rushed from the room He went down the street like a hunted animal beside himself with grief and looking for some place to hide And as he ran on he pulled out the faded pictures he had carried next to his heart and tore them into pieces and flung them to the winds CHAPTER XXVII When Sophie came home that evening Samuel had mastered himself He told her the story without a tremor in his voice And this was well for he was not prepared for the paroxysm of emotion with which the child received the news Miss Gladys had been the last of Samuel s illusions but she was the only one that Sophie had ever had The child had made her life all over out of the joy of working for her and now hearing the story of her treatment of Samuel she was almost beside herself with grief Samuel was frightened at her violence Listen Sophie he said putting his arm around her We must not forget our duty I could never go back there again exclaimed the child wildly I should die if I had to see her again I don t mean that said the other quickly seeking to divert her thoughts But you must remember what I have to do and you must help me He went on to tell her of his plan to fight for the possession of saint Matthew s Church And we must not give way to bitterness he said it would be a very wicked thing if we did it from anger But how can you help it she cried It is hard said Samuel but I have been wrestling with myself We must not hate these people They have done evil to us but they do not realize it they are poor human beings like the rest of us But they are bad selfish people exclaimed the child I have thought it all out said he I have been walking the streets all day thinking about it And I will not let myself feel anything but pity for them They have done me wrong but it is nothing to the wrong they have done themselves Oh Samuel you are so good exclaimed Sophie and he winced because that was what Miss Gladys had said to him I had to settle it with myself he explained I have got to carry on a fight against them and I have to be sure that I m not just venting my spite What are you going to do asked Sophie I am going to put the facts before the congregation of the church If they will do nothing I am going to the people But how Samuel I am going to call a meeting See I have written this And he took from his pocket a piece of paper on which he had printed in capital letters as follows TO THE MEMBERS OF saint MATTHEWS There is corruption in the church Members of its vestry have bribed the government of the town They are robbing the people The vestry has refused me a hearing and turned me out of the church I appeal to the congregation Next Wednesday evening at eight o clock I will address a meeting on the vacant lot opposite the church and will tell what I know SAMUEL PRESCOTT And what are you going to do with that asked Sophie in wonder I am going to have it printed on little slips and give them out to the people when they are coming out of the church to morrow morning Oh Samuel gasped the child I have to do it he said But Samuel everyone will come people from all over town I can t help that he answered I can t afford to hire a hall and they wouldn t let me speak in the church But can you get this printed so quickly I don t know said he I must find some one Sophie clapped her hands suddenly Oh I know just the very thing she cried Friedrich Bremer has a printing press What Yes His father used to print things They will tell us And so without stopping to eat the two hurried off to the Bremer family and mother and father and all the children sat and listened in astonishment while Samuel told his tale Friedrich was thrilling with excitement and old Johann s red face grew fiery Herr Gott he cried I vas that vay myself once And then will you help me to get them printed asked Samuel Sure replied the other I will do it myself Vy did I go through the Commune And so the whole family adjourned to the attic and the little printing outfit was dragged out from under the piles of rubbish I used it myself said the old carpet designer But vhen I come here they give me a varning and I haf not dared For two years I haf not even been to the meetings of the local Of the what asked Samuel I am a Socialist explained mister Bremer And Samuel gave a start Ought he to accept any help from Socialists But meantime Friedrich was sorting out the type and his father was inspecting Samuel s copy You must make it vith a plenty of paragraphs he said and exclamation points too Then they vill read it They ll read it said Friedrich grimly How shall we print it asked the father and the children rushed downstairs and came back with some sheets of writing paper and a lot of brown wrapping paper They sat on the floor and folded and cut it while Friedrich set the type And this was the way of the printing of Samuel s first manifesto Can you make a speech missus Bremer asked Won t you be frightened To which Samuel answered gravely I don t think so I shall be thinking about what I have to say It was late at night when the two children went home with three hundred copies of the revolutionary document carefully wrapped up from view and they were so much excited by the whole affair that they had actually forgotten about Miss Gladys It was not until he tried to go to sleep that her image came back to him and all his blasted hopes arose to mock at him What a fool he had been How utterly insane all his fantasies seemed to him now So he passed another sleepless night and it was not till daylight that he fell into a troubled slumber He had to control his impatience until after eleven o clock the hour of the service at the church Sophie wished to go with him and share his peril but he would not consent to this He would not be able to give the manifesto to everyone but he could reach enough the others would hear about it So a full hour before the end of the service he took up his post across the street his heart beating furiously He was feeling it must be confessed a good deal like a dynamiter or an assassin The weather was warm and the door of the church was open so that he could hear the booming voice of doctor Vince The sound of the organ brought tears into his eyes he loved the organ and he was not to be allowed to listen to it At last came the end the sounds of the choir receded and the assassin moved over to a strategic position And then came the first of the congregation of all persons the Olympian mister Curtis Will you take one of these sir said Samuel with his heart in his throat And mister Curtis who was mopping his forehead with his handkerchief started as if he had seen a ghost Boy what are you doing he cried but Samuel had darted away trying to give out the slips of paper to the people as they came out at both doors He was quite right in saying that everybody would know about it The people took the slips and read them and then they stopped to stare and exclaim to one another so that there was a regular blockade at the doors of the church By the time that a score of the slips had been given out the members had had time to get their wits back and then there was an attempt to interfere This is an outrage cried mister Curtis and tried to grab Samuel by the arm but the boy wrenched himself loose and darted around the corner to where a stream of people had come out of the side door Take one he exclaimed Pass it along Let everyone know And so he got rid of a score or two more of his slips And then keeping a wary lookout for mister Curtis or any other of the vestrymen he ran around in front again and circled on the edge of the rapidly gathering throng giving away several of the dodgers wherever a hand was held out Give them to everyone he kept repeating in his shrill voice The evil doers must be turned out of the church Then suddenly out of the crowd pushed mister Hamerton breathless and red in the face Samuel he cried pouncing upon him this cannot go on But it must go on replied the boy Let me go Take your hands off me And he raised his voice in a wild shriek There are thieves in the church of Christ In the scuffle the dodgers were scattered on the ground and mister Hamerton stooped to pick them up Samuel seized what he could and darted to the side door again where there were more people eager to take them And so he got rid of the last he had And for the benefit of those whom he still saw emerging he raised his hands and shouted There are men in the vestry of this church who have bribed the city council of Lockmanville I mean to expose them in a meeting across the street on Wednesday night And then he turned and dodging an outraged church member who sought to lay hold of him he sped like a deer down the street He had made his appeal to the congregation CHAPTER XXVIII Samuel rushed home breathless to tell Sophie and pretty soon came the Bremers who had been watching the scene from a distance And the thrilling tale had to be told all over to them Then Johann made a novel announcement For that meeting he said you must get a permit A permit exclaimed Samuel From whom From the police replied the other You must haf it for all street meetings And where do I get it At the station house I think Samuel did not much fancy a visit to the station house which he knew far too well already but he would have gone into a den of lions for the sake of his cause So bright and early the next morning he set out With missus Stedman s help he had persuaded Sophie that she must return to the Wygants and so he walked part of the way with her There was a new sergeant at the desk an Irishman Please sir said the boy is this where I get a permit For what asked the other To hold a meeting on the street sir What sort of a meeting Why I ve just got something to say to the people sir Something to say to the people echoed the other and then suddenly What s your name Samuel Prescott sir And the sergeant s eyes opened wide Oh he said You re that fellow What did you say asked Samuel The chief wants to see you replied the other And so Samuel was escorted into the private room where Chief McCullagh red faced and burly sat at his desk When he saw Samuel he bounded to his feet So here you are he cried To the sergeant he said Leave us alone And when the man had shut the door he strode toward Samuel and thrust a finger into his face Young fellow he cried you promised me you would get out of this town No exclaimed the boy What roared the other No sir It was Charlie Swift promised you that And what did you promise I promised I wouldn t tell anyone about about Master Albert sir And I haven t done it I told Charlie Swift to take you out of town And why didn t you go He didn t And then Samuel stopped He had promised to tell nothing about Charlie Go on cried the chief I I can t tell he stammered What exclaimed the other You want to hide things from me Don t you suppose I know that he s still in town and that you and him have been doin jobs No no cried Samuel in terror You can t lie to me threatened the chief I know you you young villain He stood glaring at the boy for a few moments And you have the nerve to come here he cried What do you want anyway I I want to hold a meeting sir Who s given you a license to make trouble in this town Nobody s given me one yet replied Samuel That s what I came for Don t you get gay with me snapped the chief But Samuel was far from the thought of getting gay with anyone he was trembling in his boots The man towered over him like a huge gorilla and his red face was ferocious Now look here young fellow he went on You might as well get this straight You ll get no permit to make any speeches in Lockmanville D ye see Yes sir And what s more you ll not make any speech D ye see But but gasped the boy And McCullagh shook his finger so that it almost hit Samuel s nose You ll not make any speech You ll not make it on the street and you ll not make it anywheres else in town And you might as well get that through your nut and save yourself trouble And if I hear of you givin out any more papers on the street you ll wish you hadn t that s all young fellow D ye see I see gasped Samuel All right said the chief And if you take my advice you ll get the first train out of Lockmanville and never show your face in it again Now get out of here And Samuel got out and went down the street dumb with dismay So they had got the police after him Of course he would make his speech He could not let himself be stopped by such a thing as that But he saw at once how matters were complicated if the police were to stop him before he had made clear what he had to say they might ruin all his plans He must seek advice about it and he went at once to the carpet factory and sought out the little room where the Bremers sat with their drawing boards and paints So that s it exclaimed Johann They vill shut you up Do you think they can asked the boy Sure they can cried the other They hafn t let the Socialists speak on the streets for years We should haf fought them He reached for his coat Come he said I vill take you to see Tom Everley Who is Tom Everley asked the boy He s a lawyer and he vill tell you He s the secretary of the local A Socialist exclaimed Samuel startled Again it was the Socialists Everley sat in a little office in an out of the way street He was a young chap frank and boyish looking and Samuel s heart warmed to him at once Comrade Everley said the carpet designer here is a boy you ought to help Tell him all about it Samuel you can trust him So Samuel told his tale once more And the other listened with breathless interest and with many exclamations of incredulity and delight When the boy had finished he sprang up excitedly and grasped his hand Samuel Prescott he cried put it there You are a brick Then you ll stand by me exclaimed Samuel breathless with relief Stand by you echoed the other I ll stand by you until hell freezes solid Then he sat down again and began tapping nervously on the desk with his pencil I ll call a special meeting of the local he said They must take you up The movement s been slow in Lockmanville of late and a fight like this is just what the comrades need But I m not a Socialist objected Samuel That s all right replied Everley we don t care about that Samuel had not meant it that way but he could not think how to make his trouble clear I can get the local together to morrow night went on the other There s no time to be lost We must get out a lot of circulars and cover the town But I only wanted the people of the church to come said the boy But others will come anyway said Everley And haven t the people a right to know how they ve been robbed Yes said Samuel they have And perhaps added the other with a smile if the congregation has a little pressure from outside it will be much more apt to take action What we ve got to do with this thing is to make a free speech fight out of it and open the eyes of the whole town Otherwise the police will nip the thing in the bud and no one will ever know what we had You must be careful how you give out those circulars put in Johann They will nip you there if they can That s all right laughed Everley You trust the comrades for that We know a printer we can rely on Samuel drew a deep breath of satisfaction Here was a man who understood things and took hold with conviction a man who was really willing to do something It was very disconcerting that he happened to be a Socialist Everley took up a pencil and wrote the new announcement PEOPLE OF LOCKMANVILLE Having made the discovery that members of the vestry of saint Matthew s Church had been bribing the city council I demanded an investigation and I was turned out of the church I called a meeting to tell the congregation about it but I was refused a permit to speak Chief of Police McCullagh declared to me that I should never make my speech in this town Will you stand by me I intend to speak on Wednesday night at eight P M at the vacant lot opposite the church In the name of Free Speech and Civic Decency SAMUEL PRESCOTT How s that he asked Fine exclaimed Samuel in delight I ll take the risk of having it set up added the lawyer And I ll get the notices to the members of the local off in this evening s mail Come we ll go to see one or two of them now and talk it over with them So they went down and while Johann hurried back to his work Samuel and Everley stopped in a cigar store a couple of doors down the street kept by a little Russian Jew with a merry face and dancing black eyes Comrade Lippman said Everley this is mister Prescott There came also Comrade Minsky from the rear workroom a cigar maker bare armed and very yellow and emaciated To them Everley told briefly the story of Samuel s adventures and what he proposed to do The glow of excitement with which they received the tidings left no doubt as to their attitude And a couple of blocks around the corner was a little shop where a grizzled old carpenter Comrade Beggs clutched Samuel s hand in a grip like one of his vises while he expressed his approval of his course And then they called on doctor Barton a young physician whom Everley declared to be one of the mainstays of the local of the town He got his education abroad he explained so he has none of the narrowness of our physicians His wife s quite a speaker too missus Barton was a sweet faced and mild looking lady who reminded Samuel of the picture of his mother All the while that Everley was telling his story the boy was staring at her and trying to straighten out the tangle of perplexity that was caused in his mind by the idea of her being a Socialist speaker By and by the doctor came in and the story had to be told yet again They were so much interested and excited that they begged their visitors to remain to luncheon They talked the whole problem out and Samuel was struck by the certainty with which their minds took hold of it There was no need of any long explanations with them they seemed to know just what to expect it was as if they possessed some magic key to the inner life of Lockmanville enabling them to understand everyone in it and exactly how he felt and exactly how he would act under any given circumstances All this was an amazing experience for Samuel A few hours ago he had been a voice crying in the wilderness forlorn and solitary and now here was a band of allies sprung up suddenly from the very ground as it seemed Men who knew exactly what was wanted and exactly how to get it who required no persuading who set to work without wasting a word just as if they had been doing such things all their lives He was so swept away with delight that for a while he was tempted to forget what sort of people they were But it came back to him suddenly when they had returned to Everley s office He sat gazing at the young lawyer with such a worried expression on his face that the other asked What s the matter Tell me mister Everley said the boy how can the Bartons believe in free love Believe in free love echoed Everley What put that into your head But don t they believe in free love persisted Samuel Why of course not Who said they did But they are Socialists And the other put down his work and laughed heartily Where did you pick that up he asked Why stammered the boy I ve read everywhere that Socialists believe in free love Wait till you get well going in this reform of yours laughed the young lawyer and then see what you read about yourself But gasped Samuel aghast don t Socialists believe in free love Some of them do I suppose was the reply I know one who believes in ghosts and one who believes in the Pope and one who believes in Adam and Eve How can I help what they believe There was a pause You see explained Everley we are a political party and we can t keep anybody from joining us who wants to And because we are an advanced party all sorts of wild people come to us How can we help that But exclaimed Samuel you are against religion We have nothing to do with religion replied the other I told you we are a political party Some of us have found it necessary to leave the capitalist churches but you will hardly blame us for that N no admitted the boy then he added But don t you want to destroy the Government On the contrary we want to strengthen it But first we have to get it away from the capitalists Then what DO you believe asked Samuel in perplexity Then the other explained that they were seeking to organize and educate the working class for the purpose of bringing about an economic change They wished to take the land and the mines the railroads and the factories out of the hands of the capitalists We believe that such things should not belong to individuals he said but to the people Then there will be work for everyone and everyone will get the full value of his labor and no man will be able to live without working There was a pause while Samuel was getting the meaning of this into his mind But he exclaimed in amazement that is exactly what I believe Of course replied the other it is exactly what everyone with sense believes But but gasped the boy then am I a Socialist Nine tenths of the people in the country are Socialists replied Everley only they haven t found it out yet But cried Samuel you ought to teach them We re doing our best laughed the other Come and help us Samuel was quite dumfounded But how do people come to have all these false ideas about you he asked Those are the ideas that the masters want them to have Samuel was clutching at the arms of his chair Why it s a conspiracy he cried Precisely said the other A conspiracy of the ruling class They own the newspapers and the books the colleges and churches and governments And they tell lies about us and keep us down And so Samuel found himself face to face with the ultimate horror of Capitalism It was bad enough to own the means whereby the people lived and to starve and exploit their bodies But to own their minds and to lead them astray To keep them from finding out the way of their deliverance Surely that was the crime of crimes I can t believe it he panted And the young lawyer answered Come and work with us a while and see for yourself CHAPTER XXIX Samuel went home and faced a surprising experience There was a dapper and well dressed young man waiting to see him My name is Pollard he said and I m from the Lockmanville Express I want to get a story from you A story from me echoed the boy in perplexity An interview explained the other I want to find out about that meeting you re going to hold And so Samuel experienced the great thrill which comes sooner or later to every social reformer He sat in missus Stedman s little parlor and told his tale yet again mister Pollard was young and just out of college and his pencil fairly flew over his notebook Gosh he exclaimed But this is hot stuff To Samuel it was an extraordinary revelation He was surprised that the idea had not occurred to him before What was the use of holding meetings and making speeches when one could have things printed in the papers In the papers everyone would read it and they would get it straight there would be no chance of error Moreover they would read it at their leisure and have time to think it all over And after mister Pollard had gone he rushed off in great excitement to tell Everley about it You won t need to print those circulars he said For I told him where the meeting was to be But Everley only smiled at this We ll get out our stuff just the same he said You d better wait until you ve seen what the Express prints What do you mean asked the boy But Everley would not explain he merely told Samuel to wait He did not seem to be as much excited as he should have been Samuel went home again And later on in the afternoon while missus Stedman had gone out to the grocer s there came a knock on the door and he opened it and to his amazement found himself confronted by Billy Finnegan Hello young fellow said Finnegan Hello said Samuel What s this I hear about your making a speech asked Finnegan I m going to was the reply But how did you know I got it from Callahan Slattery told him Slattery Has he heard about it Gee young fellow What do you think he s boss for And Finnegan gazed around the room to make sure that they were alone Sammy he said I ve come to give you a friendly tip I hope you ll have sense enough to take it What is it asked the other Don t try to make any speech Why not Because you ain t a going to be let to make it Sammy But how can they stop me I dunno Sammy But they ain t a going to let you There was a pause It s a crazy thing you re tryin to do said the other And take my word for it somethin will happen to you if you go on What will happen I dunno my boy maybe you ll fall into the river Fall into the river Yes or else run your head into a slungshot some night in a dark alley I can t tell you what only you won t make the speech Samuel was dumfounded You can t mean such things he gasped Sure I mean them was the reply Why not Samuel did not respond I don t know why you re tryin to do this thing went on the other nor who s backing you But from what I can make out you ve got the goods and you ve got them on most everybody in the town You ve got Slattery and you ve got Pat McCullagh and you ve got the machine You ve got Wygant and Hickman you ve even got something on Bertie Lockman haven t you I suppose I have said Samuel But I m not going to tell that Well they don t know what you re going to tell and they won t take any chances They won t let you tell anything But can such things be done panted the boy They re done all the time said the other Why see it stands to reason Wouldn t folks be finding out things like this and wouldn t they be tellin them To be sure said Samuel That s what puzzled me Well said the bartender they ain t let to Don t you see I see whispered the boy There s a crowd that runs this town Sammy and they mean to go on runnin it And don t you think they can t find ways of shuttin up a kid like you But mister Finnegan it would be murder Well they wouldn t have to do it themselves would they When Henry Hickman wants a chicken for dinner he don t have to wring its neck with his own hands Samuel could find nothing to reply to that He sat dumb with horror You see continued Finnegan after a bit I know about this game and I m givin you a friendly word What the hell does a kid like you want to be reformin things for anyway What else can I do asked Samuel To which the other answered Do Get yourself a decent job and find some girl you like and settle down You ll never know what there is in life Sammy till you ve got a baby But Samuel only shook his head The plan did not appeal to him I ll try to keep out of trouble he said but I MUST make that speech So Finnegan went out shaking his head and grumbling to himself And Samuel hurried off to see his lawyer friend again The result of the visit was that Everley exacted from him a solemn promise that he would not go out of the house after dark I know what was done in this town during the strike said the other and I don t want to take any chances Now that they have finished the unions there s nobody left but us So Samuel stayed at home and told Sophie and her mother all about his various experiences and about the people he had met The child was almost beside herself with delight Oh I knew that help would come she kept saying I knew that help would come Worn out as he was the young reformer could hardly sleep that night for all the excitement And early in the morning he was up and out hunting for a copy of the Express He stood on the street corner and opened it He glanced at the first page there was nothing there He glanced at the back page and then at one page after another seeking for the one that was given up to the story But there was no such page And then he went back and read over the headings of each column and still he did not find it And then he began a third time reading carefully each tiny item And so after nearly an hour s search when he found himself lost in a maze of advertisements he brought himself to realize that there was not a line of the story in the paper When Everley arrived at his office that morning Samuel was waiting for him on the steps Seeing the paper in the other s hand the young lawyer laughed You found out have you he said It s not here cried Samuel I knew just what would happen said the other But I thought I d let you see for yourself But what does it mean demanded the boy It means was the answer that the Lockman estate has a mortgage of one hundred thousand dollars on the Express And Samuel s jaw fell and he stood staring at his friend Now you see what it is to be a Socialist laughed Everley And Samuel saw

7939_120330_000004_000000	train-clean-360	After supper that evening came Everley with Friederich Bremer to take Samuel to the meeting of the local where he was to tell his story 
7939_120330_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The local met in an obscure hall over a grocery shop 
7939_120330_000005_000001	train-clean-360	There were present those whom Samuel had met the night before and about a score of others 
7939_120330_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Most of them were working men but there were several who appeared to be well to do shopkeepers and clerks 
7939_120330_000005_000003	train-clean-360	Samuel noticed that they all called one another comrade and several of them addressed him thus which gave him a queer feeling 
none	none	Also he noted that there were women present and that one of them presided at the meeting Everley made a speech reading Samuel s manifesto and telling how it had been given out Then he called upon Samuel 
7939_120330_000006_000002	train-clean-360	The boy stood upon his feet and suddenly a deadly terror seized hold upon him 
7939_120330_000006_000003	train-clean-360	Suppose he should not be able to make a speech after all 
none	none	Suppose he should be nervous 
7939_120330_000006_000005	train-clean-360	What would they think of him 
none	none	But he clenched his hands what did it matter what they thought of him 
7939_120330_000006_000007	train-clean-360	The poor were suffering and the truth was crying out for vindication 
none	none	He would tell these men what had happened to him So he began He told how he had been robbed and how he had sought in vain for work and how he had been arrested 
7939_120330_000007_000002	train-clean-360	And because he saw that these were people who understood he found himself a case and thinking no longer about himself 
7939_120330_000007_000003	train-clean-360	He talked for nearly half an hour and there was quite a sensation when he finished 
none	none	Then Everley rose to his feet again
7939_120330_000008_000001	train-clean-360	 Comrades he said for the past year I have been urging that the local must make a fight for free speech in this town 
none	none	And it seems to me that the occasion has now come 
7939_120330_000008_000003	train-clean-360	If we do not take up this fight we might just as well give up 
7939_120330_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 That s right cried Beggs the old carpenter 
7939_120330_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 I took the liberty of ordering circulars continued Everley 
7939_120330_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 There was no time to be lost and I felt sure that the comrades would back me I now move that the local take charge of the meeting to morrow evening and that the two thousand circulars I have here be given out secretly to night 
7939_120330_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 I second that motion said missus Barton 
7939_120330_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 It must be understood added Everley that we can t expect help from the papers 
7939_120330_000012_000001	train-clean-360	And our people ought to hear this story as well as the members of the church 
none	none	And then he read the circulars and the motion was put and carried unanimously
7939_120330_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Now said Everley I suggest that the local make this the occasion of a contest for the right to hold street meetings in Lockmanville 
7939_120330_000014_000001	train-clean-360	As you know the police have refused permits ever since the strike 
7939_120330_000014_000002	train-clean-360	And I move that beginning with Thursday evening we hold a meeting on the corner of Market and Main streets and tell this story to the public 
7939_120330_000014_000003	train-clean-360	And that we continue to hold a meeting every night thereafter until we have made good our right 
none	none	Samuel could see from the faces of the men what a serious proposition this was to them 
7939_120330_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Everley launched into an impassioned speech 
none	none	The workingmen of the town had lost their last hope in the unions they were suffering from the hard times and now if ever was the time to open their eyes to the remedy And the Socialists were powerless because they had permitted the police to frighten them 
7939_120330_000015_000004	train-clean-360	Now they must make a stand 
7939_120330_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 You realize that it will mean going to jail asked doctor Barton 
7939_120330_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 I realize it said Everley 
7939_120330_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 We shall probably have to go several times 
none	none	But if we make up our minds from the beginning we can win we shall have the sympathy of the people and also we can break the conspiracy of silence of the newspapers
7939_120330_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 That is the thing we must think of said the woman in the chair 
7939_120330_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I am ready to do what I can added the lawyer 
none	none	I will give my services free to defend the speakers or I will be the first man to be arrested whichever the comrades prefer We will lose our jobs said some one in the rear of the room Yes said Everley that is something you will have to consider You know well enough how much I have lost already 
7939_120330_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Samuel listened in breathless excitement to this discussion 
none	none	Here were poor people people with no more resources than he and at the mercy of the same forces which had been crushing him Here was one man who had lost an eye in the glass works and another a railroad brakeman who was just out of the hospital after losing a leg Here were men pale and haggard from hunger men with wives and children dependent upon them yet they were giving their time and their money risking their very existence in the cause of human freedom Had he ever met a group of men like this before Had he ever dreamed that such men were living He had thought that he was alone that he had all the burdens of humanity upon his own shoulders And now here were people who were ready to hold up his hands and from the discussion he gathered that they were part of a vast organization that there existed such locals in every city and town in the country They made their own nominations and voted for their own candidates at every election they published many newspapers and magazines and books And they were part of an army of men who were banded together in every civilized nation 
7939_120330_000023_000004	train-clean-360	Wherever Capitalism had come there men were uniting against it and every day their power grew there was nothing that could stop them 
none	none	These men had seen the vision of the new time that was coming and there burned in them a fire of conviction Suddenly Samuel realized the import of that word comrade which they gave one another they were men bound together by the memory of persecutions and by the presence of ruthless enemies 
7939_120330_000024_000002	train-clean-360	They knew what they were facing at this moment not only Chief McCullagh with his policemen and their clubs not only the subsidized Express with its falsehoods and ridicule but all the political and business power of the Hickmans and Wygants 
7939_120330_000024_000003	train-clean-360	They were facing arrest and imprisonment humiliation and disgrace perhaps ruin and starvation Only in this way could they reach the ears of the people 
none	none	Comrades the young lawyer was saying every step that has been taken in the progress of humanity has been taken because men have been willing to give their lives Everywhere that our movement has grown it has been in the face of persecution And sooner or later we must make up our minds to it we may wait for years but nothing can be accomplished until we have faced this issue 
7939_120330_000025_000003	train-clean-360	And so I ask you to join with me in taking this pledge that we will speak on the streets of Lockmanville next Saturday night and that we will continue to speak there as often as need be until we have vindicated our rights as American citizens 
none	none	There was a solemn hush when he finished one by one the men and women arose and offered themselves I have been out of work for four months said one and I have been promised a job next week 
7939_120330_000027_000001	train-clean-360	If I am arrested I know that I will not get it 
none	none	But still I will speak
7939_120330_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 And I am in Wygant s cotton mill said another 
none	none	And I m not young and when I m turned out it will not be easy for me 
7939_120330_000028_000002	train-clean-360	But I will help 
none	none	And I too put in Lippman the cigar store keeper my wife can tend the shop There was a general laugh at this And then Friedrich Bremer sprang up My father has been warned he cried
7939_120330_000030_000002	train-clean-360	 But I will speak also 
none	none	And I exclaimed Samuel I think I am going to be a Socialist 
7939_120330_000031_000002	train-clean-360	Will you let me help 
7939_120330_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 No one s help will be refused in a crisis like this said Everley 
7939_120330_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 We must stand by our guns for if they can crush us this time it may be years before we can be heard 
none	none	And then somewhere in the hall a voice began to sing 
7939_120330_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Others took it up until the walls of the building shook with a mighty chant 
7939_120330_000033_000002	train-clean-360	 What is it whispered Samuel to Friedrich 
none	none	It is called The Red Flag replied Friedrich And Samuel sat spellbound listening while they sang 
7939_120330_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Hark to the thunder hark to the tramp a myriad army comes 
7939_120330_000037_000000	train-clean-360	An army sprung from a hundred lands speaking a hundred tongues 
7939_120330_000038_000000	train-clean-360	And overhead a portent new a blood red banner see 
none	none	The nations gather in affright to ask what the sign may be Banner of crimson banner bright banner flaunting the sky What is the word that ye bring to men the hope that ye hold on high We come from the fields we come from the forge we come from the land and sea 
7939_120330_000043_000000	train-clean-360	We come in the right of our new born might to set the people free 
7939_120330_000051_000000	train-clean-360	We come in the right of our new born might to set the people free 
7939_120330_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Masters we left you a world to make the planning was yours to do 
none	none	We were the toilers humble and sad we gave our faith to you And now with a dread in our hearts we stand and gaze at the work of the years 
7939_120330_000047_000000	train-clean-360	We have builded a temple with pillars white ye have stained it with blood and tears 
none	none	For our little ones with their teeming hopes ye have roofed the sweatshop den And our daughters fair ye have prisoned in the reeking brothel s pen And so for the sign of our murdered hopes our blood red banner see We come in the right of our new born might to set the people free Tremble oh masters tremble all who live by others toil 
7939_120330_000053_000000	train-clean-360	We come your dungeon walls to raze your citadel to spoil 
7939_120330_000054_000000	train-clean-360	Yours is the power of club and jail yours is the axe and fire 
none	none	But ours is the hope of human hearts and the strength of the soul s desire Ours is the blazing banner sweeping the sky along 
7939_120330_000057_000000	train-clean-360	Ours the host the marching host hark to our battle song 
none	none	Chanting of brotherhood chanting of freedom dreaming the world to be We come in the right of our new born might to set the people free CHAPTER XXXI While the other members of the local scattered to distribute the circulars Everley and Friedrich escorted Samuel home and saw him safely in and the door locked They had supplied him with some Socialist papers and pamphlets and he spent most of the next day devouring these They spread a picture of the whole wonderful movement before him they explained to him all the mechanism of the cruel system in the cogs of which he had been caught It was all so very obvious that Samuel found himself in a state of exasperation with the people who did not yet understand it and spent his time wrestling in imagination with all those he had ever known with his brothers and with Finnegan and with Charlie Swift with Master Albert and mister Wygant with Professor Stewart and doctor Vince Most of all he labored with Miss Gladys and he pictured how it would be after the Revolution when he would be famous and she would be poor and he might magnanimously forgive her And when Sophie came home he explained it all to her It did not take much to make a revolutionist out of Sophie She had become quite thoroughly what the Socialists called class conscious The members of the local had been anxious about Samuel all day Everley had come in twice in the afternoon to make sure that he was safe and he came over again after supper and said that Beggs and Lippman and the Bartons and himself were coming to act as a body guard to take Samuel to the meeting The circulars had created a tremendous sensation the whole town was talking about it and the police were furious at the way they had been outwitted So the hour of the meeting drew near It was as if a great shadow were gathering over them They were nervous and restless Samuel pacing the room wandering about here and there His speech was seething within him He saw before him the eager multitude and he was laying bare to them the picture of their wrongs So much depended upon this speech If he failed now he failed in everything all that he had done before has gone for nothing Ah if only one had a voice that could reach the whole world that could shout these things into the ears of the oppressed His friends had said they would come at a quarter to eight But they came at half past seven and sat round and waited It was thought best that they should not arrive until the precise minute of the meeting and meantime they outlined to Samuel the plan of campaign they had formed doctor Barton was to make the opening speech introducing Samuel and by way of outwitting the police he was to be particularly careful to get into this introduction all the essential facts which it was desired to lay before the people He was to tell about the twenty thousand dollars which Hickman paid to Slattery and about the acknowledgment which Wygant had made to Samuel and about how the boy had been turned out of saint Matthew s Church If the police attempted to interfere with this the doctor was to persist until he had been actually placed under arrest and then others were to take up the attempt in different places until six had been arrested In this case Samuel was to make no attempt to speak at all they would save him for an out door meeting and also Everley who was to defend them in court More circulars would be given out the next afternoon and another attempt to speak would be made that evening All this was duly impressed upon the boy and then the little company set forth doctor Barton walked on one side of him and Everley on the other missus Barton missus Stedman and Sophie came next and Beggs and Lippman brought up the rear So they marched along they kept their eyes open and every time they had to pass a man they gave him a wide berth So they came to the place of the meeting At the corner were the Bremers and half a dozen others who formed a ring about them There was a huge crowd they said the lot was thronged and the people extended to streets on every side There was a score of policemen scattered about and no doubt there were many detectives Promptly on the minute of eight the little group approached There was a murmur of excitement among the waiting crowd as they started to force their way through Samuel s heart was thumping like mad and his knees were trembling so that he could hardly walk The people gave way and they found themselves in the center where several of the Socialists stood guard over the half dozen boxes from which the speaking was to be done Without a moment s delay doctor Barton mounted up Fellow citizens he called in a clear ringing voice and instantly a hush fell upon the crowd and a thousand faces were turned toward him We are here he began for a very important purpose Instantly a policeman pushed his way toward him Have you a permit for this meeting he demanded We have been refused a permit proclaimed doctor Barton to the crowd We are here as law abiding citizens demanding our right to free speech You cannot speak declared the policeman There has been bribery of the city council of Lockmanville shouted the doctor You cannot speak cried the policeman sharply Henry Hickman paid twenty thousand dollars to the city council to prevent the passage of the water bill cried the speaker Come down from there commanded the officer and made a grab at him I will not stop until I am arrested declared the doctor I am here to protest against bribery Come down and shut up shouted the other For shame For shame said voices in the crowd Let him speak That charge was made before the vestry of the saint Matthew s Church And the vestry refused to investigate it and turned out a member of the church And we are here And so still shouting the doctor was dragged off the box and collared by the policeman An outrage cried people in the audience Let him go on And yet others shouted Arrest him The throng was in a turmoil and in the midst of it Lippman who was the second victim appointed for the sacrifice sprang upon the stump of an old tree a little at one side and shrieked at the top of his lungs Henry Hickman paid twenty thousand dollars to Slattery to beat the water bill and now he and the Lockman estate are making ten thousand dollars a month out of it And Wygant confessed to our speaker that he ran the city government to get franchise favors And then Lippman was seized by an officer and dragged off his perch and choked into silence surrounded meanwhile by a crowd of indignantly protesting citizens It was quite clear by this time that the crowd had come to hear Samuel s speech and was angry at being balked There was a general shout of protest that made the policemen glad of their numbers Of these exciting events Samuel and Everley had been witnesses from the vantage point of a soap box Now suddenly the boy caught his friend s arm and pointed crying Who s that man Near the outskirts of the thrown was a big burly individual who had been roaring in a furious voice For shame Go on and waving his fists in the air I don t know said Everley I never saw him before An outrage yelled the man Kill the police Smash them Drive them away And Everley caught the boy s arm crying excitedly He s been sent here I ll wager They want to provoke trouble And even as he spoke the two saw the man stoop and pick up a brick bat and fling it into the center of the crowd where the police were massing Arrest that man shouted Everley indignantly and leaped forward and plunged through the throng to reach him There was a roar from the crowd and Samuel saw that several men had grappled with the bully he saw also that the police in the center of the throng had drawn their clubs and were beginning to strike at the people A burly sergeant was commanding them and forcing back the crowd by jabbing men in the stomachs Meantime the next speaker a woman had mounted upon a box and was crying in a shrill voice We are Socialists We are the only political party which dares to speak for the working class of Lockmanville We protest against this outrage We demand free speech There has been bribery in our city council Then suddenly the boy heard a disturbance behind him and turned just in the nick of time A fellow had thrust his way through the crowd toward him a rowdy with a brutal half drunken face And Samuel saw him raise his hand with some dark object in it and aim a smashing blow at his head The boy ducked and raised his arm He felt a sharp agonizing pain and his arm dropped helpless at his side Something struck him across the forehead cutting a gash out of which hot blood spurted blinding him He heard Beggs who was beside him give a shout Down And realizing that his life was aimed at he dropped like a flash and put his head under him covering it with one arm as well as he could There was a struggle going on over him Men were pushing and shouting and some one kicked him savagely upon the leg He crawled on a little way still keeping his head down underneath the feet of the contendents He heard Beggs shouting for help and heard the Bremers answering he heard the roar of the throng all about the sharp commands of the police sergeant and the crack of clubs falling upon the heads of men and women And then he swooned and lay there his face in a pool of his own blood Meanwhile one by one three more speakers rose and made their attempts and were arrested while the indignant people voiced their helpless protests Then suddenly somewhere in the crowd a woman began to sing Others took up the song it swelled louder until it rang above all the uproar It was the hymn that Samuel had heard at the meeting of the local The Red Flag It took hold of the crowd men followed the melody even though they did not know the words They continued to sing while the police were leading away their prisoners they followed all the way to the station house with shouts of protest and of encouragement for the victims And so the throng moved on and the uproar died away There was left upon the scene a little group of frightened people gathered about two who lay upon the ground One of them was Samuel unconscious and bleeding and the other was Sophie clinging to him and sobbing upon his bosom frantic with grief and fear And meanwhile in the distance one could still hear the melody ringing Yours is the power of club and jail yours is the axe and fire But ours is the hope of human hearts and the strength of the soul s desire End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Samuel the Seeker
