831_130746_000005_000002	train-clean-100	turned 
none	none	to the right hand side where the blocks of white linen and piles of blankets rise up to the rail from which the pink and blue prints depend you might have been served by the central figure of this story that is now beginning He would have come forward bowing and swaying he would have extended two hands with largish knuckles and enormous cuffs over the counter 
831_130746_000052_000005	train-clean-100	and he 
none	none	would have asked you protruding a pointed chin and without the slightest anticipation of pleasure in his manner what he might have the pleasure of showing you Under certain circumstances as for instance hats baby linen gloves silks lace or curtains he would simply have bowed politely and with a drooping expression and making a kind of circular sweep invited you to step this way and so led you beyond his ken but under other and happier conditions huckaback blankets dimity cretonne linen calico are cases in point he would have requested you to take a seat emphasising the hospitality by leaning over the counter and gripping a chair back in a spasmodic manner and so proceeded to obtain unfold and exhibit his goods for your consideration 
831_130739_000007_000004	train-clean-100	Under which happier circumstances you might if of an observing turn of mind and not too much of a housewife to be inhuman have given the central figure of this story less cursory attention 
831_130739_000008_000000	train-clean-100	Now if you had noticed anything about him it would have been chiefly to notice how little he was noticeable 
none	none	He wore the black morning coat the black tie and the speckled grey nether parts descending into shadow and mystery below the counter of his craft 
831_130739_000008_000002	train-clean-100	He was of a pallid complexion hair of a kind of dirty fairness greyish eyes and a skimpy immature moustache under his peaked indeterminate nose His features were all small but none ill shaped 
none	none	A rosette of pins decorated the lappel of his coat His remarks you would observe were entirely what people used to call cliche formulae not organic to the occasion but stereotyped ages ago and learnt years since by heart This madam he would say is selling very
831_130746_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 well 
none	none	We are doing a very good article at four three a yard We could show you something better of course No trouble madam I assure you Such were the simple counters of his intercourse 
831_130739_000008_000006	train-clean-100	So I say he would have presented himself to your superficial observation 
none	none	He would have danced about behind the counter have neatly refolded the goods he had shown you have put on one side those you selected extracted a little book with a carbon leaf and a tinfoil sheet from a fixture made you out a little bill in that weak flourishing hand peculiar to drapers and have bawled Sayn Then a puffy little shop walker would have come into view looked at the bill for a second very hard showing you a parting down the middle of his head meanwhile have scribbled a still more flourishing J M all over the document have asked you if there was nothing more have stood by you supposing that you were paying cash until the central figure of this story reappeared with the change One glance more at him and the puffy little shop walker would have been bowing you out with fountains of civilities at work all about you And so the interview would have terminated 
831_130739_000009_000000	train-clean-100	But real literature as distinguished from anecdote does not concern itself with superficial appearances alone 
831_130739_000009_000001	train-clean-100	Literature is revelation Modern literature is indecorous revelation 
831_130739_000009_000002	train-clean-100	It is the duty of the earnest author to tell you what you would not have seen even at the cost of some blushes 
831_130739_000009_000003	train-clean-100	And the thing that you would not have seen about this young man and the thing of the greatest moment to this story the thing that must be told if the book is to be written was let us face it bravely the Remarkable Condition of this Young Man s Legs 
831_130739_000010_000000	train-clean-100	Let us approach the business with dispassionate explicitness 
831_130739_000010_000001	train-clean-100	Let us assume something of the scientific spirit the hard almost professorial tone of the conscientious realist 
none	none	Let us treat this young man s legs as a mere diagram and indicate the points of interest with the unemotional precision of a lecturer s pointer 
831_130739_000010_000003	train-clean-100	And so to our revelation 
831_130739_000010_000004	train-clean-100	On the internal aspect of the right ankle of this young man you would have observed ladies and gentlemen a contusion and an abrasion on the internal aspect of the left ankle a contusion also on its external aspect a large yellowish bruise 
none	none	On his left shin there were two bruises one a leaden yellow graduating here and there into purple and another obviously of more recent date of a blotchy red tumid and threatening 
831_130739_000010_000006	train-clean-100	Proceeding up the left leg in a spiral manner an unnatural hardness and redness would have been discovered on the upper aspect of the calf and above the knee and on the inner side an extraordinary expanse of bruised surface a kind of closely stippled shading of contused points 
831_130739_000010_000007	train-clean-100	The right leg would be found to be bruised in a marvellous manner all about and under the knee and particularly on the interior aspect of the knee 
831_130739_000010_000008	train-clean-100	So far we may proceed with our details Fired by these discoveries an investigator might perhaps have pursued his inquiries further to bruises on the shoulders elbows and even the finger joints of the central figure of our story 
831_130739_000010_000009	train-clean-100	He had indeed been bumped and battered at an extraordinary number of points 
none	none	But enough of realistic description is as good as a feast and we have exhibited enough for our purpose 
831_130739_000010_000011	train-clean-100	Even in literature one must know where to draw the line 
none	none	Now the reader may be inclined to wonder how a respectable young shopman should have got his legs and indeed himself generally into such a dreadful condition 
831_130739_000011_000001	train-clean-100	One might fancy that he had been sitting with his nether extremities in some complicated machinery a threshing machine say or one of those hay making furies 
none	none	But Sherlock Holmes now happily dead would have fancied nothing of the kind He would have recognised at once that the bruises on the internal aspect of the left leg considered in the light of the distribution of the other abrasions and contusions pointed unmistakably to the violent impact of the Mounting Beginner upon the bicycling saddle and that the ruinous state of the right knee was equally eloquent of the concussions attendant on that person s hasty frequently causeless and invariably ill conceived descents 
831_130739_000011_000004	train-clean-100	One large bruise on the shin is even more characteristic of the prentice cyclist for upon every one of them waits the jest of the unexpected treadle 
831_130739_000011_000005	train-clean-100	You try at least to walk your machine in an easy manner and whack you are rubbing your shin 
831_130739_000011_000006	train-clean-100	So out of innocence we ripen 
831_130739_000011_000007	train-clean-100	Two bruises on that place mark a certain want of aptitude in learning such as one might expect in a person unused to muscular exercise 
831_130739_000011_000008	train-clean-100	Blisters on the hands are eloquent of the nervous clutch of the wavering rider 
none	none	And so forth until Sherlock is presently explaining by the help of the minor injuries that the machine ridden is an old fashioned affair with a fork instead of the diamond frame a cushioned tire well worn on the hind wheel and a gross weight all on of perhaps three and forty pounds 
831_130739_000012_000000	train-clean-100	The revelation is made 
none	none	Behind the decorous figure of the attentive shopman that I had the honour of showing you at first rises a vision of a nightly struggle of two dark figures and a machine in a dark road the road to be explicit from Roehampton to Putney Hill and with this vision is the sound of a heel spurning the gravel a gasping and grunting a shouting of Steer man steer a wavering unsteady flight a spasmodic turning of the missile edifice of man and machine and a collapse 
831_130739_000012_000002	train-clean-100	Then you descry dimly through the dusk the central figure of this story sitting by the roadside and rubbing his leg at some new place and his friend sympathetic but by no means depressed repairing the displacement of the handle bar 
831_130739_000013_000000	train-clean-100	Thus even in a shop assistant does the warmth of manhood assert itself and drive him against all the conditions of his calling against the counsels of prudence and the restrictions of his means to seek the wholesome delights of exertion and danger and pain 
831_130739_000013_000001	train-clean-100	And our first examination of the draper reveals beneath his draperies the man 
831_130739_000013_000002	train-clean-100	To which initial fact among others we shall come again in the end 
none	none	II 
831_130739_000015_000000	train-clean-100	But enough of these revelations 
831_130739_000015_000001	train-clean-100	The central figure of our story is now going along behind the counter a draper indeed with your purchases in his arms to the warehouse where the various articles you have selected will presently be packed by the senior porter and sent to you 
none	none	Returning thence to his particular place he lays hands on a folded piece of gingham and gripping the corners of the folds in his hands begins to straighten them punctiliously 
831_130739_000015_000003	train-clean-100	Near him is an apprentice apprenticed to the same high calling of draper s assistant a ruddy red haired lad in a very short tailless black coat and a very high collar who is deliberately unfolding and refolding some patterns of cretonne 
none	none	By twenty one he too may hope to be a full blown assistant even as 
3033-130750-0026	train-other-500	mister Hoopdriver
none	none	 Prints depend from the brass rails above them behind are fixtures full of white packages containing as inscriptions testify Lino Hd Bk and Mull You might imagine to see them that the two were both intent upon nothing but smoothness of textile and rectitude of fold 
831_130739_000015_000007	train-clean-100	But to tell the truth neither is thinking of the mechanical duties in hand 
831_130739_000015_000008	train-clean-100	The assistant is dreaming of the delicious time only four hours off now when he will resume the tale of his bruises and abrasions 
none	none	The apprentice is nearer the long long thoughts of boyhood and his imagination rides cap a pie through the chambers of his brain seeking some knightly quest in honour of that Fair Lady the last but one of the girl apprentices to the dress making upstairs 
831_130739_000015_000010	train-clean-100	He inclines rather to street fighting against revolutionaries because then she could see him from the window 
831_130739_000016_000000	train-clean-100	Jerking them back to the present comes the puffy little shop walker with a paper in his hand 
831_130739_000016_000001	train-clean-100	The apprentice becomes extremely active 
none	none	The shopwalker eyes the goods in hand Hoopdriver he says how s that line of g sez x ginghams Hoopdriver returns from an imaginary triumph over the uncertainties of dismounting
831_130739_000017_000001	train-clean-100	 They re going fairly well sir 
none	none	But the larger checks seem hanging 
831_130739_000018_000000	train-clean-100	The shop walker brings up parallel to the counter 
831_130739_000018_000001	train-clean-100	 Any particular time when you want your holidays he asks 
831_130739_000019_000000	train-clean-100	Hoopdriver pulls at his skimpy moustache 
831_130739_000019_000001	train-clean-100	 No Don t want them too late sir of course 
none	none	How about this day week Hoopdriver becomes rigidly meditative gripping the corners of the gingham folds in his hands 
831_130739_000021_000001	train-clean-100	His face is eloquent of conflicting considerations 
831_130739_000021_000002	train-clean-100	Can he learn it in a week 
831_130739_000021_000003	train-clean-100	That s the question Otherwise Briggs will get next week and he will have to wait until September when the weather is often uncertain 
831_130739_000021_000004	train-clean-100	He is naturally of a sanguine disposition 
831_130739_000021_000005	train-clean-100	All drapers have to be or else they could never have the faith they show in the beauty washability and unfading excellence of the goods they sell you 
831_130739_000021_000006	train-clean-100	The decision comes at last That ll do me very well said mister Hoopdriver terminating the pause 
831_130739_000022_000000	train-clean-100	The die is cast 
none	none	The shop walker makes a note of it and goes on to Briggs in the dresses the next in the strict scale of precedence of the Drapery Emporium mister Hoopdriver in alternating spasms anon straightens his gingham and anon becomes meditative with his tongue in the hollow of his decaying wisdom tooth 
831_130739_000024_000000	train-clean-100	III
831_130739_000025_000000	train-clean-100	At supper that night holiday talk held undisputed sway 
none	none	mister Pritchard spoke of Scotland Miss Isaacs clamoured of Bettws y Coed mister Judson displayed a proprietary interest in the Norfolk Broads
831_130739_000025_000002	train-clean-100	 I said Hoopdriver when the question came to him 
831_130739_000025_000003	train-clean-100	 Why cycling of course 
831_130746_000017_000001	train-clean-100	Why 
none	none	cycling of course
831_130739_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 You re never going to ride that dreadful machine of yours day after day said Miss Howe of the Costume Department 
831_130739_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 I am said Hoopdriver as calmly as possible pulling at the insufficient moustache 
831_130739_000027_000001	train-clean-100	 I m going for a Cycling Tour 
831_130739_000027_000002	train-clean-100	Along the South Coast 
831_130739_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 Well all I hope mister Hoopdriver is that you ll get fine weather said Miss Howe 
831_130739_000028_000001	train-clean-100	 And not come any nasty croppers 
none	none	And done forget some tinscher of arnica in yer bag said the junior apprentice in the very high collar He had witnessed one of the lessons at the top of Putney Hill
831_130739_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 You stow it said mister Hoopdriver looking hard and threateningly at the junior apprentice and suddenly adding in a tone of bitter contempt Jampot 
831_130739_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 I m getting fairly safe upon it now he told Miss Howe 
831_130746_000041_000000	train-clean-100	 safe 
none	none	upon it now he told Miss Howe 
831_130739_000032_000000	train-clean-100	At other times Hoopdriver might have further resented the satirical efforts of the apprentice but his mind was too full of the projected Tour to admit any petty delicacies of dignity 
none	none	He left the supper table early so that he might put in a good hour at the desperate gymnastics up the Roehampton Road before it would be time to come back for locking up When the gas was turned off for the night he was sitting on the edge of his bed rubbing arnica into his knee a new and very big place and studying a Road Map of the South of England Briggs of the dresses who shared the room with him was sitting up in bed and trying to smoke in the dark 
831_130739_000032_000004	train-clean-100	Briggs had never been on a cycle in his life but he felt Hoopdriver s inexperience and offered such advice as occurred to him 
831_130739_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 Have the machine thoroughly well oiled said Briggs carry one or two lemons with you don t tear yourself to death the first day and sit upright 
831_130739_000033_000001	train-clean-100	Never lose control of the machine and always sound the bell on every possible opportunity 
831_130739_000033_000002	train-clean-100	You mind those things and nothing very much can t happen to you Hoopdriver you take my word 
831_130739_000034_000000	train-clean-100	He would lapse into silence for a minute save perhaps for a curse or so at his pipe and then break out with an entirely different set of tips 
831_130739_000035_000000	train-clean-100	 Avoid running over dogs Hoopdriver whatever you do 
none	none	It s one of the worst things you can do to run over a dog 
831_130739_000035_000002	train-clean-100	Never let the machine buckle there was a man killed only the other day through his wheel buckling don t scorch don t ride on the foot path keep your own side of the road and if you see a tramline go round the corner at once and hurry off into the next county and always light up before dark 
831_130739_000038_000003	train-clean-100	You mind just a few little things like that 
831_130739_000035_000003	train-clean-100	You mind just a few little things like that Hoopdriver and nothing much can t happen to you you take my word 
831_130739_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 Right you are said Hoopdriver 
831_130739_000036_000001	train-clean-100	 Good night old man 
none	none	Good night said Briggs and there was silence for a space save for the succulent respiration of the pipe 
831_130739_000037_000001	train-clean-100	Hoopdriver rode off into Dreamland on his machine and was scarcely there before he was pitched back into the world of sense again Something what was it 
none	none	Never oil the steering 
831_130739_000038_000001	train-clean-100	It s fatal a voice that came from round a fitful glow of light was saying 
none	none	And clean the chain daily with black lead You mind just a few little things like that Lord LOVE us said Hoopdriver and pulled the bedclothes over his ears IV THE RIDING FORTH OF mister HOOPDRIVER Only those who toil six long days out of the seven and all the year round save for one brief glorious fortnight or ten days in the summer time know the exquisite sensations of the First Holiday Morning All the dreary uninteresting routine drops from you suddenly your chains fall about your feet All at once you are Lord of yourself Lord of every hour in the long vacant day you may go where you please call none Sir or Madame have a lappel free of pins doff your black morning coat and wear the colour of your heart and be a Man You grudge sleep you grudge eating and drinking even their intrusion on those exquisite moments There will be no more rising before breakfast in casual old clothing to go dusting and getting ready in a cheerless shutter darkened wrappered up shop no more imperious cries of Forward Hoopdriver no more hasty meals and weary attendance on fitful old women for ten blessed days The first morning is by far the most glorious for you hold your whole fortune in your hands Thereafter every night comes a pang a spectre that will not be exorcised the premonition of the return The shadow of going back of being put in the cage again for another twelve months lies blacker and blacker across the sunlight But on the first morning of the ten the holiday has no past and ten days seems as good as infinity And it was fine full of a promise of glorious days a deep blue sky with dazzling piles of white cloud here and there as though celestial haymakers had been piling the swathes of last night s clouds into cocks for a coming cartage There were thrushes in the Richmond Road and a lark on Putney Heath The freshness of dew was in the air dew or the relics of an overnight shower glittered on the leaves and grass Hoopdriver had breakfasted early by missus Gunn s complaisance He wheeled his machine up Putney Hill and his heart sang within him Halfway up a dissipated looking black cat rushed home across the road and vanished under a gate All the big red brick houses behind the variegated shrubs and trees had their blinds down still and he would not have changed places with a soul in any one of them for a hundred pounds He had on his new brown cycling suit a handsome Norfolk jacket thing for thirty sp and his legs those martyr legs were more than consoled by thick chequered stockings thin in the foot thick in the leg for all they had endured A neat packet of American cloth behind the saddle contained his change of raiment and the bell and the handle bar and the hubs and lamp albeit a trifle freckled by wear glittered blindingly in the rising sunlight And at the top of the hill after only one unsuccessful attempt which somehow terminated on the green Hoopdriver mounted and with a stately and cautious restraint in his pace and a dignified curvature of path began his great Cycling Tour along the Southern Coast There is only one phrase to describe his course at this stage and that is voluptuous curves He did not ride fast he did not ride straight an exacting critic might say he did not ride well but he rode generously opulently using the whole road and even nibbling at the footpath The excitement never flagged So far he had never passed or been passed by anything but as yet the day was young and the road was clear He doubted his steering so much that for the present he had resolved to dismount at the approach of anything else upon wheels The shadows of the trees lay very long and blue across the road the morning sunlight was like amber fire At the cross roads at the top of West Hill where the cattle trough stands he turned towards Kingston and set himself to scale the little bit of ascent An early heath keeper in his velveteen jacket marvelled at his efforts And while he yet struggled the head of a carter rose over the brow At the sight of him mister Hoopdriver according to his previous determination resolved to dismount He tightened the brake and the machine stopped dead He was trying to think what he did with his right leg whilst getting off He gripped the handles and released the brake standing on the left pedal and waving his right foot in the air Then these things take so long in the telling he found the machine was falling over to the right While he was deciding upon a plan of action gravitation appears to have been busy He was still irresolute when he found the machine on the ground himself kneeling upon it and a vague feeling in his mind that again Providence had dealt harshly with his shin This happened when he was just level with the heathkeeper The man in the approaching cart stood up to see the ruins better THAT ain t the way to get off said the heathkeeper mister Hoopdriver picked up the machine The handle was twisted askew again He said something under his breath He would have to unscrew the beastly thing THAT ain t the way to get off repeated the heathkeeper after a silence I know that said mister Hoopdriver testily determined to overlook the new specimen on his shin at any cost He unbuckled the wallet behind the saddle to get out a screw hammer If you know it ain t the way to get off whaddyer do it for said the heath keeper in a tone of friendly controversy mister Hoopdriver got out his screw hammer and went to the handle He was annoyed That s my business I suppose he said fumbling with the screw The unusual exertion had made his hands shake frightfully The heath keeper became meditative and twisted his stick in his hands behind his back You ve broken yer andle ain t yer he said presently Just then the screw hammer slipped off the nut mister Hoopdriver used a nasty low word They re trying things them bicycles said the heath keeper charitably Very trying mister Hoopdriver gave the nut a vicious turn and suddenly stood up he was holding the front wheel between his knees I wish said he with a catch in his voice I wish you d leave off staring at me Then with the air of one who has delivered an ultimatum he began replacing the screw hammer in the wallet The heath keeper never moved Possibly he raised his eyebrows and certainly he stared harder than he did before You re pretty unsociable he said slowly as mister Hoopdriver seized the handles and stood ready to mount as soon as the cart had passed The indignation gathered slowly but surely Why don t you ride on a private road of your own if no one ain t to speak to you asked the heath keeper perceiving more and more clearly the bearing of the matter Can t no one make a passin remark to you Touchy Ain t I good enough to speak to you Been struck wooden all of a sudden mister Hoopdriver stared into the Immensity of the Future He was rigid with emotion It was like abusing the Lions in Trafalgar Square But the heathkeeper felt his honour was at stake Don t you make no remarks to IM said the keeper as the carter came up broadside to them E s a bloomin dook e is E don t converse with no one under a earl E s off to Windsor e is that s why e s stickin his be ind out so haughty Pride Why e s got so much of it e has to carry some of it in that there bundle there for fear e d bust if e didn t ease hisself a bit E But mister Hoopdriver heard no more He was hopping vigorously along the road in a spasmodic attempt to remount He missed the treadle once and swore viciously to the keeper s immense delight Nar Nar said the heath keeper In another moment mister Hoopdriver was up and after one terrific lurch of the machine the heathkeeper dropped out of earshot mister Hoopdriver would have liked to look back at his enemy but he usually twisted round and upset if he tried that He had to imagine the indignant heath keeper telling the carter all about it He tried to infuse as much disdain aspossible into his retreating aspect He drove on his sinuous way down the dip by the new mere and up the little rise to the crest of the hill that drops into Kingston Vale and so remarkable is the psychology of cycling that he rode all the straighter and easier because the emotions the heathkeeper had aroused relieved his mind of the constant expectation of collapse that had previously unnerved him To ride a bicycle properly is very like a love affair chiefly it is a matter of faith Believe you do it and the thing is done doubt and for the life of you you cannot Now you may perhaps imagine that as he rode on his feelings towards the heath keeper were either vindictive or remorseful vindictive for the aggravation or remorseful for his own injudicious display of ill temper As a matter of fact they were nothing of the sort A sudden a wonderful gratitude possessed him The Glory of the Holidays had resumed its sway with a sudden accession of splendour At the crest of the hill he put his feet upon the footrests and now riding moderately straight went with a palpitating brake down that excellent descent A new delight was in his eyes quite over and above the pleasure of rushing through the keen sweet morning air He reached out his thumb and twanged his bell out of sheer happiness He s a bloomin Dook he is said mister Hoopdriver to himself in a soft undertone as he went soaring down the hill and again He s a bloomin Dook He opened his mouth in a silent laugh It was having a decent cut did it His social superiority had been so evident that even a man like that noticed it No more Manchester Department for ten days Out of Manchester a Man The draper Hoopdriver the Hand had vanished from existence Instead was a gentleman a man of pleasure with a five pound note two sovereigns and some silver at various convenient points of his person At any rate as good as a Dook if not precisely in the peerage Involuntarily at the thought of his funds Hoopdriver s right hand left the handle and sought his breast pocket to be immediately recalled by a violent swoop of the machine towards the cemetery Whirroo Just missed that half brick Mischievous brutes there were in the world to put such a thing in the road Some blooming Arry or other Ought to prosecute a few of these roughs and the rest would know better That must be the buckle of the wallet was rattling on the mud guard How cheerfully the wheels buzzed The cemetery was very silent and peaceful but the Vale was waking and windows rattled and squeaked up and a white dog came out of one of the houses and yelped at him He got off rather breathless at the foot of Kingston Hill and pushed up Halfway up an early milk chariot rattled by him two dirty men with bundles came hurrying down Hoopdriver felt sure they were burglars carrying home the swag It was up Kingston Hill that he first noticed a peculiar feeling a slight tightness at his knees but he noticed too at the top that he rode straighter than he did before The pleasure of riding straight blotted out these first intimations of fatigue A man on horseback appeared Hoopdriver in a tumult of soul at his own temerity passed him Then down the hill into Kingston with the screw hammer behind in the wallet rattling against the oil can He passed without misadventure a fruiterer s van and a sluggish cartload of bricks And in Kingston Hoopdriver with the most exquisite sensations saw the shutters half removed from a draper s shop and two yawning youths in dusty old black jackets and with dirty white comforters about their necks clearing up the planks and boxes and wrappers in the window preparatory to dressing it out Even so had Hoopdriver been on the previous day But now was he not a bloomin Dook palpably in the sight of common men Then round the corner to the right bell banged furiously and so along the road to Surbiton Whoop for Freedom and Adventure Every now and then a house with an expression of sleepy surprise would open its eye as he passed and to the right of him for a mile or so the weltering Thames flashed and glittered Talk of your joie de vivre Albeit with a certain cramping sensation about the knees and calves slowly forcing itself upon his attention V THE SHAMEFUL EPISODE OF THE YOUNG LADY IN GREY Now you must understand that mister Hoopdriver was not one of your fast young men If he had been King Lemuel he could not have profited more by his mother s instructions He regarded the feminine sex as something to bow to and smirk at from a safe distance Years of the intimate remoteness of a counter leave their mark upon a man It was an adventure for him to take one of the Young Ladies of the establishment to church on a Sunday Few modern young men could have merited less the epithet Dorg But I have thought at times that his machine may have had something of the blade in its metal Decidedly it was a machine with a past mister Hoopdriver had bought it second hand from Hare s in Putney and Hare said it had had several owners Second hand was scarcely the word for it and Elare was mildly puzzled that he should be selling such an antiquity He said it was perfectly sound if a little old fashioned but he was absolutely silent about its moral character It may even have begun its career with a poet say in his glorious youth It may have been the bicycle of a Really Bad Man No one who has ever ridden a cycle of any kind but will witness that the things are unaccountably prone to pick up bad habits and keep them It is undeniable that it became convulsed with the most violent emotions directly the Young Lady in Grey appeared It began an absolutely unprecedented Wabble unprecedented so far as Hoopdriver s experience went It showed off the most decadent sinuosity It left a track like one of Beardsley s feathers He suddenly realised too that his cap was loose on his head and his breath a mere remnant The Young Lady in Grey was also riding a bicycle She was dressed in a beautiful bluish gray and the sun behind her drew her outline in gold and left the rest in shadow Hoopdriver was dimly aware that she was young rather slender dark and with a bright colour and bright eyes Strange doubts possessed him as to the nature of her nether costume He had heard of such things of course French perhaps Her handles glittered a jet of sunlight splashed off her bell blindingly She was approaching the high road along an affluent from the villas of Surbiton fee roads converged slantingly She was travelling at about the same pace as mister Hoopdriver The appearances pointed to a meeting at the fork of the roads Hoopdriver was seized with a horrible conflict of doubts By contrast with her he rode disgracefully Had he not better get off at once and pretend something was wrong with his treadle Yet even the end of getting off was an uncertainty That last occasion on Putney Heath On the other hand what would happen if he kept on To go very slow seemed the abnegation of his manhood To crawl after a mere schoolgirl Besides she was not riding very fast On the other hand to thrust himself in front of her consuming the road in his tendril like advance seemed an incivility greed He would leave her such a very little His business training made him prone to bow and step aside If only one could take one s hands off the handles one might pass with a silent elevation of the hat of course But even that was a little suggestive of a funeral Meanwhile the roads converged She was looking at him She was flushed a little thin and had very bright eyes Her red lips fell apart She may have been riding hard but it looked uncommonly like a faint smile And the things were

none	none	RATIONALS Suddenly an impulse to bolt from the situation became clamorous mister Hoopdriver pedalled convulsively intending to pass her He jerked against some tin thing on the road and it flew up between front wheel and mud guard He twisted round towards her Had the machine a devil At that supreme moment it came across him that he would have done wiser to dismount He gave a frantic whoop and tried to get round then as he seemed falling over he pulled the handles straight again and to the left by an instinctive motion and shot behind her hind wheel missing her by a hair s breadth The pavement kerb awaited him He tried to recover and found himself jumped up on the pavement and riding squarely at a neat wooden paling He struck this with a terrific impact and shot forward off his saddle into a clumsy entanglement Then he began to tumble over sideways and completed the entire figure in a sitting position on the gravel with his feet between the fork and the stay of the machine The concussion on the gravel shook his entire being He remained in that position wishing that he had broken his neck wishing even more heartily that he had never been born The glory of life had departed Bloomin Dook indeed These unwomanly women There was a soft whirr the click of a brake two footfalls and the Young Lady in Grey stood holding her machine She had turned round and come back to him The warm sunlight now was in her face Are you hurt she said She had a pretty clear girlish voice She was really very young quite a girl in fact And rode so well It was a bitter draught mister Hoopdriver stood up at once Not a bit he said a little ruefully He became painfully aware that large patches of gravel scarcely improve the appearance of a Norfolk suit I m very sorry indeed It s my fault she said interrupting and so saving him on the very verge of calling her Miss He knew Miss was wrong but it was deep seated habit with him I tried to pass you on the wrong side Her face and eyes seemed all alive It s my place to be sorry But it was my steering I ought to have seen you were a Novice with a touch of superiority But you rode so straight coming along there She really was dashed pretty mister Hoopdriver s feelings passed the nadir When he spoke again there was the faintest flavour of the aristocratic in his voice It s my first ride as a matter of fact But that s no excuse for my ah blundering Your finger s bleeding she said abruptly He saw his knuckle was barked I didn t feel it he said feeling manly You don t at first Have you any sticking plaster If not She balanced her machine against herself She had a little side pocket and she whipped out a small packet of sticking plaster with a pair of scissors in a sheath at the side and cut off a generous portion He had a wild impulse to ask her to stick it on for him Controlled Thank you he said Machine all right she asked looking past him at the prostrate vehicle her hands on her handle bar For the first time Hoopdriver did not feel proud of his machine He turned and began to pick up the fallen fabric He looked over his shoulder and she was gone turned his head over the other shoulder down the road and she was riding off ORF said mister Hoopdriver Well I m blowed Talk about Slap Up His aristocratic refinement rarely adorned his speech in his private soliloquies His mind was whirling One fact was clear A most delightful and novel human being had flashed across his horizon and was going out of his life again The Holiday madness was in his blood She looked round At that he rushed his machine into the road and began a hasty ascent Unsuccessful Try again Confound it will he NEVER be able to get up on the thing again She will be round the corner in a minute Once more Ah Pedal Wabble No Right this time He gripped the handles and put his head down He would overtake her The situation was primordial The Man beneath prevailed for a moment over the civilised superstructure the Draper He pushed at the pedals with archaic violence So Palaeolithic man may have ridden his simple bicycle of chipped flint in pursuit of his exogamous affinity She vanished round the corner His effort was Titanic What should he say when he overtook her That scarcely disturbed him at first How fine she had looked flushed with the exertion of riding breathing a little fast but elastic and active Talk about your ladylike homekeeping girls with complexions like cold veal But what should he say to her That was a bother And he could not lift his cap without risking a repetition of his previous ignominy She was a real Young Lady No mistake about that None of your blooming shop girls There is no greater contempt in the world than that of shop men for shop girls unless it be that of shop girls for shop men Phew This was work A certain numbness came and went at his knees May I ask to whom I am indebted he panted to himself trying it over That might do Lucky he had a card case A hundred a shilling while you wait He was getting winded The road was certainly a bit uphill He turned the corner and saw a long stretch of road and a grey dress vanishing He set his teeth Had he gained on her at all Monkey on a gridiron yelped a small boy Hoopdriver redoubled his efforts His breath became audible his steering unsteady his pedalling positively ferocious A drop of perspiration ran into his eye irritant as acid The road really was uphill beyond dispute All his physiology began to cry out at him A last tremendous effort brought him to the corner and showed yet another extent of shady roadway empty save for a baker s van His front wheel suddenly shrieked aloud Oh Lord said Hoopdriver relaxing Anyhow she was not in sight He got off unsteadily and for a moment his legs felt like wisps of cotton He balanced his machine against the grassy edge of the path and sat down panting His hands were gnarled with swollen veins and shaking palpably his breath came viscid I m hardly in training yet he remarked His legs had gone leaden I don t feel as though I d had a mouthful of breakfast Presently he slapped his side pocket and produced therefrom a brand new cigarette case and a packet of Vansittart s Red Herring cigarettes He filled the case Then his eye fell with a sudden approval on the ornamental chequering of his new stockings The expression in his eyes faded slowly to abstract meditation She WAS a stunning girl he said I wonder if I shall ever set eyes on her again And she knew how to ride too Wonder what 
831_130746_000056_000000	train-clean-100	she thought 
none	none	of me The phrase bloomin Dook floated into his mind with a certain flavour of comfort He lit a cigarette and sat smoking and meditating He did not even look up when vehicles passed It was perhaps ten minutes before he roused himself What rot it is What s the good of thinking such things he said I m only a blessed draper s assistant To be exact he did not say blessed The service of a shop may polish a man s exterior ways but the prentices dormitory is an indifferent school for either manners or morals He stood up and began wheeling his machine towards Esher It was going to be a beautiful day and the hedges and trees and the open country were all glorious to his town tired eyes But it was a little different from the elation of his start Look at the gentleman wizzer bicitle said a nursemaid on the path to a personage in a perambulator That healed him a little Gentleman wizzer bicitle bloomin Dook I can t look so very seedy he said to himself I WONDER I should just like to know There was something very comforting in the track of HER pneumatic running straight and steady along the road before him It must be hers No other pneumatic had been along the road that morning It was just possible of course that he might see her once more coming back Should he try and say something smart He speculated what manner of girl she might be Probably she was one of these here New Women He had a persuasion the cult had been maligned Anyhow she was a Lady And rich people too Her machine couldn t have cost much under twenty pounds His mind came round and dwelt some time on her visible self Rational dress didn t look a bit unwomanly However he disdained to be one of your fortune hunters Then his thoughts drove off at a tangent He would certainly have to get something to eat at the next public house VI ON THE ROAD TO RIPLEY In the fulness of time mister Hoopdriver drew near the Marquis of Granby at Esher and as he came under the railway arch and saw the inn in front of him he mounted his machine again and rode bravely up to the doorway Burton and biscuit and cheese he had which indeed is Burton in its proper company and as he was eating there came a middleaged man in a drab cycling suit very red and moist and angry in the face and asked bitterly for a lemon squash And he sat down upon the seat in the bar and mopped his face But scarcely had he sat down before he got up again and stared out of the doorway Damn said he Then Damned Fool Eigh said mister Hoopdriver looking round suddenly with a piece of cheese in his cheek The man in drab faced him I called myself a Damned Fool sir Have you any objections Oh None None said mister Hoopdriver I thought you spoke to me I didn t hear what you said To have a contemplative disposition and an energetic temperament sir is hell Hell I tell you A contemplative disposition and a phlegmatic temperament all very well But energy and philosophy mister Hoopdriver looked as intelligent as he could but said nothing There s no hurry sir none whatever I came out for exercise gentle exercise and to notice the scenery and to botanise And no sooner do I get on the accursed machine than off I go hammer and tongs I never look to right or left never notice a flower never see a view get hot juicy red like a grilled chop Here I am sir Come from Guildford in something under the hour WHY sir mister Hoopdriver shook his head Because I m a damned fool sir Because I ve reservoirs and reservoirs of muscular energy and one or other of them is always leaking It s a most interesting road birds and trees I ve no doubt and wayside flowers and there s nothing I should enjoy more than watching them But I can t Get me on that machine and I have to go Get me on anything and I have to go And I don t want to go a bit WHY should a man rush about like a rocket all pace and fizzle Why It makes me furious I can assure you sir I go scorching along the road and cursing aloud at myself for doing it A quiet dignified philosophical man that s what I am at bottom and here I am dancing with rage and swearing like a drunken tinker at a perfect stranger But my day s wasted I ve lost all that country road and now I m on the fringe of London And I might have loitered all the morning Ugh Thank Heaven sir you have not the irritable temperament that you are not goaded to madness by your endogenous sneers by the eternal wrangling of an uncomfortable soul and body I tell you I lead a cat and dog life But what IS the use of talking It s all of a piece He tossed his head with unspeakable self disgust pitched the lemon squash into his mouth paid for it and without any further remark strode to the door mister Hoopdriver was still wondering what to say when his interlocutor vanished There was a noise of a foot spurning the gravel and when mister Hoopdriver reached the doorway the man in drab was a score of yards Londonward He had already gathered pace He pedalled with ill suppressed anger and his head was going down In another moment he flew swiftly out of sight under the railway arch and mister Hoopdriver saw him no more VII After this whirlwind mister Hoopdriver paid his reckoning and being now a little rested about the muscles of the knees resumed his saddle and rode on in the direction of Ripley along an excellent but undulating road He was pleased to find his command over his machine already sensibly increased He set himself little exercises as he went along and performed them with variable success There was for instance steering in between a couple of stones say a foot apart a deed of little difficulty as far as the front wheel is concerned But the back wheel not being under the sway of the human eye is apt to take a vicious jump over the obstacle which sends a violent concussion all along the spine to the skull and will even jerk a loosely fastened hat over the eyes and so lead to much confusion And again there was taking the hand or hands off the handlebar a thing simple in itself but complex in its consequences This particularly was a feat mister Hoopdriver desired to do for several divergent reasons but at present it simply led to convulsive balancings and novel and inelegant modes of dismounting The human nose is at its best a needless excrescence There are those who consider it ornamental and would regard a face deprived of its assistance with pity or derision but it is doubtful whether our esteem is dictated so much by a sense of its absolute beauty as by the vitiating effect of a universally prevalent fashion In the case of bicycle students as in the young of both sexes its inutility is aggravated by its persistent annoyance it requires constant attention Until one can ride with one hand and search for secure and use a pocket handkerchief with the other cycling is necessarily a constant series of descents Nothing can be further from the author s ambition than a wanton realism but mister Hoopdriver s nose is a plain and salient fact and face it we must And in addition to this inconvenience there are flies Until the cyclist can steer with one hand his face is given over to Beelzebub Contemplative flies stroll over it and trifle absently with its most sensitive surfaces The only way to dislodge them is to shake the head forcibly and to writhe one s features violently This is not only a lengthy and frequently ineffectual method but one exceedingly terrifying to foot passengers And again sometimes the beginner rides for a space with one eye closed by perspiration giving him a waggish air foreign to his mood and ill calculated to overawe the impertinent However you will appreciate now the motive of mister Hoopdriver s experiments He presently attained sufficient dexterity to slap himself smartly and violently in the face with his right hand without certainly overturning the machine but his pocket handkerchief might have been in California for any good it was to him while he was in the saddle Yet you must not think that because mister Hoopdriver was a little uncomfortable he was unhappy in the slightest degree In the background of his consciousness was the sense that about this time Briggs would be half way through his window dressing and Gosling the apprentice busy with a chair turned down over the counter and his ears very red trying to roll a piece of huckaback only those who have rolled pieces of huckaback know quite how detestable huckaback is to roll and the shop would be dusty and perhaps the governor about and snappy And here was quiet and greenery and one mucked about as the desire took one without a soul to see and here was no wailing of Sayn no folding of remnants no voice to shout Hoopdriver forward And once he almost ran over something wonderful a little low red beast with a yellowish tail that went rushing across the road before him It was the first weasel he had ever seen in his cockney life There were miles of this scores of miles of this before him pinewood and oak forest purple heathery moorland and grassy down lush meadows where shining rivers wound their lazy way villages with square towered flint churches and rambling cheap and hearty inns clean white country towns long downhill stretches where one might ride at one s ease overlooking a jolt or so and far away at the end of it all the sea What mattered a fly or so in the dawn of these delights Perhaps he had been dashed a minute by the shameful episode of the Young Lady in Grey and perhaps the memory of it was making itself a little lair in a corner of his brain from which it could distress him in the retrospect by suggesting that he looked like a fool but for the present that trouble was altogether in abeyance The man in drab evidently a swell had spoken to him as his equal and the knees of his brown suit and the chequered stockings were ever before his eyes Or rather you could see the stockings by carrying the head a little to one side And to feel little by little his mastery over this delightful treacherous machine growing and growing Every half mile or so his knees reasserted themselves and he dismounted and sat awhile by the roadside It was at a charming little place between Esher and Cobham where a bridge crosses a stream that mister Hoopdriver came across the other cyclist in brown It is well to notice the fact here although the interview was of the slightest because it happened that subsequently Hoopdriver saw a great deal more of this other man in brown The other cyclist in brown had a machine of dazzling newness and a punctured pneumatic lay across his knees He was a man of thirty or more with a whitish face an aquiline nose a lank flaxen moustache and very fair hair and he scowled at the job before him At the sight of him mister Hoopdriver pulled himself together and rode by with the air of one born to the wheel A splendid morning said mister Hoopdriver and a fine surface The morning and you and the surface be everlastingly damned said the other man in brown as Hoopdriver receded Hoopdriver heard the mumble and did not distinguish the words and he felt a pleasing sense of having duly asserted the wide sympathy that binds all cyclists together of having behaved himself as becomes one of the brotherhood of the wheel The other man in brown watched his receding aspect Greasy proletarian said the other man in brown feeling a prophetic dislike Got a suit of brown the very picture of this One would think his sole aim in life had been to caricature me It s Fortune s way with me Look at his insteps on the treadles Why does Heaven make such men And having lit a cigarette the other man in brown returned to the business in hand mister Hoopdriver worked up the hill towards Cobham to a point that he felt sure was out of sight of the other man in brown and then he dismounted and pushed his machine until the proximity of the village and a proper pride drove him into the saddle again VIII Beyond Cobham came a delightful incident delightful that is in its beginning if a trifle indeterminate in the retrospect It was perhaps half way between Cobham and Ripley mister Hoopdriver dropped down a little hill where unfenced from the road fine mossy trees and bracken lay on either side and looking up he saw an open country before him covered with heather and set with pines and a yellow road running across it and half a mile away perhaps a little grey figure by the wayside waving something white Never said mister Hoopdriver with his hands tightening on the handles He resumed the treadles staring away before him jolted over a stone wabbled recovered and began riding faster at once with his eyes ahead It can t be said Hoopdriver He rode his straightest and kept his pedals spinning albeit a limp numbness had resumed possession of his legs It CAN T be he repeated feeling every moment more assured that it WAS Lord I don t know even now said mister Hoopdriver legs awhirling and then Blow my legs But he kept on and drew nearer and nearer breathing hard and gathering flies like a flypaper In the valley he was hidden Then the road began to rise and the resistance of the pedals grew As he crested the hill he saw her not a hundred yards away from him It s her he said It s her right enough It s the suit s done it which was truer even than mister Hoopdriver thought But now she was not waving her handkerchief she was not even looking at him She was wheeling her machine slowly along the road towards him and admiring the pretty wooded hills towards Weybridge She might have been unaware of his existence for all the recognition he got For a moment horrible doubts troubled mister Hoopdriver Had that handkerchief been a dream Besides which he was deliquescent and scarlet and felt so It must be her coquetry the handkerchief was indisputable Should he ride up to her and get off or get off and ride up to her It was as well she didn t look because he would certainly capsize if he lifted his cap Perhaps that was her consideration Even as he hesitated he was upon her She must have heard his breathing He gripped the brake Steady His right leg waved in the air and he came down heavily and staggering but erect She turned her eyes upon him with admirable surprise mister Hoopdriver tried to smile pleasantly hold up his machine raise his cap and bow gracefully Indeed he felt that he did as much He was a man singularly devoid of the minutiae of self consciousness and he was quite unaware of a tail of damp hair lying across his forehead and just clearing his eyes and of the general disorder of his coiffure There was an interrogative pause What can I have the pleasure began mister Haopdriver insinuatingly I mean remembering his emancipation and abruptly assuming his most aristocratic intonation can I be of any assistance to you The Young Lady in Grey bit her lower lip and said very prettily None thank you She glanced away from him and made as if she would proceed Oh said mister Hoopdriver taken aback and suddenly crestfallen again It was so unexpected He tried to grasp the situation Was she coquetting Or had he Excuse me one minute he said as she began to wheel her machine again Yes she said stopping and staring a little with the colour in her cheeks deepening I should not have alighted if I had not imagined that you er waved something white He paused She looked at him doubtfully He HAD seen it She decided that he was not an unredeemed rough taking advantage of a mistake but an innocent soul meaning well while seeking happiness I DID wave my handkerchief she said I m very sorry I am expecting a friend a gentleman she seemed to flush pink for a minute He is riding a bicycle and dressed in in brown and at a distance you know Oh quite said mister Hoopdriver bearing up in manly fashion against his bitter disappointment Certainly I m awfully sorry you know Troubling you to dismount and all that No trouble Ssure you said mister Hoopdriver mechanically and bowing over his saddle as if it was a counter Somehow he could not find it in his heart to tell her that the man was beyond there with a punctured pneumatic He looked back along the road and tried to think of something else to say But the gulf in the conversation widened rapidly and hopelessly There s nothing further began mister Hoopdriver desperately recurring to his stock of cliches Nothing thank you she said decisively And immediately This IS the Ripley road Certainly said mister Hoopdriver Ripley is about two miles from here According to the mile stones Thank you she said warmly Thank you so much I felt sure there was no mistake And I really am awfully sorry Don t mention it said mister Hoopdriver Don t mention it He hesitated and gripped his handles to mount It s me he said ought to be sorry Should he say it Was it an impertinence Anyhow Not being the other gentleman you know He tried a quietly insinuating smile that he knew for a grin even as he smiled it felt she disapproved that she despised him was overcome with shame at her expression turned his back upon her and began very clumsily to mount He did so with a horrible swerve and went pedalling off riding very badly as he was only too painfully aware Nevertheless thank Heaven for the mounting He could not see her because it was so dangerous for him to look round but he could imagine her indignant and pitiless He felt an unspeakable idiot One had to be so careful what one said to Young Ladies and he d gone and treated her just as though she was only a Larky Girl It was unforgivable He always WAS a fool You could tell from her manner she didn t think him a gentleman One glance and she seemed to look clear through him and all his presence What rot it was venturing to speak to a girl like that With her education she was bound to see through him at once How nicely she spoke too nice clear cut words She made him feel what slush his own accent was And that last silly remark What was it Not being the other gentleman you know No point in it And GENTLEMAN What COULD she be thinking of him But really the Young Lady in Grey had dismissed Hoopdriver from her thoughts almost before he had vanished round the corner She had thought no ill of him His manifest awe and admiration of her had given her not an atom of offence But for her just now there were weightier things to think about things that would affect all the rest of her life She continued slowly walking her machine Londonward Presently she stopped Oh Why DOESN T he come she said and stamped her foot petulantly Then as if in answer coming down the hill among the trees appeared the other man in brown dismounted and wheeling his machine IX HOW mister HOOPDRIVER WAS HAUNTED As mister Hoopdriver rode swaggering along the Ripley road it came to him with an unwarrantable sense of comfort that he had seen the last of the Young Lady in Grey But the ill concealed bladery of the machine the present machinery of Fate the deus ex machina so to speak was against him The bicycle torn from this attractive young woman grew heavier and heavier and continually more unsteady It seemed a choice between stopping at Ripley or dying in the flower of his days He went into the Unicorn after propping his machine outside the door and as he cooled down and smoked his Red Herring cigarette while the cold meat was getting ready he saw from the window the Young Lady in Grey and the other man in brown entering Ripley They filled him with apprehension by looking at the house which sheltered him but the sight of his bicycle propped in a drunk and incapable attitude against the doorway humping its rackety mud guard and leering at them with its darkened lantern eye drove them away so it seemed to mister Hoopdriver to the spacious swallow of the Golden Dragon The young lady was riding very slowly but the other man in brown had a bad puncture and was wheeling his machine mister Hoopdriver noted his flaxen moustache his aquiline nose his rather bent shoulders with a sudden vivid dislike The maid at the Unicorn is naturally a pleasant girl but she is jaded by the incessant incidence of cyclists and Hoopdriver s mind even as he conversed with her in that cultivated voice of his of the weather of the distance from London and of the excellence of the Ripley road wandered to the incomparable freshness and brilliance of the Young Lady in Grey As he sat at meat he kept turning his head to the window to see what signs there were of that person but the face of the Golden Dragon displayed no appreciation of the delightful morsel it had swallowed As an incidental consequence of this distraction mister Hoopdriver was for a minute greatly inconvenienced by a mouthful of mustard After he had called for his reckoning he went his courage being high with meat and mustard to the door intending to stand with his legs wide apart and his hands deep in his pockets and stare boldly across the road But just then the other man in brown appeared in the gateway of the Golden Dragon yard it is one of those delightful inns that date from the coaching days wheeling his punctured machine He was taking it to Flambeau s the repairer s He looked up and saw Hoopdriver stared for a minute and then scowled darkly But Hoopdriver remained stoutly in the doorway until the other man in brown had disappeared into Flambeau s Then he glanced momentarily at the Golden Dragon puckered his mouth into a whistle of unconcern and proceeded to wheel his machine into the road until a sufficient margin for mounting was secured Now at that time I say Hoopdriver was rather desirous than not of seeing no more of the Young Lady in Grey The other man in brown he guessed was her brother albeit that person was of a pallid fairness differing essentially from her rich colouring and besides he felt he had made a hopeless fool of himself But the afternoon was against him intolerably hot especially on the top of his head and the virtue had gone out of his legs to digest his cold meat and altogether his ride to Guildford was exceedingly intermittent At times he would walk at times lounge by the wayside and every public house in spite of Briggs and a sentiment of economy meant a lemonade and a dash of bitter For that is the experience of all those who go on wheels that drinking begets thirst even more than thirst begets drinking until at last the man who yields becomes a hell unto himself a hell in which the fire dieth not and the thirst is not quenched Until a pennyworth of acrid green apples turned the current that threatened to carry him away Ever and again a cycle or a party of cyclists would go by with glittering wheels and softly running chains and on each occasion to save his self respect mister Hoopdriver descended and feigned some trouble with his saddle Each time he descended with less trepidation He did not reach Guildford until nearly four o clock and then he was so much exhausted that he decided to put up there for the night at the Yellow Hammer Coffee Tavern And after he had cooled a space and refreshed himself with tea and bread and butter and jam the tea he drank noisily out of the saucer he went out to loiter away the rest of the afternoon Guildford is an altogether charming old town famous so he learnt from a Guide Book as the scene of Master Tupper s great historical novel of Stephen Langton and it has a delightful castle all set about with geraniums and brass plates commemorating the gentlemen who put them up and its Guildhall is a Tudor building very pleasant to see and in the afternoon the shops are busy and the people going to and fro make the pavements look bright and prosperous It was nice to peep in the windows and see the heads of the men and girls in the drapers shops busy as busy serving away The High Street runs down at an angle of seventy degrees to the horizon so it seemed to mister Hoopdriver whose feeling for gradients was unnaturally exalted and it brought his heart into his mouth to see a cyclist ride down it like a fly crawling down a window pane The man hadn t even a brake He visited the castle early in the evening and paid his twopence to ascend the Keep At the top from the cage he looked down over the clustering red roofs of the town and the tower of the church and then going to the southern side sat down and lit a Red Herring cigarette and stared away south over the old bramble bearing fern beset ruin at the waves of blue upland that rose one behind another across the Weald to the lazy altitudes of Hindhead and Butser His pale grey eyes were full of complacency and pleasurable anticipation Tomorrow he would go riding across that wide valley He did not notice any one else had come up the Keep after him until he heard a soft voice behind him saying Well MISS BEAUMONT here s the view Something in the accent pointed to a jest in the name It s a dear old town brother George answered another voice that sounded familiar enough and turning his head mister Hoopdriver saw the other man in brown and the Young Lady in Grey with their backs towards him She turned her smiling profile towards Hoopdriver Only you know brothers don t call their sisters She glanced over her shoulder and saw Hoopdriver Damn said the other man in brown quite audibly starting as he followed her glance mister Hoopdriver with a fine air of indifference resumed the Weald Beautiful old town isn t it said the other man in brown after a quite perceptible pause Isn t it said the Young Lady in Grey Another pause began Can t get alone anywhere said the other man in brown looking round Then mister Hoopdriver perceived clearly that he was in the way and decided to retreat It was just his luck of course that he should stumble at the head of the steps and vanish with indignity This was the third time that he d seen HIM and the fourth time her And of course he was too big a fat head to raise his cap to HER He thought of that at the foot of the Keep Apparently they aimed at the South Coast just as he did He d get up betimes the next day and hurry off to avoid her them that is It never occurred to mister Hoopdriver that Miss Beaumont and her brother might do exactly the same thing and that evening at least the peculiarity of a brother calling his sister Miss Beaumont did not recur to him He was much too preoccupied with an analysis of his own share of these encounters He found it hard to be altogether satisfied about the figure he had cut revise his memories as he would Once more quite unintentionally he stumbled upon these two people It was about seven o clock He stopped outside a linen draper s and peered over the goods in the window at the assistants in torment He could have spent a whole day happily at that 
831_130746_000078_000004	train-clean-100	He told himself 
none	none	that he was trying to see how they dressed out the brass lines over their counters in a purely professional spirit but down at the very bottom of his heart he knew better The customers were a secondary consideration and it was only after the lapse of perhaps a minute that he perceived that among them was the Young Lady in Grey He turned away from the window at once and saw the other man in brown standing at the edge of the pavement and regarding him with a very curious expression of face There came into mister Hoopdriver s head the curious problem whether he was to be regarded as a nuisance haunting these people or whether they were to be regarded as a nuisance haunting him He abandoned the solution at last in despair quite unable to decide upon the course he should take at the next encounter whether he should scowl savagely at the couple or assume an attitude eloquent of apology and propitiation X THE IMAGININGS OF mister HOOPDRIVER S HEART mister Hoopdriver was in the days of this story a poet though he had never written a line of verse Or perhaps romancer will describe him better Like I know not how many of those who do the fetching and carrying of life a great number of them certainly his real life was absolutely uninteresting and if he had faced it as realistically as such people do in mister Gissing s novels he would probably have come by way of drink to suicide in the course of a year But that was just what he had the natural wisdom not to do On the contrary he was always decorating his existence with imaginative tags hopes and poses deliberate and yet quite effectual self deceptions his experiences were mere material for a romantic superstructure If some power had given Hoopdriver the giftie Burns invoked to see oursels as ithers see us he would probably have given it away to some one else at the very earliest opportunity His entire life you must understand was not a continuous romance but a series of short stories linked only by the general resemblance of their hero a brown haired young fellow commonly with blue eyes and a fair moustache graceful rather than strong sharp and resolute rather than clever cp as the scientific books say p two Invariably this person possessed an iron will The stories fluctuated indefinitely The smoking of a cigarette converted Hoopdriver s hero into something entirely worldly subtly rakish with a humorous twinkle in the eye and some gallant sinning in the background You should have seen mister Hoopdriver promenading the brilliant gardens at Earl s Court on an early closing night His meaning glances I dare not give the meaning Such an influence as the eloquence of a revivalist preacher would suffice to divert the story into absolutely different channels make him a white soured hero a man still pure walking untainted and brave and helpful through miry ways The appearance of some daintily gloved frockcoated gentleman with buttonhole and eyeglass complete gallantly attendant in the rear of customers served again to start visions of a simplicity essentially Cromwell like of sturdy plainness of a strong silent man going righteously through the world This day there had predominated a fine leisurely person immaculately clothed and riding on an unexceptional machine a mysterious person quite unostentatious but with accidental self revelation of something over the common even a bloomin Dook it might be incognito on the tour of the South Coast You must not think that there was any TELLING of these stories of this life long series by mister Hoopdriver He never dreamt that they were known to a soul If it were not for the trouble I would I think go back and rewrite this section from the beginning expunging the statements that Hoopdriver was a poet and a romancer and saying instead that he was a playwright and acted his own plays He was not only the sole performer but the entire audience and the entertainment kept him almost continuously happy Yet even that playwright comparison scarcely expresses all the facts of the case After all very many of his dreams never got acted at all possibly indeed most of them the dreams of a solitary walk for instance or of a tramcar ride the dreams dreamt behind the counter while trade was slack and mechanical foldings and rollings occupied his muscles Most of them were little dramatic situations crucial dialogues the return of mister Hoopdriver to his native village for instance in a well cut holiday suit and natty gloves the unheard asides of the rival neighbours the delight of the old mater the intelligence A ten pound rise all at once from Antrobus mater Whad d yer think of that or again the first whispering of love dainty and witty and tender to the girl he served a few days ago with sateen or a gallant rescue of generalised beauty in distress from truculent insult or ravening dog So many people do this and you never suspect it You see a tattered lad selling matches in the street and you think there is nothing between him and the bleakness of immensity between him and utter abasement but a few tattered rags and a feeble musculature And all unseen by you a host of heaven sent fatuities swathes him about even maybe as they swathe you about Many men have never seen their own profiles or the backs of their heads and for the back of your own mind no mirror has been invented They swathe him about so thickly that the pricks of fate scarce penetrate to him or become but a pleasant titillation And so indeed it is with all of us who go on living Self deception is the anaesthetic of life while God is carving out our beings But to return from this general vivisection to mister Hoopdriver s imaginings You see now how external our view has been we have had but the slightest transitory glimpses of the drama within of how the things looked in the magic mirror of mister Hoopdriver s mind On the road to Guildford and during his encounters with his haunting fellow cyclists the drama had presented chiefly the quiet gentleman to whom we have alluded but at Guildford under more varied stimuli he burgeoned out more variously There was the house agent s window for instance set him upon a charming little comedy He would go in make inquires about that thirty pound house get the key possibly and go over it the thing would stimulate the clerk s curiosity immensely He searched his mind for a reason for this proceeding and discovered that he was a dynamiter needing privacy Upon that theory he procured the key explored the house carefully said darkly that it might suit his special needs but that there were OTHERS to consult The clerk however did not understand the allusion and merely pitied him as one who had married young and paired himself to a stronger mind than his own This proceeding in some occult way led to the purchase of a note book and pencil and that started the conception of an artist taking notes That was a little game mister Hoopdriver had in congenial company played in his still younger days to the infinite annoyance of quite a number of respectable excursionists at Hastings In early days mister Hoopdriver had been as his mother proudly boasted a bit of a drawer but a conscientious and normally stupid schoolmaster perceived the incipient talent and had nipped it in the bud by a series of lessons in art However our principal character figured about quite happily in old corners of Guildford and once the other man in brown looking out of the bay window of the Earl of Kent saw him standing in a corner by a gateway note book in hand busily sketching the Earl s imposing features At which sight the other man in brown started back from the centre of the window so as to be hidden from him and crouching slightly watched him intently through the interstices of the lace curtains XI OMISSIONS Now the rest of the acts of mister Hoopdriver in Guildford on the great opening day of his holidays are not to be detailed here How he wandered about the old town in the dusk and up to the Hogsback to see the little lamps below and the little stars above come out one after another how he returned through the yellow lit streets to the Yellow Hammer Coffee Tavern and supped bravely in the commercial room a Man among Men how he joined in the talk about flying machines and the possibilities of electricity witnessing that flying machines were dead certain to come and that electricity was wonderful wonderful how he went and watched the billiard playing and said Left em several times with an oracular air how he fell a yawning and how he got out his cycling map and studied it intently are things that find no mention here Nor will I enlarge upon his going into the writing room and marking the road from London to Guildford with a fine bright line of the reddest of red ink In his little cyclist hand book there is a diary and in the diary there is an entry of these things it is there to this day and I cannot do better than reproduce it here to witness that this book is indeed a true one and no lying fable written to while away an hour At last he fell a yawning so much that very reluctantly indeed he set about finishing this great and splendid day Alas that all days must end at last He got his candle in the hall from a friendly waiting maid and passed upward whither a modest novelist who writes for the family circle dare not follow Yet I may tell you that he knelt down at his bedside happy and drowsy and said Our Father chartin heaven even as he had learnt it by rote from his mother nearly twenty years ago And anon when his breathing had become deep and regular we may creep into his bedroom and catch him at his dreams He is lying upon his left side with his arm under the pillow It is dark and he is hidden but if you could have seen his face sleeping there in the darkness I think you would have perceived in spite of that treasured thin and straggling moustache in spite of your memory of the coarse words he had used that day that the man before you was after all only a little child asleep XII THE DREAMS OF mister HOOPDRIVER In spite of the drawn blinds and the darkness you have just seen mister Hoopdriver s face peaceful in its beauty sleep in the little plain bedroom at the very top of the Yellow Hammer Coffee Tavern at Guildford That was before midnight As the night progressed he was disturbed by dreams After your first day of cycling one dream is inevitable A memory of motion lingers in the muscles of your legs and round and round they seem to go You ride through Dreamland on wonderful dream bicycles that change and grow you ride down steeples and staircases and over precipices you hover in horrible suspense over inhabited towns vainly seeking for a brake your hand cannot find to save you from a headlong fall you plunge into weltering rivers and rush helplessly at monstrous obstacles Anon mister Hoopdriver found himself riding out of the darkness of non existence pedalling Ezekiel s Wheels across the Weald of Surrey jolting over the hills and smashing villages in his course while the other man in brown cursed and swore at him and shouted to stop his career There was the Putney heath keeper too and the man in drab raging at him He felt an awful fool a what was it a juggins ah a Juggernaut The villages went off one after another with a soft squashing noise He did not see the Young Lady in Grey but he knew she was looking at his back He dared not look round Where the devil was the brake It must have fallen off And the bell Right in front of him was Guildford He tried to shout and warn the town to get out of the way but his voice was gone as well Nearer nearer it was fearful and in another moment the houses were cracking like nuts and the blood of the inhabitants squirting this way and that The streets were black with people running Right under his wheels he saw the Young Lady in Grey A feeling of horror came upon mister Hoopdriver he flung himself sideways to descend forgetting how high he was and forthwith he began falling falling falling He woke up turned over saw the new moon on the window wondered a little and went to sleep again This second dream went back into the first somehow and the other man in brown came threatening and shouting towards him He grew uglier and uglier as he approached and his expression was intolerably evil He came and looked close into mister Hoopdriver s eyes and then receded to an incredible distance His face seemed to be luminous MISS BEAUMONT he said and splashed up a spray of suspicion Some one began letting off fireworks chiefly Catherine wheels down the shop though mister Hoopdriver knew it was against the rules For it seemed that the place they were in was a vast shop and then mister Hoopdriver perceived that the other man in brown was the shop walker differing from most shop walkers in the fact that he was lit from within as a Chinese lantern might be And the customer mister Hoopdriver was going to serve was the Young Lady in Grey Curious he hadn t noticed it before She was in grey as usual rationals and she had her bicycle leaning against the counter She smiled quite frankly at him just as she had done when she had apologised for stopping him And her form as she leant towards him was full of a sinuous grace he had never noticed before What can I have the pleasure said mister Hoopdriver at once and she said The Ripley road So he got out the Ripley road and unrolled it and showed it to her and she said that would do very nicely and kept on looking at him and smiling and he began measuring off eight miles by means of the yard measure on the counter eight miles being a dress length a rational dress length that is and then the other man in brown came up and wanted to interfere and said mister Hoopdriver was a cad besides measuring it off too slowly And as mister Hoopdriver began to measure faster the other man in brown said the Young Lady in Grey had been there long enough and that he WAS her brother or else she would not be travelling with him and he suddenly whipped his arm about her waist and made off with her It occurred to mister Hoopdriver even at the moment that this was scarcely brotherly behaviour Of course it wasn t The sight of the other man gripping her so familiarly enraged him frightfully he leapt over the counter forthwith and gave chase They ran round the shop and up an iron staircase into the Keep and so out upon the Ripley road For some time they kept dodging in and out of a wayside hotel with two front doors and an inn yard The other man could not run very fast because he had hold of the Young Lady in Grey but mister Hoopdriver was hampered by the absurd behaviour of his legs They would not stretch out they would keep going round and round as if they were on the treadles of a wheel so that he made the smallest steps conceivable This dream came to no crisis The chase seemed to last an interminable time and all kinds of people heathkeepers shopmen policemen the old man in the Keep the angry man in drab the barmaid at the Unicorn men with flying machines people playing billiards in the doorways silly headless figures stupid cocks and hens encumbered with parcels and umbrellas and waterproofs people carrying bedroom candles and such like riffraff kept getting in his way and annoying him although he sounded his electric bell and said Wonderful wonderful at every corner XIII HOW mister HOOPDRIVER WENT TO HASLEMERE There was some little delay in getting mister Hoopdriver s breakfast so that after all he was not free to start out of Guildford until just upon the stroke of nine He wheeled his machine from the High Street in some perplexity He did not know whether this young lady who had seized hold of his imagination so strongly and her unfriendly and possibly menacing brother were ahead of him or even now breakfasting somewhere in Guildford In the former case he might loiter as he chose in the latter he must hurry and possibly take refuge in branch roads It occurred to him as being in some obscure way strategic that he would leave Guildford not by the obvious Portsmouth road but by the road running through Shalford Along this pleasant shady way he felt sufficiently secure to resume his exercises in riding with one hand off the handles and in staring over his shoulder He came over once or twice but fell on his foot each time and perceived that he was improving Before he got to Bramley a specious byway snapped him up ran with him for half a mile or more and dropped him as a terrier drops a walkingstick upon the Portsmouth again a couple of miles from Godalming He entered Godalming on his feet for the road through that delightful town is beyond dispute the vilest in the world a mere tumult of road metal a way of peaks and precipices and after a successful experiment with cider at the Woolpack he pushed on to Milford All this time he was acutely aware of the existence of the Young Lady in Grey and her companion in brown as a child in the dark is of Bogies Sometimes he could hear their pneumatics stealing upon him from behind and looking round saw a long stretch of vacant road Once he saw far ahead of him a glittering wheel but it proved to be a workingman riding to destruction on a very tall ordinary And he felt a curious vague uneasiness about that Young Lady in Grey for which he was altogether unable to account Now that he was awake he had forgotten that accentuated Miss Beaumont that had been quite clear in his dream But the curious dream conviction that the girl was not really the man s sister would not let itself be forgotten Why for instance should a man want to be alone with his sister on the top of a tower At Milford his bicycle made so to speak an ass of itself A finger post suddenly jumped out at him vainly indicating an abrupt turn to the right and mister Hoopdriver would have slowed up and read the inscription but no the bicycle would not let him The road dropped a little into Milford and the thing shied put down its head and bolted and mister Hoopdriver only thought of the brake when the fingerpost was passed Then to have recovered the point of intersection would have meant dismounting For as yet there was no road wide enough for mister Hoopdriver to turn in So he went on his way or to be precise he did exactly the opposite thing The road to the right was the Portsmouth road and this he was on went to Haslemere and Midhurst By that error it came about that he once more came upon his fellow travellers of yesterday coming on them suddenly without the slightest preliminary announcement and when they least expected it under the Southwestern Railway arch It s horrible said a girlish voice it s brutal cowardly And stopped His expression as he shot out from the archway at them may have been something between a grin of recognition and a scowl of annoyance at himself for the unintentional intrusion But disconcerted as he was he was yet able to appreciate something of the peculiarity of their mutual attitudes The bicycles were lying by the roadside and the two riders stood face to face The other man in brown s attitude as it flashed upon Hoopdriver was a deliberate pose he twirled his moustache and smiled faintly and he was conscientiously looking amused And the girl stood rigid her arms straight by her side her handkerchief clenched in her hand and her face was flushed with the faintest touch of red upon her eyelids She seemed to mister Hoopdriver s sense to be indignant But that was the impression of a second A mask of surprised recognition fell across this revelation of emotion as she turned her head towards him and the pose of the other man in brown vanished too in a momentary astonishment And then he had passed them and was riding on towards Haslemere to make what he could of the swift picture that had photographed itself on his brain Rum said mister Hoopdriver It s DASHED rum They were having a row Smirking What he called the other man in brown need not trouble us Annoying her That any human being should do that WHY The impulse to interfere leapt suddenly into mister Hoopdriver s mind He grasped his brake descended and stood looking hesitatingly back They still stood by the railway bridge and it seemed to mister Hoopdriver s fancy that she was stamping her foot He hesitated then turned his bicycle round mounted and rode back towards them gripping his courage firmly lest it should slip away and leave him ridiculous I ll offer im a screw ammer said mister Hoopdriver Then with a wave of fierce emotion he saw that the girl was crying In another moment they heard him and turned in surprise Certainly she had been crying her eyes were swimming in tears and the other man in brown looked exceedingly disconcerted mister Hoopdriver descended and stood over his machine Nothing wrong I hope he said looking the other man in brown squarely in the face No accident Nothing said the other man in brown shortly Nothing at all thanks But said mister Hoopdriver with a great effort the young lady is crying I thought perhaps The Young Lady in Grey started gave Hoopdriver one swift glance and covered one eye with her handkerchief It s this speck she said This speck of dust in my eye This lady said the other man in brown explaining has a gnat in her eye There was a pause The young lady busied herself with her eye I believe it s out she said The other man in brown made movements indicating commiserating curiosity concerning the alleged fly mister Hoopdriver the word is his own stood flabber gastered He had all the intuition of the simple minded He knew there was no fly But the ground was suddenly cut from his feet There is a limit to knighterrantry dragons and false knights are all very well but flies Fictitious flies Whatever the trouble was it was evidently not his affair He felt he had made a fool of himself again He would have mumbled some sort of apology but the other man in brown gave him no time turned on him abruptly even fiercely I hope he said that your curiosity is satisfied Certainly said mister Hoopdriver Then we won t detain you And ignominiously mister Hoopdriver turned his machine about struggled upon it and resumed the road southward And when he learnt that he was not on the Portsmouth road it was impossible to turn and go back for that would be to face his shame again and so he had to ride on by Brook Street up the hill to Haslemere And away to the right the Portsmouth road mocked at him and made off to its fastnesses amid the sunlit green and purple masses of Hindhead where mister Grant Allen writes his Hill Top Novels day by day The sun shone and the wide blue hill views and pleasant valleys one saw on either hand from the sandscarred roadway even the sides of the road itself set about with grey heather scrub and prickly masses of gorse and pine trees with their year s growth still bright green against the darkened needles of the previous years were fresh and delightful to mister Hoopdriver s eyes But the brightness of the day and the day old sense of freedom fought an uphill fight against his intolerable vexation at that abominable encounter and had still to win it when he reached Haslemere A great brown shadow a monstrous hatred of the other man in brown possessed him He had conceived the brilliant idea of abandoning Portsmouth or at least giving up the straight way to his fellow wayfarers and of striking out boldly to the left eastward He did not dare to stop at any of the inviting public houses in the main street of Haslemere but turned up a side way and found a little beer shop the Good Hope wherein to refresh himself And there he ate and gossipped condescendingly with an aged labourer assuming the while for his own private enjoyment the attributes of a Lost Heir and afterwards mounted and rode on towards Northchapel a place which a number of finger posts conspired to boom but which some insidious turning prevented him from attaining XIV HOW mister HOOPDRIVER REACHED MIDHURST It was one of my uncle s profoundest remarks that human beings are the only unreasonable creatures This observation was so far justified by mister Hoopdriver that after spending the morning tortuously avoiding the other man in brown and the Young Lady in Grey he spent a considerable part of the afternoon in thinking about the Young Lady in Grey and contemplating in an optimistic spirit the possibilities of seeing her again Memory and imagination played round her so that his course was largely determined by the windings of the road he traversed Of one general proposition he was absolutely convinced There s something Juicy wrong with em said he once even aloud But what it was he could not imagine He recapitulated the facts Miss Beaumont brother and sister and the stoppage to quarrel and weep it was perplexing material for a young man of small experience There was no exertion he hated so much as inference and after a time he gave up any attempt to get at the realities of the case and let his imagination go free Should he ever see her again Suppose he did with that other chap not about The vision he found pleasantest was an encounter with her an unexpected encounter at the annual Dancing Class Do at the Putney Assembly Rooms Somehow they would drift together and he would dance with her again and again It was a pleasant vision for you must understand that mister Hoopdriver danced uncommonly well Or again in the shop a sudden radiance in the doorway and she is bowed towards the Manchester counter And then to lean over that counter and murmur seemingly apropos of the goods under discussion I have not forgotten that morning on the Portsmouth road and lower I never shall forget At Northchapel mister Hoopdriver consulted his map and took counsel and weighed his course of action Petworth seemed a possible resting place or Pullborough Midhurst seemed too near and any place over the Downs beyond too far and so he meandered towards Petworth posing himself perpetually and loitering gathering wild flowers and wondering why they had no names for he had never heard of any dropping them furtively at the sight of a stranger and generally mucking about There were purple vetches in the hedges meadowsweet honeysuckle belated brambles but the dog roses had already gone there were green and red blackberries stellarias and dandelions and in another place white dead nettles traveller s joy clinging bedstraw grasses flowering white campions and ragged robins One cornfield was glorious with poppies bright scarlet and purple white and the blue corn flowers were beginning In the lanes the trees met overhead and the wisps of hay still hung to the straggling hedges Iri one of the main roads he steered a perilous passage through a dozen surly dun oxen Here and there were little cottages and picturesque beer houses with the vivid brewers boards of blue and scarlet and once a broad green and a church and an expanse of some hundred houses or so Then he came to a pebbly rivulet that emerged between clumps of sedge loosestrife and forget me nots under an arch of trees and rippled across the road and there he dismounted longing to take off shoes and stockings those stylish chequered stockings were now all dimmed with dust and paddle his lean legs in the chuckling cheerful water But instead he sat in a manly attitude smoking a cigarette for fear lest the Young Lady in Grey should come glittering round the corner For the flavour of the Young Lady in Grey was present through it all mixing with the flowers and all the delight of it a touch that made this second day quite different from the first an undertone of expectation anxiety and something like regret that would not be ignored It was only late in the long evening that quite abruptly he began to repent vividly and decidedly having fled these two people He was getting hungry and that has a curious effect upon the emotional colouring of our minds The man was a sinister brute Hoopdriver saw in a flash of inspiration and the girl she was in some serious trouble And he who might have helped her had taken his first impulse as decisive and bolted This new view of it depressed him dreadfully What might not be happening to her now He thought again of her tears Surely it was merely his duty seeing the trouble afoot to keep his eye upon it He began riding fast to get quit of such selfreproaches He found himself in a tortuous tangle of roads and as the dusk was coming on emerged not at Petworth but at Easebourne a mile from Midhurst I m getting hungry said mister Hoopdriver inquiring of a gamekeeper in Easebourne village Midhurst a mile and Petworth five Thenks I ll take Midhurst He came into Midhurst by the bridge at the watermill and up the North Street and a little shop flourishing cheerfully the cheerful sign of a teapot and exhibiting a brilliant array of tobaccos sweets and children s toys in the window struck his fancy A neat bright eyed little old lady made him welcome and he was presently supping sumptuously on sausages and tea with a visitors book full of the most humorous and flattering remarks about the little old lady in verse and prose propped up against his teapot as he ate Regular good some of the jokes were and rhymes that read well even with your mouth full of sausage mister Hoopdriver formed a vague idea of drawing something for his judgment on the little old lady was already formed He pictured the little old lady discovering it afterwards My gracious One of them Punch men she would say The room had a curtained recess and a chest of drawers for presently it was to be his bedroom and the day part of it was decorated with framed Oddfellows certificates and giltbacked books and portraits and kettle holders and all kinds of beautiful things made out of wool very comfortable it was indeed The window was lead framed and diamond paned and through it one saw the corner of the vicarage and a pleasant hill crest in dusky silhouette against the twilight sky And after the sausages had ceased to be he lit a Red Herring cigarette and went swaggering out into the twilight street All shadowy blue between its dark brick houses was the street with a bright yellow window here and there and splashes of green and red where the chemist s illumination fell across the road XV AN INTERLUDE And now let us for a space leave mister Hoopdriver in the dusky Midhurst North Street and return to the two folks beside the railway bridge between Milford and Haslemere She was a girl of eighteen dark fine featured with bright eyes and a rich swift colour under her warm tinted skin Her eyes were all the brighter for the tears that swam in them The man was thirty three or four fair with a longish nose overhanging his sandy flaxen moustache pale blue eyes and a head that struck out above and behind He stood with his feet wide apart his hand on his hip in an attitude that was equally suggestive of defiance and aggression They had watched Hoopdriver out of sight The unexpected interruption had stopped the flood of her tears He tugged his abundant moustache and regarded her calmly She stood with face averted obstinately resolved not to speak first Your behaviour he said at last makes you conspicuous She turned upon him her eyes and cheeks glowing her hands clenched You unspeakable CAD she said and choked stamped her little foot and stood panting Unspeakable cad My dear girl Possible I AM an unspeakable cad Who wouldn t be for you Dear girl How DARE you speak to me like that YOU I would do anything OH There was a moment s pause She looked squarely into his face her eyes alight with anger and contempt and perhaps he flushed a little He stroked his moustache and by an effort maintained his cynical calm Let us be reasonable he said Reasonable That means all that is mean and cowardly and sensual in the world You have always had it so in your generalising way But let us look at the facts of the case if that pleases you better With an impatient gesture she motioned him to go on Well he said you ve eloped I ve left my home she corrected with dignity I left my home because it was unendurable Because that woman Yes yes But the point is you have eloped with me You came with me You pretended to be my friend Promised to help me to earn a living by writing It was you who said why shouldn t a man and woman be friends And now you dare you dare Really Jessie this pose of yours this injured innocence I will go back I forbid you I forbid you to stand in the way One moment I have always thought that my little pupil was at least clear headed You don t know everything yet you know Listen to me for a moment Haven t I been listening And you have only insulted me You who dared only to talk of friendship who scarcely dared hint at anything beyond But you took the hints nevertheless You knew You KNEW And you did not mind MIND You liked it It was the fun of the whole thing for you That I loved you and could not speak to you You played with it You have said all that before Do you think that justifies you That isn t all I made up my mind Well to make the game more even And so I suggested to you and joined with you in this expedition of yours invented a sister at Midhurst I tell you I HAVEN T a sister For one object Well To compromise you She started That was a new way of putting it For half a minute neither spoke Then she began half defiantly Much I am compromised Of course I have made a fool of myself My dear girl you are still on the sunny side of eighteen and you know very little of this world Less than you think But you will learn Before you write all those novels we have talked about you will have to learn And that s one point He hesitated You started and blushed when the man at breakfast called you Ma am You thought it a funny mistake but you did not say anything because he was young and nervous and besides the thought of being my wife offended your modesty You didn t care to notice it But you see I gave your name as missus Beaumont He looked almost apologetic in spite of his cynical pose missus Beaumont he repeated pulling his flaxen moustache and watching the effect She looked into his eyes speechless I am learning fast she said slowly at last He thought the time had come for an emotional attack Jessie he said with a sudden change of voice I know all this is mean isvillanous But do you think that I have done all this scheming all this subterfuge for any other object She did not seem to listen to his words I shall ride home she said abruptly To her She winced Just think said he what she could say to you after this Anyhow I shall leave you now Yes And go Go somewhere to earn my living to be a free woman to live without conventionality My dear girl do let us be cynical You haven t money and you haven t credit No one would take you in It s one of two things go back to your stepmother or trust to me How CAN I Then you must go back to her He paused momentarily to let this consideration have its proper weight Jessie I did not mean to say the things I did Upon my honour I lost my head when I spoke so If you will forgive me I am a man I could not help myself Forgive me and I promise you How can I trust you Try me I can assure you She regarded him distrustfully At any rate ride on with me now Surely we have been in the shadow of this horrible bridge long enough Oh let me think she said half turning from him and pressing her hand to her brow THINK Look here Jessie It is ten o clock Shall we call a truce until one She hesitated demanded a definition of the truce and at last agreed They mounted and rode on in silence through the sunlight and the heather Both were extremely uncomfortable and disappointed She was pale divided between fear and anger She perceived she was in a scrape and tried in vain to think of a way of escape Only one tangible thing would keep in her mind try as she would to ignore it That was the quite irrelevant fact that his head was singularly like an albino cocoanut He too felt thwarted He felt that this romantic business of seduction was after all unexpectedly tame But this was only the beginning At any rate every day she spent with him was a day gained Perhaps things looked worse than they were that was some consolation XVI OF THE ARTIFICIAL IN MAN AND OF THE ZEITGEIST You have seen these two young people Bechamel by the bye is the man s name and the girl s is Jessie Milton from the outside you have heard them talking they ride now side by side but not too close together and in an uneasy silence towards Haslemere and this chapter will concern itself with those curious little council chambers inside their skulls where their motives are in session and their acts are considered and passed But first a word concerning wigs and false teeth Some jester enlarging upon the increase of bald heads and purblind people has deduced a wonderful future for the children of men Man he said was nowadays a hairless creature by forty or fifty and for hair we gave him a wig shrivelled and we padded him toothless and lo false teeth set in gold Did he lose a limb and a fine new artificial one was at his disposal get indigestion and to hand was artificial digestive fluid or bile or pancreatine as the case might be Complexions too were replaceable spectacles superseded an inefficient eye lens and imperceptible false diaphragms were thrust into the failing ear So he went over our anatomies until at last he had conjured up a weird thing of shreds and patches a simulacrum an artificial body of a man with but a doubtful germ of living flesh lurking somewhere in his recesses To that he held we were coming How far such odd substitution for the body is possible need not concern us now But the devil speaking by the lips of mister Rudyard Kipling hath it that in the case of one Tomlinson the thing so far as the soul is concerned has already been accomplished Time was when men had simple souls desires as natural as their eyes a little reasonable philanthropy a little reasonable philoprogenitiveness hunger and a taste for good living a decent personal vanity a healthy satisfying pugnacity and so forth But now we are taught and disciplined for years and years and thereafter we read and read for all the time some strenuous nerve destroying business permits Pedagogic hypnotists pulpit and platform hypnotists book writing hypnotists newspaper writing hypnotists are at us all This sugar you are eating they tell us is ink and forthwith we reject it with infinite disgust This black draught of unrequited toil is True Happiness and down it goes with every symptom of pleasure This Ibsen they say is dull past believing and we yawn and stretch beyond endurance Pardon they interrupt but this Ibsen is deep and delightful and we vie with one another in an excess of entertainment And when we open the heads of these two young people we find not a straightforward motive on the surface anywhere we find indeed not a soul so much as an oversoul a zeitgeist a congestion of acquired ideas a highway s feast of fine confused thinking The girl is resolute to Live Her Own Life a phrase you may have heard before and the man has a pretty perverted ambition to be a cynical artistic person of the very calmest description He is hoping for the awakening of Passion in her among other things He knows Passion ought to awaken from the text books he has studied He knows she admires his genius but he is unaware that she does not admire his head He is quite a distinguished art critic in London and he met her at that celebrated lady novelist s her stepmother and here you have them well embarked upon the Adventure Both are in the first stage of repentance which consists as you have probably found for yourself in setting your teeth hard and saying I WILL go on Things you see have jarred a little and they ride on their way together with a certain aloofness of manner that promises ill for the orthodox development of the Adventure He perceives he was too precipitate But he feels his honour is involved and meditates the development of a new attack And the girl She is unawakened Her motives are bookish written by a haphazard syndicate of authors novelists and biographers on her white inexperience An artificial oversoul she is that may presently break down and reveal a human being beneath it She is still in that schoolgirl phase when a talkative old man is more interesting than a tongue tied young one and when to be an eminent mathematician say or to edit a daily paper seems as fine an ambition as any girl need aspire to Bechaniel was to have helped her to attain that in the most expeditious manner and here he is beside her talking enigmatical phrases about passion looking at her with the oddest expression and once and that was his gravest offence offering to kiss her At any rate he has apologised She still scarcely realises you see the scrape she has got into XVII THE ENCOUNTER AT MIDHURST We left mister Hoopdriver at the door of the little tea toy and tobacco shop You must not think that a strain is put on coincidence when I tell you that next door to missus Wardor s that was the name of the bright eyed little old lady with whom mister Hoopdriver had stopped is the Angel Hotel and in the Angel Hotel on the night that mister Hoopdriver reached Midhurst were mister and Miss Beaumont our Bechamel and Jessie Milton Indeed it was a highly probable thing for if one goes through Guildford the choice of southward roads is limited you may go by Petersfield to Portsmouth or by Midhurst to Chichester in addition to which highways there is nothing for it but minor roadways to Petworth or Pulborough and cross cuts Brightonward And coming to Midhurst from the north the Angel s entrance lies yawning to engulf your highly respectable cyclists while missus Wardor s genial teapot is equally attractive to those who weigh their means in little scales But to people unfamiliar with the Sussex roads and such were the three persons of this story the convergence did not appear to be so inevitable Bechamel tightening his chain in the Angel yard after dinner was the first to be aware of their reunion He saw Hoopdriver walk slowly across the gateway his head enhaloed in cigarette smoke and pass out of sight up the street Incontinently a mass of cloudy uneasiness that had been partly dispelled during the day reappeared and concentrated rapidly into definite suspicion He put his screw hammer into his pocket and walked through the archway into the street to settle the business forthwith for he prided himself on his decision Hoopdriver was merely promenading and they met face to face At the sight of his adversary something between disgust and laughter seized mister Hoopdriver and for a moment destroyed his animosity Ere we are again he said laughing insincerely in a sudden outbreak at the perversity of chance The other man in brown stopped short in mister Hoopdriver s way staring Then his face assumed an expression of dangerous civility Is it any information to you he said with immense politeness when I remark that you are following us mister Hoopdriver for some occult reason resisted his characteristic impulse to apologise He wanted to annoy the other man in brown and a sentence that had come into his head in a previous rehearsal cropped up appropriately Since when said mister Hoopdriver catching his breath yet bringing the question out valiantly nevertheless since when ave you purchased the county of Sussex May I point out said the other man in brown that I object we object not only to your proximity to us To be frank you appear to be following us with an object You can always said mister Hoopdriver turn round if you don t like it and go back the way you came Oh o said the other man in brown THAT S it I thought as much Did you said mister Hoopdriver quite at sea but rising pluckily to the unknown occasion What was the man driving at I see said the other man I see I half suspected His manner changed abruptly to a quality suspiciously friendly Yes a word with you You will I hope give me ten minutes Wonderful things were dawning on mister Hoopdriver What did the other man take him for Here at last was reality He hesitated Then he thought of an admirable phrase You ave some communication We ll call it a communication said the other man I can spare you the ten minutes said mister Hoopdriver with dignity This way then said the other man in brown and they walked slowly down the North Street towards the Grammar School There was perhaps thirty seconds silence The other man stroked his moustache nervously mister Hoopdriver s dramatic instincts were now fully awake He did not quite understand in what role he was cast but it was evidently something dark and mysterious Doctor Conan Doyle Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas were well within mister Hoopdriver s range of reading and he had not read them for nothing I will be perfectly frank with you said the other man in brown Frankness is always the best course said mister Hoopdriver Well then who the devil set you on this business Set me ON this business Don t pretend to be stupid Who s your employer Who engaged you for this job Well said mister Hoopdriver confused No I can t say Quite sure The other man in brown glanced meaningly down at his hand and mister Hoopdriver following him mechanically saw a yellow milled edge glittering in the twilight Now your shop assistant is just above the tip receiving class and only just above it so that he is acutely sensitive on the point mister Hoopdriver flushed hotly and his eyes were angry as he met those of the other man in brown Stow it said mister Hoopdriver stopping and facing the tempter What said the other man in brown surprised Eigh And so saying he stowed it in his breeches pocket D yer think I m to be bribed said mister Hoopdriver whose imagination was rapidly expanding the situation By Gosh I d follow you now My dear sir said the other man in brown I beg your pardon I misunderstood you I really beg your pardon Let us walk on In your profession What have you got to say against my profession Well really you know There are detectives of an inferior description watchers The whole class Private Inquiry I did not realise I really trust you will overlook what was after all you must admit a natural indiscretion Men of honour are not so common in the world in any profession It was lucky for mister Hoopdriver that in Midhurst they do not light the lamps in the summer time or the one they were passing had betrayed him As it was he had to snatch suddenly at his moustache and tug fiercely at it to conceal the furious tumult of exultation the passion of laughter that came boiling up Detective Even in the shadow Bechamel saw that a laugh was stifled but he put it down to the fact that the phrase men of honour amused his interlocutor He ll come round yet said Bechamel to himself He s simply holding out for a fiver He coughed I don t see that it hurts you to tell me who your employer is Don t you I do Prompt said Bechamel appreciatively Now here s the thing I want to put to you the kernel of the whole business You need not answer if you don t want to There s no harm done in my telling you what I want to know Are you employed to watch me or Miss Milton I m not the leaky sort said mister Hoopdriver keeping the secret he did not know with immense enjoyment Miss Milton That was her name Perhaps he d tell some more It s no good pumping Is that all you re after said mister Hoopdriver Bechamel respected himself for his diplomatic gifts He tried to catch a remark by throwing out a confidence I take it there are two people concerned in watching this affair Who s the other said mister Hoopdriver calmly but controlling with enormous internal tension his self appreciation Who s the other was really brilliant he thought There s my wife and HER stepmother And you want to know which it is Yes said Bechamel Well arst em said mister Hoopdriver his exultation getting the better of him and with a pretty consciousness of repartee Arst em both Bechamel turned impatiently Then he made a last effort I d give a five pound note to know just the precise state of affairs he said I told you to stow that said mister Hoopdriver in a threatening tone And added with perfect truth and a magnificent mystery You don t quite understand who you re dealing with But you will He spoke with such conviction that he half believed that that defective office of his in London Baker Street in fact really existed With that the interview terminated Bechamel went back to the Angel perturbed Hang detectives It wasn t the kind of thing he had anticipated at all Hoopdriver with round eyes and a wondering smile walked down to where the mill waters glittered in the moonlight and after meditating over the parapet of the bridge for a space with occasional murmurs of Private Inquiry and the like returned with mystery even in his paces towards the town XVIII That glee which finds expression in raised eyebrows and long low whistling noises was upon mister Hoopdriver For a space he forgot the tears of the Young Lady in Grey Here was a new game and a real one mister Hoopdriver as a Private Inquiry Agent a Sherlock Holmes in fact keeping these two people under observation He walked slowly back from the bridge until he was opposite the Angel and stood for ten minutes perhaps contemplating that establishment and enjoying all the strange sensations of being this wonderful this mysterious and terrible thing Everything fell into place in his scheme He had of course by a kind of instinct assumed the disguise of a cyclist picked up the first old crock he came across as a means of pursuit No expense was to be spared Then he tried to understand what it was in particular that he was observing My wife HER stepmother Then he remembered her swimming eyes Abruptly came a wave of anger that surprised him washed away the detective superstructure and left him plain mister Hoopdriver This man in brown with his confident manner and his proffered half sovereign damn him was up to no good else why should he object to being watched He was married She was not his sister He began to understand A horrible suspicion of the state of affairs came into mister Hoopdriver s head Surely it had not come to THAT He was a detective he would find out How was it to be done He began to submit sketches on approval to himself It required an effort before he could walk into the Angel bar A lemonade and bitter please said mister Hoopdriver He cleared his throat Are mister and missus Bowlong stopping here What a gentleman and a young lady on bicycles Fairly young a married couple No said the barmaid a talkative person of ample dimensions There s no married couples stopping here But there s a mister and Miss BEAUMONT She spelt it for precision Sure you ve got the name right young man Quite said mister Hoopdriver Beaumont there is but no one of the name of What was the name you gave Bowlong said mister Hoopdriver No there ain t no Bowlong said the barmaid taking up a glasscloth and a drying tumbler and beginning to polish the latter First off I thought you might be asking for Beaumont the names being similar Were you expecting them on bicycles Yes they said they MIGHT be in Midhurst tonight P raps they ll come presently Beaumont s here but no Bowlong Sure that Beaumont ain t the name Certain said mister Hoopdriver It s curious the names being so alike I thought p raps And so they conversed at some length mister Hoopdriver delighted to find his horrible suspicion disposed of The barmaid having listened awhile at the staircase volunteered some particulars of the young couple upstairs Her modesty was much impressed by the young lady s costume so she intimated and mister Hoopdriver whispered the badinage natural to the occasion at which she was coquettishly shocked There ll be no knowing which is which in a year or two said the barmaid And her manner too She got off her machine and give it im to stick up against the kerb and in she marched I and my brother says she want to stop here to night My brother doesn t mind what kind of room e as but I want a room with a good view if there s one to be got says she He comes hurrying in after and looks at her I ve settled the rooms she says and e says damn just like that I can fancy my brother letting me boss the show like that I dessay you do said mister Hoopdriver if the truth was known The barmaid looked down smiled and shook her head put down the tumbler polished and took up another that had been draining and shook the drops of water into her little zinc sink She ll be a nice little lot to marry said the barmaid She ll be wearing the well b dashes as the sayin is I can t think what girls is comin to This depreciation of the Young Lady in Grey was hardly to Hoopdriver s taste Fashion said he taking up his change Fashion is all the go with you ladies and always was You ll be wearing em yourself before a couple of years is out Nice they d look on my figger said the barmaid with a titter No I ain t one of your fashionable sort Gracious no I shouldn t feel as if I d anything on me not more than if I d forgot Well there I m talking She put down the glass abruptly I dessay I m old fashioned she said and walked humming down the bar Not you said mister Hoopdriver He waited until he caught her eye then with his native courtesy smiled raised his cap and wished her good evening XIX Then mister Hoopdriver returned to the little room with the lead framed windows where he had dined and where the bed was now comfortably made sat down on the box under the window stared at the moon rising on the shining vicarage roof and tried to collect his thoughts How they whirled at first It was past ten and most of Midhurst was tucked away in bed some one up the street was learning the violin at rare intervals a belated inhabitant hurried home and woke the echoes and a corncrake kept up a busy churning in the vicarage garden The sky was deep blue with a still luminous afterglow along the black edge of the hill and the white moon overhead save for a couple of yellow stars had the sky to herself At first his thoughts were kinetic of deeds and not relationships There was this malefactor and his victim and it had fallen on mister Hoopdriver to take a hand in the game HE was married Did she know he was married Never for a moment did a thought of evil concerning her cross Hoopdriver s mind Simple minded people see questions of morals so much better than superior persons who have read and thought themselves complex to impotence He had heard her voice seen the frank light in her eyes and she had been weeping that sufficed The rights of the case he hadn t properly grasped But he would And that smirking well swine was the mildest for him He recalled the exceedingly unpleasant incident of the railway bridge Thin we won t detain yer thenks said mister Hoopdriver aloud in a strange unnatural contemptible voice supposed to represent that of Bechamel Oh the BEGGAR I ll be level with him yet He s afraid of us detectives that I ll SWEAR If missus Wardor should chance to be on the other side of the door within earshot well and good For a space he meditated chastisements and revenges physical impossibilities for the most part Bechamel staggering headlong from the impact of mister Hoopdriver s large but to tell the truth ill supported fist Bechamel s five feet nine of height lifted from the ground and quivering under a vigorously applied horsewhip So pleasant was such dreaming that mister Hoopdriver s peaked face under the moonlight was transfigured One might have paired him with that well known and universally admired triumph The Soul s Awakening so sweet was his ecstasy And presently with his thirst for revenge glutted by six or seven violent assaults a duel and two vigorous murders his mind came round to the Young Lady in Grey again She was a plucky one too He went over the incident the barmaid at the Angel had described to him His thoughts ceased to be a torrent smoothed down to a mirror in which she was reflected with infinite clearness and detail He d never met anything like her before Fancy that bolster of a barmaid being dressed in that way He whuffed a contemptuous laugh He compared her colour her vigour her voice with the Young Ladies in Business with whom his lot had been cast Even in tears she was beautiful more beautiful indeed to him for it made her seem softer and weaker more accessible And such weeping as he had seen before had been so much a matter of damp white faces red noses and hair coming out of curl Your draper s assistant becomes something of a judge of weeping because weeping is the custom of all Young Ladies in Business when for any reason their services are dispensed with She could weep and by Gosh she could smile HE knew that and reverting to acting abruptly he smiled confidentially at the puckered pallor of the moon It is difficult to say how long mister Hoopdriver s pensiveness lasted It seemed a long time before his thoughts of action returned Then he remembered he was a watcher that to morrow he must be busy It would be in character to make notes and he pulled out his little note book With that in hand he fell a thinking again Would that chap tell her the tecks were after them If so would she be as anxious to get away as HE was He must be on the alert If possible he must speak to her Just a significant word Your friend trust me It occurred to him that to morrow these fugitives might rise early to escape At that he thought of the time and found it was half past eleven Lord said he I must see that I wake He yawned and rose The blind was up and he pulled back the little chintz curtains to let the sunlight strike across to the bed hung his watch within good view of his pillow on a nail that supported a kettle holder and sat down on his bed to undress He lay awake for a little while thinking of the wonderful possibilities of the morrow and thence he passed gloriously into the wonderland of dreams XX THE PURSUIT And now to tell of mister Hoopdriver rising with the sun vigilant active wonderful the practicable half of the lead framed window stuck open ears alert an eye flickering incessantly in the corner panes in oblique glances at the Angel front missus Wardor wanted him to have his breakfast downstairs in her kitchen but that would have meant abandoning the watch and he held out strongly The bicycle cap a pie occupied under protest a strategic position in the shop He was expectant by six in the morning By nine horrible fears oppressed him that his quest had escaped him and he had to reconnoitre the Angel yard in order to satisfy himself There he found the ostler How are the mighty fallen in these decadent days brushing down the bicycles of the chase and he returned relieved to missus Wardor s premises And about ten they emerged and rode quietly up the North Street He watched them until they turned the corner of the post office and then out into the road and up after them in fine style They went by the engine house where the old stocks and the whipping posts are and on to the Chichester road and he followed gallantly So this great chase began They did not look round and he kept them just within sight getting down if he chanced to draw closely upon them round a corner By riding vigorously he kept quite conveniently near them for they made but little hurry He grew hot indeed and his knees were a little stiff to begin with but that was all There was little danger of losing them for a thin chalky dust lay upon the road and the track of her tire was milled like a shilling and his was a chequered ribbon along the way So they rode by Cobden s monument and through the prettiest of villages until at last the downs rose steeply ahead There they stopped awhile at the only inn in the place and mister Hoopdriver took up a position which commanded the inn door and mopped his face and thirsted and smoked a Red Herring cigarette They remained in the inn for some time A number of chubby innocents returning home from school stopped and formed a line in front of him and watched him quietly but firmly for the space of ten minutes or so Go away said he and they only seemed quietly interested He asked them all their names then and they answered indistinct murmurs He gave it up at last and became passive on his gate and so at length they tired of him The couple under observation occupied the inn so long that mister Hoopdriver at the thought of their possible employment hungered as well as thirsted Clearly they were lunching It was a cloudless day and the sun at the meridian beat down upon the top of mister Hoopdriver s head a shower bath of sunshine a huge jet of hot light It made his head swim At last they emerged and the other man in brown looked back and saw him They rode on to the foot of the down and dismounting began to push tediously up that long nearly vertical ascent of blinding white road mister Hoopdriver hesitated It might take them twenty minutes to mount that Beyond was empty downland perhaps for miles He decided to return to the inn and snatch a hasty meal At the inn they gave him biscuits and cheese and a misleading pewter measure of sturdy ale pleasant under the palate cool in the throat but leaden in the legs of a hot afternoon He felt a man of substance as he emerged in the blinding sunshine but even by the foot of the down the sun was insisting again that his skull was too small for his brains The hill had gone steeper the chalky road blazed like a magnesium light and his front wheel began an apparently incurable squeaking He felt as a man from Mars would feel if he were suddenly transferred to this planet about three times as heavy as he was wont to feel The two little black figures had vanished over the forehead of the hill The tracks ll be all right said mister Hoopdriver That was a comforting reflection It not only justified a slow progress up the hill but at the crest a sprawl on the turf beside the road to contemplate the Weald from the south In a matter of two days he had crossed that spacious valley with its frozen surge of green hills its little villages and townships here and there its copses and cornfields its ponds and streams like jewelery of diamonds and silver glittering in the sun The North Downs were hidden far away beyond the Wealden Heights Down below was the little village of Cocking and half way up the hill a mile perhaps to the right hung a flock of sheep grazing together Overhead an anxious peewit circled against the blue and every now and then emitted its feeble cry Up here the heat was tempered by a pleasant breeze mister Hoopdriver was possessed by unreasonable contentment he lit himself a cigarette and lounged more comfortably Surely the Sussex ale is made of the waters of Lethe of poppies and pleasant dreams Drowsiness coiled insidiously about him He awoke with a guilty start to find himself sprawling prone on the turf with his cap over one eye He sat up rubbed his eyes and realised that he had slept His head was still a trifle heavy And the chase He jumped to his feet and stooped to pick up his overturned machine He whipped out his watch and saw that it was past two o clock Lord love us fancy that But the tracks ll be all right said mister Hoopdriver wheeling his machine back to the chalky road I must scorch till I overtake them He mounted and rode as rapidly as the heat and a lingering lassitude permitted Now and then he had to dismount to examine the surface where the road forked He enjoyed that rather Trackin he said aloud and decided in the privacy of his own mind that he had a wonderful instinct for spoor So he came past Goodwood station and Lavant and approached Chichester towards four o clock And then came a terrible thing In places the road became hard in places were the crowded indentations of a recent flock of sheep and at last in the throat of the town cobbles and the stony streets branching east west north and south at a stone cross under the shadow of the cathedral the tracks vanished O Cricky said mister Hoopdriver dismounting in dismay and standing agape Dropped anything said an inhabitant at the kerb Yes said mister Hoopdriver I ve lost the spoor and walked upon his way leaving the inhabitant marvelling what part of a bicycle a spoor might be mister Hoopdriver abandoning tracking began asking people if they had seen a Young Lady in Grey on a bicycle Six casual people hadn t and he began to feel the inquiry was conspicuous and desisted But what was to be done Hoopdriver was hot tired and hungry and full of the first gnawings of a monstrous remorse He decided to get himself some tea and meat and in the Royal George he meditated over the business in a melancholy frame enough They had passed out of his world vanished and all his wonderful dreams of some vague crucial interference collapsed like a castle of cards What a fool he had been not to stick to them like a leech He might have thought But there what WAS the good of that sort of thing now He thought of her tears of her helplessness of the bearing of the other man in brown and his wrath and disappointment surged higher What CAN I do said mister Hoopdriver aloud bringing his fist down beside the teapot What would Sherlock Holmes have done Perhaps after all there might be such things as clues in the world albeit the age of miracles was past But to look for a clue in this intricate network of cobbled streets to examine every muddy interstice There was a chance by looking about and inquiry at the various inns Upon that he began But of course they might have ridden straight through and scarcely a soul have marked them And then came a positively brilliant idea Ow many ways are there out of Chichester said mister Hoopdriver It was really equal to Sherlock Holmes that If they ve made tracks I shall find those tracks If not they re in the town He was then in East Street and he started at once to make the circuit of the place discovering incidentally that Chichester is a walled city In passing he made inquiries at the Black Swan the Crown and the Red Lion Hotel At six o clock in the evening he was walking downcast intent as one who had dropped money along the road towards Bognor kicking up the dust with his shoes and fretting with disappointed pugnacity A thwarted crestfallen Hoopdriver it was as you may well imagine And then suddenly there jumped upon his attention a broad line ribbed like a shilling and close beside it one chequered that ever and again split into two Found said mister Hoopdriver and swung round on his heel at once and back to the Royal George helter skelter for the bicycle they were minding for him The ostler thought he was confoundedly imperious considering his machine XXI AT BOGNOR That seductive gentleman Bechamel had been working up to a crisis He had started upon this elopement in a vein of fine romance immensely proud of his wickedness and really as much in love as an artificial oversoul can be with Jessie But either she was the profoundest of coquettes or she had not the slightest element of Passion with a large P in her composition It warred with all his ideas of himself and the feminine mind to think that under their flattering circumstances she really could be so vitally deficient He found her persistent coolness her more or less evident contempt for himself exasperating in the highest degree He put it to himself that she was enough to provoke a saint and tried to think that was piquant and enjoyable but the blisters on his vanity asserted themselves The fact is he was under this standing irritation getting down to the natural man in himself for once and the natural man in himself in spite of Oxford and the junior Reviewers Club was a Palaeolithic creature of simple tastes and violent methods I ll be level with you yet ran like a plough through the soil of his thoughts Then there was this infernal detective Bechamel had told his wife he was going to Davos to see Carter To that he had fancied she was reconciled but how she would take this exploit was entirely problematical She was a woman of peculiar moral views and she measured marital infidelity largely by its proximity to herself Out of her sight and more particularly out of the sight of the other women of her set vice of the recognised description was perhaps permissible to those contemptible weaklings men but this was Evil on the High Roads She was bound to make a fuss and these fusses invariably took the final form of a tightness of money for Bechamel Albeit and he felt it was heroic of him to resolve so it was worth doing if it was to be done His imagination worked on a kind of matronly Valkyrie and the noise of pursuit and vengeance was in the air The idyll still had the front of the stage That accursed detective it seemed had been thrown off the scent and that at any rate gave a night s respite But things must be brought to an issue forthwith By eight o clock in the evening in a little dining room in the Vicuna Hotel Bognor the crisis had come and Jessie flushed and angry in the face and with her heart sinking faced him again for her last struggle with him He had tricked her this time effectually and luck had been on his side She was booked as missus Beaumont Save for her refusal to enter their room and her eccentricity of eating with unwashed hands she had so far kept up the appearances of things before the waiter But the dinner was grim enough Now in turn she appealed to his better nature and made extravagant statements of her plans to fool him He was white and vicious by this time and his anger quivered through his pose of brilliant wickedness I will go to the station she said I will go back The last train for anywhere leaves at seven point forty two I will appeal to the police You don t know them I will tell these hotel people They will turn you out of doors You re in such a thoroughly false position now They don t understand unconventionality down here She stamped her foot If I wander about the streets all night she said You who have never been out alone after dusk Do you know what the streets of a charming little holiday resort are like I don t care she said I can go to the clergyman here He s a charming man Unmarried And men are really more alike than you think And anyhow Well How CAN you explain the last two nights to anyone now The mischief is done Jessie You CUR she said and suddenly put her hand to her breast He thought she meant to faint but she stood with the colour gone from her face No he said I love you Love said she Yes love There are ways yet she said after a pause Not for you You are too full of life and hope yet for what is it not the dark arch nor the black flowing river Don t you think of it You ll only shirk it when the moment comes and turn it all into comedy She turned round abruptly from him and stood looking out across the parade at the shining sea over which the afterglow of day fled before the rising moon He maintained his attitude The blinds were still up for she had told the waiter not to draw them There was silence for some moments At last he spoke in as persuasive a voice as he could summon Take it sensibly Jessie Why should we who have so much in common quarrel into melodrama I swear I love you You are all that is bright and desirable to me I am stronger than you older man to your woman To find YOU too conventional She looked at him over her shoulder and he noticed with a twinge of delight how her little chin came out beneath the curve of her cheek MAN she said Man to MY woman Do MEN lie Would a MAN use his five and thirty years experience to outwit a girl of seventeen Man to my woman indeed That surely is the last insult Your repartee is admirable Jessie I should say they do though all that and more also when their hearts were set on such a girl as yourself For God s sake drop this shrewishness Why should you be so difficult to me Here am I with MY reputation MY career at your feet Look here Jessie on my honour I will marry you God forbid she said so promptly that she never learnt he had a wife even then It occurred to him then for the first time in the flash of her retort that she did not know he was married Tis only a pre nuptial settlement he said following that hint He paused You must be sensible The thing s your own doing Come out on the beach now the beach here is splendid and the moon will soon be high I WON T she said stamping her foot Well well Oh leave me alone Let me think Think he said if you want to It s your cry always But you can t save yourself by thinking my dear girl You can t save yourself in any way now If saving it is this parsimony Oh go go Very well I will go I will go and smoke a cigar And think of you dear But do you think I should do all this if I did not care Go she whispered without glancing round She continued to stare out of the window He stood looking at her for a moment with a strange light in his eyes He made a step towards her I HAVE you he said You are mine Netted caught But mine He would have gone up to her and laid his hand upon her but he did not dare to do that yet I have you in my hand he said in my power Do you hear POWER She remained impassive He stared at her for half a minute and then with a superb gesture that was lost upon her went to the door Surely the instinctive abasement of her sex before Strength was upon his side He told himself that his battle was won She heard the handle move and the catch click as the door closed behind him XXII And now without in the twilight behold mister Hoopdriver his cheeks hot his eye bright His brain is in a tumult The nervous obsequious Hoopdriver to whom I introduced you some days since has undergone a wonderful change Ever since he lost that spoor in Chichester he has been tormented by the most horrible visions of the shameful insults that may be happening The strangeness of new surroundings has been working to strip off the habitual servile from him Here was moonlight rising over the memory of a red sunset dark shadows and glowing orange lamps beauty somewhere mysteriously rapt away from him tangible wrong in a brown suit and an unpleasant face flouting him mister Hoopdriver for the time was in the world of Romance and Knight errantry divinely forgetful of his social position or hers forgetting too for the time any of the wretched timidities that had tied him long since behind the counter in his proper place He was angry and adventurous It was all about him this vivid drama he had fallen into and it was eluding him He was far too grimly in earnest to pick up that lost thread and make a play of it now The man was living He did not pose when he alighted at the coffee tavern even nor when he made his hasty meal As Bechamel crossed from the Vicuna towards the esplanade Hoopdriver disappointed and exasperated came hurrying round the corner from the Temperance Hotel At the sight of Bechamel his heart jumped and the tension of his angry suspense exploded into rather than gave place to an excited activity of mind They were at the Vicuna and she was there now alone It was the occasion he sought But he would give Chance no chance against him He went back round the corner sat down on the seat and watched Bechamel recede into the dimness up the esplanade before he got up and walked into the hotel entrance A lady cyclist in grey he asked for and followed boldly on the waiter s heels The door of the dining room was opening before he felt a qualm And then suddenly he was nearly minded to turn and run for it and his features seemed to him to be convulsed She turned with a start and looked at him with something between terror and hope in her eyes Can I have a few words with you alone said mister Hoopdriver controlling his breath with difficulty She hesitated and then motioned the waiter to withdraw mister Hoopdriver watched the door shut He had intended to step out into the middle of the room fold his arms and say You are in trouble I am a Friend Trust me Instead of which he stood panting and then spoke with sudden familiarity hastily guiltily Look here I don t know what the juice is up but I think there s something wrong Excuse my intruding if it isn t so I ll do anything you like to help you out of the scrape if you re in one That s my meaning I believe What can I do I would do anything to help you Her brow puckered as she watched him make with infinite emotion this remarkable speech YOU she said She was tumultuously weighing possibilities in her mind and he had scarcely ceased when she had made her resolve She stepped a pace forward You are a gentleman she said Yes said mister Hoopdriver Can I trust you She did not wait for his assurance I must leave this hotel at once Come here She took his arm and led him to the window You can just see the gate It is still open Through that are our bicycles Go down get them out and I will come down to you Dare you Get your bicycle out in the road Both Mine alone is no good At once Dare you Which way Go out by the front door and round I will follow in one minute Right said mister Hoopdriver and went He had to get those bicycles Had he been told to go out and kill Bechamel he would have done it His head was a maelstrom now He walked out of the hotel along the front and into the big black shadowed coach yard He looked round There were no bicycles visible Then a man emerged from the dark a short man in a short black shiny jacket Hoopdriver was caught He made no attempt to turn and run for it I ve been giving your machines a wipe over sir said the man recognising the suit and touching his cap Hoopdriver s intelligence now was a soaring eagle he swooped on the situation at once That s right he said and added before the pause became marked Where is mine I want to look at the chain The man led him into an open shed and went fumbling for a lantern Hoopdriver moved the lady s machine out of his way to the door and then laid hands on the man s machine and wheeled it out of the shed into the yard The gate stood open and beyond was the pale road and a clump of trees black in the twilight He stooped and examined the chain with trembling fingers How was it to be done Something behind the gate seemed to flutter The man must be got rid of anyhow I say said Hoopdriver with an inspiration can you get me a screwdriver The man simply walked across the shed opened and shut a box and came up to the kneeling Hoopdriver with a screwdriver in his hand Hoopdriver felt himself a lost man He took the screwdriver with a tepid Thanks and incontinently had another inspiration I say he said again Well This is miles too big The man lit the lantern brought it up to Hoopdriver and put it down on the ground Want a smaller screwdriver he said Hoopdriver had his handkerchief out and sneezed a prompt ATICHEW It is the orthodox thing when you wish to avoid recognition As small as you have he said out of his pocket handkerchief I ain t got none smaller than that said the ostler Won t do really said Hoopdriver still wallowing in his handkerchief I ll see wot they got in the ouse if you like sir said the man If you would said Hoopdriver And as the man s heavily nailed boots went clattering down the yard Hoopdriver stood up took a noiseless step to the lady s machine laid trembling hands on its handle and saddle and prepared for a rush The scullery door opened momentarily and sent a beam of warm yellow light up the road shut again behind the man and forthwith Hoopdriver rushed the machines towards the gate A dark grey form came fluttering to meet him Give me this she said and bring yours He passed the thing to her touched her hand in the darkness ran back seized Bechamel s machine and followed The yellow light of the scullery door suddenly flashed upon the cobbles again It was too late now to do anything but escape He heard the ostler shout behind him and came into the road She was up and dim already He got into the saddle without a blunder In a moment the ostler was in the gateway with a full throated HI sir That ain t allowed and Hoopdriver was overtaking the Young Lady in Grey For some moments the earth seemed alive with shouts of Stop em and the shadows with ambuscades of police The road swept round and they were riding out of sight of the hotel and behind dark hedges side by side She was weeping with excitement as he overtook her Brave she said brave and he ceased to feel like a hunted thief He looked over his shoulder and about him and saw that they were already out of Bognor for the Vicuna stands at the very westernmost extremity of the sea front and riding on a fair wide road

831_130746_000002_000000	train-clean-100	The ostler being a fool rushed violently down the road vociferating after them 
831_130746_000002_000001	train-clean-100	Then he returned panting to the Vicuna Hotel and finding a group of men outside the entrance who wanted to know what was UP stopped to give them the cream of the adventure 
831_130746_000002_000002	train-clean-100	That gave the fugitives five minutes 
none	none	Then pushing breathlessly into the bar he had to make it clear to the barmaid what the matter was and the gov nor being out they spent some more precious time wondering what EVER was to be done in which the two customers returning from outside joined with animation 
831_130746_000002_000004	train-clean-100	There were also moral remarks and other irrelevant contributions 
831_130746_000002_000005	train-clean-100	There were conflicting ideas of telling the police and pursuing the flying couple on a horse 
831_130746_000002_000006	train-clean-100	That made ten minutes 
none	none	Then Stephen the waiter who had shown Hoopdriver up came down and lit wonderful lights and started quite a fresh discussion by the simple question WHICH That turned ten minutes into a quarter of an hour And in the midst of this discussion making a sudden and awestricken silence appeared Bechamel in the hall beyond the bar walked with a resolute air to the foot of the staircase and passed out of sight You conceive the backward pitch of that exceptionally shaped cranium Incredulous eyes stared into one another s in the bar as his paces muffled by the stair carpet went up to the landing turned reached the passage and walked into the dining room overhead
831_130746_000003_000000	train-clean-100	 It wasn t that one at all miss said the ostler I d SWEAR 
831_130746_000004_000000	train-clean-100	 Well that s mister Beaumont said the barmaid anyhow 
831_130746_000005_000000	train-clean-100	Their conversation hung comatose in the air switched up by Bechamel They listened together 
831_130746_000005_000001	train-clean-100	His feet stopped 
none	none	Turned Went out of the diningroom 
831_130746_000005_000004	train-clean-100	Down the passage to the bedroom 
831_130746_000005_000005	train-clean-100	Stopped again 
831_130746_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 Poor chap said the barmaid 
none	none	She s a wicked woman Sssh said Stephen 
831_130746_000008_000000	train-clean-100	After a pause Bechamel went back to the dining room 
831_130746_000008_000001	train-clean-100	They heard a chair creak under him 
831_130746_000008_000002	train-clean-100	Interlude of conversational eyebrows 
831_130746_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 I m going up said Stephen to break the melancholy news to him 
831_130746_000010_000000	train-clean-100	Bechamel looked up from a week old newspaper as without knocking Stephen entered 
831_130746_000010_000001	train-clean-100	Bechamel s face suggested a different expectation 
831_130746_000010_000002	train-clean-100	 Beg pardon sir said Stephen with a diplomatic cough 
831_130746_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 Well said Bechamel wondering suddenly if Jessie had kept some of her threats 
831_130746_000011_000001	train-clean-100	If so he was in for an explanation 
831_130746_000011_000002	train-clean-100	But he had it ready 
831_130746_000011_000003	train-clean-100	She was a monomaniac 
831_130746_000011_000004	train-clean-100	 Leave me alone with her he would say I know how to calm her 
831_130746_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 missus Beaumont said Stephen 
none	none	WELL
831_130746_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 Has gone 
none	none	He rose with a fine surprise
831_130746_000015_000001	train-clean-100	 Gone he said with a half laugh 
831_130746_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 Gone sir 
831_130746_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 On her bicycle 
831_130746_000016_000001	train-clean-100	On her bicycle 
none	none	On her bicycle Why
831_130746_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 She went sir with Another Gentleman 
none	none	This time Bechamel was really startled An other Gentlemen WHO
831_130746_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 Another gentleman in brown sir 
831_130746_000020_000001	train-clean-100	Went into the yard sir got out the two bicycles sir and went off sir about twenty minutes ago 
831_130746_000021_000000	train-clean-100	Bechamel stood with his eyes round and his knuckle on his hips 
none	none	Stephen watching him with immense enjoyment speculated whether this abandoned husband would weep or curse or rush off at once in furious pursuit 
831_130746_000021_000002	train-clean-100	But as yet he seemed merely stunned 
831_130746_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 Brown clothes he said 
831_130746_000022_000001	train-clean-100	 And fairish 
831_130746_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 A little like yourself sir in the dark 
831_130746_000023_000001	train-clean-100	The ostler sir Jim Duke 
none	none	Bechamel laughed awry 
831_130746_000024_000001	train-clean-100	Then with infinite fervour he said But let us put in blank cartridge he said 
831_130746_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 I might have thought 
831_130746_000026_000000	train-clean-100	He flung himself into the armchair 
831_130746_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 Damn her said Bechamel for all the world like a common man 
831_130746_000027_000001	train-clean-100	 I ll chuck this infernal business 
none	none	They ve gone eigh Yessir Well
831_130746_000029_000001	train-clean-100	 let em GO 
none	none	said Bechamel making a memorable saying Let em GO 
831_130746_000029_000002	train-clean-100	Who cares 
831_130746_000029_000003	train-clean-100	And I wish him luck 
none	none	And bring me some Bourbon as fast as you can there s a good chap I ll take that and then I ll have another look round Bognor before I turn in 
831_130746_000030_000000	train-clean-100	Stephen was too surprised to say anything but Bourbon sir 
831_130746_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 Go on said Bechamel 
none	none	Damn you 
831_130746_000032_000000	train-clean-100	Stephen s sympathies changed at once 
none	none	Yessir he murmured fumbling for the door handle and left the room marvelling Bechamel having in this way satisfied his sense of appearances and comported himself as a Pagan should so soon as the waiter s footsteps had passed vented the cream of his feelings in a stream of blasphemous indecency Whether his wife or HER stepmother had sent the detective SHE had evidently gone off with him and that little business was over And he was here stranded and sold an ass and as it were the son of many generations of asses 
831_130746_000032_000005	train-clean-100	And his only ray of hope was that it seemed more probable after all that the girl had escaped through her stepmother 
831_130746_000032_000006	train-clean-100	In which case the business might be hushed up yet and the evil hour of explanation with his wife indefinitely postponed 
none	none	Then abruptly the image of that lithe figure in grey knickerbockers went frisking across his mind again and he reverted to his blasphemies 
831_130746_000032_000008	train-clean-100	He started up in a gusty frenzy with a vague idea of pursuit and incontinently sat down again with a concussion that stirred the bar below to its depths 
831_130746_000032_000009	train-clean-100	He banged the arms of the chair with his fist and swore again 
none	none	Of all the accursed fools that were ever spawned he was chanting I Bechamel when with an abrupt tap and prompt opening of the door Stephen entered with the Bourbon 
831_130746_000033_000000	train-clean-100	XXIV 
831_130746_000033_000001	train-clean-100	THE MOONLIGHT RIDE
831_130746_000034_000000	train-clean-100	And so the twenty minutes law passed into an infinity 
none	none	We leave the wicked Bechamel clothing himself with cursing as with a garment the wretched creature has already sufficiently sullied our modest but truthful pages we leave the eager little group in the bar of the Vicuna Hotel we leave all Bognor as we have left all Chichester and Midhurst and Haslemere and Guildford and Ripley and Putney and follow this dear fool of a Hoopdriver of ours and his Young Lady in Grey out upon the moonlight road 
831_130746_000034_000002	train-clean-100	How they rode 
831_130746_000034_000003	train-clean-100	How their hearts beat together and their breath came fast and how every shadow was anticipation and every noise pursuit 
831_130746_000034_000004	train-clean-100	For all that flight mister Hoopdriver was in the world of Romance 
831_130746_000034_000005	train-clean-100	Had a policeman intervened because their lamps were not lit Hoopdriver had cut him down and ridden on after the fashion of a hero born 
none	none	Had Bechamel arisen in the way with rapiers for a duel Hoopdriver had fought as one to whom Agincourt was a reality and drapery a dream It was Rescue Elopement Glory 
831_130746_000034_000007	train-clean-100	And she by the side of him 
831_130746_000034_000008	train-clean-100	He had seen her face in shadow with the morning sunlight tangled in her hair he had seen her sympathetic with that warm light in her face he had seen her troubled and her eyes bright with tears 
831_130746_000034_000009	train-clean-100	But what light is there lighting a face like hers to compare with the soft glamour of the midsummer moon 
831_130746_000035_000000	train-clean-100	The road turned northward going round through the outskirts of Bognor in one place dark and heavy under a thick growth of trees then amidst villas again some warm and lamplit some white and sleeping in the moonlight then between hedges over which they saw broad wan meadows shrouded in a low lying mist 
831_130746_000035_000001	train-clean-100	They scarcely heeded whither they rode at first being only anxious to get away turning once westward when the spire of Chichester cathedral rose suddenly near them out of the dewy night pale and intricate and high 
831_130746_000035_000002	train-clean-100	They rode speaking little just a rare word now and then at a turning at a footfall at a roughness in the road 
none	none	She seemed to be too intent upon escape to give much thought to him but after the first tumult of the adventure as flight passed into mere steady ridin his mind became an enormous appreciation of the position The night was a warm white silence save for the subtile running of their chains 
831_130746_000036_000001	train-clean-100	He looked sideways at her as she sat beside him with her ankles gracefully ruling the treadles 
831_130746_000036_000002	train-clean-100	Now the road turned westward and she was a dark grey outline against the shimmer of the moon and now they faced northwards and the soft cold light passed caressingly over her hair and touched her brow and cheek 
831_130746_000037_000000	train-clean-100	There is a magic quality in moonshine it touches all that is sweet and beautiful and the rest of the night is hidden 
831_130746_000037_000001	train-clean-100	It has created the fairies whom the sunlight kills and fairyland rises again in our hearts at the sight of it the voices of the filmy route and their faint soul piercing melodies 
none	none	By the moonlight every man dull clod though he be by day tastes something of Endymion takes something of the youth and strength of Enidymion and sees the dear white goddess shining at him from his Lady s eyes The firm substantial daylight things become ghostly and elusive the hills beyond are a sea of unsubstantial texture the world a visible spirit the spiritual within us rises out of its darkness loses something of its weight and body and swims up towards heaven This road that was a mere rutted white dust hot underfoot blinding to the eye is now a soft grey silence with the glitter of a crystal grain set starlike in its silver here and there 
831_130746_000037_000005	train-clean-100	Overhead riding serenely through the spacious blue is the mother of the silence she who has spiritualised the world alone save for two attendant steady shining stars 
831_130746_000037_000006	train-clean-100	And in silence under her benign influence under the benediction of her light rode our two wanderers side by side through the transfigured and transfiguring night 
831_130746_000038_000000	train-clean-100	Nowhere was the moon shining quite so brightly as in mister Hoopdriver s skull 
831_130746_000038_000001	train-clean-100	At the turnings of the road he made his decisions with an air of profound promptitude and quite haphazard 
831_130746_000038_000002	train-clean-100	 The Right he would say Or again The Left as one who knew 
831_130746_000038_000003	train-clean-100	So it was that in the space of an hour they came abruptly down a little lane full tilt upon the sea 
none	none	Grey beach to the right of them and to the left and a little white cottage fast asleep inland of a sleeping fishing boat Hullo said mister Hoopdriver sotto voce 
831_130746_000038_000006	train-clean-100	They dismounted abruptly 
831_130746_000038_000007	train-clean-100	Stunted oaks and thorns rose out of the haze of moonlight that was tangled in the hedge on either side 
none	none	You are safe said mister Hoopdriver sweeping off his cap with an air and bowing courtly
831_130746_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 Where are we 
none	none	SAFE
831_130746_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 But WHERE 
831_130746_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 Chichester Harbour He waved his arm seaward as though it was a goal 
831_130746_000044_000000	train-clean-100	 Do you think they will follow us 
831_130746_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 We have turned and turned again 
831_130746_000046_000000	train-clean-100	It seemed to Hoopdriver that he heard her sob 
831_130746_000046_000001	train-clean-100	She stood dimly there holding her machine and he holding his could go no nearer to her to see if she sobbed for weeping or for want of breath 
831_130746_000046_000002	train-clean-100	 What are we to do now her voice asked 
831_130746_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 Are you tired he asked 
831_130746_000048_000000	train-clean-100	 I will do what has to be done 
831_130746_000049_000000	train-clean-100	The two black figures in the broken light were silent for a space 
831_130746_000049_000001	train-clean-100	 Do you know she said I am not afraid of you 
none	none	I am sure you are honest to me 
831_130746_000049_000003	train-clean-100	And I do not even know your name 
831_130746_000050_000000	train-clean-100	He was taken with a sudden shame of his homely patronymic 
831_130746_000050_000001	train-clean-100	 It s an ugly name he said 
831_130746_000050_000002	train-clean-100	 But you are right in trusting me 
none	none	I would I would do anything for you 
831_130746_000050_000004	train-clean-100	This is nothing 
831_130746_000051_000000	train-clean-100	She caught at her breath 
831_130746_000051_000001	train-clean-100	She did not care to ask why 
831_130746_000051_000002	train-clean-100	But compared with Bechamel We take each other on trust she said 
831_130746_000051_000003	train-clean-100	 Do you want to know how things are with me 
831_130746_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 That man she went on after the assent of his listening silence promised to help and protect me 
831_130746_000052_000001	train-clean-100	I was unhappy at home never mind why 
831_130746_000052_000002	train-clean-100	A stepmother Idle unoccupied hindered cramped that is enough perhaps 
none	none	Then he came into my life and talked to me of art and literature and set my brain on fire 
831_130746_000052_000004	train-clean-100	I wanted to come out into the world to be a human being not a thing in a hutch 
none	none	And he
831_130746_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 I know said Hoopdriver 
none	none	And now here I am
831_130746_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 I will do anything said Hoopdriver 
none	none	She thought
831_130746_000056_000001	train-clean-100	 You cannot imagine my stepmother 
none	none	No 
831_130746_000056_000003	train-clean-100	I could not describe her 
831_130746_000057_000000	train-clean-100	 I am entirely at your service 
831_130746_000057_000001	train-clean-100	I will help you with all my power 
831_130746_000058_000000	train-clean-100	 I have lost an Illusion and found a Knight errant She spoke of Bechamel as the Illusion 
831_130746_000059_000000	train-clean-100	mister Hoopdriver felt flattered 
831_130746_000059_000001	train-clean-100	But he had no adequate answer 
none	none	I m thinking he said full of a rapture of protective responsibility what we had best be doing 
831_130746_000060_000001	train-clean-100	You are tired you know 
831_130746_000060_000002	train-clean-100	And we can t wander all night after the day we ve had 
831_130746_000061_000000	train-clean-100	 That was Chichester we were near she asked 
none	none	If he meditated with a tremble in his voice you would make ME your brother MISS BEAUMONT Yes
831_130746_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 We could stop there together 
831_130746_000065_000000	train-clean-100	She took a minute to answer 
none	none	I am going to light these lamps said Hoopdriver 
831_130746_000065_000002	train-clean-100	He bent down to his own and struck a match on his shoe 
none	none	She looked at his face in its light grave and intent 
831_130746_000065_000004	train-clean-100	How could she ever have thought him common or absurd 
831_130746_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 But you must tell me your name brother she said 
none	none	Er Carrington said mister Hoopdriver after a momentary pause 
831_130746_000067_000001	train-clean-100	Who would be Hoopdriver on a night like this 
831_130746_000068_000000	train-clean-100	 But the Christian name 
831_130746_000069_000000	train-clean-100	 Christian name 
none	none	Christian name 
831_130746_000069_000001	train-clean-100	MY Christian name 
831_130746_000069_000002	train-clean-100	Well Chris 
831_130746_000069_000003	train-clean-100	He snapped his lamp and stood up 
none	none	If you will hold my machine I will light yours he said 
831_130746_000070_000000	train-clean-100	She came round obediently and took his machine and for a moment they stood face to face 
831_130746_000070_000001	train-clean-100	 My name brother Chris she said is Jessie 
831_130746_000071_000000	train-clean-100	He looked into her eyes and his excitement seemed arrested 
831_130746_000071_000001	train-clean-100	 JESSIE he repeated slowly 
831_130746_000071_000002	train-clean-100	The mute emotion of his face affected her strangely She had to speak 
none	none	It s not such a very wonderful name is it she said with a laugh to break the intensity 
831_130746_000072_000000	train-clean-100	He opened his mouth and shut it again and with a sudden wincing of his features abruptly turned and bent down to open the lantern in front of her machine 
831_130746_000072_000001	train-clean-100	She looked down at him almost kneeling in front of her with an unreasonable approbation in her eyes 
none	none	It was as I have indicated the hour and season of the full moon 
831_130746_000073_000000	train-clean-100	XXV 
none	none	mister Hoopdriver conducted the rest of that night s journey with the same confident dignity as before and it was chiefly by good luck and the fact that most roads about a town converge thereupon that Chichester was at last attained 
831_130746_000074_000001	train-clean-100	It seemed at first as though everyone had gone to bed but the Red Hotel still glowed yellow and warm 
none	none	It was the first time Hoopdriver bad dared the mysteries of a first class hotel But that night he was in the mood to dare anything So you found your Young Lady at last said the ostler of the Red Hotel for it chanced he was one of those of whom Hoopdriver had made inquiries in the afternoon
831_130746_000076_000000	train-clean-100	 Quite a misunderstanding said Hoopdriver with splendid readiness My sister had gone to Bognor But I brought her back here 
831_130746_000076_000001	train-clean-100	I ve took a fancy to this place 
831_130746_000076_000002	train-clean-100	And the moonlight s simply dee vine 
831_130746_000077_000000	train-clean-100	 We ve had supper thenks and we re tired said mister Hoopdriver 
831_130746_000077_000001	train-clean-100	 I suppose you won t take anything Jessie 
831_130746_000078_000000	train-clean-100	The glory of having her even as a sister and to call her Jessie like that 
831_130746_000078_000001	train-clean-100	But he carried it off splendidly as he felt himself bound to admit 
831_130746_000078_000002	train-clean-100	 Good night Sis he said and pleasant dreams 
none	none	I ll just ave a look at this paper before I turn in But this was living indeed he told himself 
831_130746_000079_000000	train-clean-100	So gallantly did mister Hoopdriver comport himself up to the very edge of the Most Wonderful Day of all 
831_130746_000079_000001	train-clean-100	It had begun early you will remember with a vigil in a little sweetstuff shop next door to the Angel at Midhurst 
none	none	But to think of all the things that had happened since then He caught himself in the middle of a yawn pulled out his watch saw the time was halfpast eleven and marched off with a fine sense of heroism bedward XXVI THE SURBITON INTERLUDE And here thanks to the glorious institution of sleep comes a break in the narrative again These absurd young people are safely tucked away now their heads full of glowing nonsense indeed but the course of events at any rate is safe from any fresh developments through their activities for the next eight hours or more They are both sleeping healthily you will perhaps be astonished to hear Here is the girl what girls are coming to nowadays only missus Lynn Linton can tell in company with an absolute stranger of low extraction and uncertain accent unchaperoned and unabashed indeed now she fancies she is safe she is if anything a little proud of her own share in these transactions Then this mister Hoopdriver of yours roseate idiot that he is is in illegal possession of a stolen bicycle a stolen young lady and two stolen names established with them in an hotel that is quite beyond his means and immensely proud of himself in a somnolent way for these incomparable follies There are occasions when a moralising novelist can merely wring his hands and leave matters to take their course For all Hoopdriver knows or cares he may be locked up the very first thing to morrow morning for the rape of the cycle Then in Bognor let alone that melancholy vestige Bechamel with whom our dealings are thank Goodness over there is a Coffee Tavern with a steak mister Hoopdriver ordered done to a cinder long ago his American cloth parcel in a bedroom and his own proper bicycle by way of guarantee carefully locked up in the hayloft To morrow he will be a Mystery and they will be looking for his body along the sea front And so far we have never given a glance at the desolate home in Surbiton familiar to you no doubt through the medium of illustrated interviews where the unhappy stepmother That stepmother it must be explained is quite well known to you That is a little surprise I have prepared for you She is Thomas Plantagenet the gifted authoress of that witty and daring book A Soul Untrammelled and quite an excellent woman in her way only it is such a crooked way Her real name is Milton She is a widow and a charming one only ten years older than Jessie and she is always careful to dedicate her more daring works to the sacred memory of my husband to show that there s nothing personal you know in the matter Considering her literary reputation she was always speaking of herself as one I martyred for truth because the critics advertised her written indecorums in column long slates considering her literary reputation I say she was one of the most respectable women it is possible to imagine She furnished correctly dressed correctly had severe notions of whom she might meet went to church and even at times took the sacrament in some esoteric spirit And Jessie she brought up so carefully that she never even let her read A Soul Untrammelled Which therefore naturally enough Jessie did and went on from that to a feast of advanced literature missus Milton not only brought up Jessie carefully but very slowly so that at seventeen she was still a clever schoolgirl as you have seen her and quite in the background of the little literary circle of unimportant celebrities which Thomas Plantagenet adorned missus Milton knew Bechamel s reputation of being a dangerous man but then bad men are not bad women and she let him come to her house to show she was not afraid she took no account of Jessie When the elopement came therefore it was a double disappointment to her for she perceived his hand by a kind of instinct She did the correct thing The correct thing as you know is to take hansom cabs regardless of expense and weep and say you do not know WHAT to do round the circle of your confidential friends She could not have ridden nor wept more had Jessie been her own daughter she showed the properest spirit And she not only showed it but felt it missus Milton as a successful little authoress and still more successful widow of thirty two Thomas Plantagenet is a charming woman her reviewers used to write invariably even if they spoke ill of her found the steady growth of Jessie into womanhood an unmitigated nuisance and had been willing enough to keep her in the background And Jessie who had started this intercourse at fourteen with abstract objections to stepmothers had been active enough in resenting this Increasing rivalry and antagonism had sprung up between them until they could engender quite a vivid hatred from a dropped hairpin or the cutting of a book with a sharpened knife There is very little deliberate wickedness in the world The stupidity of our selfishness gives much the same results indeed but in the ethical laboratory it shows a different nature And when the disaster came missus Milton s remorse for their gradual loss of sympathy and her share in the losing of it was genuine enough You may imagine the comfort she got from her friends and how West Kensington and Notting Hill and Hampstead the literary suburbs those decent penitentiaries of a once Bohemian calling hummed with the business Her Men as a charming literary lady she had of course an organised corps were immensely excited and were sympathetic helpfully energetic suggestive alert as their ideals of their various dispositions required them to be Any news of Jessie was the pathetic opening of a dozen melancholy but interesting conversations To her Men she was not perhaps so damp as she was to her women friends but in a quiet way she was even more touching For three days Wednesday that is Thursday and Friday nothing was heard of the fugitives It was known that Jessie wearing a patent costume with buttonup skirts and mounted on a diamond frame safety with Dunlops and a loofah covered saddle had ridden forth early in the morning taking with her about two pounds seven shillings in money and a grey touring case packed and there save for a brief note to her stepmother a declaration of independence it was said an assertion of her Ego containing extensive and very annoying quotations from A Soul Untrammelled and giving no definite intimation of her plans knowledge ceased That note was shown to few and then only in the strictest confidence But on Friday evening late came a breathless Man Friend Widgery a correspondent of hers who had heard of her trouble among the first He had been touring in Sussex his knapsack was still on his back and he testified hurriedly that at a place called Midhurst in the bar of an hotel called the Angel he had heard from a barmaid a vivid account of a Young Lady in Grey Descriptions tallied But who was the man in brown The poor misguided girl I must go to her at once she said choking and rising with her hand to her heart It s impossible to night There are no more trains I looked on my way A mother s love she said I bear her THAT I know you do He spoke with feeling for no one admired his photographs of scenery more than missus Milton It s more than she deserves Oh don t speak unkindly of her She has been misled It was really very friendly of him He declared he was only sorry his news ended there Should he follow them and bring her back He had come to her because he knew of her anxiety It is GOOD of you she said and quite instinctively took and pressed his hand And to think of that poor girl tonight It s dreadful She looked into the fire that she had lit when he came in the warm light fell upon her dark purple dress and left her features in a warm shadow She looked such a slight frail thing to be troubled so We must follow her Her resolution seemed magnificent I have no one to go with me He must marry her said the man She has no friends We have no one After all Two women So helpless And this fair haired little figure was the woman that people who knew her only from her books called bold prurient even Simply because she was great hearted intellectual He was overcome by the unspeakable pathos of her position missus Milton he said Hetty She glanced at him The overflow was imminent Not now she said not now I must find her first Yes he said with intense emotion He was one of those big fat men who feel deeply But let me help you At least let me help you But can you spare time she said For ME For you But what can I do what can WE do Go to Midhurst Follow her on Trace her She was there on Thursday night last night She cycled out of the town Courage he said We will save her yet She put out her hand and pressed his again Courage he repeated finding it so well received There were alarms and excursions without She turned her back to the fire and he sat down suddenly in the big armchair which suited his dimensions admirably Then the door opened and the girl showed in Dangle who looked curiously from one to the other There was emotion here he had heard the armchair creaking and missus Milton whose face was flushed displayed a suspicious alacrity to explain You too she said are one of my good friends And we have news of her at last It was decidedly an advantage to Widgery but Dangle determined to show himself a man of resource In the end he too was accepted for the Midhurst Expedition to the intense disgust of Widgery and young Phipps a callow youth of few words faultless collars and fervent devotion was also enrolled before the evening was out They would scour the country all three of them She appeared to brighten up a little but it was evident she was profoundly touched She did not know what she had done to merit such friends Her voice broke a little she moved towards the door and young Phipps who was a youth of action rather than of words sprang and opened it proud to be first She is sorely troubled said Dangle to Widgery We must do what we can for her She is a wonderful woman said Dangle So subtle so intricate so many faceted She feels this deeply Young Phipps said nothing but he felt the more And yet they say the age of chivalry is dead But this is only an Interlude introduced to give our wanderers time to refresh themselves by good honest sleeping For the present therefore we will not concern ourselves with the starting of the Rescue Party nor with missus Milton s simple but becoming grey dress with the healthy Widgery s Norfolk jacket and thick boots with the slender Dangle s energetic bearing nor with the wonderful chequerings that set off the legs of the golf suited Phipps They are after us In a little while they will be upon us You must imagine as you best can the competitive raidings at Midhurst of Widgery Dangle and Phipps How Widgery was great at questions and Dangle good at inference and Phipps so conspicuously inferior in everything that he felt it and sulked with missus Milton most of the day after the manner of your callow youth the whole world over missus Milton stopped at the Angel and was very sad and charming and intelligent and Widgery paid the bill in the afternoon of Saturday Chichester was attained But by that time our fugitives As you shall immediately hear XXVII THE AWAKENING OF mister HOOPDRIVER mister Hoopdriver stirred on his pillow opened his eyes and staring unmeaningly yawned The bedclothes were soft and pleasant He turned the peaked nose that overrides the insufficient moustache up to the ceiling a pinkish projection over the billow of white You might see it wrinkle as he yawned again and then became quiet So matters remained for a space Very slowly recollection returned to him Then a shock of indeterminate brown hair appeared and first one watery grey eye a wondering and then two the bed upheaved and you had him his thin neck projecting abruptly from the clothes he held about him his face staring about the room He held the clothes about him I hope I may explain because his night shirt was at Bognor in an American cloth packet derelict He yawned a third time rubbed his eyes smacked his lips He was recalling almost everything now The pursuit the hotel the tremulous daring of his entry the swift adventure of the inn yard the moonlight Abruptly he threw the clothes back and rose into a sitting position on the edge of the bed Without was the noise of shutters being unfastened and doors unlocked and the passing of hoofs and wheels in the street He looked at his watch Half past six He surveyed the sumptuous room again Lord said mister Hoopdriver It wasn t a dream after all I wonder what they charge for these Juiced rooms said mister Hoopdriver nursing one rosy foot He became meditative tugging at his insufficient moustache Suddenly he gave vent to a noiseless laugh What a rush it was Rushed in and off with his girl right under his nose Planned it well too Talk of highway robbery Talk of brigands Up and off How juiced SOLD he must be feeling It was a shave too in the coach yard Suddenly he became silent Abruptly his eyebrows rose and his jaw fell I sa a ay said mister Hoopdriver He had never thought of it before Perhaps you will understand the whirl he had been in overnight But one sees things clearer in the daylight I m hanged if I haven t been and stolen a blessed bicycle Who cares said mister Hoopdriver presently and his face supplied the answer Then he thought of the Young Lady in Grey again and tried to put a more heroic complexion on the business But of an early morning on an empty stomach as with characteristic coarseness medical men put it heroics are of a more difficult growth than by moonlight Everything had seemed exceptionally fine and brilliant but quite natural the evening before mister Hoopdriver reached out his hand took his Norfolk jacket laid it over his knees and took out the money from the little ticket pocket Fourteen and six half he said holding the coins in his left hand and stroking his chin with his right He verified by patting the presence of a pocketbook in the breast pocket Five fourteen six half said mister Hoopdriver Left With the Norfolk jacket still on his knees he plunged into another silent meditation That wouldn t matter he said It s the bike s the bother No good going back to Bognor Might send it back by carrier of course Thanking him for the loan Having no further use mister Hoopdriver chuckled and lapsed into the silent concoction of a delightfully impudent letter mister J Hoopdriver presents his compliments But the grave note reasserted itself Might trundle back there in an hour of course and exchange them MY old crock s so blessed shabby He s sure to be spiteful too Have me run in perhaps Then she d be in just the same old fix only worse You see I m her Knight errant It complicates things so His eye wandering loosely rested on the sponge bath What the juice do they want with cream pans in a bedroom said mister Hoopdriver en passant Best thing we can do is to set out of here as soon as possible anyhow I suppose she ll go home to her friends That bicycle is a juicy nuisance anyhow Juicy nuisance He jumped to his feet with a sudden awakening of energy to proceed with his toilet Then with a certain horror he remembered that the simple necessaries of that process were at Bognor Lord he remarked and whistled silently for a space Rummy go profit and loss profit one sister with bicycle complete wot offers cheap for tooth and air brush vests night shirt stockings and sundries Make the best of it and presently when it came to hair brushing he had to smooth his troubled locks with his hands It was a poor result Sneak out and get a shave I suppose and buy a brush and so on Chink again Beard don t show much He ran his hand over his chin looked at himself steadfastly for some time and curled his insufficient moustache up with some care Then he fell a meditating on his beauty He considered himself three quarter face left and right An expression of distaste crept over his features Looking won t alter it Hoopdriver he remarked You re a weedy customer my man Shoulders narrow Skimpy anyhow He put his knuckles on the toilet table and regarded himself with his chin lifted in the air Good Lord he said WHAT a neck Wonder why I got such a thundering lump there He sat down on the bed his eye still on the glass If I d been exercised properly if I d been fed reasonable if I hadn t been shoved out of a silly school into a silly shop But there the old folks didn t know no better The schoolmaster ought to have But he didn t poor old fool Still when it comes to meeting a girl like this It s ARD I wonder what Adam d think of me as a specimen Civilisation eigh Heir of the ages I m nothing I know nothing I can t do anything sketch a bit Why wasn t I made an artist Beastly cheap after all this suit does look in the sunshine No good Hoopdriver Anyhow you don t tell yourself any lies about it Lovers ain t your game anyway But there s other things yet You can help the young lady and you will I suppose she ll be going home And that business of the bicycle s to see to too my man FORWARD Hoopdriver If you ain t a beauty that s no reason why you should stop and be copped is it And having got back in this way to a gloomy kind of self satisfaction he had another attempt at his hair preparatory to leaving his room and hurrying on breakfast for an early departure While breakfast was preparing he wandered out into South Street and refurnished himself with the elements of luggage again No expense to be spared he murmured disgorging the half sovereign XXVIII THE DEPARTURE FROM CHICHESTER He caused his sister to be called repeatedly and when she came down explained with a humorous smile his legal relationship to the bicycle in the yard Might be disagreeable y know His anxiety was obvious enough Very well she said quite friendly hurry breakfast and we ll ride out I want to talk things over with you The girl seemed more beautiful than ever after the night s sleep her hair in comely dark waves from her forehead her ungauntleted finger tips pink and cool And how decided she was Breakfast was a nervous ceremony conversation fraternal but thin the waiter overawed him and he was cowed by a multiplicity of forks But she called him Chris They discussed their route over his sixpenny county map for the sake of talking but avoided a decision in the presence of the attendant The five pound note was changed for the bill and through Hoopdriver s determination to be quite the gentleman the waiter and chambermaid got half a crown each and the ostler a florin Olidays said the ostler to himself without gratitude The public mounting of the bicycles in the street was a moment of trepidation A policeman actually stopped and watched them from the opposite kerb Suppose him to come across and ask Is that your bicycle sir Fight Or drop it and run It was a time of bewildering apprehension too going through the streets of the town so that a milk cart barely escaped destruction under mister Hoopdriver s chancy wheel That recalled him to a sense of erratic steering and he pulled himself together In the lanes he breathed freer and a less formal conversation presently began You ve ridden out of Chichester in a great hurry said Jessie Well the fact of it is I m worried just a little bit About this machine Of course she said I had forgotten that But where are we going Jest a turning or two more if you don t mind said Hoopdriver Jest a mile or so I have to think of you you know I should feel more easy If we was locked up you know Not that I should mind on my own account They rode with a streaky grey sea coming and going on their left hand Every mile they put between themselves and Chichester mister Hoopdriver felt a little less conscience stricken and a little more of the gallant desperado Here he was riding on a splendid machine with a Slap up girl beside him What would they think of it in the Emporium if any of them were to see him He imagined in detail the astonishment of Miss Isaacs and of Miss Howe Why It s mister Hoopdriver Miss Isaacs would say Never emphatically from Miss Howe Then he played with Briggs and then tried the G V in a shay Fancy introducing em to her My sister pro tem He was her brother Chris Chris what Confound it Harringon Hartington something like that Have to keep off that topic until he could remember Wish he d told her the truth now almost He glanced at her She was riding with her eyes straight ahead of her Thinking A little perplexed perhaps she seemed He noticed how well she rode and that she rode with her lips closed a thing he could never manage mister Hoopdriver s mind came round to the future What was she going to do What were they both going to do His thoughts took a graver colour He had rescued her This was fine manly rescue work he was engaged upon She ought to go home in spite of that stepmother He must insist gravely but firmly upon that She was the spirited sort of course but still Wonder if she had any money Wonder what the second class fare from Havant to London is Of course he would have to pay that it was the regular thing he being a gentleman Then should he take her home He began to rough in a moving sketch of the return The stepmother repentant of her indescribable cruelties would be present even these rich people have their troubles probably an uncle or two The footman would announce mister bother that name and Miss Milton Then two women weeping together and a knightly figure in the background dressed in a handsome Norfolk jacket still conspicuously new He would conceal his feeling until the very end Then leaving he would pause in the doorway in such an attitude as mister George Alexander might assume and say slowly and dwindlingly Be kind to her BE kind to her and so depart heartbroken to the meanest intelligence But that was a matter for the future He would have to begin discussing the return soon There was no traffic along the road and he came up beside her he had fallen behind in his musing She began to talk mister Denison she began and then doubtfully That is your name I m very stupid It is said mister Hoopdriver Denison was it Denison Denison Denison What was she saying I wonder how far you are willing to help me Confoundedly hard to answer a question like that on the spur of the moment without steering wildly You may rely said mister Hoopdriver recovering from a violent wabble I can assure you I want to help you very much Don t consider me at all Leastways consider me entirely at your service Nuisance not to be able to say this kind of thing right You see I am so awkwardly situated If I can only help you you will make me very happy There was a pause Round a bend in the road they came upon a grassy space between hedge and road set with yarrow and meadowsweet where a felled tree lay among the green There she dismounted and propping her machine against a stone sat down Here we can talk she said Yes said mister Hoopdriver expectant She answered after a little while sitting elbow on knee with her chin in her hand and looking straight in front of her I don t know I am resolved to Live my Own Life Of course said mister Hoopdriver Naturally I want to Live and I want to see what life means I want to learn Everyone is hurrying me everything is hurrying me I want time to think mister Hoopdriver was puzzled but admiring It was wonderful how clear and ready her words were But then one might speak well with a throat and lips like that He knew he was inadequate but he tried to meet the occasion If you let them rush you into anything you might repent of of course you d be very silly Don t YOU want to learn she asked I was wondering only this morning he began and stopped She was too intent upon her own thoughts to notice this insufficiency I find myself in life and it terrifies me I seem to be like a little speck whirling on a wheel suddenly caught up What am I here for I ask Simply to be here at a time I asked it a week ago I asked it yesterday and I ask it to day And little things happen and the days pass My stepmother takes me shopping people come to tea there is a new play to pass the time or a concert or a novel The wheels of the world go on turning turning It is horrible I want to do a miracle like Joshua and stop the whirl until I have fought it out At home It s impossible mister Hoopdriver stroked his moustache It IS so he said in a meditative tone Things WILL go on he said The faint breath of summer stirred the trees and a bunch of dandelion puff lifted among the meadowsweet and struck and broke into a dozen separate threads against his knee They flew on apart and sank as the breeze fell among the grass some to germinate some to perish His eye followed them until they had vanished I can t go back to Surbiton said the Young Lady in Grey EIGH said mister Hoopdriver catching at his moustache This was an unexpected development I want to write you see said the Young Lady in Grey to write Books and alter things To do Good I want to lead a Free Life and Own myself I can t go back I want to obtain a position as a journalist I have been told But I know no one to help me at once No one that I could go to There is one person She was a mistress at my school If I could write to her But then how could I get her answer H mp said mister Hoopdriver very grave I can t trouble you much more You have come you have risked things That don t count said mister Hoopdriver It s double pay to let me do it so to speak It is good of you to say that Surbiton is so Conventional I am resolved to be Unconventional at any cost But we are so hampered If I could only burgeon out of all that hinders me I want to struggle to take my place in the world I want to be my own mistress to shape my own career But my stepmother objects so She does as she likes herself and is strict with me to ease her conscience And if I go back now go back owning myself beaten She left the rest to his imagination I see that agreed mister Hoopdriver He MUST help her Within his skull he was doing some intricate arithmetic with five pounds six and twopence In some vague way he inferred from all this that Jessie was trying to escape from an undesirable marriage but was saying these things out of modesty His circle of ideas was so limited You know mister I ve forgotten your name again mister Hoopdriver seemed lost in abstraction You can t go back of course quite like that he said thoughtfully His ears waxed suddenly red and his cheeks flushed But what IS your name Name said mister Hoopdriver Why Benson of course mister Benson yes it s really very stupid of me But I can never remember names I must make a note on my cuff She clicked a little silver pencil and wrote the name down If I could write to my friend I believe she would be able to help me to an independent life I could write to her or telegraph Write I think I could scarcely explain in a telegram I know she would help me Clearly there was only one course open to a gentleman under the circumstances In that case said mister Hoopdriver if you don t mind trusting yourself to a stranger we might continue as we are perhaps For a day or so Until you heard Suppose thirty shillings a day that gives four days say four thirties is hun and twenty six quid well three days say four ten You are very good to me His expression was eloquent Very well then and thank you It s wonderful it s more than I deserve that you She dropped the theme abruptly What was our bill at Chichester Eigh said mister Hoopdriver feigning a certain stupidity There was a brief discussion Secretly he was delighted at her insistence in paying She carried her point Their talk came round to their immediate plans for the day They decided to ride easily through Havant and stop perhaps at Fareham or Southampton For the previous day had tried them both Holding the map extended on his knee mister Hoopdriver s eye fell by chance on the bicycle at his feet That bicycle he remarked quite irrelevantly wouldn t look the same machine if I got a big double Elarum instead of that little bell Why Jest a thought A pause Very well then Havant and lunch said Jessie rising I wish somehow we could have managed it without stealing that machine said Hoopdriver Because it IS stealing it you know come to think of it Nonsense If mister Bechamel troubles you I will tell the whole world if need be I believe you would said mister Hoopdriver admiring her You re plucky enough goodness knows Discovering suddenly that she was standing he too rose and picked up her machine She took it and wheeled it into the road Then he took his own He paused regarding it I say said he How d this bike look now if it was enamelled grey She looked over her shoulder at his grave face Why try and hide it in that way It was jest a passing thought said mister Hoopdriver airily Didn t MEAN anything you know As they were riding on to Havant it occurred to mister Hoopdriver in a transitory manner that the interview had been quite other than his expectation But that was the way with everything in mister Hoopdriver s experience And though his Wisdom looked grave within him and Caution was chinking coins and an ancient prejudice in favour of Property shook her head something else was there too shouting in his mind to drown all these saner considerations the intoxicating thought of riding beside Her all to day all to morrow perhaps for other days after that Of talking to her familiarly being brother of all her slender strength and freshness of having a golden real and wonderful time beyond all his imaginings His old familiar fancyings gave place to anticipations as impalpable and fluctuating and beautiful as the sunset of a summer day At Havant he took an opportunity to purchase at small hairdresser s in the main street a toothbrush a pair of nail scissors and a little bottle of stuff to darken the moustache an article the shopman introduced to his attention recommended highly and sold in the excitement of the occasion XXIX THE UNEXPECTED ANECDOTE OF THE LION They rode on to Cosham and lunched lightly but expensively there Jessie went out and posted her letter to her school friend Then the green height of Portsdown Hill tempted them and leaving their machines in the village they clambered up the slope to the silent red brick fort that crowned it Thence they had a view of Portsmouth and its cluster of sister towns the crowded narrows of the harbour the Solent and the Isle of Wight like a blue cloud through the hot haze Jessie by some miracle had become a skirted woman in the Cosham inn mister Hoopdriver lounged gracefully on the turf smoked a Red Herring cigarette and lazily regarded the fortified towns that spread like a map away there the inner line of defence like toy fortifications a mile off perhaps and beyond that a few little fields and then the beginnings of Landport suburb and the smoky cluster of the multitudinous houses To the right at the head of the harbour shallows the town of Porchester rose among the trees mister Hoopdriver s anxiety receded to some remote corner of his brain and that florid half voluntary imagination of his shared the stage with the image of Jessie He began to speculate on the impression he was creating He took stock of his suit in a more optimistic spirit and reviewed with some complacency his actions for the last four and twenty hours Then he was dashed at the thought of her infinite perfections She had been observing him quietly rather more closely during the last hour or so She did not look at him directly because he seemed always looking at her Her own troubles had quieted down a little and her curiosity about the chivalrous worshipping but singular gentleman in brown was awakening She had recalled too the curious incident of their first encounter She found him hard to explain to herself You must understand that her knowledge of the world was rather less than nothing having been obtained entirely from books You must not take a certain ignorance for foolishness She had begun with a few experiments He did not know French except sivver play a phrase he seemed to regard as a very good light table joke in itself His English was uncertain but not such as books informed her distinguished the lower classes His manners seemed to her good on the whole but a trifle over respectful and out of fashion He called her I Madam once He seemed a person of means and leisure but he knew nothing of recent concerts theatres or books How did he spend his time He was certainly chivalrous and a trifle simpleminded She fancied so much is there in a change of costume that she had never met with such a man before What COULD he be mister Benson she said breaking a silence devoted to landscape He rolled over and regarded her chin on knuckles At your service Do you paint Are you an artist Well Judicious pause I should hardly call myself a Nartist you know I DO paint a little And sketch you know skitty kind of things He plucked and began to nibble a blade of grass It was really not so much lying as his quick imagination that prompted him to add In Papers you know and all that I see said Jessie looking at him thoughtfully Artists were a very heterogeneous class certainly and geniuses had a trick of being a little odd He avoided her eye and bit his grass I don t do MUCH you know It s not your profession Oh no said Hoopdriver anxious now to hedge I don t make a regular thing of it you know Jest now and then something comes into my head and down it goes No I m not a regular artist Then you don t practise any regular profession mister Hoopdriver looked into her eyes and saw their quiet unsuspicious regard He had vague ideas of resuming the detective role It s like this he said to gain time I have a sort of profession Only there s a kind of reason nothing much you know I beg your pardon for cross examining you No trouble said mister Hoopdriver Only I can t very well I leave it to you you know I don t want to make any mystery of it so far as that goes Should he plunge boldly and be a barrister That anyhow was something pretty good But she might know about barristry I think I could guess what you are Well guess said mister Hoopdriver You come from one of the colonies Dear me said mister Hoopdriver veering round to the new wind How did you find out THAT the man was born in a London suburb dear Reader I guessed she said He lifted his eyebrows as one astonished and clutched a new piece of grass You were educated up country Good again said Hoopdriver rolling over again into her elbow You re a CLAIRVOY ant He bit at the grass smiling Which colony was it That I don t know You must guess said Hoopdriver South Africa she said I strongly incline to South Africa South Africa s quite a large place he said But South Africa is right You re warm said Hoopdriver anyhow and the while his imagination was eagerly exploring this new province South Africa IS right she insisted He turned over again and nodded smiling reassuringly into her eyes What made me think of South Africa was that novel of Olive Schreiner s you know The Story of an African Farm Gregory Rose is so like you I never read The Story of an African Farm said Hoopdriver I must What s he like You must read the book But it s a wonderful place with its mixture of races and its brand new civilisation jostling the old savagery Were you near Khama He was a long way off from our place said mister Hoopdriver We had a little ostrich farm you know Just a few hundred of em out Johannesburg way On the Karroo was it called That s the term Some of it was freehold though Luckily We got along very well in the old days But there s no ostriches on that farm now He had a diamond mine in his head just at the moment but he stopped and left a little to the girl s imagination Besides which it had occurred to him with a kind of shock that he was lying What became of the ostriches We sold em off when we parted with the farm Do you mind if I have another cigarette That was when I was quite a little chap you know that we had this ostrich farm Did you have Blacks and Boers about you Lots said mister Hoopdriver striking a match on his instep and beginning to feel hot at the new responsibility he had brought upon himself How interesting Do you know I ve never been out of England except to Paris and Mentone and Switzerland One gets tired of travelling puff after a bit of course You must tell me about your farm in South Africa It always stimulates my imagination to think of these places I can fancy all the tall ostriches being driven out by a black herd to graze I suppose How do ostriches feed Well said Hoopdriver That s rather various They have their fancies you know There s fruit of course and that kind of thing And chicken food and so forth You have to use judgment Did you ever see a lion They weren t very common in our district said Hoopdriver quite modestly But I ve seen them of course Once or twice Fancy seeing a lion Weren t you frightened mister Hoopdriver was now thoroughly sorry he had accepted that offer of South Africa He puffed his cigarette and regarded the Solent languidly as he settled the fate on that lion in his mind I scarcely had time he said It all happened in a minute Go on she said I was going across the inner paddock where the fatted ostriches were Did you EAT ostriches then I did not know Eat them often Very nice they ARE too properly stuffed Well we I rather was going across this paddock and I saw something standing up in the moonlight and looking at me mister Hoopdriver was in a hot perspiration now His invention seemed to have gone limp Luckily I had my father s gun with me I was scared though I can tell you Puff I just aimed at the end that I thought was the head And let fly Puff And over it went you know Dead AS dead It was one of the luckiest shots I ever fired And I wasn t much over nine at the time neither I should have screamed and run away There s some things you can t run away from said mister Hoopdriver To run would have been Death I don t think I ever met a lion killer before she remarked evidently with a heightened opinion of him There was a pause She seemed meditating further questions mister Hoopdriver drew his watch hastily I say said mister Hoopdriver showing it to her don t you think we ought to be getting on His face was flushed his ears bright red She ascribed his confusion to modesty He rose with a lion added to the burthens of his conscience and held out his hand to assist her They walked down into Cosham again resumed their machines and went on at a leisurely pace along the northern shore of the big harbour But mister Hoopdriver was no longer happy This horrible this fulsome lie stuck in his memory Why HAD he done it She did not ask for any more South African stories happily at least until Porchester was reached but talked instead of Living One s Own Life and how custom hung on people like chains She talked wonderfully and set Hoopdriver s mind fermenting By the Castle mister Hoopdriver caught several crabs in little shore pools At Fareham they stopped for a second tea and left the place towards the hour of sunset under such invigorating circumstances as you shall in due course hear XXX THE RESCUE EXPEDITION And now to tell of those energetic chevaliers Widgery Dangle and Phipps and of that distressed beauty Thomas Plantagenet well known in society so the paragraphs said as missus Milton We left them at Midhurst station if I remember rightly waiting in a state of fine emotion for the Chichester train It was clearly understood by the entire Rescue Party that missus Milton was bearing up bravely against almost overwhelming grief The three gentlemen outdid one another in sympathetic expedients they watched her gravely almost tenderly The substantial Widgery tugged at his moustache and looked his unspeakable feelings at her with those dog like brown eyes of his the slender Dangle tugged at HIS moustache and did what he could with unsympathetic grey ones Phipps unhappily had no moustache to run any risks with so he folded his arms and talked in a brave indifferent bearing up tone about the London Brighton and South Coast Railway just to cheer the poor woman up a little And even missus Milton really felt that exalted melancholy to the very bottom of her heart and tried to show it in a dozen little delicate feminine ways There is nothing to do until we get to Chichester said Dangle Nothing Nothing said Widgery and aside in her ear You really ate scarcely anything you know Their trains are always late said Phipps with his fingers along the edge of his collar Dangle you must understand was a sub editor and reviewer and his pride was to be Thomas Plantagenet s intellectual companion Widgery the big man was manager of a bank and a mighty golfer and his conception of his relations to her never came into his mind without those charming oldlines Douglas Douglas tender and true falling hard upon its heels His name was Douglas Douglas Widgery And Phipps Phipps was a medical student still and he felt that he laid his heart at her feet the heart of a man of the world She was kind to them all in her way and insisted on their being friends together in spite of a disposition to reciprocal criticism they displayed Dangle thought Widgery a Philistine appreciating but coarsely the merits of A Soul Untrammelled and Widgery thought Dangle lacked humanity would talk insincerely to say a clever thing Both Dangle and Widgery thought Phipps a bit of a cub and Phipps thought both Dangle and Widgery a couple of Thundering Bounders They would have got to Chichester in time for lunch said Dangle in the train After perhaps And there s no sufficient place in the road So soon as we get there Phipps must inquire at the chief hotels to see if any one answering to her description has lunched there Oh I LL inquire said Phipps Willingly I suppose you and Widgery will just hang about He saw an expression of pain on missus Milton s gentle face and stopped abruptly No said Dangle we shan t HANG ABOUT as you put it There are two places in Chichester where tourists might go the cathedral and a remarkably fine museum I shall go to the cathedral and make an inquiry or so while Widgery The museum Very well And after that there s a little thing or two I ve thought of myself said Widgery To begin with they took missus Milton in a kind of procession to the Red Hotel and established her there with some tea You are so kind to me she said All of you They signified that it was nothing and dispersed to their inquiries By six they returned their zeal a little damped without news Widgery came back with Dangle Phipps was the last to return You re quite sure said Widgery that there isn t any flaw in that inference of yours Quite said Dangle rather shortly Of course said Widgery their starting from Midhurst on the Chichester road doesn t absolutely bind them not to change their minds My dear fellow It does Really it does You must allow me to have enough intelligence to think of cross roads Really you must There aren t any cross roads to tempt them Would they turn aside here No Would they turn there Many more things are inevitable than you fancy We shall see at once said Widgery at the window Here comes Phipps For my own part Phipps said missus Milton Is he hurrying Does he look She rose in her eagerness biting her trembling lip and went towards the window No news said Phipps entering Ah said Widgery None said Dangle Well said Phipps One fellow had got hold of a queer story of a man in bicycling clothes who was asking the same question about this time yesterday What question said missus Milton in the shadow of the window She spoke in a low voice almost a whisper Why Have you seen a young lady in a grey bicycling costume Dangle caught at his lower lip What s that he said Yesterday A man asking after her then What can THAT mean Heaven knows said Phipps sitting down wearily You d better infer What kind of man said Dangle How should I know in bicycling costume the fellow said But what height What complexion Didn t ask said Phipps DIDN T ASK Nonsense said Dangle Ask him yourself said Phipps He s an ostler chap in the White Hart short thick set fellow with a red face and a crusty manner Leaning up against the stable door Smells of whiskey Go and ask him Of course said Dangle taking his straw hat from the shade over the stuffed bird on the chiffonier and turning towards the door I might have known Phipps mouth opened and shut You re tired I m sure mister Phipps said the lady soothingly Let me ring for some tea for you It suddenly occurred to Phipps that he had lapsed a little from his chivalry I was a little annoyed at the way he rushed me to do all this business he said But I d do a hundred times as much if it would bring you any nearer to her Pause I WOULD like a little tea I don t want to raise any false hopes said Widgery But I do NOT believe they even came to Chichester Dangle s a very clever fellow of course but sometimes these Inferences of his Tchak said Phipps suddenly What is it said missus Milton Something I ve forgotten I went right out from here went to every other hotel in the place and never thought But never mind I ll ask when the waiter comes You don t mean A tap and the door opened Tea m m yes m m said the waiter One minute said Phipps Was a lady in grey a cycling lady Stopped here yesterday Yessir Stopped the night With her brother sir a young gent Brother said missus Milton in a low tone Thank God The waiter glanced at her and understood everything A young gent sir he said very free with his money Give the name of Beaumont He proceeded to some rambling particulars and was cross examined by Widgery on the plans of the young couple Havant Where s Havant said Phipps I seem to remember it somewhere Was the man tall said missus Milton intently distinguished looking with a long flaxen moustache and spoke with a drawl Well said the waiter and thought His moustache m m was scarcely long scrubby more and young looking About thirty five he was No m m More like five and twenty Not that Dear me said missus Milton speaking in a curious hollow voice fumbling for her salts and showing the finest self control It must have been her YOUNGER brother must have been That will do thank you said Widgery officiously feeling that she would be easier under this new surprise if the man were dismissed The waiter turned to go and almost collided with Dangle who was entering the room panting excitedly and with a pocket handkerchief held to his right eye Hullo said dangle What s up What s up with YOU said Phipps Nothing an altercation merely with that drunken ostler of yours He thought it was a plot to annoy him that the Young Lady in Grey was mythical Judged from your manner I ve got a piece of raw meat to keep over it You have some news I see Did the man hit you asked Widgery missus Milton rose and approached Dangle Cannot I do anything Dangle was heroic Only tell me your news he said round the corner of the handkerchief It was in this way said Phipps and explained rather sheepishly While he was doing so with a running fire of commentary from Widgery the waiter brought in a tray of tea A time table said Dangle promptly for Havant missus Milton poured two cups and Phipps and Dangle partook in passover form They caught the train by a hair s breadth So to Havant and inquiries Dangle was puffed up to find that his guess of Havant was right In view of the fact that beyond Havant the Southampton road has a steep hill continuously on the right hand side and the sea on the left he hit upon a magnificent scheme for heading the young folks off He and missus Milton would go to Fareham Widgery and Phipps should alight one each at the intermediate stations of Cosham and Porchester and come on by the next train if they had no news If they did not come on a wire to the Fareham post office was to explain why It was Napoleonic and more than consoled Dangle for the open derision of the Havant street boys at the handkerchief which still protected his damaged eye Moreover the scheme answered to perfection The fugitives escaped by a hair s breadth They were outside the Golden Anchor at Fareham and preparing to mount as missus Milton and Dangle came round the corner from the station It s her said missus Milton and would have screamed Hist said Dangle gripping the lady s arm removing his handkerchief in his excitement and leaving the piece of meat over his eye an extraordinary appearance which seemed unexpectedly to calm her Be cool said Dangle glaring under the meat They must not see us They will get away else Were there flys at the station The young couple mounted and vanished round the corner of the Winchester road Had it not been for the publicity of the business missus Milton would have fainted SAVE HER she said Ah A conveyance said Dangle One minute He left her in a most pathetic attitude with her hand pressed to her heart and rushed into the Golden Anchor Dog cart in ten minutes Emerged The meat had gone now and one saw the cooling puffiness over his eye I will conduct you back to the station said Dangle hurry back here and pursue them You will meet Widgery and Phipps and tell them I am in pursuit She was whirled back to the railway station and left there on a hard blistered wooden seat in the sun She felt tired and dreadfully ruffled and agitated and dusty Dangle was no doubt most energetic and devoted but for a kindly helpful manner commend her to Douglas Widgery Meanwhile Dangle his face golden in the evening sun was driving as well as he could a large black horse harnessed into a thing called a gig northwestward towards Winchester Dangle barring his swollen eye was a refined looking little man and he wore a deerstalker cap and was dressed in dark grey His neck was long and slender Perhaps you know what gigs are huge big wooden things and very high and the horse too was huge and big and high with knobby legs a long face a hard mouth and a whacking trick of pacing Smack smack smack smack it went along the road and hard by the church it shied vigorously at a hooded perambulator The history of the Rescue Expedition now becomes confused It appears that Widgery was extremely indignant to find missus Milton left about upon the Fareham platform The day had irritated him somehow though he had started with the noblest intentions and he seemed glad to find an outlet for justifiable indignation He s such a spasmodic creature said Widgery Rushing off And I suppose we re to wait here until he comes back It s likely He s so egotistical is Dangle Always wants to mismanage everything himself He means to help me said missus Milton a little reproachfully touching his arm Widgery was hardly in the mood to be mollified all at once He need not prevent ME he said and stopped It s no good talking you know and you are tired I can go on she said brightly if only we find her While I was cooling my heels in Cosham I bought a county map He produced and opened it Here you see is the road out of Fareham He proceeded with the calm deliberation of a business man to develop a proposal of taking train forthwith to Winchester They MUST be going to Winchester he explained It was inevitable To morrow Sunday Winchester a cathedral town road going nowhere else of the slightest importance But mister Dangle He will simply go on until he has to pass something and then he will break his neck I have seen Dangle drive before It s scarcely likely a dog cart especially a hired dog cart will overtake bicycles in the cool of the evening Rely upon me missus Milton I am in your hands she said with pathetic littleness looking up at him and for the moment he forgot the exasperation of the day Phipps during this conversation had stood in a somewhat depressed attitude leaning on his stick feeling his collar and looking from one speaker to the other The idea of leaving Dangle behind seemed to him an excellent one We might leave a message at the place where he got the dog cart he suggested when he saw their eyes meeting There was a cheerful alacrity about all three at the proposal But they never got beyond Botley For even as their train ran into the station a mighty rumbling was heard there was a shouting overhead the guard stood astonished on the platform and Phipps thrusting his head out of the window cried There he goes and sprang out of the carriage missus Milton following in alarm just saw it From Widgery it was hidden Botley station lies in a cutting overhead was the roadway and across the lemon yellows and flushed pinks of the sunset there whirled a great black mass a horse like a long nosed chess knight the upper works of a gig and Dangle in transit from front to back A monstrous shadow aped him across the cutting It was the event of a second Dangle seemed to jump hang in the air momentarily and vanish and after a moment s pause came a heart rending smash Then two black heads running swiftly Better get out said Phipps to missus Milton who stood fascinated in the doorway In another moment all three were hurrying up the steps They found Dangle hatless standing up with cut hands extended having his hands brushed by an officious small boy A broad ugly road ran downhill in a long vista and in the distance was a little group of Botley inhabitants holding the big black horse Even at that distance they could see the expression of conscious pride on the monster s visage It was as wooden faced a horse as you can imagine The beasts in the Tower of London on which the men in armour are perched are the only horses I have ever seen at all like it However we are not concerned now with the horse but with Dangle Hurt asked Phipps eagerly leading mister Dangle cried missus Milton clasping her hands Hullo said Dangle not surprised in the slightest Glad you ve come I may want you Bit of a mess I m in eigh But I ve caught em At the very place I expected too Caught them said Widgery Where are they Up there he said with a backward motion of his head About a mile up the hill I left em I HAD to I don t understand said missus Milton with that rapt painful look again Have you found Jessie I have I wish I could wash the gravel out of my hands somewhere It was like this you know Came on them suddenly round a corner Horse shied at the bicycles They were sitting by the roadside botanising flowers I just had time to shout Jessie Milton we ve been looking for you and then that confounded brute bolted I didn t dare turn round I had all my work to do to save myself being turned over as it was so long as I did I mean I just shouted Return to your friends All will be forgiven And off I came clatter clatter Whether they heard TAKE ME TO HER said missus Milton with intensity turning towards Widgery Certainly said Widgery suddenly becoming active How far is it Dangle Mile and a half or two miles I was determined to find them you know I say though Look at my hands But I beg your pardon missus Milton He turned to Phipps Phipps I say where shall I wash the gravel out And have a look at my knee There s the station said Phipps becoming helpful Dangle made a step and a damaged knee became evident Take my arm said Phipps Where can we get a conveyance asked Widgery of two small boys The two small boys failed to understand They looked at one another There s not a cab not a go cart in sight said Widgery It s a case of a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse There s a harse all right said one of the small boys with a movement of the head Don t you know where we can hire traps asked Widgery Or a cart or anything asked missus Milton John Ooker s gart a cart but no one can t ire n said the larger of the small boys partially averting his face and staring down the road and making a song of it And so s my feyther for s leg us broke Not a cart even Evidently What shall we do It occurred to missus Milton that if Widgery was the man for courtly devotion Dangle was infinitely readier of resource I suppose she said timidly Perhaps if you were to ask mister Dangle And then all the gilt came off Widgery He answered quite rudely Confound Dangle Hasn t he messed us up enough He must needs drive after them in a trap to tell them we re coming and now you want me to ask him Her beautiful blue eyes were filled with tears He stopped abruptly I ll go and ask Dangle he said shortly If you wish it And went striding into the station and down the steps leaving her in the road under the quiet inspection of the two little boys and with a kind of ballad refrain running through her head Where are the Knights of the Olden Time and feeling tired to death and hungry and dusty and out of curl and in short a martyr woman XXXI It goes to my heart to tell of the end of that day how the fugitives vanished into Immensity how there were no more trains how Botley stared unsympathetically with a palpable disposition to derision denying conveyances how the landlord of the Heron was suspicious how the next day was Sunday and the hot summer s day had crumpled the collar of Phipps and stained the skirts of missus Milton and dimmed the radiant emotions of the whole party Dangle with sticking plaster and a black eye felt the absurdity of the pose of the Wounded Knight and abandoned it after the faintest efforts Recriminations never perhaps held the foreground of the talk but they played like summer lightning on the edge of the conversation And deep in the hearts of all was a galling sense of the ridiculous Jessie they thought was most to blame Apparently too the worst which would have made the whole business tragic was not happening Here was a young woman young woman do I say a mere girl had chosen to leave a comfortable home in Surbiton and all the delights of a refined and intellectual circle and had rushed off trailing us after her posing hard mutually jealous and now tired and weather worn to flick us off at last mere mud from her wheel into this detestable village beer house on a Saturday night And she had done it not for Love and Passion which are serious excuses one may recognise even if one must reprobate but just for a Freak just for a fantastic Idea for nothing in fact but the outraging of Common Sense Yet withal such was our restraint that we talked of her still as one much misguided as one who burthened us with anxiety as a lamb astray and missus Milton having eaten continued to show the finest feelings on the matter She sat I may mention in the cushioned basket chair the only comfortable chair in the room and we sat on incredibly hard horsehair things having antimacassars tied to their backs by means of lemon coloured bows It was different from those dear old talks at Surbiton somehow She sat facing the window which was open the night was so tranquil and warm and the dim light for we did not use the lamp suited her admirably She talked in a voice that told you she was tired and she seemed inclined to state a case against herself in the matter of A Soul Untrammelled It was such an evening as might live in a sympathetic memoir but it was a little dull while it lasted I feel she said that I am to blame I have Developed That first book of mine I do not go back upon a word of it mind but it has been misunderstood misapplied It has said Widgery trying to look so deeply sympathetic as to be visible in the dark Deliberately misunderstood Don t say that said the lady Not deliberately I try and think that critics are honest After their lights I was not thinking of critics But she I mean She paused an interrogation It is possible said Dangle scrutinising his sticking plaster I write a book and state a case I want people to THINK as I recommend not to DO as I recommend It is just Teaching Only I make it into a story I want to Teach new Ideas new Lessons to promulgate Ideas Then when the Ideas have been spread abroad Things will come about Only now it is madness to fly in the face of the established order Bernard Shaw you know has explained that with regard to Socialism We all know that to earn all you consume is right and that living on invested capital is wrong Only we cannot begin while we are so few It is Those Others Precisely said Widgery It is Those Others They must begin first And meanwhile you go on banking If I didn t some one else would And I live on mister Milton s Lotion while I try to gain a footing in Literature TRY said Phipps You HAVE done so And That s different said Dangle at the same time You are so kind to me But in this matter Of course Georgina Griffiths in my book lived alone in a flat in Paris and went to life classes and had men visitors but then she was over twenty one Jessica is only seventeen and girlish for that said Dangle It alters everything That child It is different with a woman And Georgina Griffiths never flaunted her freedom on a bicycle in country places In this country Where every one is so particular Fancy SLEEPING away from home It s dreadful If it gets about it spells ruin for her Ruin said Widgery No man would marry a girl like that said Phipps It must be hushed up said Dangle It always seems to me that life is made up of individuals of individual cases We must weigh each person against his or her circumstances General rules don t apply I often feel the force of that said Widgery Those are my rules Of course my books It s different altogether different said Dangle A novel deals with typical cases And life is not typical said Widgery with immense profundity Then suddenly unintentionally being himself most surprised and shocked of any in the room Phipps yawned The failing was infectious and the gathering having as you can easily understand talked itself weary dispersed on trivial pretences But not to sleep immediately Directly Dangle was alone he began with infinite disgust to scrutinise his darkling eye for he was a neat minded little man in spite of his energy The whole business so near a capture was horribly vexatious Phipps sat on his bed for some time examining with equal disgust a collar he would have thought incredible for Sunday twenty four hours before missus Milton fell a musing on the mortality of even big fat men with dog like eyes and Widgery was unhappy because he had been so cross to her at the station and because so far he did not feel that he had scored over Dangle Also he was angry with Dangle And all four of them being souls living very much upon the appearances of things had a painful mental middle distance of Botley derisive and suspicious and a remoter background of London humorous and Surbiton speculative Were they really after all behaving absurdly XXXII mister HOOPDRIVER KNIGHT ERRANT As mister Dangle bad witnessed the fugitives had been left by him by the side of the road about two miles from Botley Before mister Dangle s appearance mister Hoopdriver had been learning with great interest that mere roadside flowers had names star flowers wind stars saint John s wort willow herb lords and ladies bachelor s buttons most curious names some of them The flowers are all different in South Africa y know 
3033-130750-0000	train-other-500	he was explaining with a happy fluke of his imagination to account for his ignorance Then suddenly heralded by clattering sounds and a gride of wheels
3033-130750-0001	train-other-500	Dangle had flared and thundered across the tranquillity of the summer evening Dangle swaying and gesticulating behind a corybantic black horse had hailed Jessie by her name
none	none	 had backed towards the hedge 
3033-130750-0002	train-other-500	for no ostensible reason and vanished to the accomplishment of the Fate that had been written down for him from the very beginning of things
3033-130750-0003	train-other-500	Jessie and Hoopdriver had scarcely time to stand up and seize their machines before this tumultuous this swift and wonderful passing of Dangle was achieved
3033-130750-0004	train-other-500	He went from side to side of the road worse even than the riding forth of mister Hoopdriver it was and vanished round the corner
none	none	 He knew my name said Jessie 
3033-130750-0005	train-other-500	Yes it was mister Dangle That was our bicycles did that said mister Hoopdriver simultaneously and speaking with a certain complacent concern I hope he won t get hurt
none	none	 That was mister Dangle repeated Jessie and mister Hoopdriver heard this time with a violent start His eyebrows went up spasmodically What someone you know Yes Lord 
3033-130750-0006	train-other-500	He was looking for me said Jessie I could see He began to call to me before the horse shied My stepmother has sent him
none	none	 mister Hoopdriver wished he had returned the bicycle after all 
3033-130750-0007	train-other-500	for his ideas were still a little hazy about Bechamel and missus Milton
none	none	 Honesty IS the best policy often he thought 
3033-130750-0008	train-other-500	He turned his head this way and that He became active
none	none	 After us eigh Then he ll come back 
3033-130750-0009	train-other-500	He s gone down that hill and he won t be able to pull up for a bit I m certain
none	none	 Jessie he saw had wheeled her machine into the road 
3033-130750-0010	train-other-500	and was mounting Still staring at the corner that had swallowed up Dangle Hoopdriver followed suit And so just as the sun was setting they began another flight together riding now
3033-130750-0011	train-other-500	towards Bishops Waltham with mister Hoopdriver in the post of danger the rear ever and again looking over his shoulder and swerving dangerously as he did so
3033-130750-0012	train-other-500	Occasionally Jessie had to slacken her pace
none	none	 He breathed heavily and hated himself because his mouth fell open After nearly an hour s hard riding they found themselves uncaught at Winchester Not a trace of Dangle nor any other danger was visible as they rode into the dusky yellow lit street Though the bats had been fluttering behind thehedges and the evening star was bright while they were still two miles from Winchester mister Hoopdriver pointed out the dangers of stopping in such an obvious abiding place and gently but firmly insisted upon replenishing the lamps and riding on towards Salisbury From Winchester roads branch in every direction and to turn abruptly westward was clearly the way to throw off the chase As Hoopdriver saw the moon rising broad and yellow through the twilight he thought he should revive the effect of that ride out of Bognor but somehow albeit the moon and all the atmospheric effects were the same the emotions were different They rode in absolute silence and slowly after they had cleared the outskirts of Winchester Both of them were now nearly tired out the level was tedious and even a little hill a burden and so it came about that in the hamlet of Wallenstock they were beguiled to stop and ask for accommodation in an exceptionally prosperous looking village inn A plausible landlady rose to the occasion Now as they passed into the room where their suppers were prepared mister Hoopdriver caught a glimpse through a door ajar and floating in a reek of smoke of three and a half faces for the edge of the door cut one down and an American cloth covered table with several glasses and a tankard And he also heard a remark In the second before he heard that remark mister Hoopdriver had been a proud and happy man to particularize a baronet s heir incognito He had surrendered their bicycles 
3033-130750-0013	train-other-500	to the odd man of the place with infinite easy dignity and had bowingly opened the door for Jessie Who s that then he imagined people saying and then
none	none	 Some n pretty well orf judge by the bicycles Then the imaginary spectators would fall a talking of the fashionableness of bicycling how judges And stockbrokers and actresses and in fact all the best people rode and how 
3033-130750-0014	train-other-500	that it was often the fancy of such great folk to shun the big hotels the adulation of urban crowds and seek incognito the cosy quaintnesses of village life
none	none	 Then maybe they would think of a certain nameless air of distinction about the lady 
3033-130750-0015	train-other-500	who had stepped across the doorway and about the handsome flaxen moustached blue eyed Cavalier who had followed her in and they would look one to another
3033-130750-0016	train-other-500	Tell you what it is one of the village elders would say just as they do in novels
none	none	 voicing the thought of all in a low impressive tone 
3033-130750-0017	train-other-500	There s such a thin as entertaining barranets unawares not to mention no higher things Such I say had been the filmy delightful stuff
3033-130750-0018	train-other-500	in mister Hoopdriver s head the moment before he heard that remark But the remark toppled him headlong What the precise remark was need not concern us It was
none	none	 a casual piece of such satire as Strephon delights in Should you be curious dear lady as to its nature you have merely to dress yourself in a really modern cycling costume get one of the feeblest looking of your men to escort you and ride out next Saturday evening to any public house 
3033-130750-0019	train-other-500	where healthy homely people gather together
none	none	 Then you will hear quite a lot of the kind of thing mister Hoopdriver heard 
3033-130750-0020	train-other-500	More possibly than you will desire The remark I must add implicated mister Hoopdriver It indicated an entire disbelief in his social standing
3033-130750-0021	train-other-500	At a blow it shattered all the gorgeous imaginative fabric his mind had been rejoicing in All that foolish happiness vanished like a dream And there was nothing to show for it as
none	none	 there is nothing to show for any spiteful remark that has ever been made 
3033-130750-0022	train-other-500	Perhaps the man who said the thing had a gleam of satisfaction at the idea of taking a complacent looking fool down a peg
none	none	 but it is just as possible he did not know at the time 
3033-130750-0023	train-other-500	that his stray shot had hit He had thrown it as a boy throws a stone at a bird And it not only demolished a foolish happy conceit but it wounded It touched Jessie grossly
3033-130750-0024	train-other-500	She did not hear it he concluded from her subsequent bearing but during the supper they had in the little private dining room though she talked cheerfully
3033-130750-0025	train-other-500	he was preoccupied Whiffs of indistinct conversation and now and then laughter
none	none	 came in from the inn parlor through the pelargoniums in the open window Hoopdriver felt it must all be in the same strain at her expense and his He answered her abstractedly She was tired she said and presently went to her room mister Hoopdriver in his courtly way opened the door for her and bowed her out 
3033-130750-0027	train-other-500	He stood listening and fearing some new offence as she went upstairs and round the bend
none	none	 where the barometer hung beneath the stuffed birds Then he went back to the room and stood on the hearthrug before the paper fireplace ornament Cads he said in a scathing undertone as a fresh burst of laughter 
3033-130750-0028	train-other-500	came floating in All through supper he had been composing
none	none	 stinging repartee a blistering speech of denunciation to be presently delivered He would rate them as a nobleman should Call themselves Englishmen indeed and insult a woman he would say take the names and addresses perhaps threaten to speak to the Lord of the Manor promise to let them hear from him again and so out with consternation in his wake It really ought to be done Teach em better he said fiercely and tweaked his moustache painfully What was it He revived the objectionable remark for his own exasperation and then went over the heads of his speech again He coughed made three steps towards the door then stopped and went back to the hearthrug He wouldn t after all Yet was he not a Knight Errant Should such men go unreproved unchecked by wandering baronets incognito Magnanimity Look at it in that way Churls beneath one s notice No merely a cowardly subterfuge He WOULD after all Something within him protested that he was a hot headed ass even as he went towards the door again But he only went on the more resolutely 
3033-130750-0029	train-other-500	He crossed the hall by the bar
none	none	 and entered the room from which the remark had 
3033-130750-0030	train-other-500	proceeded He opened the door abruptly and stood scowling on them in the doorway You ll only make a mess of it remarked the internal sceptic There were five men in the room altogether
3033-130750-0031	train-other-500	a fat person with a long pipe and a great number of chins in an armchair by the fireplace who wished mister Hoopdriver a good evening very affably
3033-130750-0032	train-other-500	a young fellow smoking a cutty and displaying crossed legs with gaiters
none	none	 a little bearded man with a toothless laugh a middle aged comfortable man with bright eyes who wore a velveteen jacket and a fair young man very genteel in a yellowish brown ready made suit and a white tie H m 
3033-130750-0033	train-other-500	said mister Hoopdriver looking very stern and harsh
none	none	 And then in a forbidding tone as one who consented 
3033-130750-0034	train-other-500	to no liberties Good evening
none	none	 Very pleasant day we ve been aving 
3033-130750-0035	train-other-500	said the fair young man with the white tie Very said mister Hoopdriver slowly and taking a brown armchair he planted it with great deliberation where he faced the fireplace and sat down
none	none	 Let s see how did that speech begin 
3033-130750-0036	train-other-500	Very pleasant roads about here said the fair young man with the white tie Very said mister Hoopdriver eyeing him darkly Have to begin somehow
3033-130750-0037	train-other-500	The roads about here are all right
none	none	 and the weather about here is all right but what I ve come in here to say is there s some 
3033-130750-0038	train-other-500	damned unpleasant people damned unpleasant people Oh said the young man with the gaiters apparently making a mental inventory of his pearl buttons as he spoke How s that
3033-130750-0039	train-other-500	mister Hoopdriver put his hands on his knees
none	none	 and stuck out his elbows with extreme angularity In his heart he was raving at his 
3033-130750-0040	train-other-500	idiotic folly at thus bearding these lions indisputably they WERE lions but he had to go through with it now
none	none	 Heaven send his breath which was already getting a trifle spasmodic did not suddenly give out He fixed his eye on the face of the fat man with the chins and spoke in a low impressive voice I came here sir 
3033-130750-0041	train-other-500	said mister Hoopdriver and paused to inflate his cheeks with a lady Very nice lady said the man with the gaiters putting his head on one side to admire a pearl button
none	none	 that had been hiding behind 
3033-130750-0042	train-other-500	the curvature of his calf Very nice lady indeed I came here said mister Hoopdriver with a lady We saw you did bless you said the fat man with the chins
none	none	 in a curious wheezy voice I don t see there s anything so very extraordinary in that One ud think we hadn t eyes 
3033-130750-0043	train-other-500	mister Hoopdriver coughed I came here sir
none	none	 We ve eard that said the little man with the beard 
3033-130750-0044	train-other-500	sharply and went off into an amiable chuckle We know it by art said the little man elaborating the point mister Hoopdriver temporarily lost his thread
none	none	 He glared malignantly at the little man with the beard and tried to recover his discourse A pause 
3033-130750-0045	train-other-500	You were saying said the fair young man with the white tie speaking very politely that you came here with a lady A lady meditated the gaiter gazer
3033-130750-0046	train-other-500	The man in velveteen who was looking from one speaker to another with keen bright eyes now laughed as though a point had been scored and stimulated mister Hoopdriver to speak by fixing him
3033-130750-0047	train-other-500	with an expectant regard Some dirty cad said mister Hoopdriver proceeding with his discourse and suddenly growing extremely fierce made a remark as we went by this door
none	none	 Steady on said the old gentleman with many chins Steady on Don t you go a calling us names please 
3033-130750-0048	train-other-500	One minute said mister Hoopdriver It wasn t I began calling names Who did said the man with the chins I m not calling any of you dirty cads Don t run away with that impression
none	none	 Only some person in this room made a remark 
3033-130750-0049	train-other-500	that showed he wasn t fit to wipe boots on and with all due deference to such gentlemen as ARE gentlemen mister Hoopdriver looked round for moral support I want to know which it was
none	none	 Meanin said the fair young man in the white tie That I m going to wipe my boots on im straight away said mister Hoopdriver reverting to anger if 
3033-130750-0050	train-other-500	with a slight catch in his throat than which threat of personal violence nothing had been further from his thoughts on entering the room He said this because he could think of nothing else to say
3033-130750-0051	train-other-500	and stuck out his elbows truculently to hide the sinking of his heart It is curious how situations run away with us Ullo Charlie
none	none	 said the little man and My eye said the owner of the chins You re going to wipe your boots on im 
3033-130750-0052	train-other-500	said the fair young man in a tone of mild surprise I am said mister Hoopdriver with emphatic resolution and glared in the young man s face
3033-130750-0053	train-other-500	That s fair and reasonable said the man in the velveteen jacket if you can
none	none	 The interest of the meeting seemed transferred to the young man in the white tic Of course if you can t find out which it is I suppose you re prepared to wipe your boots in a liberal way on everybody in the room said this young man in the same tone of impersonal question This gentleman the champion lightweight 
3033-130750-0054	train-other-500	Own up Charlie said the young man with the gaiters
none	none	 looking up for a moment And don t go a dragging in your betters 
3033-130750-0055	train-other-500	It s fair and square You can t get out of it Was it this gent began mister Hoopdriver Of course said the young man in the white tie
none	none	 when it comes to talking of wiping boots 
3033-130750-0056	train-other-500	I m not talking I m going to do it said mister Hoopdriver He looked round at the meeting They were no longer antagonists they were spectators He would have to go through with it now
3033-130750-0057	train-other-500	But this tone of personal aggression on the maker of the remark
none	none	 had somehow got rid of the oppressive feeling of Hoopdriver contra mundum Apparently he would have to fight someone Would he get a black eye Would he get very much hurt Pray goodness it wasn t that sturdy chap in the gaiters Should he rise and begin What would she think if he brought a black eye to breakfast to morrow Is this the man said mister Hoopdriver with a business like calm 
3033-130750-0058	train-other-500	and arms more angular than ever Eat im said the little man with the beard eat im straight orf Steady on said the young man in the white tie
none	none	 Steady on a minute If I did happen to say You did did you said mister Hoopdriver Backing out of it Charlie said the young man with the gaiters Not a bit said Charlie Surely we can pass a bit of a joke I m going to teach you to keep your jokes to yourself said mister Hoopdriver Bray vo said the shepherd of the flock of chins Charlie IS a bit too free with his jokes said the little man with the beard It s downright disgusting said Hoopdriver falling back upon his speech A lady can t ride a bicycle in a country road or wear a dress a little out of the ordinary but every dirty little greaser must needs go shouting insults I didn t know the young lady would hear what I said said Charlie Surely one can speak friendly to one s friends How was I to know the door was open Hoopdriver began to suspect that his antagonist was if possible more seriously alarmed at the prospect of violence than himself and his spirits rose again These chaps ought to have a thorough lesson Of COURSE you knew the door was open he retorted indignantly Of COURSE you thought we should hear what you said Don t go telling lies about it It s no good your saying things like that You ve had your fun and you meant to have your fun And I mean to make an example of you Sir Ginger beer said the little man with the beard in a confidential tone to the velveteen jacket is regular up this ot weather Bustin its bottles it is everywhere What s the good of scrapping about in a public house said Charlie appealing to the company A fair fight without interruptions now I WOULDN T mind if the gentleman s so disposed Evidently the man was horribly afraid mister Hoopdriver grew truculent Where you like said mister Hoopdriver jest wherever you like You insulted the gent said the man in velveteen Don t be a bloomin funk Charlie said the man in gaiters Why you got a stone of him if you got an ounce What I say is this said the gentleman with the excessive chins trying to get a hearing by banging his chair arms If Charlie goes saying things he ought to back em up That s what I say I don t mind his sayin such things t all but he ought to be prepared to back em up I ll BACK em up all right said Charlie with extremely bitter emphasis on back If the gentleman likes to come Toosday week Rot chopped in Hoopdriver Now Ear ear said the owner of the chins Never put off till to morrow Charlie 
3033-130750-0059	train-other-500	what you can do to day said the man in the velveteen coat You got to do it Charlie said the man in gaiters It s no good It s like this said Charlie
3033-130750-0060	train-other-500	appealing to everyone except Hoopdriver Here s me got to take in her ladyship s dinner to morrow night How should I look with a black eye And going round with the carriage
none	none	 with a split lip If you don t want your face sp iled Charlie why don t you keep your mouth shut said the person in gaiters 
3033-130750-0061	train-other-500	Exactly said mister Hoopdriver driving it home with great fierceness Why don t you shut your ugly mouth It s as much as my situation s worth
3033-130750-0062	train-other-500	protested Charlie You should have thought of that before
none	none	 said Hoopdriver There s no occasion to be so thunderin ot about it I only meant the thing joking said Charlie AS one gentleman to another I m very sorry if the gentleman s annoyed Everybody began to speak at once mister Hoopdriver twirled his moustache He felt that Charlie s recognition of his gentlemanliness was at any rate a redeeming feature But it became his pose to ride hard and heavy over the routed foe He shouted some insulting phrase over the tumult You re regular abject the man in gaiters was saying to Charlie More confusion Only don t think I m afraid 
3033-130750-0063	train-other-500	not of a spindle legged cuss like him shouted Charlie Because I ain t Change of front
none	none	 thought Hoopdriver a little startled Where are we going Don t sit there and be abusive said the man in velveteen 
3033-130750-0064	train-other-500	He s offered to hit you and if I was him
none	none	 I d hit you now 
3033-130750-0065	train-other-500	All right then said Charlie with a sudden change of front and springing to his feet If I must I must Now then
3033-130750-0066	train-other-500	At that Hoopdriver the child of Fate rose too with a horrible sense that his internal monitor was right Things had taken a turn He had made a mess of it
none	none	 and now there was nothing for it so far as he could see but to hit the man at once He and Charlie stood six feet apart with a table between both very breathless and fierce A vulgar fight in a public house 
3033-130750-0067	train-other-500	and with what was only too palpably a footman Good Heavens
none	none	 And this was the dignified scornful remonstrance How the juice had it all happened 
3033-130750-0068	train-other-500	Go round the table at him I suppose But before the brawl could achieve itself the man in gaiters intervened Not here he said
none	none	 stepping between the antagonists Everyone was standing up Charlie s artful said the little man with the beard 
3033-130750-0069	train-other-500	Buller s yard said the man with the gaiters taking the control of the entire affair with the easy readiness of an accomplished practitioner If the gentleman DON T mind
3033-130750-0070	train-other-500	Buller s yard it seemed was the very place We ll do the thing regular and decent if you please And before he completely realized what was happening Hoopdriver was being marched out
3033-130750-0071	train-other-500	through the back premises of the inn to the first and only fight with fists that was ever to glorify his life
3033-130750-0072	train-other-500	Outwardly so far as the intermittent moonlight showed
none	none	 mister Hoopdriver was quietly but eagerly prepared to fight But inwardly he was a chaos of conflicting purposes It was extraordinary how things happened One remark had trod so closely on the heels of another that he had had 
3033-130750-0073	train-other-500	the greatest difficulty in following the development of the business He distinctly remembered himself walking across from one room to the other a dignified even an aristocratic figure primed with considered eloquence
none	none	 intent upon a scathing remonstrance to these wretched yokels regarding their manners 
3033-130750-0074	train-other-500	Then incident had flickered into incident until here he was out in a moonlit lane a slight dark figure in a group of larger indistinct figures
3033-130750-0075	train-other-500	marching in a quiet business like way towards some unknown horror at Buller s yard Fists It was astonishing It was terrible In front of him was the pallid
3033-130750-0076	train-other-500	figure of Charles and he saw that the man in gaiters
none	none	 held 
3033-130750-0077	train-other-500	Charles kindly but firmly by the arm It s blasted rot Charles was saying
none	none	 getting up a fight just for a thing like that all very well for im E s got is olidays e asn t no blessed dinner to take up to morrow night like I ave No need to numb my arm IS there They went into Buller s yard through gates There were sheds in Buller s yard sheds of mystery that the moonlight could not solve 
3033-130750-0078	train-other-500	a smell of cows and a pump stood out clear and black throwing a clear black shadow on the whitewashed wall And here it was his face was to be battered to a pulp
3033-130750-0079	train-other-500	He knew this was the uttermost folly to stand up here and be pounded but the way out of it was beyond his imagining
none	none	 Yet afterwards Could he ever face her again He patted his Norfolk jacket and took his 
3033-130750-0080	train-other-500	ground with his back to the gate How did one square So Suppose one were to turn and run even now run straight back to the inn and lock himself into his bedroom
none	none	 They couldn t make 
3033-130750-0081	train-other-500	him come out anyhow He could prosecute them for assault if they did How did one set about prosecuting for assault He saw Charles with his face
3033-130750-0082	train-other-500	ghastly white under the moon squaring in front of him He caught a blow on the arm and gave ground Charles pressed him Then he hit with his right
3033-130750-0083	train-other-500	and with the violence of despair It was a hit of his own devising an impromptu
3033-130750-0084	train-other-500	but it chanced to coincide with the regulation hook hit at the head He perceived with a leap of exultation that the thing his fist had met was the jawbone of Charles
3033-130750-0085	train-other-500	It was the sole gleam of pleasure he experienced during the fight and it was quite momentary He had hardly got home upon Charles before he was struck in the chest and whirled backward
3033-130750-0086	train-other-500	He had the greatest difficulty in keeping his feet He felt that his heart was smashed flat Gord darm said somebody dancing toe in hand somewhere behind him
3033-130750-0087	train-other-500	As mister Hoopdriver staggered Charles gave a loud and fear compelling cry He seemed to tower over Hoopdriver in the moonlight
none	none	 Both his fists were whirling 
3033-130750-0088	train-other-500	It was annihilation coming no less mister Hoopdriver ducked perhaps and certainly gave ground to the right hit and missed Charles swept round to the left missing generously
none	none	 A blow glanced over mister Hoopdriver s left ear 
3033-130750-0089	train-other-500	and the flanking movement was completed Another blow behind the ear Heaven and earth spun furiously round mister Hoopdriver and then he became aware of a figure in a light suit
3033-130750-0090	train-other-500	shooting violently through an open gate into the night The man in gaiters sprang forward past mister Hoopdriver but too late to intercept the fugitive
3033-130750-0091	train-other-500	There were shouts laughter and mister Hoopdriver still solemnly squaring realized the great and wonderful truth Charles had fled He Hoopdriver had fought
none	none	 and by all the rules of war had won 
3033-130750-0092	train-other-500	That was a pretty cut under the jaw you gave him the toothless little man with the beard was remarking in an unexpectedly friendly manner
3033-130750-0093	train-other-500	The fact of it is said mister Hoopdriver sitting beside the road to Salisbury and with the sound of distant church bells in his
none	none	 cars I had to give the fellow a lesson 
3033-130750-0094	train-other-500	simply had to It seems so dreadful that you should have to knock people about said Jessie These louts get unbearable
3033-130750-0095	train-other-500	said mister Hoopdriver If now and then we didn t give them a lesson well
none	none	 a lady cyclist in the roads would be an impossibility I suppose every woman shrinks from violence said Jessie I suppose men ARE braver in a way than women It seems to me I can t imagine how one could bring oneself to face a roomful of rough characters pick out the bravest and give him an exemplary thrashing I quail at the idea I thought only Ouida s guardsmen did things like that It was nothing more than my juty as a gentleman said mister Hoopdriver But to walk straight into the face of danger It s habit said mister Hoopdriver quite modestly flicking off a particle of cigarette ash that had settled on his knee XXXIII THE ABASEMENT OF mister HOOPDRIVER On Monday morning the two fugitives found themselves breakfasting at the Golden Pheasant in Blandford They were in the course of an elaborate doubling movement through Dorsetshire towards Ringwood where Jessie anticipated an answer from her schoolmistress friend By this time they had been nearly sixty hours together and you will understand that mister Hoopdriver s feelings had undergone a considerable intensification and development At first Jessie had been only an impressionist sketch upon his mind something feminine active and dazzling something emphatically above him cast into his company by a kindly fate His chief idea at the outset as you know had been to live up to her level by pretending to be more exceptional more wealthy better educated and above all better born than he was His knowledge of the feminine mind was almost entirely derived from the young ladies he had met in business and in that class as in military society and among gentlemen s servants the good old tradition of a brutal social exclusiveness is still religiously preserved He had an almost intolerable dread of her thinking him a I bounder Later he began to perceive the distinction of her idiosyncracies Coupled with a magnificent want of experience was a splendid enthusiasm for abstract views of the most advanced description and her strength of conviction completely carried Hoopdriver away She was going to Live her Own Life with emphasis and mister Hoopdriver was profoundly stirred to similar resolves So soon as he grasped the tenor of her views he perceived that he himself had thought as much from his earliest years Of course he remarked in a flash of sexual pride a man is freer than a woman End in the Colonies y know there isn t half the Conventionality you find in society in this country He made one or two essays in the display of unconventionality and was quite unaware that he impressed her as a narrow minded person He suppressed the habits of years and made no proposal to go to church He discussed church going in a liberal spirit It s jest a habit he said jest a custom I don t see what good it does you at all really And he made a lot of excellent jokes at the chimney pot hat jokes he had read in the Globe turnovers on that subject But he showed his gentle breeding by keeping his gloves on all through the Sunday s ride and ostentatiously throwing away more than half a cigarette when they passed a church whose congregation was gathering for afternoon service He cautiously avoided literary topics except by way of compliment seeing that she was presently to be writing books It was on Jessie s initiative that they attended service in the old fashioned gallery of Blandford church Jessie s conscience I may perhaps tell you was now suffering the severest twinges She perceived clearly that things were not working out quite along the lines she had designed She had read her Olive Schreiner and George Egerton and so forth with all the want of perfect comprehension of one who is still emotionally a girl She knew the thing to do was to have a flat and to go to the British Museum and write leading articles for the daily papers until something better came along If Bechamel detestable person had kept his promises instead of behaving with unspeakable horridness all would have been well Now her only hope was that liberal minded woman Miss Mergle who a year ago had sent her out highly educated into the world Miss Mergle had told her at parting to live fearlessly and truly and had further given her a volume of Emerson s Essays and Motley s Dutch Republic to help her through the rapids of adolescence Jessie s feelings for her stepmother s household at Surbiton amounted to an active detestation There are no graver or more solemn women in the world than these clever girls whose scholastic advancement has retarded their feminine coquetry In spite of the advanced tone of Thomas Plantagenet s antimarital novel Jessie had speedily seen through that amiable woman s amiable defences The variety of pose necessitated by the corps of Men annoyed her to an altogether unreasonable degree To return to this life of ridiculous unreality unconditional capitulation to Conventionality was an exasperating prospect Yet what else was there to do You will understand therefore that at times she was moody and mister Hoopdriver respectfully silent and attentive and at times inclined to eloquent denunciation of the existing order of things She was a Socialist Hoopdriver learnt and he gave a vague intimation that he went further intending thereby no less than the horrors of anarchism He would have owned up to the destruction of the Winter Palace indeed had he had the faintest idea where the Winter Palace was and had his assurance amounted to certainty that the Winter Palace was destroyed He agreed with her cordially that the position of women was intolerable but checked himself on the verge of the proposition that a girl ought not to expect a fellow to hand down boxes for her when he was getting the swap from a customer It was Jessie s preoccupation with her own perplexities no doubt that delayed the unveiling of mister Hoopdriver all through Saturday and Sunday Once or twice however there were incidents that put him about terribly even questions that savoured of suspicion On Sunday night for no conceivable reason an unwonted wakefulness came upon him Unaccountably he realised he was a contemptible liar All through the small hours of Monday he reviewed the tale of his falsehoods and when he tried to turn his mind from that the financial problem suddenly rose upon him He heard two o clock strike and three It is odd how unhappy some of us are at times when we are at our happiest XXXIV Good morning Madam said Hoopdriver as Jessie came into the breakfast room of the Golden Pheasant on Monday morning and he smiled bowed rubbed his hands together and pulled out a chair for her and rubbed his hands again She stopped abruptly with a puzzled expression on her face Where HAVE I seen that before she said The chair said Hoopdriver flushing No the attitude She came forward and shook hands with him looking the while curiously into his face And Madam It s a habit said mister Hoopdriver guiltily A bad habit Calling ladies Madam You must put it down to our colonial roughness Out there up country y know the ladies so rare we call em all Madam You HAVE some funny habits brother Chris said Jessie Before you sell your diamond shares and go into society as you say and stand for Parliament What a fine thing it is to be a man you must cure yourself That habit of bowing as you do and rubbing your hands and looking expectant It s a habit I know But I don t think it a good one You don t mind my telling you Not a bit I m grateful I m blessed or afflicted with a trick of observation said Jessie looking at the breakfast table mister Hoopdriver put his hand to his moustache and then thinking this might be another habit checked his arm and stuck his hand into his pocket He felt juiced awkward to use his private formula Jessie s eye wandered to the armchair where a piece of binding was loose and possibly to carry out her theory of an observant disposition she turned and asked him for a pin mister Hoopdriver s hand fluttered instinctively to his lappel and there planted by habit were a couple of stray pins he had impounded What an odd place to put pins exclaimed Jessie taking it It s andy said mister Hoopdriver I saw a chap in a shop do it once You must have a careful disposition she said over her shoulder kneeling down to the chair In the centre of Africa up country that is one learns to value pins said mister Hoopdriver after a perceptible pause There weren t over many pins in Africa They don t lie about on the ground there His face was now in a fine red glow Where would the draper break out next He thrust his hands into his coat pockets then took one out again furtively removed the second pin and dropped it behind him gently It fell with a loud ping on the fender Happily she made no remark being preoccupied with the binding of the chair mister Hoopdriver instead of sitting down went up to the table and stood against it with his finger tips upon the cloth They were keeping breakfast a tremendous time He took up his rolled serviette looked closely and scrutinisingly at the ring then put his hand under the fold of the napkin and examined the texture and put the thing down again Then he had a vague impulse to finger his hollow wisdom tooth happily checked He suddenly discovered he was standing as if the table was a counter and sat down forthwith He drummed with his hand on the table He felt dreadfully hot and self conscious Breakfast is late said Jessie standing up Isn t it Conversation was slack Jessie wanted to know the distance to Ringwood Then silence fell again mister Hoopdriver very uncomfortable and studying an easy bearing looked again at the breakfast things and then idly lifted the corner of the tablecloth on the ends of his fingers and regarded it Fifteen three he thought privately Why do you do that said Jessie WHAT said Hoopdriver dropping the tablecloth convulsively Look at the cloth like that I saw you do it yesterday too mister Hoopdriver s face became quite a bright red He began pulling his moustache nervously I know he said I know It s a queer habit I know But out there you know there s native servants you know and it s a queer thing to talk about but one has to look at things to see don t y know whether they re quite clean or not It s got to be a habit How odd said Jessie Isn t it mumbled Hoopdriver If I were a Sherlock Holmes said Jessie I suppose I could have told you were a colonial from little things like that But anyhow I guessed it didn t I Yes said Hoopdriver in a melancholy tone you guessed it Why not seize the opportunity for a neat confession and add unhappily in this case you guessed wrong Did she suspect Then at the psychological moment the girl bumped the door open with her tray and brought in the coffee and scrambled eggs I am rather lucky with my intuitions sometimes said Jessie Remorse that had been accumulating in his mind for two days surged to the top of his mind What a shabby liar he was And besides he must sooner or later inevitably give himself away XXXV mister Hoopdriver helped the eggs and then instead of beginning sat with his cheek on his hand watching Jessie pour out the coffee His ears were a bright red and his eyes bright He took his coffee cup clumsily cleared his throat suddenly leant back in his chair and thrust his hands deep into his pockets I ll do it he said aloud Do what said Jessie looking up in surprise over the coffee pot She was just beginning her scrambled egg Own up Own what Miss Milton I m a liar He put his head on one side and regarded her with a frown of tremendous resolution Then in measured accents and moving his head slowly from side to side he announced Ay m a deraper You re a draper I thought You thought wrong But it s bound to come up Pins attitude habits It s plain enough I m a draper s assistant let out for a ten days holiday Jest a draper s assistant Not much is it A counter jumper A draper s assistant isn t a position to be ashamed of she said recovering and not quite understanding yet what this all meant Yes it is he said for a man in this country now To be just another man s hand as I am To have to wear what clothes you are told and go to church to please customers and work There s no other kind of men stand such hours A drunken bricklayer s a king to it But why are you telling me this now It s important you should know at once But mister Benson That isn t all If you don t mind my speaking about myself a bit there s a few things I d like to tell you I can t go on deceiving you My name s not Benson WHY I told you Benson I DON T know Except that I m a kind of fool Well I wanted somehow to seem more than I was My name s Hoopdriver Yes And that about South Africa and that lion Well Lies Lies And the discovery of diamonds on the ostrich farm Lies too And all the reminiscences of the giraffes lies too I never rode on no giraffes I d be afraid He looked at her with a kind of sullen satisfaction He had eased his conscience anyhow She regarded him in infinite perplexity This was a new side altogether to the man But WHY she began Why did I tell you such things I don t know Silly sort of chap I expect I suppose I wanted to impress you But somehow now I want you to know the truth Silence Breakfast untouched I thought I d tell you said mister Hoopdriver I suppose it s snobbishness and all that kind of thing as much as anything I lay awake pretty near all last night thinking about myself thinking what a got up imitation of a man I was and all that And you haven t any diamond shares and you are not going into Parliament and you re not All Lies said Hoopdriver in a sepulchral voice Lies from beginning to end Ow I came to tell em I DON T know She stared at him blankly I never set eyes on Africa in my life said mister Hoopdriver completing the confession Then he pulled his right hand from his pocket and with the nonchalance of one to whom the bitterness of death is passed began to drink his coffee It s a little surprising began Jessie vaguely Think it over said mister Hoopdriver I m sorry from the bottom of my heart And then breakfast proceeded in silence Jessie ate very little and seemed lost in thought mister Hoopdriver was so overcome by contrition and anxiety that he consumed an extraordinarily large breakfast out of pure nervousness and ate his scrambled eggs for the most part with the spoon that belonged properly to the marmalade His eyes were gloomily downcast She glanced at him through her eyelashes Once or twice she struggled with laughter once or twice she seemed to be indignant I don t know what to think she said at last I don t know what to make of you brother Chris I thought do you know that you were perfectly honest And somehow Well I think so still Honest with all those lies I wonder I don t said mister Hoopdriver I m fair ashamed of myself But anyhow I ve stopped deceiving you I THOUGHT said the Young Lady in Grey that story of the lion Lord said mister Hoopdriver Don t remind me of THAT I thought somehow I FELT that the things you said didn t ring quite true She suddenly broke out in laughter at the expression of his face Of COURSE you are honest she said How could I ever doubt it As if I had never pretended I see it all now Abruptly she rose and extended her hand across the breakfast things He looked at her doubtfully and saw the dancing friendliness in her eyes He scarcely understood at first He rose holding the marmalade spoon and took her proffered hand with abject humility Lord he broke out if you aren t enough but there I see it all now A brilliant inspiration had suddenly obscured her humour She sat down suddenly and he sat down too You did it she said because you wanted to help me And you thought I was too Conventional to take help from one I might think my social inferior That was partly it said mister Hoopdriver How you misunderstood me she said You don t mind It was noble of you But I am sorry she said you should think me likely to be ashamed of you because you follow a decent trade I didn t know at first you see said mister Hoopdriver And he submitted meekly to a restoration of his self respect He was as useful a citizen as could be it was proposed and carried and his lying was of the noblest And so the breakfast concluded much more happily than his brightest expectation and they rode out of ruddy little Blandford as though no shadow of any sort had come between them XXXVI As they were sitting by the roadside among the pine trees half way up a stretch of hill between Wimborne and Ringwood however mister Hoopdriver reopened the question of his worldly position Ju think he began abruptly removing a meditative cigarette from his mouth that a draper s shopman IS a decent citizen Why not When he puts people off with what they don t quite want for instance Need he do that Salesmanship said Hoopdriver Wouldn t get a crib if he didn t It s no good your arguing It s not a particularly honest nor a particularly useful trade it s not very high up there s no freedom and no leisure seven to eight thirty every day in the week don t leave much edge to live on does it real workmen laugh at us and educated chaps like bank clerks and solicitors clerks look down on us You look respectable outside and inside you are packed in dormitories like convicts fed on bread and butter and bullied like slaves You re just superior enough to feel that you re not superior Without capital there s no prospects one draper in a hundred don t even earn enough to marry on and if he DOES marry his G V can just use him to black boots if he likes and he daren t put his back up That s drapery And you tell me to be contented Would YOU be contented if you was a shop girl She did not answer She looked at him with distress in her brown eyes and he remained gloomily in possession of the field Presently he spoke I ve been thinking he said and stopped She turned her face resting her cheek on the palm of her hand There was a light in her eyes that made the expression of them tender mister Hoopdriver had not looked in her face while he had talked He had regarded the grass and pointed his remarks with redknuckled hands held open and palms upwards Now they hung limply over his knees Well she said I was thinking it this morning said mister Hoopdriver Yes Of course it s silly Well It s like this I m twenty three about I had my schooling all right to fifteen say Well that leaves me eight years behind Is it too late I wasn t so backward I did algebra and Latin up to auxiliary verbs and French genders I got a kind of grounding And now you mean should you go on working Yes said mister Hoopdriver That s it You can t do much at drapery without capital you know But if I could get really educated I ve thought sometimes Why not said the Young Lady in Grey mister Hoopdriver was surprised to see it in that light You think he said Of course You are a Man You are free She warmed I wish I were you to have the chance of that struggle Am I Man ENOUGH said mister Hoopdriver aloud but addressing himself There s that eight years he said to her You can make it up What you call educated men They re not going on You can catch them They are quite satisfied Playing golf and thinking of clever things to say to women like my stepmother and dining out You re in front of them already in one thing They think they know everything You don t And they know such little things Lord said mister Hoopdriver How you encourage a fellow If I could only help you she said and left an eloquent hiatus He became pensive again It s pretty evident you don t think much of a draper he said abruptly Another interval Hundreds of men she said have come from the very lowest ranks of life There was Burns a ploughman and Hugh Miller a stonemason and plenty of others Dodsley was a footman But drapers We re too sort of shabby genteel to rise Our coats and cuffs might get crumpled Wasn t there a Clarke who wrote theology He was a draper There was one started a sewing cotton the only one I ever heard tell of Have you ever read Hearts Insurgent Never said mister Hoopdriver He did not wait for her context but suddenly broke out with an account of his literary requirements The fact is I ve read precious little One don t get much of a chance situated as I am We have a library at business and I ve gone through that Most Besant I ve read and a lot of missus Braddon s and Rider Haggard and Marie Corelli and well a Ouida or so They re good stories of course and first class writers but they didn t seem to have much to do with me But there s heaps of books one hears talked about I HAVEN T read Don t you read any other books but novels Scarcely ever One gets tired after business and you can t get the books I have been to some extension lectures of course Lizabethan Dramatists it was but it seemed a little high flown you know And I went and did wood carving at the same place But it didn t seem leading nowhere and I cut my thumb and chucked it He made a depressing spectacle with his face anxious and his hands limp It makes me sick he said to think how I ve been fooled with My old schoolmaster ought to have a juiced HIDING He s a thief He pretended to undertake to make a man of me and be s stole twenty three years of my life filled me up with scraps and sweepings Here I am I don t KNOW anything and I can t DO anything and all the learning time is over Is it she said but he did not seem to hear her My o people didn t know any better and went and paid thirty pounds premium thirty pounds down to have me made THIS The G V promised to teach me the trade and he never taught me anything but to be a Hand It s the way they do with draper s apprentices If every swindler was locked up well you d have nowhere to buy tape and cotton It s all very well to bring up Burns and those chaps but I m not that make Yet I m not such muck that I might not have been better with teaching I wonder what the chaps who sneer and laugh at such as me would be if they d been fooled about as I ve been At twenty three it s a long start He looked up with a wintry smile a sadder and wiser Hoopdriver indeed than him of the glorious imaginings It s YOU done this he said You re real And it sets me thinking what I really am and what I might have been Suppose it was all different MAKE it different How WORK Stop playing at life Face it like a man Ah said Hoopdriver glancing at her out of the corners of his eyes And even then No It s not much good I m beginning too late And there in blankly thoughtful silence that conversation ended XXXVII IN THE NEW FOREST At Ringwood they lunched and Jessie met with a disappointment There was no letter for her at the post office Opposite the hotel The Chequered Career was a machine shop with a conspicuously second hand Marlborough Club tandem tricycle displayed in the window together with the announcement that bicycles and tricycles were on hire within The establishment was impressed on mister Hoopdriver s mind by the proprietor s action in coming across the road and narrowly inspecting their machines His action revived a number of disagreeable impressions but happily came to nothing While they were still lunching a tall clergyman with a heated face entered the room and sat down at the table next to theirs He was in a kind of holiday costume that is to say he had a more than usually high collar fastened behind and rather the worse for the weather and his long tail coat had been replaced by a black jacket of quite remarkable brevity He had faded brown shoes on his feet his trouser legs were grey with dust and he wore a hat of piebald straw in the place of the customary soft felt He was evidently socially inclined A most charming day sir he said in a ringing tenor Charming said mister Hoopdriver over a portion of pie You are I perceive cycling through this delightful country said the clergyman Touring explained mister Hoopdriver I can imagine that with a properly oiled machine there can be no easier nor pleasanter way of seeing the country No said mister Hoopdriver it isn t half a bad way of getting about For a young and newly married couple a tandem bicycle must be I should imagine a delightful bond Quite so said mister Hoopdriver reddening a little Do you ride a tandem No we re separate said mister Hoopdriver The motion through the air is indisputably of a very exhilarating description With that decision the clergyman turned to give his orders to the attendant in a firm authoritative voice for a cup of tea two gelatine lozenges bread and butter salad and pie to follow The gelatine lozenges I must have I require them to precipitate the tannin in my tea he remarked to the room at large and folding his hands remained for some time with his chin thereon staring fixedly at a little picture over mister Hoopdriver s head I myself am a cyclist said the clergyman descending suddenly upon mister Hoopdriver Indeed said mister Hoopdriver attacking the moustache What machine may I ask I have recently become possessed of a tricycle A bicycle is I regret to say considered too how shall I put it flippant by my parishioners So I have a tricycle I have just been hauling it hither Hauling said Jessie surprised With a shoe lace And partly carrying it on my back The pause was unexpected Jessie had some trouble with a crumb mister Hoopdriver s face passed through several phases of surprise Then he saw the explanation Had an accident I can hardly call it an accident The wheels suddenly refused to go round I found myself about five miles from here with an absolutely immobile machine Ow said mister Hoopdriver trying to seem intelligent and Jessie glanced at this insane person It appears said the clergyman satisfied with the effect he had created that my man carefully washed out the bearings with paraffin and let the machine dry without oiling it again The consequence was that they became heated to a considerable temperature and jammed Even at the outset the machine ran stiffly as well as noisily and I being inclined to ascribe this stiffness to my own lassitude merely redoubled my exertions Ot work all round said mister Hoopdriver You could scarcely put it more appropriately It is my rule of life to do whatever I find to do with all my might I believe indeed that the bearings became red hot Finally one of the wheels jammed together A side wheel it was so that its stoppage necessitated an inversion of the entire apparatus an inversion in which I participated Meaning that you went over said mister Hoopdriver suddenly much amused Precisely And not brooking my defeat I suffered repeatedly You may understand perhaps a natural impatience I expostulated playfully of course Happily the road was not overlooked Finally the entire apparatus became rigid and I abandoned the unequal contest For all practical purposes the tricycle was no better than a heavy chair without castors It was a case of hauling or carrying The clergyman s nutriment appeared in the doorway Five miles said the clergyman He began at once to eat bread and butter vigorously Happily he said I am an eupeptic energetic sort of person on principle I would all men were likewise It s the best way agreed mister Hoopdriver and the conversation gave precedence to bread and butter Gelatine said the clergyman presently stirring his tea thoughtfully precipitates the tannin in one s tea and renders it easy of digestion That s a useful sort of thing to know said mister Hoopdriver You are altogether welcome said the clergyman biting generously at two pieces of bread and butter folded together In the afternoon our two wanderers rode on at an easy pace towards Stoney Cross Conversation languished the topic of South Africa being in abeyance mister Hoopdriver was silenced by disagreeable thoughts He had changed the last sovereign at Ringwood The fact had come upon him suddenly Now too late he was reflecting upon his resources There was twenty pounds or more in the post office savings bank in Putney but his book was locked up in his box at the Antrobus establishment Else this infatuated man would certainly have surreptitiously withdrawn the entire sum in order to prolong these journeyings even for a few days As it was the shadow of the end fell across his happiness Strangely enough in spite of his anxiety and the morning s collapse he was still in a curious emotional state that was certainly not misery He was forgetting his imaginings and posings forgetting himself altogether in his growing appreciation of his companion The most tangible trouble in his mind was the necessity of breaking the matter to her A long stretch up hill tired them long before Stoney Cross was reached and they dismounted and sat under the shade of a little oak tree Near the crest the road looped on itself so that looking back it sloped below them up to the right and then came towards them About them grew a rich heather with stunted oaks on the edge of a deep ditch along the roadside and this road was sandy below the steepness of the hill however it was grey and barred with shadows for there the trees clustered thick and tall mister Hoopdriver fumbled clumsily with his cigarettes There s a thing I got to tell you he said trying to be perfectly calm Yes she said I d like to jest discuss your plans a bit y know I m very unsettled said Jessie You are thinking of writing Books Or doing journalism or teaching or something like that And keeping yourself independent of your stepmother Yes How long d it take now to get anything of that sort to do I don t know at all I believe there are a great many women journalists and sanitary inspectors and black and white artists But I suppose it takes time Women you know edit most papers nowadays George Egerton says I ought I suppose to communicate with a literary agent Of course said Hoopdriver it s very suitable work Not being heavy like the drapery There s heavy brain labour you must remember That wouldn t hurt YOU said mister Hoopdriver turning a compliment It s like this he said ending a pause It s a juiced nuisance alluding to these matters but we got very little more money He perceived that Jessie started though he did not look at her I was counting of course on your friend s writing and your being able to take some action to day Take some action was a phrase he had learnt at his last swop Money said Jessie I didn t think of money Hullo Here s a tandem bicycle said mister Hoopdriver abruptly and pointing with his cigarette She looked and saw two little figures emerging from among the trees at the foot of the slope The riders were bowed sternly over their work and made a gallant but unsuccessful attempt to take the rise The machine was evidently too highly geared for hill climbing and presently the rearmost rider rose on his saddle and hopped off leaving his companion to any fate he found proper The foremost rider was a man unused to such machines and apparently undecided how to dismount He wabbled a few yards up the hill with a long tail of machine wabbling behind him Finally he made an attempt to jump off as one does off a single bicycle hit his boot against the backbone and collapsed heavily falling on his shoulder She stood up Dear me she said I hope he isn t hurt The second rider went to the assistance of the fallen man Hoopdriver stood up too The lank shaky machine was lifted up and wheeled out of the way and then the fallen rider being assisted got up slowly and stood rubbing his arm No serious injury seemed to be done to the man and the couple presently turned their attention to the machine by the roadside They were not in cycling clothes Hoopdriver observed One wore the grotesque raiment for which the Cockney discovery of the game of golf seems indirectly blamable Even at this distance the flopping flatness of his cap the bright brown leather at the top of his calves and the chequering of his stockings were perceptible The other the rear rider was a slender little man in grey Amatoors said mister Hoopdriver Jessie stood staring and a veil of thought dropped over her eyes She no longer regarded the two men who were now tinkering at the machine down below there How much have you she said He thrust his right hand into his pocket and produced six coins counted them with his left index finger and held them out to her Thirteen four half said mister Hoopdriver Every penny I have half a sovereign she said Our bill wherever we stop The hiatus was more eloquent than many words I never thought of money coming in to stop us like this said Jessie It s a juiced nuisance Money said Jessie Is it possible Surely Conventionality May only people of means Live their own Lives I never thought Pause Here s some more cyclists coming said mister Hoopdriver The two men were both busy with their bicycle still but now from among the trees emerged the massive bulk of a Marlborough Club tandem ridden by a slender woman in grey and a burly man in a Norfolk jacket Following close upon this came lank black figure in a piebald straw hat riding a tricycle of antiquated pattern with two large wheels in front The man in grey remained bowed over the bicycle with his stomach resting on the saddle but his companion stood up and addressed some remark to the tricycle riders Then it seemed as if he pointed up hill to where mister Hoopdriver and his companion stood side by side A still odder thing followed the lady in grey took out her handkerchief appeared to wave it for a moment and then at a hasty motion from her companion the white signal vanished Surely said Jessie peering under her hand It s never The tandem tricycle began to ascend the hill quartering elaborately from side to side to ease the ascent It was evident from his heaving shoulders and depressed head that the burly gentleman was exerting himself The clerical person on the tricycle assumed the shape of a note of interrogation Then on the heels of this procession came a dogcart driven by a man in a billycock hat and containing a lady in dark green Looks like some sort of excursion said Hoopdriver Jessie did not answer She was still peering under her hand Surely she said The clergyman s efforts were becoming convulsive With a curious jerking motion the tricycle he rode twisted round upon itself and he partly dismounted and partly fell off He turned his machine up hill again immediately and began to wheel it Then the burly gentleman dismounted and with a courtly attentiveness assisted the lady in grey to alight There was some little difference of opinion as to assistance she so clearly wished to help push Finally she gave in and the burly gentleman began impelling the machine up hill by his own unaided strength His face made a dot of brilliant colour among the greys and greens at the foot of the hill The tandem bicycle was now it seems repaired and this joined the tail of the procession its riders walking behind the dogcart from which the lady in green and the driver had now descended mister Hoopdriver said Jessie Those people I m almost sure Lord said mister Hoopdriver reading the rest in her face and he turned to pick up his machine at once Then he dropped it and assisted her to mount At the sight of Jessie mounting against the sky line the people coming up the hill suddenly became excited and ended Jessie s doubts at once Two handkerchiefs waved and some one shouted The riders of the tandem bicycle began to run it up hill past the other vehicles But our young people did not wait for further developments of the pursuit In another moment they were out of sight riding hard down a steady incline towards Stoney Cross Before they had dropped among the trees out of sight of the hill brow Jessie looked back and saw the tandem rising over the crest with its rear rider just tumbling into the saddle They re coming she said and bent her head over her handles in true professional style They whirled down into the valley over a white bridge and saw ahead of them a number of shaggy little ponies frisking in the roadway Involuntarily they slackened Shoo said mister Hoopdriver and the ponies kicked up their heels derisively At that mister Hoopdriver lost his temper and charged at them narrowly missed one and sent them jumping the ditch into the bracken under the trees leaving the way clear for Jessie Then the road rose quietly but persistently the treadles grew heavy and mister Hoopdriver s breath sounded like a saw The tandem appeared making frightful exertions at the foot while the chase was still climbing Then thank Heaven a crest and a stretch of up and down road whose only disadvantage was its pitiless exposure to the afternoon sun The tandem apparently dismounted at the hill and did not appear against the hot blue sky until they were already near some trees and a good mile away We re gaining said mister Hoopdriver with a little Niagara of perspiration dropping from brow to cheek That hill But that was their only gleam of success They were both nearly spent Hoopdriver indeed was quite spent and only a feeling of shame prolonged the liquidation of his bankrupt physique From that point the tandem grained upon them steadily At the Rufus Stone it was scarcely a hundred yards behind Then one desperate spurt and they found themselves upon a steady downhill stretch among thick pine woods Downhill nothing can beat a highly geared tandem bicycle Automatically mister Hoopdriver put up his feet and Jessie slackened her pace In another moment they heard the swish of the fat pneumatics behind them and the tandem passed Hoopdriver and drew alongside Jessie Hoopdriver felt a mad impulse to collide with this abominable machine as it passed him His only consolation was to notice that its riders riding violently were quite as dishevelled as himself and smothered in sandy white dust Abruptly Jessie stopped and dismounted and the tandem riders shot panting past them downhill Brake said Dangle who was riding behind and stood up on the pedals For a moment the velocity of the thing increased and then they saw the dust fly from the brake as it came down on the front tire Dangle s right leg floundered in the air as he came off in the road The tandem wobbled Hold it cried Phipps over his shoulder going on downhill I can t get off if you don t hold it He put on the brake until the machine stopped almost dead and then feeling unstable began to pedal again Dangle shouted after him Put out your foot man said Dangle In this way the tandem riders were carried a good hundred yards or more beyond their quarry Then Phipps realized his possibilities slacked up with the brake and let the thing go over sideways dropping on to his right foot With his left leg still over the saddle and still holding the handles he looked over his shoulder and began addressing uncomplimentary remarks to Dangle You only think of yourself said Phipps with a florid face They have forgotten us said Jessie turning her machine There was a road at the top of the hill to Lyndhurst said Hoopdriver following her example It s no good There s the money We must give it up But let us go back to that hotel at Rufus Stone I don t see why we should be led captive So to the consternation of the tandem riders Jessie and her companion mounted and rode quietly back up the hill again As they dismounted at the hotel entrance the tandem overtook them and immediately afterwards the dogcart came into view in pursuit Dangle jumped off Miss Milton I believe said Dangle panting and raising a damp cap from his wet and matted hair I SAY said Phipps receding involuntarily Don t go doing it again Dangle HELP a chap One minute said Dangle and ran after his colleague Jessie leant her machine against the wall and went into the hotel entrance Hoopdriver remained in the hotel entrance limp but defiant XXXVIII AT THE RUFUS STONE He folded his arms as Dangle and Phipps returned towards him Phipps was abashed by his inability to cope with the tandem which he was now wheeling but Dangle was inclined to be quarrelsome Miss Milton he said briefly mister Hoopdriver bowed over his folded arms Miss Milton within said Dangle AND not to be disturved said mister Hoopdriver You are a scoundrel sir said mister Dangle Et your service said mister Hoopdriver She awaits er stepmother sir mister Dangle hesitated She will be here immediately he said Here is her friend Miss Mergle mister Hoopdriver unfolded his arms slowly and with an air of immense calm thrust his hands into his breeches pockets Then with one of those fatal hesitations of his it occurred to him that this attitude was merely vulgarly defiant he withdrew both returned one and pulled at the insufficient moustache with the other Miss Mergle caught him in confusion Is this the man she said to Dangle and forthwith How DARE you sir How dare you face me That poor girl You will permit me to observe began mister Hoopdriver with a splendid drawl seeing himself for the first time in all this business as a romantic villain Ugh said Miss Mergle unexpectedly striking him about the midriff with her extended palms and sending him staggering backward into the hall of the hotel Let me pass said Miss Mergle in towering indignation How dare you resist my passage and so swept by him and into the dining room wherein Jessie had sought refuge As mister Hoopdriver struggled for equilibrium with the umbrella stand Dangle and Phipps roused from their inertia by Miss Mergle s activity came in upon her heels Phipps leading How dare you prevent that lady passing said Phipps mister Hoopdriver looked obstinate and to Dangle s sense dangerous but he made no answer A waiter in full bloom appeared at the end of the passage guardant It is men of your stamp sir said Phipps who discredit manhood mister Hoopdriver thrust his hands into his pockets Who the juice are you shouted mister Hoopdriver fiercely Who are YOU sir retorted Phipps Who are you That s the question What are YOU and what are you doing wandering at large with a young lady under age Don t speak to him said Dangle I m not a going to tell all my secrets to any one who comes at me said Hoopdriver Not Likely And added fiercely And that I tell you sir He and Phipps stood legs apart and both looking exceedingly fierce at one another and Heaven alone knows what might not have happened if the long clergyman had not appeared in the doorway heated but deliberate Petticoated anachronism said the long clergyman in the doorway apparently still suffering from the antiquated prejudice that demanded a third wheel and a black coat from a clerical rider He looked at Phipps and Hoopdriver for a moment then extending his hand towards the latter he waved it up and down three times saying Tchak tchak tchak very deliberately as he did so Then with a concluding Ugh and a gesture of repugnance he passed on into the dining room from which the voice of Miss Mergle was distinctly audible remarking that the weather was extremely hot even for the time of year This expression of extreme disapprobation had a very demoralizing effect upon Hoopdriver a demoralization that was immediately completed by the advent of the massive Widgery Is this the man said Widgery very grimly and producing a special voice for the occasion from somewhere deep in his neck Don t hurt him said missus Milton with clasped hands However much wrong he has done her No violence Ow many more of you said Hoopdriver at bay before the umbrella stand Where is she What has he done with her said missus Milton I m not going to stand here and be insulted by a lot of strangers said mister Hoopdriver So you needn t think it Please don t worry mister Hoopdriver said Jessie suddenly appearing in the door of the dining room I m here mother Her face was white missus Milton said something about her child and made an emotional charge at Jessie The embrace vanished into the dining room Widgery moved as if to follow and hesitated You d better make yourself scarce he said to mister Hoopdriver I shan t do anything of the kind said mister Hoopdriver with a catching of the breath I m here defending that young lady You ve done her enough mischief I should think said Widgery suddenly walking towards the dining room and closing the door behind him leaving Dangle and Phipps with Hoopdriver Clear said Phipps threateningly I shall go and sit out in the garden said mister Hoopdriver with dignity There I shall remain Don t make a row with him said Dangle And mister Hoopdriver retired unassaulted in almost sobbing dignity XXXIX So here is the world with us again and our sentimental excursion is over In the front of the Rufus Stone Hotel conceive a remarkable collection of wheeled instruments watched over by Dangle and Phipps in grave and stately attitudes and by the driver of a stylish dogcart from Ringwood In the garden behind in an attitude of nervous prostration mister Hoopdriver was seated on a rustic seat Through the open window of a private sitting room came a murmur of voices as of men and women in conference Occasionally something that might have been a girlish sob I fail to see what status Widgery has says Dangle thrusting himself in there He takes too much upon himself said Phipps I ve been noticing little things yesterday and to day said Dangle and stopped They went to the cathedral together in the afternoon Financially it would be a good thing for her of course said Dangle with a gloomy magnanimity He felt drawn to Phipps now by the common trouble in spite of the man s chequered legs Financially it wouldn t be half bad He s so dull and heavy said Phipps Meanwhile within the clergyman had by promptitude and dexterity taken the chair and was opening the case against the unfortunate Jessie I regret to have to say that my heroine had been appalled by the visible array of public opinion against her excursion to the pitch of tears She was sitting with flushed cheeks and swimming eyes at the end of the table opposite to the clergyman She held her handkerchief crumpled up in her extended hand missus Milton sat as near to her as possible and occasionally made little dabs with her hand at Jessie s hand to indicate forgiveness These advances were not reciprocated which touched Widgery very much The lady in green Miss Mergle B A sat on the opposite side near the clergyman She was the strong minded schoolmistress to whom Jessie had written and who had immediately precipitated the pursuit upon her She had picked up the clergyman in Ringwood and had told him everything forthwith having met him once at a British Association meeting He had immediately constituted himself administrator of the entire business Widgery having been foiled in an attempt to conduct the proceedings stood with his legs wide apart in front of the fireplace ornament and looked profound and sympathetic Jessie s account of her adventures was a chary one and given amidst frequent interruptions She surprised herself by skilfully omitting any allusion to the Bechamel episode She completely exonerated Hoopdriver from the charge of being more than an accessory to her escapade But public feeling was heavy against Hoopdriver Her narrative was inaccurate and sketchy but happily the others were too anxious to pass opinions to pin her down to particulars At last they had all the facts they would permit My dear young lady said the clergyman I can only ascribe this extravagant and regrettable expedition of yours to the wildest misconceptions of your place in the world and of your duties and responsibilities Even now it seems to me your present emotion is due not so much to a real and sincere penitence for your disobedience and folly as to a positive annoyance at our most fortunate interference Not that said missus Milton in a low tone Not that But WHY did she go off like this said Widgery That s what I want to know Jessie made an attempt to speak but missus Milton said Hush and the ringing tenor of the clergyman rode triumphantly over the meeting I cannot understand this spirit of unrest that has seized upon the more intelligent portion of the feminine community You had a pleasant home a most refined and intelligent lady in the position of your mother to cherish and protect you If I HAD a mother gulped Jessie succumbing to the obvious snare of self pity and sobbing To cherish protect and advise you And you must needs go out of it all alone into a strange world of unknown dangers I wanted to learn said Jessie You wanted to learn May you never have anything to UNlearn AH from missus Milton very sadly It isn t fair for all of you to argue at me at once submitted Jessie irrelevantly A world full of unknown dangers resumed the clergyman Your proper place was surely the natural surroundings that are part of you You have been unduly influenced it is only too apparent by a class of literature which with all due respect to distinguished authoress that shall be nameless I must call the New Woman Literature In that deleterious ingredient of our book boxes I don t altogether agree with you there said Miss Mergle throwing her head back and regarding him firmly through her spectacles and mister Widgery coughed What HAS all this to do with me asked Jessie availing herself of the interruption The point is said missus Milton on her defence that in my books All I want to do said Jessie is to go about freely by myself Girls do so in America Why not here Social conditions are entirely different in America said Miss Mergle Here we respect Class Distinctions It s very unfortunate What I want to know is why I cannot go away for a holiday if I want to With a strange young man socially your inferior said Widgery and made her flush by his tone Why not she said With anybody They don t do that even in America said Miss Mergle My dear young lady said the clergyman the most elementary principles of decorum A day will come when you will better understand how entirely subservient your ideas are to the very fundamentals of our present civilisation when you will better understand the harrowing anxiety you have given missus Milton by this inexplicable flight of yours We can only put things down at present in charity to your ignorance You have to consider the general body of opinion too said Widgery Precisely said Miss Mergle There is no such thing as conduct in the absolute If once this most unfortunate business gets about said the clergyman it will do you infinite harm But I VE done nothing wrong Why should I be responsible for other people s The world has no charity said missus Milton For a girl said Jessie No Now do let us stop arguing my dear young lady and let us listen to reason Never mind how or why this conduct of yours will do you infinite harm if once it is generally known And not only that it will cause infinite pain to those who care for you But if you will return at once to your home causing it to be understood that you have been with friends for these last few days Tell lies said Jessie Certainly not Most certainly not But I understand that is how your absence is understood at present and there is no reason Jessie s grip tightened on her handkerchief I won t go back she said to have it as I did before I want a room of my own what books I need to read to be free to go out by myself alone Teaching Anything said missus Milton anything in reason But will you keep your promise said Jessie Surely you won t dictate to your mother said Widgery My stepmother I don t want to dictate I want definite promises now This is most unreasonable said the clergyman Very well said Jessie swallowing a sob but with unusual resolution Then I won t go back My life is being frittered away LET her have her way said Widgery A room then All your Men I m not to come down and talk away half my days My dear child if only to save you said missus Milton If you don t keep your promise Then I take it the matter is practically concluded said the clergyman And that you very properly submit to return to your proper home And now if I may offer a suggestion it is that we take tea Freed of its tannin nothing I think is more refreshing and stimulating There s a train from Lyndhurst at thirteen minutes to six said Widgery unfolding a time table That gives us about half an hour or three quarters here if a conveyance is obtainable that is A gelatine lozenge dropped into the tea cup precipitates the tannin in the form of tannate of gelatine said the clergyman to Miss Mergle in a confidential bray Jessie stood up and saw through the window a depressed head and shoulders over the top of the back of a garden seat She moved towards the door While you have tea mother she said I must tell mister Hoopdriver of our arrangements Don t you think I began the clergyman No said Jessie very rudely I don t But Jessie haven t you already You are already breaking the capitulation said Jessie Will you want the whole half hour said Widgery at the bell Every minute said Jessie in the doorway He s behaved very nobly to me There s tea said Widgery I ve had tea He may not have behaved badly said the clergyman But he s certainly an astonishingly weak person to let a wrong headed young girl Jessie closed the door into the garden Meanwhile mister Hoopdriver made a sad figure in the sunlight outside It was over this wonderful excursion of his so far as she was concerned and with the swift blow that separated them he realised all that those days had done for him He tried to grasp the bearings of their position Of course they would take her away to those social altitudes of hers She would become an inaccessible young lady again Would they let him say good bye to her How extraordinary it had all been He recalled the moment when he had first seen her riding with the sunlight behind her along the riverside road he recalled that wonderful night at Bognor remembering it as if everything had been done of his own initiative Brave brave she had called him And afterwards when she came down to him in the morning kindly quiet But ought he to have persuaded her then to return to her home He remembered some intention of the sort Now these people snatched her away from him as though he was scarcely fit to live in the same world with her No more he was He felt he had presumed upon her worldly ignorance in travelling with her day after day She was so dainty so delightful so serene He began to recapitulate her expressions the light of her eyes the turn of her face He wasn t good enough to walk in the same road with her Nobody was Suppose they let him say good bye to her what could he say That But they were sure not to let her talk to him alone her mother would be there as what was it Chaperone He d never once had a chance of saying what he felt indeed it was only now he was beginning to realise what he felt Love I he wouldn t presume It was worship If only he could have one more chance He must have one more chance somewhere somehow Then he would pour out his soul to her eloquently He felt eloquently and words would come He was dust under her feet His meditation was interrupted by the click of a door handle and Jessie appeared in the sunlight under the verandah Come away from here she said to Hoopdriver as he rose to meet her I m going home with them We have to say good bye mister Hoopdriver winced opened and shut his mouth and rose without a word XL At first Jessie Milton and mister Hoopdriver walked away from the hotel in silence He heard a catching in her breath and glanced at her and saw her ips pressed tight and a tear on her cheek Her face was hot and bright She was looking straight before her He could think of nothing to say and thrust his hands in his pockets and looked away from her intentionally After a while she began to talk They dealt disjointedly with scenery first and then with the means of self education She took his address at Antrobus s and promised to send him some books But even with that it was spiritless aching talk Hoopdriver felt for the fighting mood was over She seemed to him preoccupied with the memories of her late battle and that appearance hurt him It s the end he whispered to himself It s the end They went into a hollow and up a gentle wooded slope and came at last to a high and open space overlooking a wide expanse of country There by a common impulse they stopped She looked at her watch a little ostentatiously They stared at the billows of forest rolling away beneath them crest beyond crest of leafy trees fading at last into blue The end ran through his mind to the exclusion of all speakable thoughts And so she said presently breaking the silence it comes to good bye For half a minute he did not answer Then he gathered his resolution There is one thing I MUST say Well she said surprised and abruptly forgetting the recent argument I ask no return But Then he stopped I won t say it It s no good It would be rot from me now I wasn t going to say anything Good bye She looked at him with a startled expression in her eyes No she said But don t forget you are going to work Remember brother Chris you are my friend You will work You are not a very strong man you know now you will forgive me nor do you know all you should But what will you be in six years time He stared hard in front of him still and the lines about his weak mouth seemed to strengthen He knew she understood what he could not say I ll work he said concisely They stood side by side for a moment Then he said with a motion of his head I won t come back to THEM Do you mind Going back alone She took ten seconds to think No she said and held out her hand biting her nether lip GOOD BYE she whispered He turned with a white face looked into her eyes took her hand limply and then with a sudden impulse lifted it to his lips She would have snatched it away but his grip tightened to her movement She felt the touch of his lips and then he had dropped her fingers and turned from her and was striding down the slope A dozen paces away his foot turned in the lip of a rabbit hole and he stumbled forward and almost fell He recovered his balance and went on not looking back He never once looked back She stared at his receding figure until it was small and far below her and then the tears running over her eyelids now turned slowly and walked with her hands gripped hard together behind her towards Stoney Cross again I did not know she whispered to herself I did not understand Even now No I do not understand XLI THE ENVOY So the story ends dear Reader mister Hoopdriver sprawling down there among the bracken must sprawl without our prying I think or listening to what chances to his breathing And of what came of it all of the six years and afterwards this is no place to tell In truth there is no telling it for the years have still to run But if you see how a mere counter jumper a cad on castors and a fool to boot may come to feel the little insufficiencies of life and if he has to any extent won your sympathies my end is attained If it is not attained may Heaven forgive us both Nor will we follow this adventurous young lady of ours back to her home at Surbiton to her new struggle against Widgery and missus Milton combined For as she will presently hear that devoted man has got his reward For her also your sympathies are invited The rest of this great holiday too five days there are left of it is beyond the limits of our design You see fitfully a slender figure in a dusty brown suit and heather mixture stockings and brown shoes not intended to be cycled in flitting Londonward through Hampshire and Berkshire and Surrey going economically for excellent reasons Day by day he goes on riding fitfully and for the most part through bye roads but getting a few miles to the north eastward every day He is a narrow chested person with a nose hot and tanned at the bridge with unwonted exposure and brown red knuckled fists A musing expression sits upon the face of this rider you observe Sometimes he whistles noiselessly to himself sometimes he speaks aloud a juiced good try anyhow you hear and sometimes and that too often for my liking he looks irritable and hopeless I know he says I know It s over and done It isn t IN me You ain t man enough Hoopdriver Look at yer silly hands Oh my God and a gust of passion comes upon him and he rides furiously for a space Sometimes again his face softens Anyhow if I m not to see her she s going to lend me books he thinks and gets such comfort as he can Then again Books What s books Once or twice triumphant memories of the earlier incidents nerve his face for a while I put the ky bosh on HIS little game he remarks I DID that and one might even call him happy in these phases And by the bye the machine you notice has been enamel painted grey and carries a sonorous gong This figure passes through Basingstoke and Bagshot Staines Hampton and Richmond At last in Putney High Street glowing with the warmth of an August sunset and with all the prentice boys busy shutting up shop and the work girls going home and the shop folks peeping abroad and the white buses full of late clerks and city folk rumbling home to their dinners we part from him He is back To morrow the early rising the dusting and drudgery begin again but with a difference with wonderful memories and still more wonderful desires and ambitions replacing those discrepant dreams He turns out of the High Street at the corner dismounts with a sigh and pushes his machine through the gates of the Antrobus stable yard as the apprentice with the high collar holds them open There are words of greeting South Coast you hear and splendid weather splendid He sighs Yes swapped him off for a couple of sovs It s a juiced good machine The gate closes upon him with a slam and he vanishes from our ken End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Wheels of Chance by H G Wells END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE
