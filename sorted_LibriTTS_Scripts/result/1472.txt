GERMANS AT MEAT Bread soup was placed upon the table Ah said the Herr Rat leaning upon the table as he peered into the tureen that is what I need My magen has not been in order for several days Bread soup and just the right consistency I am a good cook myself he turned to me How interesting I said attempting to infuse just the right amount of enthusiasm into my voice Oh yes when one is not married it is necessary As for me I have had all I wanted from women without marriage He tucked his napkin into his collar and blew upon his soup as he spoke Now at nine o clock I make myself an English breakfast but not much Four slices of bread two eggs two slices of cold ham one plate of soup two cups of tea that is nothing to you He asserted the fact so vehemently that I had not the courage to refute it All eyes were suddenly turned upon me I felt I was bearing the burden of the nation s preposterous breakfast I who drank a cup of coffee while buttoning my blouse in the morning Nothing at all cried Herr Hoffmann from Berlin Ach when I was in England in the morning I used to eat He turned up his eyes and his moustache wiping the soup drippings from his coat and waistcoat Do they really eat so much asked Fraulein Stiegelauer Soup and baker s bread and pig s flesh and tea and coffee and stewed fruit and honey and eggs and cold fish and kidneys and hot fish and liver All the ladies eat too especially the ladies Certainly I myself have noticed it when I was living in a hotel in Leicester Square cried the Herr Rat It was a good hotel but they could not make tea now Ah that s one thing I CAN do said I laughing brightly I can make very good tea The great secret is to warm the teapot Warm the teapot interrupted the Herr Rat pushing away his soup plate What do you warm the teapot for Ha ha that s very good One does not eat the teapot I suppose He fixed his cold blue eyes upon me with an expression which suggested a thousand premeditated invasions So that is the great secret of your English tea All you do is to warm the teapot I wanted to say that was only the preliminary canter but could not translate it and so was silent The servant brought in veal with sauerkraut and potatoes I eat sauerkraut with great pleasure said the Traveller from North Germany but now I have eaten so much of it that I cannot retain it I am immediately forced to A beautiful day I cried turning to Fraulein Stiegelauer Did you get up early At five o clock I walked for ten minutes in the wet grass Again in bed At half past five I fell asleep and woke at seven when I made an overbody washing Again in bed At eight o clock I had a cold water poultice and at half past eight I drank a cup of mint tea At nine I drank some malt coffee and began my cure Pass me the sauerkraut please You do not eat it No thank you I still find it a little strong Is it true asked the Widow picking her teeth with a hairpin as she spoke that you are a vegetarian Why yes I have not eaten meat for three years Im possible Have you any family No There now you see that s what you re coming to Who ever heard of having children upon vegetables It is not possible But you never have large families in England now I suppose you are too busy with your suffragetting Now I have had nine children and they are all alive thank God Fine healthy babies though after the first one was born I had to How WONDERFUL I cried Wonderful said the Widow contemptuously replacing the hairpin in the knob which was balanced on the top of her head Not at all A friend of mine had four at the same time Her husband was so pleased he gave a supper party and had them placed on the table Of course she was very proud Germany boomed the Traveller biting round a potato which he had speared with his knife is the home of the Family Followed an appreciative silence The dishes were changed for beef red currants and spinach They wiped their forks upon black bread and started again How long are you remaining here asked the Herr Rat I do not know exactly I must be back in London in September Of course you will visit Munchen I am afraid I shall not have time You see it is important not to break into my cure But you MUST go to Munchen You have not seen Germany if you have not been to Munchen All the Exhibitions all the Art and Soul life of Germany are in Munchen There is the Wagner Festival in August and Mozart and a Japanese collection of pictures and there is the beer You do not know what good beer is until you have been to Munchen Why I see fine ladies every afternoon but fine ladies I tell you drinking glasses so high He measured a good washstand pitcher in height and I smiled If I drink a great deal of Munchen beer I sweat so said Herr Hoffmann When I am here in the fields or before my baths I sweat but I enjoy it but in the town it is not at all the same thing Prompted by the thought he wiped his neck and face with his dinner napkin and carefully cleaned his ears A glass dish of stewed apricots was placed upon the table Ah fruit said Fraulein Stiegelauer that is so necessary to health The doctor told me this morning that the more fruit I could eat the better She very obviously followed the advice Said the Traveller I suppose you are frightened of an invasion too eh Oh that s good I ve been reading all about your English play in a newspaper Did you see it Yes I sat upright I assure you we are not afraid Well then you ought to be said the Herr Rat You have got no army at all a few little boys with their veins full of nicotine poisoning Don t be afraid Herr Hoffmann said We don t want England If we did we would have had her long ago We really do not want you He waved his spoon airily looking across at me as though I were a little child whom he would keep or dismiss as he pleased We certainly do not want Germany I said This morning I took a half bath Then this afternoon I must take a knee bath and an arm bath volunteered the Herr Rat then I do my exercises for an hour and my work is over A glass of wine and a couple of rolls with some sardines They were handed cherry cake with whipped cream What is your husband s favourite meat asked the Widow I really do not know I answered You really do not know How long have you been married Three years But you cannot be in earnest You would not have kept house as his wife for a week without knowing that fact I really never asked him he is not at all particular about his food A pause They all looked at me shaking their heads their mouths full of cherry stones No wonder there is a repetition in England of that dreadful state of things in Paris said the Widow folding her dinner napkin How can a woman expect to keep her husband if she does not know his favourite food after three years Mahlzeit Mahlzeit I closed the door after me two THE BARON Who is he I said And why does he sit always alone with his back to us too Ah whispered the Frau Oberregierungsrat he is a BARON She looked at me very solemnly and yet with the slightest possible contempt a fancy not recognising that at the first glance expression But poor soul he cannot help it I said Surely that unfortunate fact ought not to debar him from the pleasures of intellectual intercourse If it had not been for her fork I think she would have crossed herself Surely you cannot understand He is one of the First Barons More than a little unnerved she turned and spoke to the Frau Doktor on her left My omelette is empty EMPTY she protested and this is the third I have tried I looked at the First of the Barons He was eating salad taking a whole lettuce leaf on his fork and absorbing it slowly rabbit wise a fascinating process to watch Small and slight with scanty black hair and beard and yellow toned complexion he invariably wore black serge clothes a rough linen shirt black sandals and the largest black rimmed spectacles that I had ever seen The Herr Oberlehrer who sat opposite me smiled benignantly It must be very interesting for you gnadige Frau to be able to watch of course this is a VERY FINE HOUSE There was a lady from the Spanish Court here in the summer she had a liver We often spoke together I looked gratified and humble Now in England in your boarding ouse one does not find the First Class as in Germany No indeed I replied still hypnotised by the Baron who looked like a little yellow silkworm The Baron comes every year went on the Herr Oberlehrer for his nerves He has never spoken to any of the guests YET A smile crossed his face I seemed to see his visions of some splendid upheaval of that silence a dazzling exchange of courtesies in a dim future a splendid sacrifice of a newspaper to this Exalted One a danke schon to be handed down to future generations At that moment the postman looking like a German army officer came in with the mail He threw my letters into my milk pudding and then turned to a waitress and whispered She retired hastily The manager of the pension came in with a little tray A picture post card was deposited on it and reverently bowing his head the manager of the pension carried it to the Baron Myself I felt disappointed that there was not a salute of twenty five guns At the end of the meal we were served with coffee I noticed the Baron took three lumps of sugar putting two in his cup and wrapping up the third in a corner of his pocket handkerchief He was always the first to enter the dining room and the last to leave and in a vacant chair beside him he placed a little black leather bag In the afternoon leaning from my window I saw him pass down the street walking tremulously and carrying the bag Each time he passed a lamp post he shrank a little as though expecting it to strike him or maybe the sense of plebeian contamination I wondered where he was going and why he carried the bag Never had I seen him at the Casino or the Bath Establishment He looked forlorn his feet slipped in his sandals I found myself pitying the Baron That evening a party of us were gathered in the salon discussing the day s kur with feverish animation The Frau Oberregierungsrat sat by me knitting a shawl for her youngest of nine daughters who was in that very interesting frail condition But it is bound to be quite satisfactory she said to me The dear married a banker the desire of her life There must have been eight or ten of us gathered together we who were married exchanging confidences as to the underclothing and peculiar characteristics of our husbands the unmarried discussing the over clothing and peculiar fascinations of Possible Ones I knit them myself I heard the Frau Lehrer cry of thick grey wool He wears one a month with two soft collars And then whispered Fraulein Lisa he said to me Indeed you please me I shall perhaps write to your mother Small wonder that we were a little violently excited a little expostulatory Suddenly the door opened and admitted the Baron Followed a complete and deathlike silence He came in slowly hesitated took up a toothpick from a dish on the top of the piano and went out again When the door was closed we raised a triumphant cry It was the first time he had ever been known to enter the salon Who could tell what the Future held Days lengthened into weeks Still we were together and still the solitary little figure head bowed as though under the weight of the spectacles haunted me He entered with the black bag he retired with the black bag and that was all At last the manager of the pension told us the Baron was leaving the next day Oh I thought surely he cannot drift into obscurity be lost without one word Surely he will honour the Frau Oberregierungsrat of the Frau Feldleutnantswitwe ONCE before he goes In the evening of that day it rained heavily I went to the post office and as I stood on the steps umbrellaless hesitating before plunging into the slushy road a little hesitating voice seemed to come from under my elbow I looked down It was the First of the Barons with the black bag and an umbrella Was I mad Was I sane He was asking me to share the latter But I was exceedingly nice a trifle diffident appropriately reverential Together we walked through the mud and slush Now there is something peculiarly intimate in sharing an umbrella It is apt to put one on the same footing as brushing a man s coat for him a little daring naive I longed to know why he sat alone why he carried the bag what he did all day But he himself volunteered some information I fear he said that my luggage will be damp I invariably carry it with me in this bag one requires so little for servants are untrustworthy A wise idea I answered And then Why have you denied us the pleasure I sit alone that I may eat more said the Baron peering into the dusk my stomach requires a great deal of food I order double portions and eat them in peace Which sounded finely Baronial And what do you do all day I imbibe nourishment in my room he replied in a voice that closed the conversation and almost repented of the umbrella When we arrived at the pension there was very nearly an open riot I ran half way up the stairs and thanked the Baron audibly from the landing He distinctly replied Not at all It was very friendly of the Herr Oberlehrer to have sent me a bouquet that evening and the Frau Oberregierungsrat asked me for my pattern of a baby s bonnet Next day the Baron was gone Sic transit gloria German mundi three THE SISTER OF THE BARONESS There are two new guests arriving this afternoon said the manager of the pension placing a chair for me at the breakfast table I have only received the letter acquainting me with the fact this morning The Baroness von Gall is sending her little daughter the poor child is dumb to make the cure She is to stay with us a month and then the Baroness herself is coming Baroness von Gall cried the Frau Doktor coming into the room and positively scenting the name Coming here There was a picture of her only last week in Sport and Salon She is a friend of the court I have heard that the Kaiserin says du to her But this is delightful I shall take my doctor s advice and spend an extra six weeks here There is nothing like young society But the child is dumb ventured the manager apologetically Bah What does that matter Afflicted children have such pretty ways Each guest who came into the breakfast room was bombarded with the wonderful news The Baroness von Gall is sending her little daughter here the Baroness herself is coming in a month s time Coffee and rolls took on the nature of an orgy We positively scintillated Anecdotes of the High Born were poured out sweetened and sipped we gorged on scandals of High Birth generously buttered They are to have the room next to yours said the manager addressing me I was wondering if you would permit me to take down the portrait of the Kaiserin Elizabeth from above your bed to hang over their sofa Yes indeed something homelike the Frau Oberregierungsrat patted my hand and of no possible significance to you I felt a little crushed Not at the prospect of losing that vision of diamonds and blue velvet bust but at the tone placing me outside the pale branding me as a foreigner We dissipated the day in valid speculations Decided it was too warm to walk in the afternoon so lay down on our beds mustering in great force for afternoon coffee And a carriage drew up at the door A tall young girl got out leading a child by the hand They entered the hall were greeted and shown to their room Ten minutes later she came down with the child to sign the visitors book She wore a black closely fitting dress touched at throat and wrists with white frilling Her brown hair braided was tied with a black bow unusually pale with a small mole on her left cheek I am the Baroness von Gall s sister she said trying the pen on a piece of blotting paper and smiling at us deprecatingly Even for the most jaded of us life holds its thrilling moments Two Baronesses in two months The manager immediately left the room to find a new nib To my plebeian eyes that afflicted child was singularly unattractive She had the air of having been perpetually washed with a blue bag and hair like grey wool dressed too in a pinafore so stiffly starched that she could only peer at us over the frill of it a social barrier of a pinafore and perhaps it was too much to expect a noble aunt to attend to the menial consideration of her niece s ears But a dumb niece with unwashed ears struck me as a most depressing object They were given places at the head of the table For a moment we all looked at one another with an eena deena dina do expression Then the Frau Oberregierungsrat I hope you are not tired after your journey No said the sister of the Baroness smiling into her cup I hope the dear child is not tired said the Frau Doktor Not at all I expect I hope you will sleep well to night the Herr Oberlehrer said reverently Yes The poet from Munich never took his eyes off the pair He allowed his tie to absorb most of his coffee while he gazed at them exceedingly soulfully Unyoking Pegasus thought I Death spasms of his Odes to Solitude There were possibilities in that young woman for an inspiration not to mention a dedication and from that moment his suffering temperament took up its bed and walked They retired after the meal leaving us to discuss them at leisure There is a likeness mused the Frau Doktor Quite What a manner she has Such reserve such a tender way with the child Pity she has the child to attend to exclaimed the student from Bonn He had hitherto relied upon three scars and a ribbon to produce an effect but the sister of a Baroness demanded more than these Absorbing days followed Had she been one whit less beautifully born we could not have endured the continual conversation about her the songs in her praise the detailed account of her movements But she graciously suffered our worship and we were more than content The poet she took into her confidence He carried her books when we went walking he jumped the afflicted one on his knee poetic licence this and one morning brought his notebook into the salon and read to us The sister of the Baroness has assured me she is going into a convent he said That made the student from Bonn sit up I have written these few lines last night from my window in the sweet night air Oh your DELICATE chest commented the Frau Doktor He fixed a stony eye on her and she blushed I have written these lines Ah will you to a convent fly So young so fresh so fair Spring like a doe upon the fields And find your beauty there Nine verses equally lovely commanded her to equally violent action I am certain that had she followed his advice not even the remainder of her life in a convent would have given her time to recover her breath I have presented her with a copy he said And to day we are going to look for wild flowers in the wood The student from Bonn got up and left the room I begged the poet to repeat the verses once more At the end of the sixth verse I saw from the window the sister of the Baroness and the scarred youth disappearing through the front gate which enabled me to thank the poet so charmingly that he offered to write me out a copy But we were living at too high pressure in those days Swinging from our humble pension to the high walls of palaces how could we help but fall Late one afternoon the Frau Doktor came upon me in the writing room and took me to her bosom She has been telling me all about her life whispered the Frau Doktor She came to my bedroom and offered to massage my arm You know I am the greatest martyr to rheumatism And fancy now she has already had six proposals of marriage Such beautiful offers that I assure you I wept and every one of noble birth My dear the most beautiful was in the wood Not that I do not think a proposal should take place in a drawing room it is more fitting to have four walls but this was a private wood He said the young officer she was like a young tree whose branches had never been touched by the ruthless hand of man Such delicacy She sighed and turned up her eyes Of course it is difficult for you English to understand when you are always exposing your legs on cricket fields and breeding dogs in your back gardens The pity of it Youth should be like a wild rose For myself I do not understand how your women ever get married at all She shook her head so violently that I shook mine too and a gloom settled round my heart It seemed we were really in a very bad way Did the spirit of romance spread her rose wings only over aristocratic Germany I went to my room bound a pink scarf about my hair and took a volume of Morike s lyrics into the garden A great bush of purple lilac grew behind the summer house There I sat down finding a sad significance in the delicate suggestion of half mourning I began to write a poem myself They sway and languish dreamily And we close pressed are kissing there It ended Close pressed did not sound at all fascinating Savoured of wardrobes Did my wild rose then already trail in the dust I chewed a leaf and hugged my knees Then magic moment I heard voices from the summer house the sister of the Baroness and the student from Bonn Second hand was better than nothing I pricked up my ears What small hands you have said the student from Bonn They are like white lilies lying in the pool of your black dress This certainly sounded the real thing Her high born reply was what interested me Sympathetic murmur only May I hold one I heard two sighs presumed they held he had rifled those dark waters of a noble blossom Look at my great fingers beside yours But they are beautifully kept said the sister of the Baroness shyly The minx Was love then a question of manicure How I should adore to kiss you murmured the student But you know I am suffering from severe nasal catarrh and I dare not risk giving it to you Sixteen times last night did I count myself sneezing And three different handkerchiefs I threw Morike into the lilac bush and went back to the house A great automobile snorted at the front door In the salon great commotion The Baroness was paying a surprise visit to her little daughter Clad in a yellow mackintosh she stood in the middle of the room questioning the manager And every guest the pension contained was grouped about her even the Frau Doktor presumably examining a timetable as near to the august skirts as possible But where is my maid asked the Baroness There was no maid replied the manager save for your gracious sister and daughter Sister she cried sharply Fool I have no sister My child travelled with the daughter of my dressmaker Tableau grandissimo four FRAU FISCHER Frau Fischer was the fortunate possessor of a candle factory somewhere on the banks of the Eger and once a year she ceased from her labours to make a cure in Dorschausen arriving with a dress basket neatly covered in a black tarpaulin and a hand bag The latter contained amongst her handkerchiefs eau de Cologne toothpicks and a certain woollen muffler very comforting to the magen samples of her skill in candle making to be offered up as tokens of thanksgiving when her holiday time was over Four of the clock one July afternoon she appeared at the Pension Muller I was sitting in the arbour and watched her bustling up the path followed by the red bearded porter with her dress basket in his arms and a sunflower between his teeth The widow and her five innocent daughters stood tastefully grouped upon the steps in appropriate attitudes of welcome and the greetings were so long and loud that I felt a sympathetic glow What a journey cried the Frau Fischer And nothing to eat in the train nothing solid I assure you the sides of my stomach are flapping together But I must not spoil my appetite for dinner just a cup of coffee in my room Bertha turning to the youngest of the five how changed What a bust Frau Hartmann I congratulate you Once again the Widow seized Frau Fischer s hands Kathi too a splendid woman but a little pale Perhaps the young man from Nurnberg is here again this year How you keep them all I don t know Each year I come expecting to find you with an empty nest It s surprising Frau Hartmann in an ashamed apologetic voice We are such a happy family since my dear man died But these marriages one must have courage and after all give them time they all make the happy family bigger thank God for that Are there many people here just now Every room engaged Followed a detailed description in the hall murmured on the stairs continued in six parts as they entered the large room windows opening upon the garden which Frau Fischer occupied each successive year I was reading the Miracles of Lourdes which a Catholic priest fixing a gloomy eye upon my soul had begged me to digest but its wonders were completely routed by Frau Fischer s arrival Not even the white roses upon the feet of the Virgin could flourish in that atmosphere It was a simple shepherd child who pastured her flocks upon the barren fields Voices from the room above The washstand has of course been scrubbed over with soda Poverty stricken her limbs with tattered rags half covered Every stick of the furniture has been sunning in the garden for three days And the carpet we made ourselves out of old clothes There is a piece of that beautiful flannel petticoat you left us last summer Deaf and dumb was the child in fact the population considered her half idiot Yes that is a new picture of the Kaiser We have moved the thorn crowned one of Jesus Christ out into the passage It was not cheerful to sleep with Dear Frau Fischer won t you take your coffee out in the garden That is a very nice idea But first I must remove my corsets and my boots Ah what a relief to wear sandals again I am needing the cure very badly this year My nerves I am a mass of them During the entire journey I sat with my handkerchief over my head even while the guard collected the tickets Exhausted She came into the arbour wearing a black and white spotted dressing gown and a calico cap peaked with patent leather followed by Kathi carrying the little blue jugs of malt coffee We were formally introduced Frau Fischer sat down produced a perfectly clean pocket handkerchief and polished her cup and saucer then lifted the lid of the coffee pot and peered in at the contents mournfully Malt coffee she said Ah for the first few days I wonder how I can put up with it Naturally absent from home one must expect much discomfort and strange food But as I used to say to my dear husband with a clean sheet and a good cup of coffee I can find my happiness anywhere But now with nerves like mine no sacrifice is too terrible for me to make What complaint are you suffering from You look exceedingly healthy I smiled and shrugged my shoulders Ah that is so strange about you English You do not seem to enjoy discussing the functions of the body As well speak of a railway train and refuse to mention the engine How can we hope to understand anybody knowing nothing of their stomachs In my husband s most severe illness the poultices She dipped a piece of sugar in her coffee and watched it dissolve Yet a young friend of mine who travelled to England for the funeral of his brother told me that women wore bodices in public restaurants no waiter could help looking into as he handed the soup But only German waiters I said English ones look over the top of your head There she cried now you see your dependence on Germany Not even an efficient waiter can you have by yourselves But I prefer them to look over your head And that proves that you must be ashamed of your bodice I looked out over the garden full of wall flowers and standard rose trees growing stiffly like German bouquets feeling I did not care one way or the other I rather wanted to ask her if the young friend had gone to England in the capacity of waiter to attend the funeral baked meats but decided it was not worth it The weather was too hot to be malicious and who could be uncharitable victimised by the flapping sensations which Frau Fischer was enduring until six thirty As a gift from heaven for my forbearance down the path towards us came the Herr Rat angelically clad in a white silk suit He and Frau Fischer were old friends She drew the folds of her dressing gown together and made room for him on the little green bench How cool you are looking she said and if I may make the remark what a beautiful suit Surely I wore it last summer when you were here I brought the silk from China smuggled it through the Russian customs by swathing it round my body And such a quantity two dress lengths for my sister in law three suits for myself a cloak for the housekeeper of my flat in Munich How I perspired Every inch of it had to be washed afterwards Surely you have had more adventures than any man in Germany When I think of the time that you spent in Turkey with a drunken guide who was bitten by a mad dog and fell over a precipice into a field of attar of roses I lament that you have not written a book Time time I am getting a few notes together And now that you are here we shall renew our quiet little talks after supper Yes It is necessary and pleasant for a man to find relaxation in the company of women occasionally Indeed I realise that Even here your life is too strenuous you are so sought after so admired It was just the same with my dear husband He was a tall beautiful man and sometimes in the evening he would come down into the kitchen and say Wife I would like to be stupid for two minutes Nothing rested him so much then as for me to stroke his head The Herr Rat s bald pate glistening in the sunlight seemed symbolical of the sad absence of a wife I began to wonder as to the nature of these quiet little after supper talks How could one play Delilah to so shorn a Samson Herr Hoffmann from Berlin arrived yesterday said the Herr Rat That young man I refuse to converse with He told me last year that he had stayed in France in an hotel where they did not have serviettes what a place it must have been In Austria even the cabmen have serviettes Also I have heard that he discussed free love with Bertha as she was sweeping his room I am not accustomed to such company I had suspected him for a long time Young blood answered the Herr Rat genially I have had several disputes with him you have heard them is it not so turning to me A great many I said smiling Doubtless you too consider me behind the times I make no secret of my age I am sixty nine but you must have surely observed how impossible it was for him to speak at all when I raised my voice I replied with the utmost conviction and catching Frau Fischer s eye suddenly realised I had better go back to the house and write some letters It was dark and cool in my room A chestnut tree pushed green boughs against the window I looked down at the horsehair sofa so openly flouting the idea of curling up as immoral pulled the red pillow on to the floor and lay down And barely had I got comfortable when the door opened and Frau Fischer entered The Herr Rat had a bathing appointment she said shutting the door after her May I come in Pray do not move You look like a little Persian kitten Now tell me something really interesting about your life When I meet new people I squeeze them dry like a sponge To begin with you are married I admit the fact Then dear child where is your husband I said he was a sea captain on a long and perilous voyage What a position to leave you in so young and so unprotected She sat down on the sofa and shook her finger at me playfully Admit now that you keep your journeys secret from him For what man would think of allowing a woman with such a wealth of hair to go wandering in foreign countries Now supposing that you lost your purse at midnight in a snowbound train in North Russia But I haven t the slightest intention I began I don t say that you have But when you said good bye to your dear man I am positive that you had no intention of coming here My dear I am a woman of experience and I know the world While he is away you have a fever in your blood Your sad heart flies for comfort to these foreign lands At home you cannot bear the sight of that empty bed it is like widowhood Since the death of my dear husband I have never known an hour s peace I like empty beds I protested sleepily thumping the pillow That cannot be true because it is not natural Every wife ought to feel that her place is by her husband s side sleeping or waking It is plain to see that the strongest tie of all does not yet bind you Wait until a little pair of hands stretches across the water wait until he comes into harbour and sees you with the child at your breast I sat up stiffly But I consider child bearing the most ignominious of all professions I said For a moment there was silence Then Frau Fischer reached down and caught my hand So young and yet to suffer so cruelly she murmured There is nothing that sours a woman so terribly as to be left alone without a man especially if she is married for then it is impossible for her to accept the attention of others unless she is unfortunately a widow Of course I know that sea captains are subject to terrible temptations and they are as inflammable as tenor singers that is why you must present a bright and energetic appearance and try and make him proud of you when his ship reaches port This husband that I had created for the benefit of Frau Fischer became in her hands so substantial a figure that I could no longer see myself sitting on a rock with seaweed in my hair awaiting that phantom ship for which all women love to suppose they hunger Rather I saw myself pushing a perambulator up the gangway and counting up the missing buttons on my husband s uniform jacket Handfuls of babies that is what you are really in need of mused Frau Fischer Then as the father of a family he cannot leave you Think of his delight and excitement when he saw you The plan seemed to me something of a risk To appear suddenly with handfuls of strange babies is not generally calculated to raise enthusiasm in the heart of the average British husband I decided to wreck my virgin conception and send him down somewhere off Cape Horn Then the dinner gong sounded Come up to my room afterwards said Frau Fischer There is still much that I must ask you She squeezed my hand but I did not squeeze back five FRAU BRECHENMACHER ATTENDS A WEDDING Getting ready was a terrible business After supper Frau Brechenmacher packed four of the five babies to bed allowing Rosa to stay with her and help to polish the buttons of Herr Brechenmacher s uniform Then she ran over his best shirt with a hot iron polished his boots and put a stitch or two into his black satin necktie Rosa she said fetch my dress and hang it in front of the stove to get the creases out Now mind you must look after the children and not sit up later than half past eight and not touch the lamp you know what will happen if you do Yes Mamma said Rosa who was nine and felt old enough to manage a thousand lamps But let me stay up the Bub may wake and want some milk Half past eight said the Frau I ll make the father tell you too Rosa drew down the corners of her mouth But but Here comes the father You go into the bedroom and fetch my blue silk handkerchief You can wear my black shawl while I m out there now Rosa dragged it off her mother s shoulders and wound it carefully round her own tying the two ends in a knot at the back After all she reflected if she had to go to bed at half past eight she would keep the shawl on Which resolution comforted her absolutely Now then where are my clothes cried Herr Brechenmacher hanging his empty letter bag behind the door and stamping the snow out of his boots Nothing ready of course and everybody at the wedding by this time I heard the music as I passed What are you doing You re not dressed You can t go like that Here they are all ready for you on the table and some warm water in the tin basin Dip your head in Rosa give your father the towel Everything ready except the trousers I haven t had time to shorten them You must tuck the ends into your boots until we get there Nu said the Herr there isn t room to turn I want the light You go and dress in the passage Dressing in the dark was nothing to Frau Brechenmacher She hooked her skirt and bodice fastened her handkerchief round her neck with a beautiful brooch that had four medals to the Virgin dangling from it and then drew on her cloak and hood Here come and fasten this buckle called Herr Brechenmacher He stood in the kitchen puffing himself out the buttons on his blue uniform shining with an enthusiasm which nothing but official buttons could possibly possess How do I look Wonderful replied the little Frau straining at the waist buckle and giving him a little pull here a little tug there Rosa come and look at your father Herr Brechenmacher strode up and down the kitchen was helped on with his coat then waited while the Frau lighted the lantern Now then finished at last Come along The lamp Rosa warned the Frau slamming the front door behind them Snow had not fallen all day the frozen ground was slippery as an icepond She had not been out of the house for weeks past and the day had so flurried her that she felt muddled and stupid felt that Rosa had pushed her out of the house and her man was running away from her Wait wait she cried No I ll get my feet damp you hurry It was easier when they came into the village There were fences to cling to and leading from the railway station to the Gasthaus a little path of cinders had been strewn for the benefit of the wedding guests The Gasthaus was very festive Lights shone out from every window wreaths of fir twigs hung from the ledges Branches decorated the front doors which swung open and in the hall the landlord voiced his superiority by bullying the waitresses who ran about continually with glasses of beer trays of cups and saucers and bottles of wine Up the stairs up the stairs boomed the landlord Leave your coats on the landing Herr Brechenmacher completely overawed by this grand manner so far forgot his rights as a husband as to beg his wife s pardon for jostling her against the banisters in his efforts to get ahead of everybody else Herr Brechenmacher s colleagues greeted him with acclamation as he entered the door of the Festsaal and the Frau straightened her brooch and folded her hands assuming the air of dignity becoming to the wife of a postman and the mother of five children Beautiful indeed was the Festsaal Three long tables were grouped at one end the remainder of the floor space cleared for dancing Oil lamps hanging from the ceiling shed a warm bright light on the walls decorated with paper flowers and garlands shed a warmer brighter light on the red faces of the guests in their best clothes At the head of the centre table sat the bride and bridegroom she in a white dress trimmed with stripes and bows of coloured ribbon giving her the appearance of an iced cake all ready to be cut and served in neat little pieces to the bridegroom beside her who wore a suit of white clothes much too large for him and a white silk tie that rose halfway up his collar Grouped about them with a fine regard for dignity and precedence sat their parents and relations and perched on a stool at the bride s right hand a little girl in a crumpled muslin dress with a wreath of forget me nots hanging over one ear Everybody was laughing and talking shaking hands clinking glasses stamping on the floor a stench of beer and perspiration filled the air Frau Brechenmacher following her man down the room after greeting the bridal party knew that she was going to enjoy herself She seemed to fill out and become rosy and warm as she sniffed that familiar festive smell Somebody pulled at her skirt and looking down she saw Frau Rupp the butcher s wife who pulled out an empty chair and begged her to sit beside her Fritz will get you some beer she said My dear your skirt is open at the back We could not help laughing as you walked up the room with the white tape of your petticoat showing But how frightful said Frau Brechenmacher collapsing into her chair and biting her lip Na it s over now said Frau Rupp stretching her fat hands over the table and regarding her three mourning rings with intense enjoyment but one must be careful especially at a wedding And such a wedding as this cried Frau Ledermann who sat on the other side of Frau Brechenmacher Fancy Theresa bringing that child with her It s her own child you know my dear and it s going to live with them That s what I call a sin against the Church for a free born child to attend its own mother s wedding The three women sat and stared at the bride who remained very still with a little vacant smile on her lips only her eyes shifting uneasily from side to side Beer they ve given it too whispered Frau Rupp and white wine and an ice It never did have a stomach she ought to have left it at home Frau Brechenmacher turned round and looked towards the bride s mother She never took her eyes off her daughter but wrinkled her brown forehead like an old monkey and nodded now and again very solemnly Her hands shook as she raised her beer mug and when she had drunk she spat on the floor and savagely wiped her mouth with her sleeve Then the music started and she followed Theresa with her eyes looking suspiciously at each man who danced with her Cheer up old woman shouted her husband digging her in the ribs this isn t Theresa s funeral He winked at the guests who broke into loud laughter I AM cheerful mumbled the old woman and beat upon the table with her fist keeping time to the music proving she was not out of the festivities She can t forget how wild Theresa has been said Frau Ledermann Who could with the child there I heard that last Sunday evening Theresa had hysterics and said that she would not marry this man They had to get the priest to her Where is the other one asked Frau Brechenmacher Why didn t he marry her The woman shrugged her shoulders Gone disappeared He was a traveller and only stayed at their house two nights He was selling shirt buttons I bought some myself and they were beautiful shirt buttons but what a pig of a fellow I can t think what he saw in such a plain girl but you never know Her mother says she s been like fire ever since she was sixteen Frau Brechenmacher looked down at her beer and blew a little hole in the froth That s not how a wedding should be she said it s not religion to love two men Nice time she ll have with this one Frau Rupp exclaimed He was lodging with me last summer and I had to get rid of him He never changed his clothes once in two months and when I spoke to him of the smell in his room he told me he was sure it floated up from the shop Ah every wife has her cross Isn t that true my dear Frau Brechenmacher saw her husband among his colleagues at the next table He was drinking far too much she knew gesticulating wildly the saliva spluttering out of his mouth as he talked Yes she assented that s true Girls have a lot to learn Wedged in between these two fat old women the Frau had no hope of being asked to dance She watched the couples going round and round she forgot her five babies and her man and felt almost like a girl again The music sounded sad and sweet Her roughened hands clasped and unclasped themselves in the folds of her skirt While the music went on she was afraid to look anybody in the face and she smiled with a little nervous tremor round the mouth But my God Frau Rupp cried they ve given that child of Theresa s a piece of sausage It s to keep her quiet There s going to be a presentation now your man has to speak Frau Brechenmacher sat up stiffly The music ceased and the dancers took their places again at the tables Herr Brechenmacher alone remained standing he held in his hands a big silver coffee pot Everybody laughed at his speech except the Frau everybody roared at his grimaces and at the way he carried the coffee pot to the bridal pair as if it were a baby he was holding She lifted the lid peeped in then shut it down with a little scream and sat biting her lips The bridegroom wrenched the pot away from her and drew forth a baby s bottle and two little cradles holding china dolls As he dandled these treasures before Theresa the hot room seemed to heave and sway with laughter Frau Brechenmacher did not think it funny She stared round at the laughing faces and suddenly they all seemed strange to her She wanted to go home and never come out again She imagined that all these people were laughing at her more people than there were in the room even all laughing at her because they were so much stronger than she was They walked home in silence Herr Brechenmacher strode ahead she stumbled after him White and forsaken lay the road from the railway station to their house a cold rush of wind blew her hood from her face and suddenly she remembered how they had come home together the first night Now they had five babies and twice as much money BUT Na what is it all for she muttered and not until she had reached home and prepared a little supper of meat and bread for her man did she stop asking herself that silly question Herr Brechenmacher broke the bread into his plate smeared it round with his fork and chewed greedily Good she asked leaning her arms on the table and pillowing her breast against them But fine He took a piece of the crumb wiped it round his plate edge and held it up to her mouth She shook her head Not hungry she said But it is one of the best pieces and full of the fat He cleared the plate then pulled off his boots and flung them into a corner Not much of a wedding he said stretching out his feet and wriggling his toes in the worsted socks N no she replied taking up the discarded boots and placing them on the oven to dry Herr Brechenmacher yawned and stretched himself and then looked up at her grinning Remember the night that we came home You were an innocent one you were Get along Such a time ago I forget Well she remembered Such a clout on the ear as you gave me But I soon taught you Oh don t start talking You ve too much beer Come to bed He tilted back in his chair chuckling with laughter That s not what you said to me that night God the trouble you gave me But the little Frau seized the candle and went into the next room The children were all soundly sleeping She stripped the mattress off the baby s bed to see if he was still dry then began unfastening her blouse and skirt Always the same she said all over the world the same but God in heaven but STUPID Then even the memory of the wedding faded quite She lay down on the bed and put her arm across her face like a child who expected to be hurt as Herr Brechenmacher lurched in six THE MODERN SOUL Good evening said the Herr Professor squeezing my hand wonderful weather I have just returned from a party in the wood I have been making music for them on my trombone You know these pine trees provide most suitable accompaniment for a trombone They are sighing delicacy against sustained strength as I remarked once in a lecture on wind instruments in Frankfort May I be permitted to sit beside you on this bench gnadige Frau He sat down tugging at a white paper package in the tail pocket of his coat Cherries he said nodding and smiling There is nothing like cherries for producing free saliva after trombone playing especially after Grieg s Ich Liebe Dich Those sustained blasts on liebe make my throat as dry as a railway tunnel Have some He shook the bag at me I prefer watching you eat them Ah ha He crossed his legs sticking the cherry bag between his knees to leave both hands free Psychologically I understood your refusal It is your innate feminine delicacy in preferring etherealised sensations Or perhaps you do not care to eat the worms All cherries contain worms Once I made a very interesting experiment with a colleague of mine at the university We bit into four pounds of the best cherries and did not find one specimen without a worm But what would you As I remarked to him afterwards dear friend it amounts to this if one wishes to satisfy the desires of nature one must be strong enough to ignore the facts of nature The conversation is not out of your depth I have so seldom the time or opportunity to open my heart to a woman that I am apt to forget I looked at him brightly See what a fat one cried the Herr Professor That is almost a mouthful in itself it is beautiful enough to hang from a watch chain He chewed it up and spat the stone an incredible distance over the garden path into the flower bed He was proud of the feat I saw it The quantity of fruit I have eaten on this bench he sighed apricots peaches and cherries One day that garden bed will become an orchard grove and I shall allow you to pick as much as you please without paying me anything I was grateful without showing undue excitement Which reminds me he hit the side of his nose with one finger the manager of the pension handed me my weekly bill after dinner this evening It is almost impossible to credit I do not expect you to believe me he has charged me extra for a miserable little glass of milk I drink in bed at night to prevent insomnia Naturally I did not pay But the tragedy of the story is this I cannot expect the milk to produce somnolence any longer my peaceful attitude of mind towards it is completely destroyed I know I shall throw myself into a fever in attempting to plumb this want of generosity in so wealthy a man as the manager of a pension Think of me to night he ground the empty bag under his heel think that the worst is happening to me as your head drops asleep on your pillow Two ladies came on the front steps of the pension and stood arm in arm looking over the garden The one old and scraggy dressed almost entirely in black bead trimming and a satin reticule the other young and thin in a white gown her yellow hair tastefully garnished with mauve sweet peas The Professor drew in his feet and sat up sharply pulling down his waistcoat The Godowskas he murmured Do you know them A mother and daughter from Vienna The mother has an internal complaint and the daughter is an actress Fraulein Sonia is a very modern soul I think you would find her most sympathetic She is forced to be in attendance on her mother just now But what a temperament I have once described her in her autograph album as a tigress with a flower in the hair Will you excuse me Perhaps I can persuade them to be introduced to you I said I am going up to my room But the Professor rose and shook a playful finger at me Na he said we are friends and therefore I shall speak quite frankly to you I think they would consider it a little marked if you immediately retired to the house at their approach after sitting here alone with me in the twilight You know this world Yes you know it as I do I shrugged my shoulders remarking with one eye that while the Professor had been talking the Godowskas had trailed across the lawn towards us They confronted the Herr Professor as he stood up Good evening quavered Frau Godowska Wonderful weather It has given me quite a touch of hay fever Fraulein Godowska said nothing She swooped over a rose growing in the embryo orchard then stretched out her hand with a magnificent gesture to the Herr Professor He presented me This is my little English friend of whom I have spoken She is the stranger in our midst We have been eating cherries together How delightful sighed Frau Godowska My daughter and I have often observed you through the bedroom window Haven t we Sonia Sonia absorbed my outward and visible form with an inward and spiritual glance then repeated the magnificent gesture for my benefit The four of us sat on the bench with that faint air of excitement of passengers established in a railway carriage on the qui vive for the train whistle Frau Godowska sneezed I wonder if it is hay fever she remarked worrying the satin reticule for her handkerchief or would it be the dew Sonia dear is the dew falling Fraulein Sonia raised her face to the sky and half closed her eyes No mamma my face is quite warm Oh look Herr Professor there are swallows in flight they are like a little flock of Japanese thoughts nicht wahr Where cried the Herr Professor Oh yes I see by the kitchen chimney But why do you say Japanese Could you not compare them with equal veracity to a little flock of German thoughts in flight He rounded on me Have you swallows in England I believe there are some at certain seasons But doubtless they have not the same symbolical value for the English In Germany I have never been to England interrupted Fraulein Sonia but I have many English acquaintances They are so cold She shivered Fish blooded snapped Frau Godowska Without soul without heart without grace But you cannot equal their dress materials I spent a week in Brighton twenty years ago and the travelling cape I bought there is not yet worn out the one you wrap the hot water bottle in Sonia My lamented husband your father Sonia knew a great deal about England But the more he knew about it the oftener he remarked to me England is merely an island of beef flesh swimming in a warm gulf sea of gravy Such a brilliant way of putting things Do you remember Sonia I forget nothing mamma answered Sonia Said the Herr Professor That is the proof of your calling gnadiges Fraulein Now I wonder and this is a very interesting speculation is memory a blessing or excuse the word a curse Frau Godowska looked into the distance then the corners of her mouth dropped and her skin puckered She began to shed tears Ach Gott Gracious lady what have I said exclaimed the Herr Professor Sonia took her mother s hand Do you know she said to night it is stewed carrots and nut tart for supper Suppose we go in and take our places her sidelong tragic stare accusing the Professor and me the while I followed them across the lawn and up the steps Frau Godowska was murmuring Such a wonderful beloved man with her disengaged hand Fraulein Sonia was arranging the sweet pea garniture A concert for the benefit of afflicted Catholic infants will take place in the salon at eight thirty P M Artists Fraulein Sonia Godowska from Vienna Herr Professor Windberg and his trombone Frau Oberlehrer Weidel and others This notice was tied round the neck of the melancholy stag s head in the dining room It graced him like a red and white dinner bib for days before the event causing the Herr Professor to bow before it and say good appetite until we sickened of his pleasantry and left the smiling to be done by the waiter who was paid to be pleasing to the guests On the appointed day the married ladies sailed about the pension dressed like upholstered chairs and the unmarried ladies like draped muslin dressing table covers Frau Godowska pinned a rose in the centre of her reticule another blossom was tucked in the mazy folds of a white antimacassar thrown across her breast The gentlemen wore black coats white silk ties and ferny buttonholes tickling the chin The floor of the salon was freshly polished chairs and benches arranged and a row of little flags strung across the ceiling they flew and jigged in the draught with all the enthusiasm of family washing It was arranged that I should sit beside Frau Godowska and that the Herr Professor and Sonia should join us when their share of the concert was over That will make you feel quite one of the performers said the Herr Professor genially It is a great pity that the English nation is so unmusical Never mind To night you shall hear something we have discovered a nest of talent during the rehearsals What do you intend to recite Fraulein Sonia She shook back her hair I never know until the last moment When I come on the stage I wait for one moment and then I have the sensation as though something struck me here she placed her hand upon her collar brooch and words come Bend down a moment whispered her mother Sonia love your skirt safety pin is showing at the back Shall I come outside and fasten it properly for you or will you do it yourself Oh mamma please don t say such things Sonia flushed and grew very angry You know how sensitive I am to the slightest unsympathetic impression at a time like this I would rather my skirt dropped off my body Sonia my heart A bell tinkled The waiter came in and opened the piano In the heated excitement of the moment he entirely forgot what was fitting and flicked the keys with the grimy table napkin he carried over his arm The Frau Oberlehrer tripped on the platform followed by a very young gentleman who blew his nose twice before he hurled his handkerchief into the bosom of the piano Yes I know you have no love for me And no forget me not No love no heart and no forget me not sang the Frau Oberlehrer in a voice that seemed to issue from her forgotten thimble and have nothing to do with her Ach how sweet how delicate we cried clapping her soothingly She bowed as though to say Yes isn t it and retired the very young gentleman dodging her train and scowling The piano was closed an arm chair was placed in the centre of the platform Fraulein Sonia drifted towards it A breathless pause Then presumably the winged shaft struck her collar brooch She implored us not to go into the woods in trained dresses but rather as lightly draped as possible and bed with her among the pine needles Her loud slightly harsh voice filled the salon She dropped her arms over the back of the chair moving her lean hands from the wrists We were thrilled and silent The Herr Professor beside me abnormally serious his eyes bulging pulled at his moustache ends Frau Godowska adopted that peculiarly detached attitude of the proud parent The only soul who remained untouched by her appeal was the waiter who leaned idly against the wall of the salon and cleaned his nails with the edge of a programme He was off duty and intended to show it What did I say shouted the Herr Professor under cover of tumultuous applause tem per ament There you have it She is a flame in the heart of a lily I know I am going to play well It is my turn now I am inspired Fraulein Sonia as that lady returned to us pale and draped in a large shawl you are my inspiration To night you shall be the soul of my trombone Wait only To right and left of us people bent over and whispered admiration down Fraulein Sonia s neck She bowed in the grand style I am always successful she said to me You see when I act I AM In Vienna in the plays of Ibsen we had so many bouquets that the cook had three in the kitchen But it is difficult here There is so little magic Do you not feel it There is none of that mysterious perfume which floats almost as a visible thing from the souls of the Viennese audiences My spirit starves for want of that She leaned forward chin on hand Starves she repeated The Professor appeared with his trombone blew into it held it up to one eye tucked back his shirt cuffs and wallowed in the soul of Sonia Godowska Such a sensation did he create that he was recalled to play a Bavarian dance which he acknowledged was to be taken as a breathing exercise rather than an artistic achievement Frau Godowska kept time to it with a fan Followed the very young gentleman who piped in a tenor voice that he loved somebody with blood in his heart and a thousand pains Fraulein Sonia acted a poison scene with the assistance of her mother s pill vial and the arm chair replaced by a chaise longue a young girl scratched a lullaby on a young fiddle and the Herr Professor performed the last sacrificial rites on the altar of the afflicted children by playing the National Anthem Now I must put mamma to bed whispered Fraulein Sonia But afterwards I must take a walk It is imperative that I free my spirit in the open air for a moment Would you come with me as far as the railway station and back Very well then knock on my door when you re ready Thus the modern soul and I found ourselves together under the stars What a night she said Do you know that poem of Sappho about her hands in the stars I am curiously sapphic And this is so remarkable not only am I sapphic I find in all the works of all the greatest writers especially in their unedited letters some touch some sign of myself some resemblance some part of myself like a thousand reflections of my own hands in a dark mirror But what a bother said I I do not know what you mean by bother is it rather the curse of my genius She paused suddenly staring at me Do you know my tragedy she asked I shook my head My tragedy is my mother Living with her I live with the coffin of my unborn aspirations You heard that about the safety pin to night It may seem to you a little thing but it ruined my three first gestures They were Impaled on a safety pin I suggested Yes exactly that And when we are in Vienna I am the victim of moods you know I long to do wild passionate things And mamma says Please pour out my mixture first Once I remember I flew into a rage and threw a washstand jug out of the window Do you know what she said Sonia it is not so much throwing things out of windows if only you would Choose something smaller said I No tell me about it beforehand Humiliating And I do not see any possible light out of this darkness Why don t you join a touring company and leave your mother in Vienna What Leave my poor little sick widowed mother in Vienna Sooner than that I would drown myself I love my mother as I love nobody else in the world nobody and nothing Do you think it is impossible to love one s tragedy Out of my great sorrows I make my little songs that is Heine or myself Oh well that s all right I said cheerfully But it is not all right I suggested we should turn back We turned Sometimes I think the solution lies in marriage said Fraulein Sonia If I find a simple peaceful man who adores me and will look after mamma a man who would be for me a pillow for genius cannot hope to mate I shall marry him You know the Herr Professor has paid me very marked attentions Oh Fraulein Sonia I said very pleased with myself why not marry him to your mother We were passing the hairdresser s shop at the moment Fraulein Sonia clutched my arm You you she stammered The cruelty I am going to faint Mamma to marry again before I marry the indignity I am going to faint here and now I was frightened You can t I said shaking her Come back to the pension and faint as much as you please But you can t faint here All the shops are closed There is nobody about Please don t be so foolish Here and here only She indicated the exact spot and dropped quite beautifully lying motionless Very well I said faint away but please hurry over it She did not move I began to walk home but each time I looked behind me I saw the dark form of the modern soul prone before the hairdresser s window Finally I ran and rooted out the Herr Professor from his room Fraulein Sonia has fainted I said crossly Du lieber Gott Where How Outside the hairdresser s shop in the Station Road Jesus and Maria Has she no water with her he seized his carafe nobody beside her Nothing Where is my coat No matter I shall catch a cold on the chest Willingly I shall catch one You are ready to come with me No I said you can take the waiter But she must have a woman I cannot be so indelicate as to attempt to loosen her stays Modern souls oughtn t to wear them said I He pushed past me and clattered down the stairs When I came down to breakfast next morning there were two places vacant at table Fraulein Sonia and Herr Professor had gone off for a day s excursion in the woods I wondered seven AT LEHMANN S Certainly Sabina did not find life slow She was on the trot from early morning until late at night At five o clock she tumbled out of bed buttoned on her clothes wearing a long sleeved alpaca pinafore over her black frock and groped her way downstairs into the kitchen Anna the cook had grown so fat during the summer that she adored her bed because she did not have to wear her corsets there but could spread as much as she liked roll about under the great mattress calling upon Jesus and Holy Mary and Blessed Anthony himself that her life was not fit for a pig in a cellar Sabina was new to her work Pink colour still flew in her cheeks there was a little dimple on the left side of her mouth that even when she was most serious most absorbed popped out and gave her away And Anna blessed that dimple It meant an extra half hour in bed for her it made Sabina light the fire turn out the kitchen and wash endless cups and saucers that had been left over from the evening before Hans the scullery boy did not come until seven He was the son of the butcher a mean undersized child very much like one of his father s sausages Sabina thought His red face was covered with pimples and his nails indescribably filthy When Herr Lehmann himself told Hans to get a hairpin and clean them he said they were stained from birth because his mother had always got so inky doing the accounts and Sabina believed him and pitied him Winter had come very early to Mindelbau By the end of October the streets were banked waist high with snow and the greater number of the Cure Guests sick unto death of cold water and herbs had departed in nothing approaching peace So the large salon was shut at Lehmann s and the breakfast room was all the accommodation the cafe afforded Here the floor had to be washed over the tables rubbed coffee cups set out each with its little china platter of sugar and newspapers and magazines hung on their hooks along the walls before Herr Lehmann appeared at seven thirty and opened business As a rule his wife served in the shop leading into the cafe but she had chosen the quiet season to have a baby and a big woman at the best of times she had grown so enormous in the process that her husband told her she looked unappetising and had better remain upstairs and sew Sabina took on the extra work without any thought of extra pay She loved to stand behind the counter cutting up slices of Anna s marvellous chocolate spotted confections or doing up packets of sugar almonds in pink and blue striped bags You ll get varicose veins like me said Anna That s what the Frau s got too No wonder the baby doesn t come All her swelling s got into her legs And Hans was immensely interested During the morning business was comparatively slack Sabina answered the shop bell attended to a few customers who drank a liqueur to warm their stomachs before the midday meal and ran upstairs now and again to ask the Frau if she wanted anything But in the afternoon six or seven choice spirits played cards and everybody who was anybody drank tea or coffee Sabina Sabina She flew from one table to the other counting out handfuls of small change giving orders to Anna through the slide helping the men with their heavy coats always with that magical child air about her that delightful sense of perpetually attending a party How is the Frau Lehmann the women would whisper She feels rather low but as well as can be expected Sabina would answer nodding confidentially Frau Lehmann s bad time was approaching Anna and her friends referred to it as her journey to Rome and Sabina longed to ask questions yet being ashamed of her ignorance was silent trying to puzzle it out for herself She knew practically nothing except that the Frau had a baby inside her which had to come out very painful indeed One could not have one without a husband that she also realised But what had the man got to do with it So she wondered as she sat mending tea towels in the evening head bent over her work light shining on her brown curls Birth what was it wondered Sabina Death such a simple thing She had a little picture of her dead grandmother dressed in a black silk frock tired hands clasping the crucifix that dragged between her flattened breasts mouth curiously tight yet almost secretly smiling But the grandmother had been born once that was the important fact As she sat there one evening thinking the Young Man entered the cafe and called for a glass of port wine Sabina rose slowly The long day and the hot room made her feel a little languid but as she poured out the wine she felt the Young Man s eyes fixed on her looked down at him and dimpled It s cold out she said corking the bottle The Young Man ran his hands through his snow powdered hair and laughed I wouldn t call it exactly tropical he said But you re very snug in here look as though you ve been asleep Very languid felt Sabina in the hot room and the Young Man s voice was strong and deep She thought she had never seen anybody who looked so strong as though he could take up the table in one hand and his restless gaze wandering over her face and figure gave her a curious thrill deep in her body half pleasure half pain She wanted to stand there close beside him while he drank his wine A little silence followed Then he took a book out of his pocket and Sabina went back to her sewing Sitting there in the corner she listened to the sound of the leaves being turned and the loud ticking of the clock that hung over the gilt mirror She wanted to look at him again there was a something about him in his deep voice even in the way his clothes fitted From the room above she heard the heavy dragging sound of Frau Lehmann s footsteps and again the old thoughts worried Sabina If she herself should one day look like that feel like that Yet it would be very sweet to have a little baby to dress and jump up and down Fraulein what s your name what are you smiling at called the Young Man She blushed and looked up hands quiet in her lap looked across the empty tables and shook her head Come here and I ll show you a picture he commanded She went and stood beside him He opened the book and Sabina saw a coloured sketch of a naked girl sitting on the edge of a great crumpled bed a man s opera hat on the back of her head He put his hand over the body leaving only the face exposed then scrutinised Sabina closely Well What do you mean she asked knowing perfectly well Why it might be your own photograph the face I mean that s as far as I can judge But the hair s done differently said Sabina laughing She threw back her head and the laughter bubbled in her round white throat It s rather a nice picture don t you think he asked But she was looking at a curious ring he wore on the hand that covered the girl s body and only nodded Ever seen anything like it before Oh there s plenty of those funny ones in the illustrated papers How would you like to have your picture taken that way Me I d never let anybody see it Besides I haven t got a hat like that That s easily remedied Again a little silence broken by Anna throwing up the slide Sabina ran into the kitchen Here take this milk and egg up to the Frau said Anna Who ve you got in there Got such a funny man I think he s a little gone here tapping her forehead Upstairs in the ugly room the Frau sat sewing a black shawl round her shoulders her feet encased in red woollen slippers The girl put the milk on a table by her then stood polishing a spoon on her apron Nothing else Na said the Frau heaving up in her chair Where s my man He s playing cards over at Snipold s Do you want him Dear heaven leave him alone I m nothing I don t matter And the whole day waiting here Her hand shook as she wiped the rim of the glass with her fat finger Shall I help you to bed You go downstairs leave me alone Tell Anna not to let Hans grub the sugar give him one on the ear Ugly ugly ugly muttered Sabina returning to the cafe where the Young Man stood coat buttoned ready for departure I ll come again to morrow said he Don t twist your hair back so tightly it will lose all its curl Well you are a funny one she said Good night By the time Sabina was ready for bed Anna was snoring She brushed out her long hair and gathered it in her hands Perhaps it would be a pity if it lost all its curl Then she looked down at her straight chemise and drawing it off sat down on the side of the bed I wish she whispered smiling sleepily there was a great big looking glass in this room Lying down in the darkness she hugged her little body I wouldn t be the Frau for one hundred marks not for a thousand marks To look like that And half dreaming she imagined herself heaving up in her chair with the port wine bottle in her hand as the Young Man entered the cafe Cold and dark the next morning Sabina woke tired feeling as though something heavy had been pressing under her heart all night There was a sound of footsteps shuffling along the passage Herr Lehmann She must have overslept herself Yes he was rattling the door handle One moment one moment she called dragging on her stockings Bina tell Anna to go to the Frau but quickly I must ride for the nurse Yes yes she cried Has it come But he had gone and she ran over to Anna and shook her by the shoulder The Frau the baby Herr Lehmann for the nurse she stuttered Name of God said Anna flinging herself out of bed No complaints to day Importance enthusiasm in Anna s whole bearing You run downstairs and light the oven Put on a pan of water speaking to an imaginary sufferer as she fastened her blouse Yes yes I know we must be worse before we are better I m coming patience It was dark all that day Lights were turned on immediately the cafe opened and business was very brisk Anna turned out of the Frau s room by the nurse refused to work and sat in a corner nursing herself listening to sounds overhead Hans was more sympathetic than Sabina He also forsook work and stood by the window picking his nose But why must I do everything said Sabina washing glasses I can t help the Frau she oughtn t to take such a time about it Listen said Anna they ve moved her into the back bedroom above here so as not to disturb the people That was a groan that one Two small beers shouted Herr Lehmann through the slide One moment one moment At eight o clock the cafe was deserted Sabina sat down in the corner without her sewing Nothing seemed to have happened to the Frau A doctor had come that was all Ach said Sabina I think no more of it I listen no more Ach I would like to go away I hate this talk I will not hear it No it is too much She leaned both elbows on the table cupped her face in her hands and pouted But the outer door suddenly opening she sprang to her feet and laughed It was the Young Man again He ordered more port and brought no book this time Don t go and sit miles away he grumbled I want to be amused And here take my coat Can t you dry it somewhere snowing again There s a warm place the ladies cloak room she said I ll take it in there just by the kitchen She felt better and quite happy again I ll come with you he said I ll see where you put it And that did not seem at all extraordinary She laughed and beckoned to him In here she cried Feel how warm I ll put more wood on that oven It doesn t matter they re all busy upstairs She knelt down on the floor and thrust the wood into the oven laughing at her own wicked extravagance The Frau was forgotten the stupid day was forgotten Here was someone beside her laughing too They were together in the little warm room stealing Herr Lehmann s wood It seemed the most exciting adventure in the world She wanted to go on laughing or burst out crying or or catch hold of the Young Man What a fire she shrieked stretching out her hands Here s a hand pull up said the Young Man There now you ll catch it to morrow They stood opposite to each other hands still clinging And again that strange tremor thrilled Sabina Look here he said roughly are you a child or are you playing at being one I I Laughter ceased She looked up at him once then down at the floor and began breathing like a frightened little animal He pulled her closer still and kissed her mouth Na what are you doing she whispered He let go her hands he placed his on her breasts and the room seemed to swim round Sabina Suddenly from the room above a frightful tearing shriek She wrenched herself away tightened herself drew herself up Who did that who made that noise In the silence the thin wailing of a baby Achk shrieked Sabina rushing from the room eight THE LUFT BAD I think it must be the umbrellas which make us look ridiculous When I was admitted into the enclosure for the first time and saw my fellow bathers walking about very nearly in their nakeds it struck me that the umbrellas gave a distinctly Little Black Sambo touch Ridiculous dignity in holding over yourself a green cotton thing with a red parroquet handle when you are dressed in nothing larger than a handkerchief There are no trees in the Luft Bad It boasts a collection of plain wooden cells a bath shelter two swings and two odd clubs one presumably the lost property of Hercules or the German army and the other to be used with safety in the cradle And there in all weathers we take the air walking or sitting in little companies talking over each other s ailments and measurements and ills that flesh is heir to A high wooden wall compasses us all about above it the pine trees look down a little superciliously nudging each other in a way that is peculiarly trying to a debutante Over the wall on the right side is the men s section We hear them chopping down trees and sawing through planks dashing heavy weights to the ground and singing part songs Yes they take it far more seriously On the first day I was conscious of my legs and went back into my cell three times to look at my watch but when a woman with whom I had played chess for three weeks cut me dead I took heart and joined a circle We lay curled on the ground while a Hungarian lady of immense proportions told us what a beautiful tomb she had bought for her second husband A vault it is she said with nice black railings And so large that I can go down there and walk about Both their photographs are there with two very handsome wreaths sent me by my first husband s brother There is an enlargement of a family group photograph too and an illuminated address presented to my first husband on his marriage I am often there it makes such a pleasant excursion for a fine Saturday afternoon She suddenly lay down flat on her back took in six long breaths and sat up again The death agony was dreadful she said brightly of the second I mean The first was run into by a furniture wagon and had fifty marks stolen out of a new waistcoat pocket but the second was dying for sixty seven hours I never ceased crying once not even to put the children to bed A young Russian with a bang curl on her forehead turned to me Can you do the Salome dance she asked I can How delightful I said Shall I do it now Would you like to see me She sprang to her feet executed a series of amazing contortions for the next ten minutes and then paused panting twisting her long hair Isn t that nice she said And now I am perspiring so splendidly I shall go and take a bath Opposite to me was the brownest woman I have ever seen lying on her back her arms clasped over her head How long have you been here to day she was asked Oh I spend the day here now she answered I am making my own cure and living entirely on raw vegetables and nuts and each day I feel my spirit is stronger and purer After all what can you expect The majority of us are walking about with pig corpuscles and oxen fragments in our brain The wonder is the world is as good as it is Now I live on the simple provided food she pointed to a little bag beside her a lettuce a carrot a potato and some nuts are ample rational nourishment I wash them under the tap and eat them raw just as they come from the harmless earth fresh and uncontaminated Do you take nothing else all day I cried Water And perhaps a banana if I wake in the night She turned round and leaned on one elbow You over eat yourself dreadfully she said shamelessly How can you expect the Flame of the Spirit to burn brightly under layers of superfluous flesh I wished she would not stare at me and thought of going to look at my watch again when a little girl wearing a string of coral beads joined us The poor Frau Hauptmann cannot join us to day she said she has come out in spots all over on account of her nerves She was very excited yesterday after having written two post cards A delicate woman volunteered the Hungarian but pleasant Fancy she has a separate plate for each of her front teeth But she has no right to let her daughters wear such short sailor suits They sit about on benches crossing their legs in a most shameless manner What are you going to do this afternoon Fraulein Anna Oh said the Coral Necklace the Herr Oberleutnant has asked me to go with him to Landsdorf He must buy some eggs there to take home to his mother He saves a penny on eight eggs by knowing the right peasants to bargain with Are you an American said the Vegetable Lady turning to me No Then you are an Englishwoman Well hardly You must be one of the two you cannot help it I have seen you walking alone several times You wear your I got up and climbed on to the swing The air was sweet and cool rushing past my body Above white clouds trailed delicately through the blue sky From the pine forest streamed a wild perfume the branches swayed together rhythmically sonorously I felt so light and free and happy so childish I wanted to poke my tongue out at the circle on the grass who drawing close together were whispering meaningly Perhaps you do not know cried a voice from one of the cells to swing is very upsetting for the stomach A friend of mine could keep nothing down for three weeks after exciting herself so I went to the bath shelter and was hosed As I dressed someone tapped on the wall Do you know said a voice there is a man who LIVES in the Luft Bad next door He buries himself up to the armpits in mud and refuses to believe in the Trinity The umbrellas are the saving grace of the Luft Bad Now when I go I take my husband s storm gamp and sit in a corner hiding behind it Not that I am in the least ashamed of my legs nine A BIRTHDAY Andreas Binzer woke slowly He turned over on the narrow bed and stretched himself yawned opening his mouth as widely as possible and bringing his teeth together afterwards with a sharp click The sound of that click fascinated him he repeated it quickly several times with a snapping movement of the jaws What teeth he thought Sound as a bell every man jack of them Never had one out never had one stopped That comes of no tomfoolery in eating and a good regular brushing night and morning He raised himself on his left elbow and waved his right arm over the side of the bed to feel for the chair where he put his watch and chain overnight No chair was there of course he d forgotten there wasn t a chair in this wretched spare room Had to put the confounded thing under his pillow Half past eight Sunday breakfast at nine time for the bath his brain ticked to the watch He sprang out of bed and went over to the window The venetian blind was broken hung fan shaped over the upper pane That blind must be mended I ll get the office boy to drop in and fix it on his way home to morrow he s a good hand at blinds Give him twopence and he ll do it as well as a carpenter Anna could do it herself if she was all right So would I for the matter of that but I don t like to trust myself on rickety step ladders He looked up at the sky it shone strangely white unflecked with cloud he looked down at the row of garden strips and backyards The fence of these gardens was built along the edge of a gully spanned by an iron suspension bridge and the people had a wretched habit of throwing their empty tins over the fence into the gully Just like them of course Andreas started counting the tins and decided viciously to write a letter to the papers about it and sign it sign it in full The servant girl came out of their back door into the yard carrying his boots She threw one down on the ground thrust her hand into the other and stared at it sucking in her cheeks Suddenly she bent forward spat on the toecap and started polishing with a brush rooted out of her apron pocket Slut of a girl Heaven knows what infectious disease may be breeding now in that boot Anna must get rid of that girl even if she has to do without one for a bit as soon as she s up and about again The way she chucked one boot down and then spat upon the other She didn t care whose boots she d got hold of SHE had no false notions of the respect due to the master of the house He turned away from the window and switched his bath towel from the washstand rail sick at heart I m too sensitive for a man that s what s the matter with me Have been from the beginning and will be to the end There was a gentle knock at the door and his mother came in She closed the door after her and leant against it Andreas noticed that her cap was crooked and a long tail of hair hung over her shoulder He went forward and kissed her Good morning mother how s Anna The old woman spoke quickly clasping and unclasping her hands Andreas please go to Doctor Erb as soon as you are dressed Why he said is she bad Frau Binzer nodded and Andreas watching her saw her face suddenly change a fine network of wrinkles seemed to pull over it from under the skin surface Sit down on the bed a moment he said Been up all night Yes No I won t sit down I must go back to her Anna has been in pain all night She wouldn t have you disturbed before because she said you looked so run down yesterday You told her you had caught a cold and been very worried Straightway Andreas felt that he was being accused Well she made me tell her worried it out of me you know the way she does Again Frau Binzer nodded Oh yes I know She says is your cold better and there s a warm undervest for you in the left hand corner of the big drawer Quite automatically Andreas cleared his throat twice Yes he answered Tell her my throat certainly feels looser I suppose I d better not disturb her No and besides TIME Andreas I ll be ready in five minutes They went into the passage As Frau Binzer opened the door of the front bedroom a long wail came from the room That shocked and terrified Andreas He dashed into the bathroom turned on both taps as far as they would go cleaned his teeth and pared his nails while the water was running Frightful business frightful business he heard himself whispering And I can t understand it It isn t as though it were her first it s her third Old Schafer told me yesterday his wife simply dropped her fourth Anna ought to have had a qualified nurse Mother gives way to her Mother spoils her I wonder what she meant by saying I d worried Anna yesterday Nice remark to make to a husband at a time like this Unstrung I suppose and my sensitiveness again When he went into the kitchen for his boots the servant girl was bent over the stove cooking breakfast Breathing into that now I suppose thought Andreas and was very short with the servant girl She did not notice She was full of terrified joy and importance in the goings on upstairs She felt she was learning the secrets of life with every breath she drew Had laid the table that morning saying Boy as she put down the first dish Girl as she placed the second it had worked out with the saltspoon to Boy For two pins I d tell the master that to comfort him like she decided But the Master gave her no opening Put an extra cup and saucer on the table he said the doctor may want some coffee The doctor sir The servant girl whipped a spoon out of a pan and spilt two drops of grease on the stove Shall I fry something extra But the master had gone slamming the door after him He walked down the street there was nobody about at all dead and alive this place on a Sunday morning As he crossed the suspension bridge a strong stench of fennel and decayed refuse streamed from the gulley and again Andreas began concocting a letter He turned into the main road The shutters were still up before the shops Scraps of newspaper hay and fruit skins strewed the pavement the gutters were choked with the leavings of Saturday night Two dogs sprawled in the middle of the road scuffling and biting Only the public house at the corner was open a young barman slopped water over the doorstep Fastidiously his lips curling Andreas picked his way through the water Extraordinary how I am noticing things this morning It s partly the effect of Sunday I loathe a Sunday when Anna s tied by the leg and the children are away On Sunday a man has the right to expect his family Everything here s filthy the whole place might be down with the plague and will be too if this street s not swept away I d like to have a hand on the government ropes He braced his shoulders Now for this doctor Doctor Erb is at breakfast the maid informed him She showed him into the waiting room a dark and musty place with some ferns under a glass case by the window He says he won t be a minute please sir and there is a paper on the table Unhealthy hole thought Binzer walking over to the window and drumming his fingers on the glass fern shade At breakfast is he That s the mistake I made turning out early on an empty stomach A milk cart rattled down the street the driver standing at the back cracking a whip he wore an immense geranium flower stuck in the lapel of his coat Firm as a rock he stood bending back a little in the swaying cart Andreas craned his neck to watch him all the way down the road even after he had gone listening for the sharp sound of those rattling cans H m not much wrong with him he reflected Wouldn t mind a taste of that life myself Up early work all over by eleven o clock nothing to do but loaf about all day until milking time Which he knew was an exaggeration but he wanted to pity himself The maid opened the door and stood aside for Doctor Erb Andreas wheeled round the two men shook hands Well Binzer said the doctor jovially brushing some crumbs from a pearl coloured waistcoat son and heir becoming importunate Up went Binzer s spirits with a bound Son and heir by Jove He was glad to have to deal with a man again And a sane fellow this who came across this sort of thing every day of the week That s about the measure of it Doctor he answered smiling and picking up his hat Mother dragged me out of bed this morning with imperative orders to bring you along Gig will be round in a minute Drive back with me won t you Extraordinary sultry day you re as red as a beetroot already Andreas affected to laugh The doctor had one annoying habit imagined he had the right to poke fun at everybody simply because he was a doctor The man s riddled with conceit like all these professionals Andreas decided What sort of night did Frau Binzer have asked the doctor Ah here s the gig Tell me on the way up Sit as near the middle as you can will you Binzer Your weight tilts it over a bit one side that s the worst of you successful business men Two stone heavier than I if he s a pound thought Andreas The man may be all right in his profession but heaven preserve me Off you go my beauty Doctor Erb flicked the little brown mare Did your wife get any sleep last night No I don t think she did answered Andreas shortly To tell you the truth I m not satisfied that she hasn t a nurse Oh your mother s worth a dozen nurses cried the doctor with immense gusto To tell you the truth I m not keen on nurses too raw raw as rump steak They wrestle for a baby as though they were wrestling with Death for the body of Patroclus Ever seen that picture by an English artist Leighton Wonderful thing full of sinew There he goes again thought Andreas airing off his knowledge to make a fool of me Now your mother she s firm she s capable Does what she s told with a fund of sympathy Look at these shops we re passing they re festering sores How on earth this government can tolerate They re not so bad sound enough only want a coat of paint The doctor whistled a little tune and flicked the mare again Well I hope the young shaver won t give his mother too much trouble he said Here we are A skinny little boy who had been sliding up and down the back seat of the gig sprang out and held the horse s head Andreas went straight into the dining room and left the servant girl to take the doctor upstairs He sat down poured out some coffee and bit through half a roll before helping himself to fish Then he noticed there was no hot plate for the fish the whole house was at sixes and sevens He rang the bell but the servant girl came in with a tray holding a bowl of soup and a hot plate I ve been keeping them on the stove she simpered Ah thanks that s very kind of you As he swallowed the soup his heart warmed to this fool of a girl Oh it s a good thing Doctor Erb has come volunteered the servant girl who was bursting for want of sympathy H m h m said Andreas She waited a moment expectantly rolling her eyes then in full loathing of menkind went back to the kitchen and vowed herself to sterility Andreas cleared the soup bowl and cleared the fish As he ate the room slowly darkened A faint wind sprang up and beat the tree branches against the window The dining room looked over the breakwater of the harbour and the sea swung heavily in rolling waves Wind crept round the house moaning drearily We re in for a storm That means I m boxed up here all day Well there s one blessing it ll clear the air He heard the servant girl rushing importantly round the house slamming windows Then he caught a glimpse of her in the garden unpegging tea towels from the line across the lawn She was a worker there was no doubt about that He took up a book and wheeled his arm chair over to the window But it was useless Too dark to read he didn t believe in straining his eyes and gas at ten o clock in the morning seemed absurd So he slipped down in the chair leaned his elbows on the padded arms and gave himself up for once to idle dreaming A boy Yes it was bound to be a boy this time What s your family Binzer Oh I ve two girls and a boy A very nice little number Of course he was the last man to have a favourite child but a man needed a son I m working up the business for my son Binzer Son It would mean living very tight for the next ten years cutting expenses as fine as possible and then A tremendous gust of wind sprang upon the house seized it shook it dropped only to grip the more tightly The waves swelled up along the breakwater and were whipped with broken foam Over the white sky flew tattered streamers of grey cloud Andreas felt quite relieved to hear Doctor Erb coming down the stairs he got up and lit the gas Mind if I smoke in here asked Doctor Erb lighting a cigarette before Andreas had time to answer You don t smoke do you No time to indulge in pernicious little habits How is she now asked Andreas loathing the man Oh well as can be expected poor little soul She begged me to come down and have a look at you Said she knew you were worrying With laughing eyes the doctor looked at the breakfast table Managed to peck a bit I see eh Hoo wih shouted the wind shaking the window sashes Pity this weather said Doctor Erb Yes it gets on Anna s nerves and it s just nerve she wants Eh what s that retorted the doctor Nerve Man alive She s got twice the nerve of you and me rolled into one Nerve she s nothing but nerve A woman who works as she does about the house and has three children in four years thrown in with the dusting so to speak He pitched his half smoked cigarette into the fireplace and frowned at the window Now HE S accusing me thought Andreas That s the second time this morning first mother and now this man taking advantage of my sensitiveness He could not trust himself to speak and rang the bell for the servant girl Clear away the breakfast things he ordered I can t have them messing about on the table till dinner Don t be hard on the girl coaxed Doctor Erb She s got twice the work to do to day At that Binzer s anger blazed out I ll trouble you Doctor not to interfere between me and my servants And he felt a fool at the same moment for not saying servant Doctor Erb was not perturbed He shook his head thrust his hands into his pockets and began balancing himself on toe and heel You re jagged by the weather he said wryly nothing else A great pity this storm You know climate has an immense effect upon birth A fine day perks a woman gives her heart for her business Good weather is as necessary to a confinement as it is to a washing day Not bad that last remark of mine for a professional fossil eh Andreas made no reply Well I ll be getting back to my patient Why don t you take a walk and clear your head That s the idea for you No he answered I won t do that it s too rough He went back to his chair by the window While the servant girl cleared away he pretended to read then his dreams It seemed years since he had had the time to himself to dream like that he never had a breathing space Saddled with work all day and couldn t shake it off in the evening like other men Besides Anna was interested they talked of practically nothing else together Excellent mother she d make for a boy she had a grip of things Church bells started ringing through the windy air now sounding as though from very far away then again as though all the churches in the town had been suddenly transplanted into their street They stirred something in him those bells something vague and tender Just about that time Anna would call him from the hall Andreas come and have your coat brushed I m ready Then off they would go she hanging on his arm and looking up at him She certainly was a little thing He remembered once saying when they were engaged Just as high as my heart and she had jumped on to a stool and pulled his head down laughing A kid in those days younger than her children in nature brighter more go and spirit in her The way she d run down the road to meet him after business And the way she laughed when they were looking for a house By Jove that laugh of hers At the memory he grinned then grew suddenly grave Marriage certainly changed a woman far more than it did a man Talk about sobering down She had lost all her go in two months Well once this boy business was over she d get stronger He began to plan a little trip for them He d take her away and they d loaf about together somewhere After all dash it they were young still She d got into a groove he d have to force her out of it that s all He got up and went into the drawing room carefully shut the door and took Anna s photograph from the top of the piano She wore a white dress with a big bow of some soft stuff under the chin and stood a little stiffly holding a sheaf of artificial poppies and corn in her hands Delicate she looked even then her masses of hair gave her that look She seemed to droop under the heavy braids of it and yet she was smiling Andreas caught his breath sharply She was his wife that girl Posh it had only been taken four years ago He held it close to him bent forward and kissed it Then rubbed the glass with the back of his hand At that moment fainter than he had heard in the passage more terrifying Andreas heard again that wailing cry The wind caught it up in mocking echo blew it over the house tops down the street far away from him He flung out his arms I m so damnably helpless he said and then to the picture Perhaps it s not as bad as it sounds perhaps it is just my sensitiveness In the half light of the drawing room the smile seemed to deepen in Anna s portrait and to become secret even cruel No he reflected that smile is not at all her happiest expression it was a mistake to let her have it taken smiling like that She doesn t look like my wife like the mother of my son Yes that was it she did not look like the mother of a son who was going to be a partner in the firm The picture got on his nerves he held it in different lights looked at it from a distance sideways spent it seemed to Andreas afterwards a whole lifetime trying to fit it in The more he played with it the deeper grew his dislike of it Thrice he carried it over to the fireplace and decided to chuck it behind the Japanese umbrella in the grate then he thought it absurd to waste an expensive frame There was no good in beating about the bush Anna looked like a stranger abnormal a freak it might be a picture taken just before or after death Suddenly he realised that the wind had dropped that the whole house was still terribly still Cold and pale with a disgusting feeling that spiders were creeping up his spine and across his face he stood in the centre of the drawing room hearing Doctor Erb s footsteps descending the stairs He saw Doctor Erb come into the room the room seemed to change into a great glass bowl that spun round and Doctor Erb seemed to swim through this glass bowl towards him like a goldfish in a pearl coloured waistcoat My beloved wife has passed away He wanted to shout it out before the doctor spoke Well she s hooked a boy this time said Doctor Erb Andreas staggered forward Look out Keep on your pins said Doctor Erb catching Dinzer s arm and murmuring as he felt it Flabby as butter A glow spread all over Andreas He was exultant Well by God Nobody can accuse ME of not knowing what suffering is he said ten THE CHILD WHO WAS TIRED She was just beginning to walk along a little white road with tall black trees on either side a little road that led to nowhere and where nobody walked at all when a hand gripped her shoulder shook her slapped her ear Oh oh don t stop me cried the Child Who Was Tired Let me go Get up you good for nothing brat said a voice get up and light the oven or I ll shake every bone out of your body With an immense effort she opened her eyes and saw the Frau standing by the baby bundled under one arm The three other children who shared the same bed with the Child Who Was Tired accustomed to brawls slept on peacefully In a corner of the room the Man was fastening his braces What do you mean by sleeping like this the whole night through like a sack of potatoes You ve let the baby wet his bed twice She did not answer but tied her petticoat string and buttoned on her plaid frock with cold shaking fingers There that s enough Take the baby into the kitchen with you and heat that cold coffee on the spirit lamp for the master and give him the loaf of black bread out of the table drawer Don t guzzle it yourself or I ll know The Frau staggered across the room flung herself on to her bed drawing the pink bolster round her shoulders It was almost dark in the kitchen She laid the baby on the wooden settle covering him with a shawl then poured the coffee from the earthenware jug into the saucepan and set it on the spirit lamp to boil I m sleepy nodded the Child Who Was Tired kneeling on the floor and splitting the damp pine logs into little chips That s why I m not awake The oven took a long time to light Perhaps it was cold like herself and sleepy Perhaps it had been dreaming of a little white road with black trees on either side a little road that led to nowhere Then the door was pulled violently open and the Man strode in Here what are you doing sitting on the floor he shouted Give me my coffee I ve got to be off Ugh You haven t even washed over the table She sprang to her feet poured his coffee into an enamel cup and gave him bread and a knife then taking a wash rag from the sink smeared over the black linoleumed table Swine of a day swine s life mumbled the Man sitting by the table and staring out of the window at the bruised sky which seemed to bulge heavily over the dull land He stuffed his mouth with bread and then swilled it down with the coffee The Child drew a pail of water turned up her sleeves frowning the while at her arms as if to scold them for being so thin so much like little stunted twigs and began to mop over the floor Stop sousing about the water while I m here grumbled the Man Stop the baby snivelling it s been going on like that all night The Child gathered the baby into her lap and sat rocking him Ts ts ts she said He s cutting his eye teeth that s what makes him cry so AND dribble I never seen a baby dribble like this one She wiped his mouth and nose with a corner of her skirt Some babies get their teeth without you knowing it she went on and some take on this way all the time I once heard of a baby that died and they found all it s teeth in its stomach The Man got up unhooked his cloak from the back of the door and flung it round him There s another coming said he What a tooth exclaimed the Child startled for the first time that morning out of her dreadful heaviness and thrusting her finger into the baby s mouth No he said grimly another baby Now get on with your work it s time the others got up for school She stood a moment quite silently hearing his heavy steps on the stone passage then the gravel walk and finally the slam of the front gate Another baby Hasn t she finished having them YET thought the Child Two babies getting eye teeth two babies to get up for in the night two babies to carry about and wash their little piggy clothes She looked with horror at the one in her arms who seeming to understand the contemptuous loathing of her tired glance doubled his fists stiffened his body and began violently screaming Ts ts ts She laid him on the settle and went back to her floor washing He never ceased crying for a moment but she got quite used to it and kept time with her broom Oh how tired she was Oh the heavy broom handle and the burning spot just at the back of her neck that ached so and a funny little fluttering feeling just at the back of her waistband as though something were going to break The clock struck six She set the pan of milk in the oven and went into the next room to wake and dress the three children Anton and Hans lay together in attitudes of mutual amity which certainly never existed out of their sleeping hours Lena was curled up her knees under her chin only a straight standing up pigtail of hair showing above the bolster Get up cried the Child speaking in a voice of immense authority pulling off the bedclothes and giving the boys sundry pokes and digs I ve been calling you this last half hour It s late and I ll tell on you if you don t get dressed this minute Anton awoke sufficiently to turn over and kick Hans on a tender part whereupon Hans pulled Lena s pigtail until she shrieked for her mother Oh do be quiet whispered the Child Oh do get up and dress You know what will happen There I ll help you But the warning came too late The Frau got out of bed walked in a determined fashion into the kitchen returning with a bundle of twigs in her hand fastened together with a strong cord One by one she laid the children across her knee and severely beat them expending a final burst of energy on the Child Who Was Tired then returned to bed with a comfortable sense of her maternal duties in good working order for the day Very subdued the three allowed themselves to be dressed and washed by the Child who even laced the boys boots having found through experience that if left to themselves they hopped about for at least five minutes to find a comfortable ledge for their foot and then spat on their hands and broke the bootlaces While she gave them their breakfast they became uproarious and the baby would not cease crying When she filled the tin kettle with milk tied on the rubber teat and first moistening it herself tried with little coaxing words to make him drink he threw the bottle on to the floor and trembled all over Eye teeth shouted Hans hitting Anton over the head with his empty cup he s getting the evil eye teeth I should say Smarty retorted Lena poking out her tongue at him and then when he promptly did the same crying at the top of her voice Mother Hans is making faces at me That s right said Hans go on howling and when you re in bed to night I ll wait till you re asleep and then I ll creep over and take a little tiny piece of your arm and twist and twist it until He leant over the table making the most horrible faces at Lena not noticing that Anton was standing behind his chair until the little boy bent over and spat on his brother s shaven head Oh weh oh weh The Child Who Was Tired pushed and pulled them apart muffled them into their coats and drove them out of the house Hurry hurry the second bell s rung she urged knowing perfectly well she was telling a story and rather exulting in the fact She washed up the breakfast things then went down to the cellar to look out the potatoes and beetroot Such a funny cold place the coal cellar With potatoes banked on one corner beetroot in an old candle box two tubs of sauerkraut and a twisted mass of dahlia roots that looked as real as though they were fighting one another thought the Child She gathered the potatoes into her skirt choosing big ones with few eyes because they were easier to peel and bending over the dull heap in the silent cellar she began to nod Here you what are you doing down there cried the Frau from the top of the stairs The baby s fallen off the settle and got a bump as big as an egg over his eye Come up here and I ll teach you It wasn t me it wasn t me screamed the Child beaten from one side of the hall to the other so that the potatoes and beetroot rolled out of her skirt The Frau seemed to be as big as a giant and there was a certain heaviness in all her movements that was terrifying to anyone so small Sit in the corner and peel and wash the vegetables and keep the baby quiet while I do the washing Whimpering she obeyed but as to keeping the baby quiet that was impossible His face was hot little beads of sweat stood all over his head and he stiffened his body and cried She held him on her knees with a pan of cold water beside her for the cleaned vegetables and the ducks bucket for the peelings Ts ts ts she crooned scraping and boring there s going to be another soon and you can t both keep on crying Why don t you go to sleep baby I would if I were you I ll tell you a dream Once upon a time there was a little white road She shook back her head a great lump ached in her throat and then the tears ran down her face on to the vegetables That s no good said the Child shaking them away Just stop crying until I ve finished this baby and I ll walk you up and down But by that time she had to peg out the washing for the Frau A wind had sprung up Standing on tiptoe in the yard she almost felt she would be blown away There was a bad smell coming from the ducks coop which was half full of manure water but away in the meadow she saw the grass blowing like little green hairs And she remembered having heard of a child who had once played for a whole day in just such a meadow with real sausages and beer for her dinner and not a little bit of tiredness Who had told her that story She could not remember and yet it was so plain The wet clothes flapped in her face as she pegged them danced and jigged on the line bulged out and twisted She walked back to the house with lagging steps looking longingly at the grass in the meadow What must I do now please she said Make the beds and hang the baby s mattress out of the window then get the wagon and take him for a little walk along the road In front of the house mind where I can see you Don t stand there gaping Then come in when I call you and help me cut up the salad When she had made the beds the Child stood and looked at them Gently she stroked the pillow with her hand and then just for one moment let her head rest there Again the smarting lump in her throat the stupid tears that fell and kept on falling as she dressed the baby and dragged the little wagon up and down the road A man passed driving a bullock wagon He wore a long queer feather in his hat and whistled as he passed Two girls with bundles on their shoulders came walking out of the village one wore a red handkerchief about her head and one a blue They were laughing and holding each other by the hand Then the sun pushed by a heavy fold of grey cloud and spread a warm yellow light over everything Perhaps thought the Child Who Was Tired if I walked far enough up this road I might come to a little white one with tall black trees on either side a little road Salad salad cried the Frau s voice from the house Soon the children came home from school dinner was eaten the Man took the Frau s share of pudding as well as his own and the three children seemed to smear themselves all over with whatever they ate Then more dish washing and more cleaning and baby minding So the afternoon dragged coldly through Old Frau Grathwohl came in with a fresh piece of pig s flesh for the Frau and the Child listened to them gossiping together Frau Manda went on her journey to Rome last night and brought back a daughter How are you feeling I was sick twice this morning said the Frau My insides are all twisted up with having children too quickly I see you ve got a new help commented old Mother Grathwohl Oh dear Lord the Frau lowered her voice don t you know her She s the free born one daughter of the waitress at the railway station They found her mother trying to squeeze her head in the wash hand jug and the child s half silly Ts ts ts whispered the free born one to the baby As the day drew in the Child Who Was Tired did not know how to fight her sleepiness any longer She was afraid to sit down or stand still As she sat at supper the Man and the Frau seemed to swell to an immense size as she watched them and then become smaller than dolls with little voices that seemed to come from outside the window Looking at the baby it suddenly had two heads and then no head Even his crying made her feel worse When she thought of the nearness of bedtime she shook all over with excited joy But as eight o clock approached there was the sound of wheels on the road and presently in came a party of friends to spend the evening Then it was Put on the coffee Bring me the sugar tin Carry the chairs out of the bedroom Set the table And finally the Frau sent her into the next room to keep the baby quiet There was a little piece of candle burning in the enamel bracket As she walked up and down she saw her great big shadow on the wall like a grown up person with a grown up baby Whatever would it look like when she carried two babies so Ts ts ts Once upon a time she was walking along a little white road with oh such great big black trees on either side Here you called the Frau s voice bring me my new jacket from behind the door And as she took it into the warm room one of the women said She looks like an owl Such children are seldom right in their heads Why don t you keep that baby quiet said the Man who had just drunk enough beer to make him feel very brave and master of his house If you don t keep that baby quiet you ll know why later on They burst out laughing as she stumbled back into the bedroom I don t believe Holy Mary could keep him quiet she murmured Did Jesus cry like this when He was little If I was not so tired perhaps I could do it but the baby just knows that I want to go to sleep And there is going to be another one She flung the baby on the bed and stood looking at him with terror From the next room there came the jingle of glasses and the warm sound of laughter And she suddenly had a beautiful marvellous idea She laughed for the first time that day and clapped her hands Ts ts ts she said lie there silly one you WILL go to sleep You ll not cry any more or wake up in the night Funny little ugly baby He opened his eyes and shrieked loudly at the sight of the Child Who Was Tired From the next room she heard the Frau call out to her One moment he is almost asleep she cried And then gently smiling on tiptoe she brought the pink bolster from the Frau s bed and covered the baby s face with it pressed with all her might as he struggled like a duck with its head off wriggling she thought She heaved a long sigh then fell back on to the floor and was walking along a little white road with tall black trees on either side a little road that led to nowhere and where nobody walked at all nobody at all eleven THE ADVANCED LADY Do you think we might ask her to come with us said Fraulein Elsa retying her pink sash ribbon before my mirror You know although she is so intellectual I cannot help feeling convinced that she has some secret sorrow And Lisa told me this morning as she was turning out my room that she remains hours and hours by herself writing in fact Lisa says she is writing a book I suppose that is why she never cares to mingle with us and has so little time for her husband and the child Well YOU ask her said I I have never spoken to the lady Elsa blushed faintly I have only spoken to her once she confessed I took her a bunch of wild flowers to her room and she came to the door in a white gown with her hair loose Never shall I forget that moment She just took the flowers and I heard her because the door was not quite properly shut I heard her as I walked down the passage saying Purity fragrance the fragrance of purity and the purity of fragrance It was wonderful At that moment Frau Kellermann knocked at the door Are you ready she said coming into the room and nodding to us very genially The gentlemen are waiting on the steps and I have asked the Advanced Lady to come with us Na how extraordinary cried Elsa But this moment the gnadige Frau and I were debating whether Yes I met her coming out of her room and she said she was charmed with the idea Like all of us she has never been to Schlingen She is downstairs now talking to Herr Erchardt I think we shall have a delightful afternoon Is Fritzi waiting too asked Elsa Of course he is dear child as impatient as a hungry man listening for the dinner bell Run along Elsa ran and Frau Kellermann smiled at me significantly In the past she and I had seldom spoken to each other owing to the fact that her one remaining joy her charming little Karl had never succeeded in kindling into flame those sparks of maternity which are supposed to glow in great numbers upon the altar of every respectable female heart but in view of a premeditated journey together we became delightfully cordial For us she said there will be a double joy We shall be able to watch the happiness of these two dear children Elsa and Fritz They only received the letters of blessing from their parents yesterday morning It is a very strange thing but whenever I am in the company of newly engaged couples I blossom Newly engaged couples mothers with first babies and normal deathbeds have precisely the same effect on me Shall we join the others I was longing to ask her why normal deathbeds should cause anyone to burst into flower and said Yes do let us We were greeted by the little party of cure guests on the pension steps with those cries of joy and excitement which herald so pleasantly the mildest German excursion Herr Erchardt and I had not met before that day so in accordance with strict pension custom we asked each other how long we had slept during the night had we dreamed agreeably what time we had got up was the coffee fresh when we had appeared at breakfast and how had we passed the morning Having toiled up these stairs of almost national politeness we landed triumphant and smiling and paused to recover breath And now said Herr Erchardt I have a pleasure in store for you The Frau Professor is going to be one of us for the afternoon Yes nodding graciously to the Advanced Lady Allow me to introduce you to each other We bowed very formally and looked each other over with that eye which is known as eagle but is far more the property of the female than that most unoffending of birds I think you are English she said I acknowledged the fact I am reading a great many English books just now rather I am studying them Nu cried Herr Erchardt Fancy that What a bond already I have made up my mind to know Shakespeare in his mother tongue before I die but that you Frau Professor should be already immersed in those wells of English thought From what I have read she said I do not think they are very deep wells He nodded sympathetically No he answered so I have heard But do not let us embitter our excursion for our little English friend We will speak of this another time Nu are we ready cried Fritz who stood supporting Elsa s elbow in his hand at the foot of the steps It was immediately discovered that Karl was lost Ka rl Karl chen we cried No response But he was here one moment ago said Herr Langen a tired pale youth who was recovering from a nervous breakdown due to much philosophy and little nourishment He was sitting here picking out the works of his watch with a hairpin Frau Kellermann rounded on him Do you mean to say my dear Herr Langen you did not stop the child No said Herr Langen I ve tried stopping him before now Da that child has such energy never is his brain at peace If he is not doing one thing he is doing another Perhaps he has started on the dining room clock now suggested Herr Langen abominably hopeful The Advanced Lady suggested that we should go without him I never take my little daughter for walks she said I have accustomed her to sitting quietly in my bedroom from the time I go out until I return There he is there he is piped Elsa and Karl was observed slithering down a chestnut tree very much the worse for twigs I ve been listening to what you said about me mumma he confessed while Frau Kellermann brushed him down It was not true about the watch I was only looking at it and the little girl never stays in the bedroom She told me herself she always goes down to the kitchen and Da that s enough said Frau Kellermann We marched en masse along the station road It was a very warm afternoon and continuous parties of cure guests who were giving their digestions a quiet airing in pension gardens called after us asked if we were going for a walk and cried Herr Gott happy journey with immense ill concealed relish when we mentioned Schlingen But that is eight kilometres shouted one old man with a white beard who leaned against a fence fanning himself with a yellow handkerchief Seven and a half answered Herr Erchardt shortly Eight bellowed the sage Seven and a half Eight The man is mad said Herr Erchardt Well please let him be mad in peace said I putting my hands over my ears Such ignorance must not be allowed to go uncontradicted said he and turning his back on us too exhausted to cry out any longer he held up seven and a half fingers Eight thundered the greybeard with pristine freshness We felt very sobered and did not recover until we reached a white signpost which entreated us to leave the road and walk through the field path without trampling down more of the grass than was necessary Being interpreted it meant single file which was distressing for Elsa and Fritz Karl like a happy child gambolled ahead and cut down as many flowers as possible with the stick of his mother s parasol followed the three others then myself and the lovers in the rear And above the conversation of the advance party I had the privilege of hearing these delicious whispers Fritz Do you love me Elsa Nu yes Fritz passionately But how much To which Elsa never replied except with How much do YOU love ME Fritz escaped that truly Christian trap by saying I asked you first It grew so confusing that I slipped in front of Frau Kellermann and walked in the peaceful knowledge that she was blossoming and I was under no obligation to inform even my nearest and dearest as to the precise capacity of my affections What right have they to ask each other such questions the day after letters of blessing have been received I reflected What right have they even to question each other Love which becomes engaged and married is a purely affirmative affair they are usurping the privileges of their betters and wisers The edges of the field frilled over into an immense pine forest very pleasant and cool it looked Another signpost begged us to keep to the broad path for Schlingen and deposit waste paper and fruit peelings in wire receptacles attached to the benches for the purpose We sat down on the first bench and Karl with great curiosity explored the wire receptacle I love woods said the Advanced Lady smiling pitifully into the air In a wood my hair already seems to stir and remember something of its savage origin But speaking literally said Frau Kellermann after an appreciative pause there is really nothing better than the air of pine trees for the scalp Oh Frau Kellermann please don t break the spell said Elsa The Advanced Lady looked at her very sympathetically Have you too found the magic heart of Nature she said That was Herr Langen s cue Nature has no heart said he very bitterly and readily as people do who are over philosophised and underfed She creates that she may destroy She eats that she may spew up and she spews up that she may eat That is why we who are forced to eke out an existence at her trampling feet consider the world mad and realise the deadly vulgarity of production Young man interrupted Herr Erchardt you have never lived and you have never suffered Oh excuse me how can you know I know because you have told me and there s an end of it Come back to this bench in ten years time and repeat those words to me said Frau Kellermann with an eye upon Fritz who was engaged in counting Elsa s fingers with passionate fervour and bring with you your young wife Herr Langen and watch perhaps your little child playing with She turned towards Karl who had rooted an old illustrated paper out of the receptacle and was spelling over an advertisement for the enlargement of Beautiful Breasts The sentence remained unfinished We decided to move on As we plunged more deeply into the wood our spirits rose reaching a point where they burst into song on the part of the three men O Welt wie bist du wunderbar the lower part of which was piercingly sustained by Herr Langen who attempted quite unsuccessfully to infuse satire into it in accordance with his world outlook They strode ahead and left us to trail after them hot and happy Now is the opportunity said Frau Kellermann Dear Frau Professor do tell us a little about your book Ach how did you know I was writing one she cried playfully Elsa here had it from Lisa And never before have I personally known a woman who was writing a book How do you manage to find enough to write down That is never the trouble said the Advanced Lady she took Elsa s arm and leaned on it gently The trouble is to know where to stop My brain has been a hive for years and about three months ago the pent up waters burst over my soul and since then I am writing all day until late into the night still ever finding fresh inspirations and thoughts which beat impatient wings about my heart Is it a novel asked Elsa shyly Of course it is a novel said I How can you be so positive said Frau Kellermann eyeing me severely Because nothing but a novel could produce an effect like that Ach don t quarrel said the Advanced Lady sweetly Yes it is a novel upon the Modern Woman For this seems to me the woman s hour It is mysterious and almost prophetic it is the symbol of the true advanced woman not one of those violent creatures who deny their sex and smother their frail wings under under The English tailor made from Frau Kellermann I was not going to put it like that Rather under the lying garb of false masculinity Such a subtle distinction I murmured Whom then asked Fraulein Elsa looking adoringly at the Advanced Lady whom then do you consider the true woman She is the incarnation of comprehending Love But my dear Frau Professor protested Frau Kellermann you must remember that one has so few opportunities for exhibiting Love within the family circle nowadays One s husband is at business all day and naturally desires to sleep when he returns home one s children are out of the lap and in at the university before one can lavish anything at all upon them But Love is not a question of lavishing said the Advanced Lady It is the lamp carried in the bosom touching with serene rays all the heights and depths of Darkest Africa I murmured flippantly She did not hear The mistake we have made in the past as a sex said she is in not realising that our gifts of giving are for the whole world we are the glad sacrifice of ourselves Oh cried Elsa rapturously and almost bursting into gifts as she breathed how I know that You know ever since Fritz and I have been engaged I share the desire to give to everybody to share everything How extremely dangerous said I It is only the beauty of danger or the danger of beauty said the Advanced Lady and there you have the ideal of my book that woman is nothing but a gift I smiled at her very sweetly Do you know I said I too would like to write a book on the advisability of caring for daughters and taking them for airings and keeping them out of kitchens I think the masculine element must have felt these angry vibrations they ceased from singing and together we climbed out of the wood to see Schlingen below us tucked in a circle of hills the white houses shining in the sunlight for all the world like eggs in a bird s nest as Herr Erchardt declared We descended upon Schlingen and demanded sour milk with fresh cream and bread at the Inn of the Golden Stag a most friendly place with tables in a rose garden where hens and chickens ran riot even flopping upon the disused tables and pecking at the red checks on the cloths We broke the bread into the bowls added the cream and stirred it round with flat wooden spoons the landlord and his wife standing by Splendid weather said Herr Erchardt waving his spoon at the landlord who shrugged his shoulders What you don t call it splendid As you please said the landlord obviously scorning us Such a beautiful walk said Fraulein Elsa making a free gift of her most charming smile to the landlady I never walk said the landlady when I go to Mindelbau my man drives me I ve more important things to do with my legs than walk them through the dust I like these people confessed Herr Langen to me I like them very very much I think I shall take a room here for the whole summer Why Oh because they live close to the earth and therefore despise it He pushed away his bowl of sour milk and lit a cigarette We ate solidly and seriously until those seven and a half kilometres to Mindelbau stretched before us like an eternity Even Karl s activity became so full fed that he lay on the ground and removed his leather waistbelt Elsa suddenly leaned over to Fritz and whispered who on hearing her to the end and asking her if she loved him got up and made a little speech We we wish to celebrate our betrothal by by asking you all to drive back with us in the landlord s cart if it will hold us Oh what a beautiful noble idea said Frau Kellermann heaving a sigh of relief that audibly burst two hooks It is my little gift said Elsa to the Advanced Lady who by virtue of three portions almost wept tears of gratitude Squeezed into the peasant cart and driven by the landlord who showed his contempt for mother earth by spitting savagely every now and again we jolted home again and the nearer we came to Mindelbau the more we loved it and one another We must have many excursions like this said Herr Erchardt to me for one surely gets to know a person in the simple surroundings of the open air one SHARES the same joys one feels friendship What is it your Shakespeare says One moment I have it The friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel But said I feeling very friendly towards him the bother about my soul is that it refuses to grapple anybody at all and I am sure that the dead weight of a friend whose adoption it had tried would kill it immediately Never yet has it shown the slightest sign of a hoop He bumped against my knees and excused himself and the cart My dear little lady you must not take the quotation literally Naturally one is not physically conscious of the hoops but hoops there are in the soul of him or her who loves his fellow men Take this afternoon for instance How did we start out As strangers you might almost say and yet all of us how have we come home In a cart said the only remaining joy who sat upon his mother s lap and felt sick We skirted the field that we had passed through going round by the cemetery Herr Langen leaned over the edge of the seat and greeted the graves He was sitting next to the Advanced Lady inside the shelter of her shoulder I heard her murmur You look like a little boy with your hair blowing about in the wind Herr Langen slightly less bitter watched the last graves disappear And I heard her murmur Why are you so sad I too am very sad sometimes but you look young enough for me to dare to say this I too know of much joy What do you know said he I leaned over and touched the Advanced Lady s hand Hasn t it been a nice afternoon I said questioningly But you know that theory of yours about women and Love it s as old as the hills oh older From the road a sudden shout of triumph Yes there he was again white beard silk handkerchief and undaunted enthusiasm What did I say Eight kilometres it is Seven and a half shrieked Herr Erchardt Why then do you return in carts Eight kilometres it must be Herr Erchardt made a cup of his hands and stood up in the jolting cart while Frau Kellermann clung to his knees Seven and a half Ignorance must not go uncontradicted I said to the Advanced Lady twelve THE SWING OF THE PENDULUM The landlady knocked at the door Come in said Viola There is a letter for you said the landlady a special letter she held the green envelope in a corner of her dingy apron Thanks Viola kneeling on the floor poking at the little dusty stove stretched out her hand Any answer No the messenger has gone Oh all right She did not look the landlady in the face she was ashamed of not having paid her rent and wondered grimly without any hope if the woman would begin to bluster again About this money owing to me said the landlady Oh the Lord off she goes thought Viola turning her back on the woman and making a grimace at the stove It s settle or it s go The landlady raised her voice she began to bawl I m a landlady I am and a respectable woman I ll have you know I ll have no lice in my house sneaking their way into the furniture and eating up everything It s cash or out you go before twelve o clock to morrow Viola felt rather than saw the woman s gesture She shot out her arm in a stupid helpless way as though a dirty pigeon had suddenly flown at her face Filthy old beast Ugh And the smell of her like stale cheese and damp washing Very well she answered shortly it s cash down or I leave to morrow All right don t shout It was extraordinary always before this woman came near her she trembled in her shoes even the sound of those flat feet stumping up the stairs made her feel sick but once they were face to face she felt immensely calm and indifferent and could not understand why she even worried about money nor why she sneaked out of the house on tiptoe not even daring to shut the door after her in case the landlady should hear and shout something terrible nor why she spent nights pacing up and down her room drawing up sharply before the mirror and saying to a tragic reflection Money money money When she was alone her poverty was like a huge dream mountain on which her feet were fast rooted aching with the ache of the size of the thing but if it came to definite action with no time for imaginings her dream mountain dwindled into a beastly hold your nose affair to be passed as quickly as possible with anger and a strong sense of superiority The landlady bounced out of the room banging the door so that it shook and rattled as though it had listened to the conversation and fully sympathised with the old hag Squatting on her heels Viola opened the letter It was from Casimir I shall be with you at three o clock this afternoon and must be off again this evening All news when we meet I hope you are happier than I CASIMIR Huh how kind she sneered how condescending Too good of you really She sprang to her feet crumbling the letter in her hands And how are you to know that I shall stick here awaiting your pleasure until three o clock this afternoon But she knew she would her rage was only half sincere She longed to see Casimir for she was confident that this time she would make him understand the situation For as it is it s intolerable intolerable she muttered It was ten o clock in the morning of a grey day curiously lighted by pale flashes of sunshine Searched by these flashes her room looked tumbled and grimed She pulled down the window blinds but they gave a persistent whitish glare which was just as bad The only thing of life in the room was a jar of hyacinths given her by the landlady s daughter it stood on the table exuding a sickly perfume from its plump petals there were even rich buds unfolding and the leaves shone like oil Viola went over to the washstand poured some water into the enamel basin and sponged her face and neck She dipped her face into the water opened her eyes and shook her head from side to side it was exhilarating She did it three times I suppose I could drown myself if I stayed under long enough she thought I wonder how long it takes to become unconscious Often read of women drowning in a bucket I wonder if any air enters by the ears if the basin would have to be as deep as a bucket She experimented gripped the washstand with both hands and slowly sank her head into the water when again there was a knock on the door Not the landlady this time it must be Casimir With her face and hair dripping with her petticoat bodice unbuttoned she ran and opened it A strange man stood against the lintel seeing her he opened his eyes very wide and smiled delightfully Excuse me does Fraulein Schafer live here No never heard of her His smile was so infectious she wanted to smile too and the water had made her feel so fresh and rosy The strange man appeared overwhelmed with astonishment She doesn t he cried She is out you mean No she s not living here answered Viola But pardon one moment He moved from the door lintel standing squarely in front of her He unbuttoned his greatcoat and drew a slip of paper from the breast pocket smoothing it in his gloved fingers before handing it to her Yes that s the address right enough but there must be a mistake in the number So many lodging houses in this street you know and so big Drops of water fell from her hair on to the paper She burst out laughing Oh HOW dreadful I must look one moment She ran back to the washstand and caught up a towel The door was still open After all there was nothing more to be said Why on earth had she asked him to wait a moment She folded the towel round her shoulders and returned to the door suddenly grave I m sorry I know no such name in a sharp voice Said the strange man Sorry too Have you been living here long Er yes a long time She began to close the door slowly Well good morning thanks so much Hope I haven t been a bother Good morning She heard him walk down the passage and then pause lighting a cigarette Yes a faint scent of delicious cigarette smoke penetrated her room She sniffed at it smiling again Well that had been a fascinating interlude He looked so amazingly happy his heavy clothes and big buttoned gloves his beautifully brushed hair and that smile Jolly was the word just a well fed boy with the world for his playground People like that did one good one felt made over at the sight of them SANE they were so sane and solid You could depend on them never having one mad impulse from the day they were born until the day they died And Life was in league with them jumped them on her knee quite rightly too At that moment she noticed Casimir s letter crumpled up on the floor the smile faded Staring at the letter she began braiding her hair a dull feeling of rage crept through her she seemed to be braiding it into her brain and binding it tightly above her head Of course that had been the mistake all along What had Oh Casimir s frightful seriousness If she had been happy when they first met she never would have looked at him but they had been like two patients in the same hospital ward each finding comfort in the sickness of the other sweet foundation for a love episode Misfortune had knocked their heads together they had looked at each other stunned with the conflict and sympathised I wish I could step outside the whole affair and just judge it then I d find a way out I certainly was in love with Casimir Oh be sincere for once She flopped down on the bed and hid her face in the pillow I was not in love I wanted somebody to look after me and keep me until my work began to sell and he kept bothers with other men away And what would have happened if he hadn t come along I would have spent my wretched little pittance and then Yes that was what decided me thinking about that then He was the only solution And I believed in him then I thought his work had only to be recognised once and he d roll in wealth I thought perhaps we might be poor for a month but he said if only he could have me the stimulus Funny if it wasn t so damned tragic Exactly the contrary has happened he hasn t had a thing published for months neither have I but then I didn t expect to Yes the truth is I m hard and bitter and I have neither faith nor love for unsuccessful men I always end by despising them as I despise Casimir I suppose it s the savage pride of the female who likes to think the man to whom she has given herself must be a very great chief indeed But to stew in this disgusting house while Casimir scours the land in the hope of finding one editorial open door it s humiliating It s changed my whole nature I wasn t born for poverty I only flower among really jolly people and people who never are worried The figure of the strange man rose before her would not be dismissed That was the man for me after all is said and done a man without a care who d give me everything I want and with whom I d always feel that sense of life and of being in touch with the world I never wanted to fight it was thrust on me Really there s a fount of happiness in me that is drying up little by little in this hateful existence I ll be dead if this goes on and she stirred in the bed and flung out her arms I want passion and love and adventure I yearn for them Why should I stay here and rot I am rotting she cried comforting herself with the sound of her breaking voice But if I tell Casimir all this when he comes this afternoon and he says Go as he certainly will that s another thing I loathe about him he s under my thumb what should I do then where should I go to There was nowhere I don t want to work or carve out my own path I want ease and any amount of nursing in the lap of luxury There is only one thing I m fitted for and that is to be a great courtesan But she did not know how to go about it She was frightened to go into the streets she heard of such awful things happening to those women men with diseases or men who didn t pay besides the idea of a strange man every night no that was out of the question If I d the clothes I would go to a really good hotel and find some wealthy man like the strange man this morning He would be ideal Oh if I only had his address I am sure I would fascinate him I d keep him laughing all day I d make him give me unlimited money At the thought she grew warm and soft She began to dream of a wonderful house and of presses full of clothes and of perfumes She saw herself stepping into carriages looking at the strange man with a mysterious voluptuous glance she practised the glance lying on the bed and never another worry just drugged with happiness That was the life for her Well the thing to do was to let Casimir go on his wild goose chase that evening and while he was away What Also please to remember there was the rent to be paid before twelve next morning and she hadn t the money for a square meal At the thought of food she felt a sharp twinge in her stomach a sensation as though there were a hand in her stomach squeezing it dry She was terribly hungry all Casimir s fault and that man had lived on the fat of the land ever since he was born He looked as though he could order a magnificent dinner Oh why hadn t she played her cards better he d been sent by Providence and she d snubbed him If I had that time over again I d be safe by now And instead of the ordinary man who had spoken with her at the door her mind created a brilliant laughing image who would treat her like a queen There s only one thing I could not stand that he should be coarse or vulgar Well he wasn t he was obviously a man of the world and the way he apologised I have enough faith in my own power and beauty to know I could make a man treat me just as I wanted to be treated It floated into her dreams that sweet scent of cigarette smoke And then she remembered that she had heard nobody go down the stone stairs Was it possible that the strange man was still there The thought was too absurd Life didn t play tricks like that and yet she was quite conscious of his nearness Very quietly she got up unhooked from the back of the door a long white gown buttoned it on smiling slyly She did not know what was going to happen She only thought Oh what fun and that they were playing a delicious game this strange man and she Very gently she turned the door handle screwing up her face and biting her lip as the lock snapped back Of course there he was leaning against the banister rail He wheeled round as she slipped into the passage Da she muttered folding her gown tightly around her I must go downstairs and fetch some wood Brr the cold There isn t any wood volunteered the strange man She gave a little cry of astonishment and then tossed her head You again she said scornfully conscious the while of his merry eye and the fresh strong smell of his healthy body The landlady shouted out there was no wood left I just saw her go out to buy some Story story she longed to cry He came quite close to her stood over her and whispered Aren t you going to ask me to finish my cigarette in your room She nodded You may if you want to In that moment together in the passage a miracle had happened Her room was quite changed it was full of sweet light and the scent of hyacinth flowers Even the furniture appeared different exciting Quick as a flash she remembered childish parties when they had played charades and one side had left the room and come in again to act a word just what she was doing now The strange man went over to the stove and sat down in her arm chair She did not want him to talk or come near her it was enough to see him in the room so secure and happy How hungry she had been for the nearness of someone like that who knew nothing at all about her and made no demands but just lived Viola ran over to the table and put her arms round the jar of hyacinths Beautiful Beautiful she cried burying her head in the flowers and sniffing greedily at the scent Over the leaves she looked at the man and laughed You are a funny little thing said he lazily Why Because I love flowers I d far rather you loved other things said the strange man slowly She broke off a little pink petal and smiled at it Let me send you some flowers said the strange man I ll send you a roomful if you d like them His voice frightened her slightly Oh no thanks this one is quite enough for me No it isn t in a teasing voice What a stupid remark thought Viola and looking at him again he did not seem quite so jolly She noticed that his eyes were set too closely together and they were too small Horrible thought that he should prove stupid What do you do all day she asked hastily Nothing Nothing at all Why should I do anything Oh don t imagine for one moment that I condemn such wisdom only it sounds too good to be true What s that he craned forward What sounds too good to be true Yes there was no denying it he looked silly I suppose the searching after Fraulein Schafer doesn t occupy all your days Oh no he smiled broadly that s very good By Jove no I drive a good bit are you keen on horses She nodded Love them You must come driving with me I ve got a fine pair of greys Will you Pretty I d look perched behind greys in my one and only hat thought she Aloud I d love to Her easy acceptance pleased him How about to morrow he suggested Suppose you have lunch with me to morrow and I take you driving After all this was just a game Yes I m not busy to morrow she said A little pause then the strange man patted his leg Why don t you come and sit down he said She pretended not to see and swung on to the table Oh I m all right here No you re not again the teasing voice Come and sit on my knee Oh no said Viola very heartily suddenly busy with her hair Why not I don t want to Oh come along impatiently She shook her head from side to side I wouldn t dream of such a thing At that he got up and came over to her Funny little puss cat He put up one hand to touch her hair Don t she said and slipped off the table I I think it s time you went now She was quite frightened now thinking only This man must be got rid of as quickly as possible Oh but you don t want me to go Yes I do I m very busy Busy What does the pussy cat do all day Lots and lots of things She wanted to push him out of the room and slam the door on him idiot fool cruel disappointment What s she frowning for he asked Is she worried about anything Suddenly serious I say you know are you in any financial difficulty Do you want money I ll give it to you if you like Money Steady on the brake don t lose your head so she spoke to herself I ll give you two hundred marks if you ll kiss me Oh boo What a condition And I don t want to kiss you I don t like kissing Please go Yes you do yes you do He caught hold of her arms above the elbows She struggled and was quite amazed to realise how angry she felt Let me go immediately she cried and he slipped one arm round her body and drew her towards him like a bar of iron across her back that arm Leave me alone I tell you Don t be mean I didn t want this to happen when you came into my room How dare you Well kiss me and I ll go It was too idiotic dodging that stupid smiling face I won t kiss you you brute I won t Somehow she slipped out of his arms and ran to the wall stood back against it breathing quickly Get out she stammered Go on now clear out At that moment when he was not touching her she quite enjoyed herself She thrilled at her own angry voice To think I should talk to a man like that An angry flush spread over his face his lips curled back showing his teeth just like a dog thought Viola He made a rush at her and held her against the wall pressed upon her with all the weight of his body This time she could not get free I won t kiss you I won t Stop doing that Ugh you re like a dog you ought to find lovers round lamp posts you beast you fiend He did not answer With an expression of the most absurd determination he pressed ever more heavily upon her He did not even look at her but rapped out in a sharp voice Keep quiet keep quiet Gar r Why are men so strong She began to cry Go away I don t want you you dirty creature I want to murder you Oh my God if I had a knife Don t be silly come and be good He dragged her towards the bed Do you suppose I m a light woman she snarled and swooping over she fastened her teeth in his glove Ach don t do that you are hurting me She did not let go but her heart said Thank the Lord I thought of this Stop this minute you vixen you bitch He threw her away from him She saw with joy that his eyes were full of tears You ve really hurt me he said in a choking voice Of course I have I meant to That s nothing to what I ll do if you touch me again The strange man picked up his hat No thanks he said grimly But I ll not forget this I ll go to your landlady Pooh She shrugged her shoulders and laughed I ll tell her you forced your way in here and tried to assault me Who will she believe with your bitten hand You go and find your Schafers A sensation of glorious intoxicating happiness flooded Viola She rolled her eyes at him If you don t go away this moment I ll bite you again she said and the absurd words started her laughing Even when the door was closed hearing him descending the stairs she laughed and danced about the room What a morning Oh chalk it up That was her first fight and she d won she d conquered that beast all by herself Her hands were still trembling She pulled up the sleeve of her gown great red marks on her arms My ribs will be blue I ll be blue all over she reflected If only that beloved Casimir could have seen us And the feeling of rage and disgust against Casimir had totally disappeared How could the poor darling help not having any money It was her fault as much as his and he just like her was apart from the world fighting it just as she had done If only three o clock would come She saw herself running towards him and putting her arms round his neck My blessed one Of course we are bound to win Do you love me still Oh I have been horrible lately thirteen A BLAZE Max you silly devil you ll break your neck if you go careering down the slide that way Drop it and come to the Club House with me and get some coffee I ve had enough for to day I m damp all through

3848-46063-0002	train-other-500	without looking through a hundred and fifty others to morrow morning They sat down at a small round table near the stove and ordered coffee Victor sprawled in his chair patting his little brown dog Bobo and looking
3848-46063-0003	train-other-500	half laughingly at Max What s the matter my dear Isn t the world being nice and pretty I want my coffee and I want to put my feet into my pocket they re like stones

3848-46063-0004	train-other-500	thanks the cake is like underdone india rubber here
none	none	 Fuchs and Wistuba came and sat at their table 
3848-46063-0005	train-other-500	Max half turned his back and stretched his feet out to the oven The three other men all began talking at once of the weather of the record slide
none	none	 of the fine condition of the Wald See for skating 
3848-46063-0006	train-other-500	Suddenly Fuchs looked at Max raised his eyebrows and nodded across to Victor who shook his head Baby doesn t feel well he said feeding the brown dog with broken lumps of sugar
none	none	 and nobody s to disturb him 
3848-46063-0007	train-other-500	I m nurse That s the first time I ve ever known him off colour said Wistuba I ve always imagined he had the better part of this world that could not be taken away from him
3848-46063-0008	train-other-500	I think he says his prayers to the dear Lord for having spared him being taken home in seven basketsful to night It s a fool s game to risk your all that way and leave the nation desolate Dry up said Max

none	none	 Are you other fellows going back to the town or stopping on here Fuchs and Victor said they were stopping Max did not answer but sat motionless while the men paid for their coffee and moved away Victor came back a moment and put a hand on his shoulder 
3848-46063-0011	train-other-500	If you re going right back my dear I wish you d look Elsa up and

3848-46063-0012	train-other-500	And feed with us to night at Limpold will you And take some hot grog when you get in Thanks old fellow I m all right Going back now He rose stretched himself buttoned on his heavy coat and
3848-46063-0013	train-other-500	lighted another cigarette From the door Victor watched him plunging through the heavy snow head bent hands thrust in his pockets he almost appeared to be running through the heavy snow towards the town
3848-46063-0014	train-other-500	Someone came stamping up the stairs paused at the door of her sitting room and knocked Is that you Victor she called No it is I
none	none	 can I come in Of course 
3848-46063-0015	train-other-500	Why what a Santa Claus
none	none	 Hang your coat on the landing and shake yourself over the banisters 
3848-46063-0016	train-other-500	Had a good time The room was full of light and warmth Elsa in a white velvet tea gown lay curled up on the sofa a book of fashions on her lap a box of creams beside her
none	none	 The curtains were not yet drawn before the windows and a blue light shone through 
3848-46063-0017	train-other-500	and the white boughs of the trees sprayed across A woman s room full of flowers and photographs and silk pillows the floor smothered in rugs an immense tiger skin under the piano
3848-46063-0018	train-other-500	just the head protruding sleepily savage It was good enough said Max Victor can t be in till late He told me to come up and tell you He started walking up and down
3848-46063-0019	train-other-500	tore off his gloves and flung them on the table Don t do that Max said Elsa you get on my nerves And I ve got a headache to day I m feverish and quite flushed Don t I look flushed
none	none	 He paused by the window and glanced at her a moment over his shoulder 
3848-46063-0020	train-other-500	No he said I didn t notice it Oh you haven t looked at me properly and I ve got a new tea gown on too She pulled her skirts together and patted a little place on the couch
3848-46063-0021	train-other-500	Come along and sit by me and tell me why you re being naughty But standing by the window
none	none	 he suddenly flung his arm across his eyes Oh he said 
3848-46063-0022	train-other-500	I can t I m done I m spent I m smashed Silence in the room The fashion book fell to the floor with a quick rustle of leaves Elsa sat forward
3848-46063-0023	train-other-500	her hands clasped in her lap a strange light shone in her eyes a red colour stained her mouth Then she spoke very quietly
none	none	 Come over here and explain yourself 
3848-46063-0024	train-other-500	I don t know what on earth you are talking about You do know you know far better than I You ve simply played with Victor in my presence that I may feel worse You ve tormented me you ve led me on
none	none	 offering me everything and nothing at all It s been a spider and fly business from first to last and I ve never for one moment been ignorant of that 
3848-46063-0025	train-other-500	and I ve never for one moment been able to withstand it He turned round deliberately
none	none	 Do you suppose that 
3848-46063-0026	train-other-500	when you asked me to pin your flowers into your evening gown when you let me
none	none	 come into your bedroom when Victor was out while you did your hair 
3848-46063-0027	train-other-500	when you pretended to be a baby and let me feed you with grapes when you have run to me and searched in all my pockets for a cigarette knowing perfectly well where they were kept going through every pocket just the same
3848-46063-0028	train-other-500	I knowing too I keeping up the farce
none	none	 do you suppose that now you have finally lighted your bonfire 
3848-46063-0029	train-other-500	you are going to find it a peaceful and pleasant thing you are going to prevent the whole house from burning
none	none	 She suddenly turned white and drew in her breath sharply 
3848-46063-0030	train-other-500	Don t talk to me like that
none	none	 You have no right to talk to me like that 
3848-46063-0031	train-other-500	I am another man s wife Hum he sneered throwing back his head that s rather late in the game and that s been your trump card all along You only love Victor on the cat and cream principle
3848-46063-0032	train-other-500	you a poor little starved kitten that he s given everything to that he s carried in his breast never dreaming that those little pink claws could tear out a man s heart She stirred
3848-46063-0033	train-other-500	looking at him with almost fear in her eyes After all unsteadily this is my room I ll have to ask you to go But he stumbled towards her knelt down by the couch
3848-46063-0034	train-other-500	burying his head in her lap clasping his arms round her waist And I LOVE you I love you the humiliation of it I adore you Don t don t just a minute let me stay here
none	none	 just a moment in a whole life Elsa 
3848-46063-0035	train-other-500	Elsa She leant back and pressed her head into the pillows Then his muffled voice I feel like a savage I want your whole body I want to carry you away to a cave
3848-46063-0036	train-other-500	and love you until I kill you you can t understand how a man feels I kill myself when I see you I m sick of my own strength that turns in upon itself and dies and rises new born like a Phoenix
3848-46063-0037	train-other-500	out of the ashes of that horrible death Love me just this once tell me a lie SAY that you do you are always lying Instead she pushed him away frightened
3848-46063-0038	train-other-500	Get up she said suppose the servant came in with the tea Oh ye gods He stumbled to his feet and stood staring down at her
none	none	 You re rotten to the core and so am I But you re heathenishly beautiful The woman went over to the piano 
3848-46063-0039	train-other-500	stood there striking one note her brows drawn together Then she shrugged her shoulders and smiled I ll make a confession Every word you have said is true I can t help it
3848-46063-0040	train-other-500	I can t help seeking admiration any more than a cat can help going to people to be stroked It s my nature I m born out of my time And yet you know I m not a COMMON woman
3848-46063-0041	train-other-500	I like men to adore me to flatter me even to make love to me but
none	none	 I would never give myself to any man I would never let a man kiss me 
3848-46063-0042	train-other-500	even It s immeasurably worse you ve no legitimate excuse Why even a prostitute has a greater sense of generosity I know she said
3848-46063-0043	train-other-500	I know perfectly well but I can t help the way I m built Are you going He put on his gloves Well he said what s going to happen to us now Again she shrugged her shoulders
3848-46063-0044	train-other-500	I haven t the slightest idea I never have just let things occur All alone cried Victor Has Max been here He only stayed a moment and
none	none	 wouldn t even have tea 
3848-46063-0045	train-other-500	I sent him home to change his clothes He was frightfully boring You poor darling your hair s coming down I ll fix it stand still a moment so you were bored Um m frightfully
3848-46063-0046	train-other-500	Oh you ve run a hairpin right into your wife s head you naughty boy She flung her arms round his neck and looked up at him half laughing like a beautiful loving child God What a woman you are said the man
