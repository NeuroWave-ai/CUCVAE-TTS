dah the a represents an a with a macron above it A LETTER TO THE CHILDREN DEAR CHILDREN You will like to know that the man who wrote these true stories is himself one of the people he describes so pleasantly and so lovingly for you He hopes that when you have finished this book the Indians will seem to you very real and very friendly He is not willing that all your knowledge of the race that formerly possessed this continent should come from the lips of strangers and enemies or that you should think of them as blood thirsty and treacherous as savage and unclean War you know is always cruel and it is true that there were stern fighting men among the Indians as well as among your own forefathers But there were also men of peace men generous and kindly and religious There were tender mothers and happy little ones and a home life that was pure and true There were high ideals of loyalty and honor It will do you good and make you happier to read of these things Perhaps you wonder how a real live Indian could write a book I will tell you how The story of this man s life is itself as wonderful as a fairy tale Born in a wigwam as he has told you and early left motherless he was brought up like the little Hiawatha by a good grandmother When he was four years old war broke out between his people and the United States government The Indians were defeated and many of them were killed Some fled northward into Canada and took refuge under the British flag among them the writer of this book with his grandmother and an uncle His father was captured by the whites After ten years of that wild life now everywhere at an end of which he has given you a true picture in his books his father whom the good President Lincoln had pardoned and released from the military prison made the long and dangerous journey to Canada to find and bring back his youngest son The Sioux were beginning to learn that the old life must go and that if they were to survive at all they must follow the white man s road long and hard as it looked to a free people They were beginning to plow and sow and send their children to school Ohiyesa the Winner as the boy was called came home with his father to what was then Dakota Territory to a little settlement of Sioux homesteaders Everything about the new life was strange to him and at first he did not like it at all He had thoughts of running away and making his way back to Canada But his father Many Lightnings who had been baptized a Christian under the name of Jacob Eastman told him that he too must take a new name and he chose that of Charles Alexander Eastman He was told to cut off his long hair and put on citizen s clothing Then his father made him choose between going to school and working at the plow Ohiyesa tried plowing for half a day It was hard work to break the tough prairie sod with his father s oxen and the strange implement they gave him He decided to try school Rather to his surprise he liked it and he kept on His teachers were pleased with his progress and soon better opportunities opened to him He was sent farther east to a better school where he continued to do well and soon went higher In the long summer vacations he worked on farms in shops and offices and in winter he studied and played football and all the other games you play until after about fifteen or sixteen years he found himself with the diplomas of a famous college and a great university a Bachelor of Science a Doctor of Medicine and a doubly educated man educated in the lore of the wilderness as well as in some of the deepest secrets of civilization Since that day a good many more years have passed Ohiyesa known as Doctor Charles A Eastman has now a home and six children of his own among the New England hills He has hundreds of devoted friends of both races He is the author of five books which have been widely read some of them in England France and Germany as well as in America and he speaks face to face to thousands of people every year Perhaps some of you have heard from his own lips his recollections of wild life You may find all the stories in this book and many more of the same sort in the books

when he thinks of the freest life in the world This life was mine Every day there was a real hunt There was real game No people have a better use of their five senses than the children of the wilderness We could smell as well as hear and see We could feel and taste as well as we could see and hear Nowhere has the memory been more fully developed than in the wild life and I can still see wherein I owe much to my early training Of course I myself do not remember when I first saw the day but my brothers have often recalled the event with much mirth for it was a custom of the Sioux that when a boy was born his brother must plunge into the water or roll in the snow naked if it was winter time and if he was not big enough to do either of these himself water was thrown on him If the new born had a sister she must be immersed The idea was that a warrior had come to camp and the other children must display some act of hardihood I was so unfortunate as to be the youngest of five children who soon after I was born were left motherless I had to bear the humiliating name Hak a dah meaning the pitiful last until I should earn a more dignified and appropriate name I was regarded as little more than a plaything by the rest of the children The babe was done up as usual in a movable cradle made from an oak board two and a half feet long and one and a half feet wide On one side of it was nailed with brass headed tacks the richly embroidered sack which was open in front and laced up and down with buckskin strings Over the arms of the infant was a wooden bow the ends of which were firmly attached to the board so that if the cradle should fall the child s head and face would be protected On this bow were hung curious playthings strings of artistically carved bones and hoofs of deer which rattled when the little hands moved them In this upright cradle I lived played and slept the greater part of the time during the first few months of my life Whether I was made to lean against a lodge pole or was suspended from a bough of a tree while my grandmother cut wood or whether I was carried on her back or conveniently balanced by another child in a similar cradle hung on the opposite side of a pony I was still in my oaken bed This grandmother who had already lived through sixty years of hardships was a wonder to the young maidens of the tribe She showed no less enthusiasm over Hakadah than she had done when she held her first born the boy s father in her arms Every little attention that is due to a loved child she performed with much skill and devotion She made all my scanty garments and my tiny moccasins with a great deal of taste It was said by all that I could not have had more attention had my mother been living Uncheedah grandmother was a great singer Sometimes when Hakadah wakened too early in the morning she would sing to him something like the following lullaby Sleep sleep my boy the Chippewas Are far away are far away Sleep sleep my boy prepare to meet The foe by day the foe by day The cowards will not dare to fight Till morning break till morning break Sleep sleep my child while still tis night Then bravely wake then bravely wake The Dakota women were wont to cut and bring their fuel from the woods and in fact to perform most of the drudgery of the camp This of necessity fell to their lot because the men must follow the game during the day Very often my grandmother carried me with her on these excursions and while she worked it was her habit to suspend me from a wild grape vine or a springy bough so that the least breeze would swing the cradle to and fro She has told me that when I had grown old enough to take notice I was apparently capable of holding extended conversations in an unknown dialect with birds and red squirrels Once I fell asleep in my cradle suspended five or six feet from the ground while Uncheedah was some distance away gathering birch bark for a canoe A squirrel had found it convenient to come upon the bow of my cradle and nibble his hickory nut until he awoke me by dropping the crumbs of his meal It was a common thing for birds to alight on my cradle in the woods After I left my cradle I almost walked away from it she told me She then began calling my attention to natural objects Whenever I heard the song of a bird she would tell me what bird it came from something after this fashion Hakadah listen to Shechoka the robin calling his mate He says he has just found something good to eat Or Listen to Oopehanska the thrush he is singing for his little wife He will sing his best When in the evening the whippoorwill started his song with vim no further than a stone s throw from our tent in the woods she would say to me Hush It may be an Ojibway scout Again when I waked at midnight she would say Do not cry Hinakaga the owl is watching you from the tree top I usually covered up my head for I had perfect faith in my grandmother s admonitions and she had given me a dreadful idea of this bird It was one of her legends that a little boy was once standing just outside of the teepee tent crying vigorously for his mother when Hinakaga swooped down in the darkness and carried the 
7240_92202_000021_000002	train-clean-360	poor little fellow 
none	none	up into the trees It was well known that the hoot of the owl was commonly imitated by Indian scouts when on the war path There had been dreadful massacres immediately following this call Therefore it was deemed wise to impress the sound early upon the mind of the child Indian children were trained so that they hardly ever cried much in the night This was very expedient and necessary in their exposed life In my infancy it was my grandmother s custom to put me to sleep as she said with the birds and to waken me with them until it became a habit She did this with an object in view An Indian must always rise early In the first place as a hunter he finds his game best at daybreak Secondly other tribes when on the war path usually make their attack very early in the morning Even when our people are moving about leisurely we like to rise before daybreak in order to travel when the air is cool and unobserved perchance by our enemies As a little child it was instilled into me to be silent and reticent This was one of the most important traits to form in the character of the Indian As a hunter and warrior it was considered absolutely necessary to him and was thought to lay the foundations of patience and self control II EARLY HARDSHIPS 
7240_92200_000003_000000	train-clean-360	One of the earliest recollections of my adventurous childhood is the ride I had on a pony s side 
7240_92200_000003_000001	train-clean-360	I was passive in the whole matter 
7240_92200_000003_000002	train-clean-360	A little girl cousin of mine was put in a bag and suspended from the horn of an Indian saddle but her weight must be balanced or the saddle would not remain on the animal s back 
7240_92200_000003_000003	train-clean-360	Accordingly I was put into another sack and made to keep the saddle and the girl in position 
7240_92200_000003_000004	train-clean-360	I did not object for I had a very pleasant game of peek a boo with the little girl until we came to a big snow drift where the poor beast was stuck fast and began to lie down 
7240_92200_000003_000005	train-clean-360	Then it was not so nice 
7240_92200_000004_000000	train-clean-360	This was the convenient and primitive way in which some mothers packed their children for winter journeys 
7240_92200_000004_000001	train-clean-360	However cold the weather might be the inmate of the fur lined sack was usually very comfortable at least I used to think so 
7240_92200_000004_000002	train-clean-360	I believe I was accustomed to all the precarious Indian conveyances and as a boy I enjoyed the dog travaux ride as much as any 
7240_92200_000004_000003	train-clean-360	The travaux consisted of a set of rawhide strips securely lashed to the tent poles which were harnessed to the sides of the animal as if he stood between shafts while the free ends were allowed to drag on the ground 
7240_92200_000004_000004	train-clean-360	Both ponies and large dogs were used as beasts of burden and they carried in this way the smaller children as well as the baggage 
7240_92200_000005_000000	train-clean-360	This mode of travelling for children was possible only in the summer and as the dogs were sometimes unreliable the little ones were exposed to a certain amount of danger 
7240_92200_000005_000001	train-clean-360	For instance whenever a train of dogs had been travelling for a long time almost perishing with the heat and their heavy loads a glimpse of water would cause them to forget all their responsibilities 
7240_92200_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Some of them in spite of the screams of the women would swim with their burdens into the cooling stream and I was thus on more than one occasion made to partake of an unwilling bath 
7240_92200_000006_000000	train-clean-360	I was a little over four years old at the time of the Sioux massacre in Minnesota 
7240_92200_000006_000001	train-clean-360	In the general turmoil we took flight into British Columbia and the journey is still vividly remembered by all our family 
7240_92200_000006_000002	train-clean-360	A yoke of oxen and a lumber wagon were taken from some white farmer and brought home for our conveyance 
none	none	How delighted I was when I learned that we were to ride behind those wise looking animals and in that gorgeously painted wagon 
7240_92200_000007_000001	train-clean-360	It seemed almost like a living creature to me this new vehicle with four legs and the more so when we got out of axle grease and the wheels went along squealing like pigs 
none	none	The boys found a great deal of innocent fun in jumping from the high wagon while the oxen were leisurely moving along 
7240_92200_000008_000001	train-clean-360	My elder brothers soon became experts 
7240_92200_000008_000002	train-clean-360	At last I mustered up courage enough to join them in this sport 
7240_92200_000008_000003	train-clean-360	I was sure they stepped on the wheel so I cautiously placed my moccasined foot upon it 
7240_92200_000008_000004	train-clean-360	Alas before I could realize what had happened I was under the wheels and had it not been for the neighbor immediately behind us I might have been run over by the next team as well 
7240_92200_000009_000000	train-clean-360	This was my first experience with a civilized vehicle 
7240_92200_000009_000001	train-clean-360	I cried out all possible reproaches on the white man s team and concluded that a dog travaux was good enough for me 
7240_92200_000009_000002	train-clean-360	I was really rejoiced that we were moving away from the people who made the wagon that had almost ended my life and it did not occur to me that I alone was to blame 
7240_92200_000009_000003	train-clean-360	I could not be persuaded to ride in that wagon again and was glad when we finally left it beside the Missouri river 
7240_92200_000010_000000	train-clean-360	The summer after the Minnesota massacre General Sibley pursued our people across this river 
7240_92200_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Now the Missouri is considered one of the most treacherous rivers in the world 
7240_92200_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Even a good modern boat is not safe upon its uncertain current 
7240_92200_000010_000003	train-clean-360	We were forced to cross in buffalo skin boats as round as tubs 
7240_92200_000011_000000	train-clean-360	The Washechu white men were coming in great numbers with their big guns and while most of our men were fighting them to gain time the women and the old men made and equipped the temporary boats braced with ribs of willow 
7240_92200_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Some of these were towed by two or three women or men swimming in the water and some by ponies 
7240_92200_000011_000002	train-clean-360	It was not an easy matter to keep them right side up with their helpless freight of little children and such goods as we possessed 
7240_92200_000012_000000	train-clean-360	In our flight we little folks were strapped in the saddles or held in front of an older person and in the long night marches to get away from the soldiers we suffered from loss of sleep and insufficient food 
7240_92200_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Our meals were eaten hastily and sometimes in the saddle 
7240_92200_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Water was not always to be found 
7240_92200_000012_000003	train-clean-360	The people carried it with them in bags formed of tripe or the dried pericardium of animals 
7240_92200_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Now we were compelled to trespass upon the country of hostile tribes and were harassed by them almost daily and nightly 
7240_92200_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Only the strictest vigilance saved us 
none	none	One day we met with another enemy near the British lines 
7240_92200_000014_000001	train-clean-360	It was a prairie fire 
7240_92200_000014_000002	train-clean-360	We were surrounded 
7240_92200_000014_000003	train-clean-360	Another fire was quickly made which saved our lives 
7240_92200_000015_000000	train-clean-360	One of the most thrilling experiences of the following winter was a blizzard which overtook us in our wanderings 
7240_92200_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Here and there a family lay down in the snow selecting a place where it was not likely to drift much 
7240_92200_000015_000002	train-clean-360	For a day and a night we lay under the snow 
7240_92200_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Uncle stuck a long pole beside us to tell us when the storm was over 
7240_92200_000015_000004	train-clean-360	We had plenty of buffalo robes and the snow kept us warm but we found it heavy After a time it became packed and hollowed out around our bodies so that we were as comfortable as one can be under those circumstances 
7240_92200_000016_000000	train-clean-360	The next day the storm ceased and we discovered a large herd of buffaloes almost upon us 
7240_92200_000016_000001	train-clean-360	We dug our way out shot some of the buffaloes made a fire and enjoyed a good dinner 
7240_92200_000017_000000	train-clean-360	I was now an exile as well as motherless yet I was not unhappy 
7240_92200_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Our wanderings from place to place afforded us many pleasant experiences and quite as many hardships and misfortunes 
7240_92200_000017_000002	train-clean-360	There were times of plenty and times of scarcity and we had several narrow escapes from death 
7240_92200_000017_000003	train-clean-360	In savage life the early spring is the most trying time and almost all the famines occurred at this period of the year 
7240_92200_000018_000000	train-clean-360	The Indians are a patient and a clannish people their love for one another is stronger than that of any civilized people I know 
7240_92200_000018_000001	train-clean-360	If this were not so I believe there would have been tribes of cannibals among them 
7240_92200_000018_000002	train-clean-360	White people have been known to kill and eat their companions in preference to starving but Indians never 
7240_92200_000019_000000	train-clean-360	In times of famine the adults often denied themselves in order to make the food last as long as possible for the children who were not able to bear hunger as well as the old 
7240_92200_000019_000001	train-clean-360	As a people they can live without food much longer than any other nation 
7240_92200_000020_000000	train-clean-360	I once passed through one of these hard springs when we had nothing to eat for several days 
7240_92200_000020_000001	train-clean-360	I well remember the six small birds which constituted the breakfast for six families one morning and then we had no dinner or supper to follow 
none	none	What a relief that was to me although I had only a small wing of a small bird for my share 
7240_92200_000020_000003	train-clean-360	Soon after this we came into a region where buffaloes were plenty and hunger and scarcity were forgotten 
7240_92200_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Such was the Indians wild life 
7240_92200_000021_000001	train-clean-360	When game was to be had and the sun shone they easily forgot the bitter experiences of the winter before Little preparation was made for the future 
7240_92200_000021_000002	train-clean-360	They are children of Nature and occasionally she whips them with the lashes of experience yet they are forgetful and careless 
7240_92200_000021_000003	train-clean-360	Much of their suffering might have been prevented by a little calculation 
7240_92200_000022_000000	train-clean-360	During the summer when Nature is at her best and provides abundantly for the savage it seems to me that no life is happier than his 
7240_92200_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Food is free lodging free everything free 
none	none	All were alike rich in the summer and again all were alike poor in the winter and early spring However their diseases were fewer and not so destructive as now and the Indian s health was generally good The Indian boy enjoyed such a life as almost all boys dream of and would choose for themselves if they were permitted to do so 
7240_92200_000023_000000	train-clean-360	The raids made upon our people by other tribes were frequent and we had to be constantly on the watch 
7240_92200_000023_000001	train-clean-360	I remember at one time a night attack was made upon our camp and all our ponies stampeded 
7240_92200_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Only a few of them were recovered and our journeys after this misfortune were effected mostly by means of the dog travaux 
7240_92200_000024_000000	train-clean-360	The second winter after the massacre my father and my two older brothers with several others were betrayed by a half breed at Winnipeg to the United States authorities 
7240_92200_000024_000001	train-clean-360	As I was then living with my uncle in another part of the country I became separated from them for ten years 
none	none	During all this time we believed that they had been killed by the whites and I was taught that I must avenge their deaths as soon as I was able to go upon the war path III AN INDIAN SUGAR CAMP With the first March thaw the thoughts of the Indian women of my childhood days turned promptly to the annual sugar making This industry was chiefly followed by the old men and women and the children The rest of the tribe went out upon the spring fur hunt at this season leaving us at home to make the sugar The first and most important of the necessary utensils were the huge iron and brass kettles for boiling Everything else could be made but these must be bought begged or borrowed A maple tree was felled and a log canoe hollowed out into which the sap was to be gathered Little troughs of basswood and birchen basins were also made to receive the sweet drops as they trickled from the tree As soon as these labors were accomplished we all proceeded to the bark sugar house which stood in the midst of a fine grove of maples on the bank of the Minnesota river We found this hut partially filled with the snows of winter and the withered leaves of the preceding autumn and it must be cleared for our use In the meantime a tent was pitched outside for a few days occupancy The snow was still deep in the woods with a solid crust upon which we could easily walk for we usually moved to the sugar house before the sap had actually started the better to complete our preparations My grandmother did not confine herself to canoe making She also collected a good supply of fuel for the fires for she would not have much time to gather wood when the sap began to flow Presently the weather moderated and the snow began to melt The month of April brought showers which carried most of it off into the Minnesota river Now the women began to test the trees moving leisurely among them axe in hand and striking a single quick blow to see if the sap would appear Trees like people have their individual characters some were ready to yield up their life blood while others were more reluctant Now one of the birchen basins was set under each tree and a hardwood chip driven deep into the cut which the axe had made From the corners of this chip at first drop by drop then more freely the sap trickled into the little dishes It is usual to make sugar from maples but several other trees were also tapped by the Indians From the birch and ash was made a dark colored sugar with a somewhat bitter taste which was used for medicinal purposes The box elder yielded a beautiful white sugar whose only fault was that there was never enough of it A long fire was now made in the sugar house and a row of brass kettles suspended over the blaze The sap was collected by the women in tin or birchen buckets and poured into the canoes from which the kettles were kept filled The hearts of the boys beat high with pleasant anticipations when they heard the welcome hissing sound of the boiling sap Each boy claimed one kettle for his especial charge It was his duty to see that the fire was kept under it to watch lest it boil over and finally when the sap became sirup to test it upon the snow dipping it out with a wooden paddle So frequent were these tests that for the first day or two we consumed nearly all that could be made and it was not until the sweetness began to pall that my grandmother set herself in earnest to store up sugar for future use She made it into cakes of various forms in birchen molds and sometimes in hollow canes or reeds and the bills of ducks and geese Some of it was pulverized and packed in rawhide cases Being a prudent woman she did not give it to us after the first month or so except upon special occasions and it was thus made to last almost the year around The smaller candies were reserved as an occasional treat for the little fellows and the sugar was eaten at feasts with wild rice or parched corn and also with pounded dried meat Coffee and tea with their substitutes were all unknown to us in those days Every pursuit has its trials and anxieties My grandmother s special tribulations during the sugaring season were the upsetting and gnawing of holes in her birch bark pans The transgressors were the rabbit and squirrel tribes and we little boys for once became useful in shooting them with our bows and arrows We hunted all over the sugar camp until the little creatures were fairly driven out of the neighborhood Occasionally one of my older brothers brought home a rabbit or two and then we had a feast I remember on this occasion of our last sugar bush in Minnesota that I stood one day outside of our hut and watched the approach of a visitor a bent old man his hair almost white and carrying on his back a large bundle of red willow or kinnikinick which the Indians use for smoking He threw down his load at the door and thus saluted us You have indeed perfect weather for sugar making It was my great grandfather Cloud Man whose original village was on the shores of Lakes Calhoun and Harriet now in the suburbs of the city of Minneapolis He was the first Sioux chief to welcome the Protestant missionaries among his people and a well known character in those pioneer days He brought us word that some of the peaceful sugar makers near us on the river had been attacked and murdered by roving Ojibways This news disturbed us not a little for we realized that we too might become the victims of an Ojibway war party Therefore we all felt some uneasiness from this time until we returned heavy laden to our village IV GAMES AND SPORTS 
7240_92202_000002_000000	train-clean-360	The Indian boy was a prince of the wilderness 
7240_92202_000002_000001	train-clean-360	He had but very little work to do during the period of his boyhood 
7240_92202_000002_000002	train-clean-360	His principal occupation was the practice of a few simple arts in warfare and the chase 
7240_92202_000002_000003	train-clean-360	Aside from this he was master of his time 
7240_92202_000003_000000	train-clean-360	It is true that our savage life was a precarious one and full of dreadful catastrophes however this never prevented us from enjoying our sports to the fullest extent 
7240_92202_000003_000001	train-clean-360	As we left our teepees in the morning we were never sure that our scalps would not dangle from a pole in the afternoon 
7240_92202_000003_000002	train-clean-360	It was an uncertain life to be sure 
7240_92202_000003_000003	train-clean-360	Yet we observed that the fawns skipped and played happily while the gray wolves might be peeping forth from behind the hills ready to tear them limb from limb 
7240_92202_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Our sports were molded by the life and customs of our people indeed we practiced only what we expected to do when grown 
7240_92202_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Our games were feats with the bow and arrow foot and pony races wrestling swimming and imitation of the customs and habits of our fathers 
7240_92202_000004_000002	train-clean-360	We had sham fights with mud balls and willow wands we played lacrosse made war upon bees shot winter arrows which were used only in that season and coasted upon the ribs of animals and buffalo robes 
none	none	No sooner did the boys get together than as a usual thing they divided into squads and chose sides then a leading arrow was shot at random into the air 
7240_92202_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Before it fell to the ground a volley from the bows of the participants followed 
7240_92202_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Each player was quick to note the direction and speed of the leading arrow and he tried to send his own at the same speed and at an equal height so that when it fell it would be closer to the first than any of the others 
7240_92202_000006_000000	train-clean-360	It was considered out of place to shoot by first sighting the object aimed at 
7240_92202_000006_000001	train-clean-360	This was usually impracticable in actual life because the object was almost always in motion while the hunter himself was often upon the back of a pony at full gallop 
7240_92202_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore it was the off hand shot that the Indian boy sought to master 
7240_92202_000006_000003	train-clean-360	There was another game with arrows that was characterized by gambling and was generally confined to the men 
none	none	The races were an every day occurrence 
7240_92202_000007_000001	train-clean-360	At noon the boys were usually gathered by some pleasant sheet of water and as soon as the ponies were watered they were allowed to graze for an hour or two while the boys stripped for their noonday sports 
7240_92202_000007_000002	train-clean-360	A boy might say to some other whom he considered his equal 
7240_92202_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t run but I will challenge you to fifty paces 
7240_92202_000009_000000	train-clean-360	A former hero when beaten would often explain his defeat by saying I drank too much water 
7240_92202_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Boys of all ages were paired for a spin and the little red men cheered on their favorites with spirit 
7240_92202_000011_000000	train-clean-360	As soon as this was ended the pony races followed 
7240_92202_000011_000001	train-clean-360	All the speedy ponies were picked out and riders chosen 
7240_92202_000011_000002	train-clean-360	If a boy declined to ride there would be shouts of derision 
7240_92202_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Last of all came the swimming 
7240_92202_000012_000001	train-clean-360	A little urchin would hang to his pony s long tail while the latter with only his head above water glided sportively along 
none	none	Finally the animals were driven into a fine field of grass and we turned our attention to other games The mud and willow fight was rather a severe and dangerous sport A lump of soft clay was stuck on the end of a limber and springy willow wand and thrown as boys throw apples from sticks with considerable force 
7240_92202_000013_000002	train-clean-360	When there were fifty or a hundred players on each side the battle became warm but anything to arouse the bravery of Indian boys seemed to them a good and wholesome diversion 
none	none	Wrestling was largely indulged in by us all 
7240_92202_000014_000001	train-clean-360	It may seem odd but wrestling was done by a great many boys at once from ten to any number on a side 
7240_92202_000014_000002	train-clean-360	It was really a battle in which each one chose his opponent 
7240_92202_000014_000003	train-clean-360	The rule was that if a boy sat down he was let alone but as long as he remained standing within the field he was open to an attack 
7240_92202_000014_000004	train-clean-360	No one struck with the hand but all manner of tripping with legs and feet and butting with the knees was allowed 
7240_92202_000014_000005	train-clean-360	Altogether it was an exhausting pastime fully equal to the American game of football and only the young athlete could really enjoy it 
7240_92202_000015_000000	train-clean-360	One of our most curious sports was a war upon the nests of wild bees We imagined ourselves about to make an attack upon the Ojibways or some tribal foe 
none	none	We all painted and stole cautiously upon the nest then with a rush and war whoop sprang upon the object of our attack and endeavored to destroy it 
7240_92202_000015_000002	train-clean-360	But it seemed that the bees were always on the alert and never entirely surprised for they always raised quite as many scalps as did their bold assailants 
7240_92202_000015_000003	train-clean-360	After the onslaught upon the nest was ended we usually followed it by a pretended scalp dance 
7240_92202_000016_000000	train-clean-360	On the occasion of my first experience in this mode of warfare there were two other little boys who were also novices 
none	none	One of them particularly was really too young to indulge in an exploit of that kind 
7240_92202_000016_000002	train-clean-360	As it was the custom of our people when they killed or wounded an enemy on the battle field to announce the act in a loud voice we did the same 
7240_92202_000016_000003	train-clean-360	My friend Little Wound as I will call him for I do not remember his name being quite small was unable to reach the nest until it had been well trampled upon and broken and the insects had made a counter charge with such vigor as to repulse and scatter our numbers in every direction 
7240_92202_000016_000004	train-clean-360	However he evidently did not want to retreat without any honors so he bravely jumped upon the nest and yelled 
7240_92202_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 I the brave Little Wound to day kill the only fierce enemy 
none	none	Illustration So he bravely jumped upon the nest Page thirty two 
7240_92202_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Scarcely were the last words uttered when he screamed as if stabbed to the heart 
7240_92202_000019_000001	train-clean-360	One of his older companions shouted 
7240_92202_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Dive into the water 
none	none	Run 
7240_92202_000020_000002	train-clean-360	Dive into the water for there was a lake near by 
7240_92202_000020_000003	train-clean-360	This advice he obeyed 
7240_92202_000021_000000	train-clean-360	When we had reassembled and were indulging in our mimic dance Little Wound was not allowed to dance 
7240_92202_000021_000001	train-clean-360	He was considered not to be in existence he had been killed by our enemies the Bee tribe 
none	none	Poor little fellow 
7240_92202_000021_000003	train-clean-360	His swollen face was sad and ashamed as he sat on a fallen log and watched the dance 
none	none	Although he might well have styled himself one of the noble dead who had died for their country yet he was not unmindful that he had screamed and this weakness would be apt to recur to him many times in the future 
7240_92202_000022_000000	train-clean-360	We had some quiet plays which we alternated with the more severe and warlike ones 
7240_92202_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Among them were throwing wands and snow arrows 
7240_92202_000022_000002	train-clean-360	In the winter we coasted much 
none	none	We had no double rippers or toboggans but six or seven of the long ribs of a buffalo fastened together at the larger end answered all practical purposes 
7240_92202_000022_000004	train-clean-360	Sometimes a strip of bass wood bark four feet long and about six inches wide was used with considerable skill 
7240_92202_000022_000005	train-clean-360	We stood on one end and held the other using the slippery inside of the bark for the outside and thus coasting down long hills with remarkable speed 
7240_92202_000023_000000	train-clean-360	The spinning of tops was one of the all absorbing winter sports 
7240_92202_000023_000001	train-clean-360	We made our tops heart shaped of wood horn or bone 
7240_92202_000023_000002	train-clean-360	We whipped them with a long thong of buckskin 
7240_92202_000023_000003	train-clean-360	The handle was a stick about a foot long and sometimes we whittled the stick to make it spoon shaped at one end 
7240_92202_000024_000000	train-clean-360	We played games with these tops two to fifty boys at one time 
7240_92202_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Each whips his top until it hums then one takes the lead and the rest follow in a sort of obstacle race 
7240_92202_000024_000002	train-clean-360	The top must spin all the way through 
7240_92202_000024_000003	train-clean-360	There were bars of snow over which we must pilot our top in the spoon end of our whip then again we would toss it in the air on to another open spot of ice or smooth snow crust from twenty to fifty paces away 
7240_92202_000024_000004	train-clean-360	The top that holds out the longest is the winner 
7240_92202_000025_000000	train-clean-360	We loved to play in the water 
7240_92202_000025_000001	train-clean-360	When we had no ponies we often had swimming matches of our own and sometimes made rafts with which we crossed lakes and rivers 
7240_92202_000025_000002	train-clean-360	It was a common thing to duck a young or timid boy or to carry him into deep water to struggle as best he might 
7240_92202_000026_000000	train-clean-360	I remember a perilous ride with a companion on an unmanageable log when we were both less than seven years old 
7240_92202_000026_000001	train-clean-360	The older boys had put us on this uncertain bark and pushed us out into the swift current of the river 
none	none	I cannot speak for my comrade in distress but I can say now that I would rather ride on a swift bronco any day than try to stay on and steady a short log in a river 
7240_92202_000026_000003	train-clean-360	I never knew how we managed to prevent a shipwreck on that voyage and to reach the shore 
7240_92202_000027_000000	train-clean-360	We had many curious wild pets 
7240_92202_000027_000001	train-clean-360	There were young foxes bears wolves raccoons fawns buffalo calves and birds of all kinds tamed by various boys 
7240_92202_000027_000002	train-clean-360	My pets were different at different times but I particularly remember one 
7240_92202_000027_000003	train-clean-360	I once had a grizzly bear for a pet and so far as he and I were concerned our relations were charming and very close 
7240_92202_000027_000004	train-clean-360	But I hardly know whether he made more enemies for me or I for him 
7240_92202_000027_000005	train-clean-360	It was his habit to treat every boy unmercifully who injured me 
none	none	V AN INDIAN BOY S TRAINING Very early the Indian boy assumed the task of preserving and transmitting the legends of his ancestors and his race Almost every evening a myth or a true story of some deed done in the past was narrated by one of the parents or grand parents while the boy listened with parted lips and glistening eyes On the following evening he was usually required to repeat it If he was not an apt scholar he struggled long with his task but as a rule the Indian boy is a good listener and has a good memory so that the stories were tolerably well mastered The household became his audience by which he was alternately criticized and applauded This sort of teaching at once enlightens the boy s mind and stimulates his ambition His conception of his own future career becomes a vivid and irresistible force Whatever there is for him to learn must be learned whatever qualifications are necessary to a truly great man he must seek at any expense of danger and hardship Such was the feeling of the imaginative and brave young Indian It became apparent to him in early life that he must accustom himself to rove alone and not to fear or dislike the impression of solitude It seems to be a popular idea that all the characteristic skill of the Indian is instinctive and hereditary This is a mistake All the stoicism and patience of the Indian are acquired traits and continual practice alone makes him master of the art of wood craft Physical training and dieting were not neglected I remember that I was not allowed to have beef soup or any warm drink The soup was for the old men General rules for the young were never to take their food very hot nor to drink much water My uncle who educated me up to the age of fifteen years was a strict disciplinarian and a good teacher When I left the teepee in the morning he would say Hakadah look closely to everything you see and at evening on my return he used often to catechize me for an hour or so On which side of the trees is the lighter colored bark On which side do they have most regular branches It was his custom to let me name all the new birds that I had seen during the day I would name them according to the color or the shape of the bill or their song or the appearance and locality of the nest in fact anything about the bird that impressed me as characteristic I made many ridiculous errors I must admit He then usually informed me of the correct name Occasionally I made a hit and this he would warmly commend He went much deeper into this science when I was a little older that is about the age of eight or nine years He would say for instance How do you know that there are fish in yonder lake Because they jump out of the water for flies at mid day He would smile at my prompt but superficial reply What do you think of the little pebbles grouped together under the shallow water and what made the pretty curved marks in the sandy bottom and the little sand banks Where do you find the fish eating birds Have the inlet and the outlet of a lake anything to do with the question He did not expect a correct reply at once to all the questions that he put to me on these occasions but he meant to make me observant and a good student of nature Hakadah he would say to me you ought to follow the example of the shunktokecha wolf Even when he is surprised and runs for his life he will pause to take one more look at you before he enters his final retreat So you must take a second look at everything you see It is better to view animals unobserved I have been a witness to their courtships and their quarrels and have learned many of their secrets in this way I was once the unseen spectator of a thrilling battle between a pair of grizzly bears and three buffaloes a rash act for the bears for it was in the moon of strawberries when the buffaloes sharpen and polish their horns for bloody contests among themselves I advise you my boy never to approach a grizzly s den from the front but to steal up behind and throw your blanket or a stone in front of the hole He does not usually rush for it but first puts his head out and listens and then comes out very indifferently and sits on his haunches on the mound in front of the hole before he makes any attack While he is exposing himself in this fashion aim at his heart Always be as cool as the animal himself Thus he armed me against the cunning of savage beasts by teaching me how to outwit them In hunting he would resume you will be guided by the habits of the animal you seek Remember that a moose stays in swampy or low land or between high mountains near a spring or lake for thirty to sixty days at a time Most large game moves about continually except the doe in the spring it is then a very easy matter to find her with the fawn Conceal yourself in a convenient place as soon as you observe any signs of the presence of either and then call with your birchen doe caller Whichever one hears you first will soon appear in your neighborhood But you must be very watchful or you may be made a fawn of by a large wild cat They understand the characteristic call of the doe perfectly well When you have any difficulty with a bear or a wild cat that is if the creature shows any signs of attacking you you must make him fully understand that you have seen him and are aware of his intentions If you are not well equipped for a pitched battle the only way to make him retreat is to take a long sharp pointed pole for a spear and rush toward him No wild beast will face this unless he is cornered and already wounded These fierce beasts are generally afraid of the common weapon of the larger animals the horns and if these are very long and sharp they dare not risk an open fight There is one exception to this rule the gray wolf will attack fiercely when very hungry But their courage depends upon their numbers in this they are like white men One wolf or two will never attack a man They will stampede a herd of buffaloes in order to get at the calves they will rush upon a herd of antelopes for these are helpless but they are always careful about attacking man Of this nature were the instructions of my uncle who was widely known at that time as among the greatest hunters of his tribe All boys were expected to endure hardship without complaint In savage warfare a young man must of course be an athlete and used to undergoing all sorts of privations He must be able to go without food and water for two or three days without displaying any weakness or to run for a day and a night without any rest He must be able to traverse a pathless and wild country without losing his way either in the day or night time He cannot refuse to do any of these things if he aspires to be a warrior Sometimes my uncle would waken me very early in the morning and challenge me to fast with him all day I had to accept the challenge We blackened our faces with charcoal so that every boy in the village would know that I was fasting for the day Then the little tempters would make my life a misery until the merciful sun hid behind the western hills I can scarcely recall the time when my stern teacher began to give sudden war whoops over my head in the morning while I was sound asleep He expected me to leap up with perfect presence of mind always ready to grasp a weapon of some sort and to give a shrill whoop in reply If I was sleepy or startled and hardly knew what I was about he would ridicule me and say that I need never expect to sell my scalp dear Often he would vary these tactics by shooting off his gun just outside of the lodge while I was yet asleep at the same time giving blood curdling yells After a time I became used to this When Indians went upon the war path it was their custom to try the new warriors thoroughly before coming to an engagement For instance when they were near a hostile camp they would select the novices to go after the water and make them do all sorts of things to prove their courage In accordance with this idea my uncle used to send me off after water when we camped after dark in a strange place Perhaps the country was full of wild beasts and for aught I knew there might be scouts from hostile bands of Indians lurking in that very neighborhood Yet I never objected for that would show cowardice I picked my way through the woods dipped my pail in the water and hurried back always careful to make as little noise as a cat Being only a boy my heart would leap at every crackling of a dry twig or distant hooting of an owl until at last I reached our teepee Then my uncle would perhaps say Ah Hakadah you are a thorough warrior empty out the precious contents of the pail and order me to go a second time Imagine how I felt But I wished to be a brave man as much as a white boy desires to be a great lawyer or even President of the United States Silently I would take the pail and endeavor to retrace my foot steps in the dark With all this our manners and morals were not neglected I was made to respect the adults and especially the aged I was not allowed to join in their discussions nor even to speak in their presence unless requested to do so Indian etiquette was very strict and among the requirements was that of avoiding the direct address A term of relationship or some title of courtesy was commonly used instead of the personal name by those who wished to show respect We were taught generosity to the poor and reverence for the Great Mystery Religion was the basis of all Indian training VI THE BOY HUNTER There was almost as much difference between the Indian boys who were brought up on the open prairies and those of the woods as between city and country boys The hunting of the prairie boys was limited and their knowledge of natural history imperfect They were as a rule good riders but in all round physical development much inferior to the red men of the forest Our hunting varied with the season of the year and the nature of the country which was for the time our home Our chief weapon was the bow and arrows and perhaps if we were lucky a knife was possessed by some one in the crowd In the olden times knives and hatchets were made from bone and sharp stones For fire we used a flint with a spongy piece of dry wood and a stone to strike with Another way of starting fire was for several of the boys to sit down in a circle and rub two pieces of dry spongy wood together one after another until the wood took fire We hunted in company a great deal though it was a common thing for a boy to set out for the woods quite alone and he usually enjoyed himself fully as much Our game consisted mainly of small birds rabbits squirrels and grouse Fishing too occupied much of our time We hardly ever passed a creek or a pond without searching for some signs of fish When fish were present we always managed to get some Fish lines were made of wild hemp sinew or horse hair We either caught fish with lines snared or speared them or shot them with bow and arrows In the fall we charmed them up to the surface by gently tickling them with a stick and quickly threw them out We have sometimes dammed the brooks and driven the larger fish into a willow basket made for that purpose It was part of our hunting to find new and strange things in the woods We examined the slightest sign of life and if a bird had scratched the leaves off the ground or a bear dragged up a root for his morning meal we stopped to speculate on the time it was done If we saw a large old tree with some scratches on its bark we concluded that a bear or some raccoons must be living there In that case we did not go any nearer than was necessary but later reported the incident at home An old deer track would at once bring on a warm discussion as to whether it was the track of a buck or a doe Generally at noon we met and compared our game noting at the same time the peculiar characteristics of everything we had killed It was not merely a hunt for we combined with it the study of animal life We also kept strict account of our game and thus learned who were the best shots among the boys I am sorry to say that we were merciless toward the birds We often took their eggs and their young ones My brother Chatanna and I once had a disagreeable adventure while bird hunting We were accustomed to catch in our hands young ducks and geese during the summer and while doing this we happened to find a crane s nest Of course we were delighted with our good luck But as it was already midsummer the young cranes two in number were rather large and they were a little way from the nest we also observed that the two old cranes were in a swampy place near by but as it was moulting time we did not suppose that they would venture on dry land So we proceeded to chase the young birds but they were fleet runners and it took us some time to come up with them Meanwhile the parent birds had heard the cries of their little ones and come to their rescue They were chasing us while we followed the birds It was really a perilous encounter Our strong bows finally gained the victory in a hand to hand struggle with the angry cranes but after that we hardly ever hunted a crane s nest Almost all birds make some resistance when their eggs or young are taken but they will seldom attack man fearlessly We used to climb large trees for birds of all kinds but we never undertook to get young owls unless they were on the ground The hooting owl especially is a dangerous bird to attack under these circumstances I was once trying to catch a yellow winged woodpecker in its nest when my arm became twisted and lodged in the deep hole so that I could not get it out without the aid of a knife but we were a long way from home and my only companion was a deaf mute cousin of mine I was about fifty feet up in the tree in a very uncomfortable position but I had to wait there for more than an hour before he brought me the knife with which I finally released myself Our devices for trapping small animals were rude but they were often successful For instance we used to gather up a peck or so of large sharp pointed burrs and scatter them in the rabbit s furrow like path In the morning we would find the little fellow sitting quietly in his tracks unable to move for the burrs stuck to his feet Another way of snaring rabbits and grouse was the following We made nooses of twisted horse hair which we tied very firmly to the top of a limber young tree then bent the latter down to the track and fastened the whole with a slip knot after adjusting the noose When the rabbit runs his head through the noose he pulls the slip knot and is quickly carried up by the spring of the young tree This is a good plan for the rabbit is out of harm s way as he swings high in the air Perhaps the most enjoyable of all was the chipmunk hunt We killed these animals at any time of year but the special time to hunt them was in March After the first thaw the chipmunks burrow a hole through the snow crust and make their first appearance for the season Sometimes as many as fifty will come together and hold a social reunion These gatherings occur early in the morning from daybreak to about nine o clock We boys learned this among other secrets of nature and got our blunt headed arrows together in good season for the chipmunk expedition We generally went in groups of six to a dozen or fifteen to see which would get the most On the evening before we selected several boys who could imitate the chipmunk s call with wild oat straws and each of these provided himself with a supply of straws The crust will hold the boys nicely at this time of the year Bright and early they all come together at the appointed place from which each group starts out in a different direction agreeing to meet somewhere at a given position of the sun My first experience of this kind is still well remembered It was a fine crisp March morning and the sun had not yet shown himself among the distant tree tops as we hurried along through the ghostly wood Presently we arrived at a place where there were many signs of the animals Then each of us selected a tree and took up his position behind it The chipmunk caller sat upon a log as motionless as he could and began to call Soon we heard the patter of little feet on the hard snow then we saw the chipmunks approaching from all directions Some stopped and ran experimentally up a tree or a log as if uncertain of the exact direction of the call others chased one another about In a few minutes the chipmunk caller was besieged with them Some ran all over his person others under him and still others ran up the tree against which he was sitting Each boy remained immovable until their leader gave the signal then a great shout arose and the chipmunks in their flight all ran up the different trees Now the shooting match began The little creatures seemed to realize their hopeless position they would try again and again to come down the trees and flee away from the deadly aim of the youthful hunters But they were shot down very fast and whenever several of them rushed toward the ground the little redskin hugged the tree and yelled frantically to scare them up again Each boy shoots always against the trunk of the tree so that the arrow may bound back to him every time otherwise when he had shot away all of them he would be helpless and another who had cleared his own tree would come and take away his game so there was warm competition Sometimes a desperate chipmunk would jump from the top of the tree in order to escape which was considered a joke on the boy who lost it and a triumph for the brave little animal At last all were killed or gone and then we went on to another place keeping up the sport until the sun came out and the chipmunks refused to answer the call VII EVENING IN THE LODGE I had been skating on that part of the lake where there was an overflow and came home somewhat cold I cannot say just how cold it was but it must have been intensely so for the trees were cracking all about me like pistol shots I did not mind because I was wrapped up in my buffalo robe with the hair inside and a wide leather belt held it about my loins My skates were nothing more than strips of basswood bark bound upon my feet I had taken off my frozen moccasins and put on dry ones in their places Where have you been and what have you been doing Uncheedah asked as she placed before me some roast venison in a wooden bowl Did you see any tracks of moose or bear No grandmother I have only been playing at the lower end of the lake I have something to ask you I said eating my dinner and supper together with all the relish of a hungry boy who has been skating in the cold for half a day I found this feather grandmother and I could not make out what tribe wear feathers in that shape Ugh I am not a man you had better ask your uncle Besides you should know it yourself by this time You are now old enough to think about eagle feathers I felt mortified by this reminder of my ignorance It seemed a reflection on me that I was not ambitious enough to have found all such matters out before Uncle you will tell me won t you I said in an appealing tone I am surprised my boy that you should fail to recognize this feather It is a Cree medicine feather and not a warrior s Then I said with much embarrassment you had better tell me again uncle the language of the feathers I have really forgotten it all The day was now gone the moon had risen but the cold had not lessened for the trunks of the trees were still snapping all around our teepee which was lighted and warmed by the immense logs which Uncheedah s industry had provided My uncle White Footprint now undertook to explain to me the significance of the eagle s feather The eagle is the most war like bird he began and the most kingly of all birds besides his feathers are unlike any others and these are the reasons why they are used by our people to signify deeds of bravery It is not true that when a man wears a feather bonnet each one of the feathers represents the killing of a foe or even a coup When a man wears an eagle feather upright upon his head he is supposed to have counted one of four coups upon his enemy Well then a coup does not mean the killing of an enemy No it is the after stroke or touching of the body after he falls It is so ordered because oftentimes the touching of an enemy is much more difficult to accomplish than the shooting of one from a distance It requires a strong heart to face the whole body of the enemy in order to count the coup on the fallen one who lies under cover of his kinsmen s fire Many a brave man has been lost in the attempt When a warrior approaches his foe dead or alive he calls upon the other warriors to witness by saying I Fearless Bear your brave again perform the brave deed of counting the first or second or third or fourth coup upon the body of the bravest of your enemies Naturally those who are present will see the act and be able to testify to it When they return the heralds as you know announce publicly all such deeds of valor which then become a part of the man s war record Any brave who would wear the eagle s feather must give proof of his right to do so When a brave is wounded in the same battle where he counted his coup he wears the feather hanging downward When he is wounded but makes no count he trims his feather and in that case it need not be an eagle feather All other feathers are merely ornaments When a warrior wears a feather with a round mark it means that he slew his enemy When the mark is cut into the feather and painted red it means that he took the scalp A brave who has been successful in ten battles is entitled to a war bonnet and if he is a recognized leader he is permitted to wear one with long trailing plumes Also those who have counted many coups may tip the ends of the feathers with bits of white or colored down Sometimes the eagle feather is tipped with a strip of weasel skin that means the wearer had the honor of killing scalping and counting the first coup upon the enemy all at the same time This feather you have found was worn by a Cree it is indiscriminately painted All other feathers worn by the common Indians mean nothing he added Tell me uncle whether it would be proper for me to wear any feathers at all if I have never gone upon the war path You could wear any other kind of feathers but not an eagle s replied my uncle although sometimes one is worn on great occasions by the child of a noted man to indicate the father s dignity and position The fire had gone down somewhat so I pushed the embers together and wrapped my robe more closely about me Now and then the ice on the lake would burst with a loud report like thunder Uncheedah was busy re stringing one of uncle s old snow shoes There were two different kinds that he wore one with a straight toe and long the other shorter and with an upturned toe She had one of the shoes fastened toe down between sticks driven into the ground while she put in some new strings and tightened the others Aunt Four Stars was beading a new pair of moccasins Wabeda the dog the companion of my boyhood days was in trouble because he insisted upon bringing his extra bone into the teepee while Uncheedah was determined that he should not I sympathized with him because I saw the matter as he did If he should bury it in the snow outside I knew Shunktokecha the coyote would surely steal it I knew just how anxious Wabeda was about his bone It was a fat bone I mean a bone of a fat deer and all Indians know how much better they are than the other kind Wabeda always hated to see a good thing go to waste His eyes spoke words to me for he and I had been friends for a long time When I was afraid of anything in the woods he would get in front of me at once and gently wag his tail He always made it a point to look directly in my face His kind large eyes gave me a thousand assurances When I was perplexed he would hang about me until he understood the situation Many times I believed he saved my life by uttering the dog word in time Most animals even the dangerous grizzly do not care to be seen when the two legged kind and his dog are about When I feared a surprise by a bear or a gray wolf I would say to Wabeda Now my dog give your war whoop and immediately he would sit up on his haunches and bark to beat the band as you white boys say When a bear or wolf heard the noise he would be apt to retreat Sometimes I helped Wabeda and gave a war whoop of my own This drove the deer away as well but it relieved my mind When he appealed to me on this occasion therefore I said Come my dog let us bury your bone so that no Shunktokecha will take it He appeared satisfied with my suggestion so we went out together We dug in the snow and buried our bone wrapped up in a piece of old blanket partly burned then we covered it up again with snow We knew that the coyote would not touch anything burnt I did not put it up a tree because Wabeda always objected to that and I made it a point to consult his wishes whenever I could I came in and Wabeda followed me with two short rib bones in his mouth Apparently he did not care to risk those delicacies There exclaimed Uncheedah you still insist upon bringing in some sort of bone but I begged her to let him gnaw them inside because it was so cold Having been granted this privilege he settled himself at my back and I became absorbed in some specially nice arrows that uncle was making Oh uncle you must put on three feathers to all of them so that they can fly straight I suggested Yes but if there are only two feathers they will fly faster he answered Woow Wabeda uttered his suspicions Woow he said again and rushed for the entrance of the teepee He kicked me over as he went and scattered the burning embers En na he na Uncheedah exclaimed but he was already outside Wow wow wow Wow wow wow A deep guttural voice answered him Out I rushed with my bow and arrows in my hand Come uncle come A big cinnamon bear I shouted as I emerged from the teepee Uncle sprang out and in a moment he had sent a swift arrow through the bear s heart The animal fell dead He had just begun to dig up Wabeda s bone when the dog s quick ear had heard the sound Ah uncle Wabeda and I ought to have at least a little eaglet s feather for this I too sent my small arrow into the bear before he fell I exclaimed But I thought all bears ought to be in their lodges in the winter time What was this one doing at this time of the year and night Well said my uncle I will tell you Among the tribes some are naturally lazy The cinnamon bear is the lazy one of his tribe He alone sleeps out of doors in the winter and because he has not a warm bed he is soon hungry Sometimes he lives in the hollow trunk of a tree where he has made a bed of dry grass but when the night is very cold like to night he has to move about to keep himself from freezing and as he prowls around he gets hungry We dragged the huge carcass within our lodge Oh what nice claws he has uncle I exclaimed eagerly Can I have them for my necklace Illustration Oh what nice claws he has uncle I exclaimed eagerly Page sixty nine It is only the old medicine men who wear them regularly The son of a great warrior who has killed a grizzly may wear them upon a public occasion he explained And you are just like my father and are considered the best hunter among the Santees and Sissetons You have killed many grizzlies so that no one can object to my bear s claw necklace I said appealingly White Foot print smiled My boy you shall have them he said but it is always better to earn them yourself He cut the claws off carefully for my use Tell me uncle whether you could wear these claws all the time I asked Yes I am entitled to wear them but they are so heavy and uncomfortable he replied with a superior air At last the bear had been skinned and dressed and we all resumed our usual places Uncheedah was particularly pleased to have some more fat for her cooking Now grandmother tell me the story of the bear s fat I shall be so happy if you will I begged It is a good story and it is true You should know it by heart and gain a lesson from it she replied It was in the forests of Minnesota in the country that now belongs to the Ojibways From the Bedawakanton Sioux village a young married couple went into the woods to get fresh venison The snow was deep the ice was thick Far away in the woods they pitched their lonely teepee The young man was a well known hunter and his wife a good maiden of the village He hunted entirely on snow shoes because the snow was very deep His wife had to wear snow shoes too to get to the spot where they pitched their tent It was thawing the day they went out so their path was distinct after the freeze came again The young man killed many deer and bears His wife was very busy curing the meat and trying out the fat while he was away hunting each day In the evenings she kept on trying the fat He sat on one side of the teepee and she on the other One evening she had just lowered a kettle of fat to cool and as she looked into the hot fat she saw the face of an Ojibway scout looking down at them through the smoke hole She said nothing nor did she betray herself in any way After a little she said to her husband in a natural voice Marpeetopah some one is looking at us through the smoke hole and I think it is an enemy s scout Then Marpeetopah Four skies took up his bow and arrows and began to straighten and dry them for the next day s hunt talking and laughing meanwhile Suddenly he turned and sent an arrow upward killing the Ojibway who fell dead at their door Quick Wadutah he exclaimed you must hurry home upon our trail I will stay here When this scout does not return the war party may come in a body or send another scout If only one comes I can soon dispatch him and then I will follow you If I do not do that they will overtake us in our flight Wadutah Scarlet protested and begged to be allowed to stay with her husband but at last she came away to get re inforcements Then Marpeetopah Four skies put more sticks on the fire so that the teepee might be brightly lit and show him the way He then took the scalp of the enemy and proceeded on his track until he came to the upturned root of a great tree There he spread out his arrows and laid out his tomahawk Soon two more scouts were sent by the Ojibway war party to see what was the trouble and why the first one failed to come back He heard them as they approached They were on snow shoes When they came close to him he shot an arrow into the foremost As for the other in his effort to turn quickly his snow shoes stuck in the deep snow and detained him so Marpeetopah killed them both Quickly he took the scalps and followed Wadutah He ran hard But the Ojibways suspected something wrong and came to the lonely teepee to find all their scouts had been killed They followed the path of Marpeetopah and Wadutah to the main village and there a great battle was fought on the ice Many were killed on both sides It was after this that the Sioux moved to the Mississippi river I was sleepy by this time and I rolled myself up in my buffalo robe and fell asleep PART TWO STORIES OF REAL INDIANS I WINONA S CHILDHOOD Hush hushaby little woman Be brave and weep not The spirits sleep not Tis they who ordain To woman pain Hush hushaby little woman Now all things bearing A new gift sharing From those above To woman love Sioux Lullaby Chinto weyanna Yes indeed she is a real little woman declares the old grandmother as she receives and critically examines the tiny bit of humanity There is no remark as to the color of its hair or eyes both so black as almost to be blue but the old woman scans sharply the delicate profile of the baby face Ah she has the nose of her ancestors Lips thin as a leaf and eyes bright as stars in midwinter she exclaims as she passes on the furry bundle to the other grandmother for her inspection Tokee she is pretty enough to win a twinkle from the evening star remarks that smiling personage And what shall her name be Winona the First born of course That is hers by right of birth Still it may not fit her One must prove herself worthy in order to retain that honorable name Ugh retorts the first grandmother she can at least bear it on probation Tosh tosh the other assents Thus the unconscious little Winona has passed the first stage of the Indian s christening Presently she is folded into a soft white doeskin well lined with the loose down of cattails and snugly laced into an upright oaken cradle the front of which is a richly embroidered buckskin bag with porcupine quills and deer s hoofs suspended from its profuse fringes This gay cradle is strapped upon the second grandmother s back and that dignitary walks off with the newcomer You must come with me she says We shall go among the father and mother trees and hear them speak with their thousand tongues that you may know their language forever I will hang the cradle of the woman child upon Utuhu the oak and she shall hear the love sighs of the pine maiden In this fashion Winona is introduced to nature and becomes at once nature born in accord with the beliefs and practices of the wild red man The baby girl is called Winona for some months when the medicine man is summoned and requested to name publicly the first born daughter of Chetonska the White Hawk but not until he has received a present of a good pony with a finely painted buffalo robe It is usual to confer another name besides that of the First born which may be resumed later if the maiden proves worthy The name Winona implies much of honor It means charitable kind helpful all that an eldest sister should be The herald goes around the ring of lodges announcing in singsong fashion the christening and inviting everybody to a feast in honor of the event A real American christening is always a gala occasion when much savage wealth is distributed among the poor and old people Winona has only just walked and this fact is also announced with additional gifts A well born child is ever before the tribal eye and in the tribal ear as every little step in its progress toward manhood or womanhood the first time of walking or swimming first shot with bow and arrow if a boy first pair of moccasins made if a girl is announced publicly with feasting and the giving of presents So Winona receives her individual name of Tatiyopa or Her Door It is symbolic like most Indian names and implies that the door of the bearer is hospitable and her home attractive The two grandmothers who have carried the little maiden upon their backs now tell and sing to her by turns all the legends of their most noted female ancestors from the twin sisters of the old story the maidens who married among the star people of the sky down to their own mothers All their lullabies are feminine and designed to impress upon her tender mind the life and duties of her sex As soon as she is old enough to play with dolls she plays mother in all seriousness and gravity She is dressed like a miniature woman and her dolls are clad likewise in garments of doeskin to her ankles adorned with long fringes embroidered with porcupine quills and dyed with root dyes in various colors Her little blanket or robe with which she shyly drapes or screens her head and shoulders is the skin of a buffalo calf or a deer soft white embroidered on the smooth side and often with the head and hoofs left on You must never forget my little daughter that you are a woman like myself Do always those things that you see me do her mother often admonishes her Even the language of the Sioux has its feminine dialect and the tiny girl would be greatly abashed were it ever needful to correct her for using a masculine termination This mother makes for her little daughter a miniature copy of every rude tool that she uses in her daily tasks There is a little scraper of elk horn to scrape raw hides preparatory to tanning them another scraper of a different shape for tanning bone knives and stone mallets for pounding choke cherries and jerked meat While her mother is bending over a large buffalo hide stretched and pinned upon the ground standing upon it and scraping off the fleshy portion as nimbly as a carpenter shaves a board with his plane Winona at five years of age stands upon a corner of the great hide and industriously scrapes away with her tiny instrument When the mother stops to sharpen her tool the little woman always sharpens hers also Perhaps there is water to be fetched in bags made from the dried pericardium of an animal the girl brings some in a smaller water bag When her mother goes for wood she carries one or two sticks on her back She pitches her play teepee to form an exact copy of her mother s Her little belongings are nearly all practical and her very play is real II WINONA S GIRLHOOD Braver than the bravest You sought honors at death s door Could you not remember One who weeps at home Could you not remember me Braver than the bravest You sought honors more than love Dear I weep yet I am not a coward My heart weeps for thee My heart weeps when I remember thee Sioux Love Song The sky is blue overhead peeping through window like openings in a roof of green leaves Right between a great pine and a birch tree their soft doeskin shawls are spread and there sit two Sioux maidens amid their fineries variously colored porcupine quills for embroidery laid upon sheets of thin birch bark and moccasin tops worked in colors like autumn leaves It is Winona and her friend Miniyata They have arrived at the period during which the young girl is carefully secluded from her brothers and cousins and future lovers and retires as it were into the nunnery of the woods behind a veil of thick foliage Thus she is expected to develop her womanly qualities In meditation and solitude entirely alone or with a chosen companion of her own sex and age she gains a secret strength as she studies the art of womanhood from nature herself Come let us practise our sacred dance says one to the other Each crowns her glossy head with a wreath of wild flowers and they dance with slow steps around the white birch singing meanwhile the sacred songs Now upon the lake that stretches blue to the eastward there appears a distant canoe a mere speck no bigger than a bird far off against the shining sky See the lifting of the paddles exclaims Winona Like the leaping of a trout upon the water suggests Miniyata I hope they will not discover us yet I would like to know who they are remarks the other innocently The birch canoe approaches swiftly with two young men plying the light cedar paddles The girls now settle down to their needle work quite as if they had never laughed or danced or woven garlands bending over their embroidery in perfect silence Surely they would not wish to attract attention for the two sturdy young warriors have already landed They pick up the canoe and lay it well up on the bank out of sight Then one procures a strong pole They lift a buck deer from the canoe not a mark upon it save for the bullet wound the deer looks as if it were sleeping They tie the hind legs together and the fore legs also and carry it between them on the pole Quickly and cleverly they do all this and now they start forward and come unexpectedly upon the maidens retreat They pause for an instant in mute apology but the girls smile their forgiveness and the youths hurry on toward the village Winona has now attended her first maidens feast and is considered eligible to marriage She may receive young men but not in public or in a social way for such is not the custom of the Sioux When he speaks she need not answer him unless she chooses It was no disgrace to the chief s daughter in the old days to work with her hands Indeed their standard of worth was the willingness to work but not for the sake of accumulation only in order to give Winona has learned to prepare skins to remove the hair and tan the skin of a deer so that it may be made into moccasins within three days She has a bone tool for each stage of the conversion of the stiff rawhide into velvety leather She has been taught the art of painting tents and rawhide cases and the manufacture of garments of all kinds Generosity is a trait that is highly developed in the Sioux woman She makes many moccasins and other articles of clothing for her male relatives or for any who are not well provided She loves to see her brother the best dressed among the young men and the moccasins especially of a young brave are the pride of his woman kind Her own person is neatly attired but ordinarily with great simplicity Her doeskin gown has wide flowing sleeves the neck is low but not so low as is the evening dress of society Her moccasins are plain her leggins close fitting and not as high as her brother s She parts her smooth jet black hair in the middle and plaits it in two In the old days she used to do it in one plait wound around with wampum Her ornaments sparingly worn are beads elks teeth and a touch of red paint No feathers are worn by the woman unless in a sacred dance She is supposed to be always occupied with some feminine pursuit or engaged in some social affair which also is strictly feminine as a rule There is an etiquette of sitting and standing which is strictly observed The woman must never raise her knees or cross her feet when seated She seats herself on the ground sidewise with both feet under her Notwithstanding her modesty and undemonstrative ways there is no lack of mirth and relaxation for Winona among her girl companions In summer swimming and playing in the water is a favorite amusement She even imitates with the soles of her feet the peculiar resonant sound that the beaver makes with her large flat tail upon the surface of the water She is a graceful swimmer keeping the feet together and waving them backward and forward like the tail of a fish Nearly all her games are different from those of the men She has a sport of wand throwing which develops fine muscles of the shoulder and back The wands are about eight feet long and taper gradually from an inch and a half to half an inch in diameter Some of them are artistically made with heads of bone and horn so that it is remarkable to what a distance they may be made to slide over the ground In the feminine game of ball which is something like shinny the ball is driven with curved sticks between two goals It is played with from two or three to a hundred on a side and a game between two bands or villages is a picturesque event A common indoor diversion is the deer s foot game played with six deer hoofs on a string ending in a bone or steel awl The object is to throw it in such a way as to catch one or more hoofs on the point of the awl a feat which requires no little dexterity Another is played with marked plum stones in a bowl which are thrown like dice and count according to the side that is turned uppermost Winona s wooing is a typical one As with any other people love making is more or less in vogue at all times of the year but more especially at midsummer during the characteristic reunions and festivities of that season The young men go about usually in pairs and the maidens do likewise They may meet by chance at any time of day in the woods or at the spring but oftenest seek to do so after dark just outside the teepee The girl has her companion and he has his for the sake of propriety or protection The conversation is carried on in a whisper so that even these chaperons do not hear At the sound of the drum on summer evenings dances are begun within the circular rows of teepees but without the circle the young men promenade in pairs Each provides himself with the plaintive flute and plays the simple cadences of his people while his person is completely covered with his fine robe so that he cannot be recognized by the passer by At every pause in the melody he gives his yodel like love call to which the girls respond with their musical sing song laughter Matosapa has improved every opportunity until Winona has at last shyly admitted her willingness to listen For a whole year he has been compelled at intervals to repeat the story of his love Through the autumn hunting of the buffalo and the long cold winter he often presents her kinsfolk with his game At the next midsummer the parents on both sides are made acquainted with the betrothal and they at once begin preparations for the coming wedding Provisions and delicacies of all kinds are laid aside for a feast Matosapa s sisters and his girl cousins are told of the approaching event and they too prepare for it since it is their duty to dress or adorn the bride with garments made by their own hands The bride is ceremoniously delivered to her husband s people together with presents of rich clothing collected from all her clan which she afterward distributes among her new relations Winona is carried in a travois handsomely decorated and is received with equal ceremony III A MIDSUMMER FEAST The Wahpetonwan village on the banks of the Minnesota river was alive with the newly arrived guests and the preparations for the coming event Meat of wild game had been put away with much care during the previous fall in anticipation of this feast There was wild rice and the choicest of dried venison that had been kept all winter as well as freshly dug turnips ripe berries and an abundance of fresh meat Along the edge of the woods the teepees were pitched in groups or semi circles each band distinct from the others The teepee of Mankato or Blue Earth was pitched in a conspicuous spot Just over the entrance was painted in red and yellow a picture of a pipe and directly opposite this the rising sun The painting was symbolic of welcome and good will to men under the bright sun A meeting was held to appoint some medicine man to make the balls that were to be used in the lacrosse contest and presently the herald announced that this honor had been conferred upon old Chankpee yuhah or Keeps the Club while every other man of his profession was disappointed Towards evening he appeared in the circle leading by the hand a boy about four years old Closely the little fellow observed every motion of the man nothing escaped his vigilant black eyes which seemed constantly to grow brighter and larger while his glossy black hair was plaited and wound around his head like that of a Celestial He wore a bit of swan s down in each ear which formed a striking contrast with the child s complexion Further than this the boy was painted according to the fashion of the age He held in his hands a miniature bow and arrows The medicine man drew himself up in an admirable attitude and proceeded to make his short speech Wahpetonwans you boast that you run down the elk you can outrun the Ojibways Before you all I dedicate to you this red ball Kaposias you claim that no one has a lighter foot than you you declare that you can endure running a whole day without water To you I dedicate this black ball Either you or the Leaf Dwellers will have to drop your eyes and bow your head when the game is over I wish to announce that if the Wahpetonwans should win this little warrior shall bear the name Ohiyesa winner through life but if the Light Lodges should win let the name be given to any child appointed by them The ground selected for the great game was on a narrow strip of land between a lake and the river It was about three quarters of a mile long and a quarter of a mile in width The spectators had already ranged themselves all along the two sides as well as at the two ends which were somewhat higher than the middle The soldiers appointed to keep order furnished much of the entertainment of the day They painted artistically and tastefully according to the Indian fashion not only their bodies but also their ponies and clubs They were so strict in enforcing the laws that no one could venture with safety within a few feet of the limits of the field Now all of the minor events and feasts occupying several days time had been observed Heralds on ponies backs announced that all who intended to participate in the final game were requested to repair to the ground also that if any one bore a grudge against another he was implored to forget his ill feeling until the contest should be over The most powerful men were stationed at the half way ground while the fast runners were assigned to the back It was an impressive spectacle a fine collection of agile forms almost stripped of garments and painted in wild imitation of the rainbow and sunset sky on human canvas Some had undertaken to depict the Milky Way across their tawny bodies and one or two made a bold attempt to reproduce the lightning Others contented themselves with painting the figure of some fleet animal or swift bird on their muscular chests At the middle of the ground were stationed four immense men magnificently formed A fifth approached this group paused a moment and then threw his head back gazed up into the sky in the manner of a cock and gave a smooth clear operatic tone Instantly the little black ball went up between the two middle rushers in the midst of yells cheers and war whoops Both men endeavored to catch it in the air but alas each interfered with the other then the guards on each side rushed upon them For a time a hundred lacrosse sticks vied with each other and the wriggling human flesh and paint were all one could see through the cloud of dust Suddenly there shot swiftly through the air toward the south toward the Kaposias goal the ball There was a general cheer from their adherents which echoed back from the white cliff on the opposite side of the Minnesota As the ball flew through the air two adversaries were ready to receive it The Kaposia quickly met the ball but failed to catch it in his netted bag for the other had swung his up like a flash Thus it struck the ground but had no opportunity to bound up when a Wahpeton pounced upon it like a cat and slipped out of the grasp of his opponents A mighty cheer thundered through the air The warrior who had undertaken to pilot the little sphere was risking much for he must dodge a host of Kaposias before he could gain any ground He was alert and agile now springing like a panther now leaping like a deer over a stooping opponent who tried to seize him around the waist Every opposing player was upon his heels while those of his own side did all in their power to clear the way for him But it was all in vain He only gained fifty paces Thus the game went First one side then the other would gain an advantage and then it was lost until the herald proclaimed that it was time to change the ball No victory was in sight for either side After a few minutes rest the game was resumed The red ball was now tossed in the air in the usual way No sooner had it descended than one of the rushers caught it and away it went northward again it was fortunate for it was advanced by one of the same side The scene was now one of the wildest excitement and confusion At last the northward flight of the ball was checked for a moment and a desperate struggle ensued The ball had not been allowed to come to the surface since it reached this point for there were more than a hundred men who scrambled for it Suddenly a warrior shot out of the throng like the ball itself Then some of the players shouted Look out for Antelope But it was too late The little sphere had already nestled into Antelope s palm and that fleetest of Wahpetons had thrown down his lacrosse stick and set a determined eye upon the northern goal Such a speed He had cleared almost all the opponents guards there were but two more These were exceptional runners of the Kaposias As he approached them in his almost irresistible speed every savage heart thumped louder in the Indian s dusky bosom In another moment there would be a defeat for the Kaposias or a prolongation of the game The two men with a determined look approached their foe like two panthers prepared to spring yet he neither slackened his speed nor deviated from his course A crash a mighty shout the two Kaposias collided and the swift Antelope had won the laurels The turmoil and commotion at the victors camp were indescribable A few beats of a drum were heard after which the criers hurried along the lines announcing the last act to be performed at the camp of the Leaf Dwellers The day had been a perfect one Every event had been a success and as a matter of course the old people were happy for they largely profited by these occasions Within the circle formed by the general assembly sat in a group the members of the common council Blue Earth arose and in a few appropriate and courteous remarks assured his guests that it was not selfishness that led his braves to carry off the honors of the last event but that this was a friendly contest in which each band must assert its prowess In memory of this victory the boy would now receive his name A loud Ho o o of approbation reverberated from the edge of the forest upon the Minnesota s bank Half frightened the little fellow was now brought into the circle looking very much as if he were about to be executed Cheer after cheer went up for the awe stricken boy Chankpee yuhah the medicine man proceeded to confer the name Ohiyesa or Winner shall be thy name henceforth Be brave be patient and thou shalt always win Thy name is Ohiyesa IV THE FAITHFULNESS OF LONG EARS Away beyond the Thin Hills above the Big Lone Tree upon the Powder river the Uncpapa Sioux had celebrated their Sun Dance some forty years ago It was midsummer and the red folk were happy They lacked for nothing The yellowish green flat on either side of the Powder was studded with wild flowers and the cottonwood trees were in full leaf One large circle of buffalo skin teepees formed the movable village The tribal rites had all been observed and the usual summer festivities enjoyed to the full The camp as it broke up divided itself in three parts each of which had determined to seek a favorite hunting ground One band journeyed west toward the Tongue river One followed a tributary of the Powder to the south The third merely changed camp on account of the grazing for ponies and for four days remained near the old place The party that went west did not fail to realize the perilous nature of their wanderings for they were trespassing upon the country of the warlike Crows On the third day at sunrise the Sioux crier s voice resounded in the valley of the Powder announcing that the lodges must be razed and the villagers must take up their march Breakfast of jerked buffalo meat had been served and the women were adjusting their packs not without much chatter and apparent confusion Weeko Beautiful Woman the young wife of the war chief Shunkaska who had made many presents at the dances in honor of her twin boys now gave one of her remaining ponies to a poor old woman whose only beast of burden a large dog had died during the night This made it necessary to shift the packs of the others Nakpa or Long Ears her kitten like gray mule which had heretofore been honored with the precious burden of the twin babies was to be given a heavier and more cumbersome load Weeko s two year old spotted pony was selected to carry the babies Accordingly the two children in their gorgeously beaded buckskin hoods were suspended upon either side of the pony s saddle As Weeko s first born they were beautifully dressed even the saddle and bridle were daintily worked by her own hands The caravan was now in motion and Weeko started all her ponies after the leader while she adjusted the mule s clumsy burden of kettles and other household gear In a moment Go on let us see how you move with your new load Go on she exclaimed again with a light blow of the horse hair lariat as the animal stood perfectly still Nakpa simply gave an angry side glance at her load and shifted her position once or twice Then she threw herself headlong into the air and landed stiff legged uttering at the same time her unearthly protest First she dove straight through the crowd then proceeded in a circle her heels describing wonderful curves and sweeps in the air Her pack too began to come to pieces and to take forced flights from her undignified body and heels in the midst of the screams of women and children the barking of dogs and the war whoops of the amused young braves The cowskin tent became detached from her saddle and a moment later Nakpa stood free Her sides worked like a bellows as she stood there meekly indignant apparently considering herself to be the victim of an uncalled for misunderstanding I should put an arrow through her at once only she is not worth a good arrow said Shunkaska or White Dog the husband of Weeko At his wife s answer he opened his eyes in surprised displeasure No she shall have her own pack again She wants her twins I ought never to have taken them from her Weeko approached Nakpa as she stood alone and unfriended in the face of her little world all of whom considered that she had committed the unpardonable sin As for her she evidently felt that her misfortunes had not been of her own making She gave a hesitating sidelong look at her mistress Nakpa you should not have acted so I knew you were stronger than the others therefore I gave you that load said Weeko in a conciliatory tone and patted her on the nose Come now you shall have your own pet pack and she led her back to where the young pony stood silently with the babies Nakpa threw back her ears and cast savage looks at him while Shunkaska with no small annoyance gathered together as much as he could of their scattered household effects The sleeping brown skinned babies in their chrysalis like hoods were gently lowered from the pony s back and attached securely to Nakpa s padded wooden saddle The family pots and kettles were divided among the pack ponies Order was restored and the village once more in motion Come now Nakpa you have your wish You must take good care of my babies Be good because I have trusted you murmured the young mother in her softest tones Really Weeko you have some common ground with Nakpa for you both always want to have your own way and stick to it too I tell you I fear this Long Ears She is not to be trusted with babies remarked Shunkaska with a good deal of severity But his wife made no reply for she well knew that though he might criticize he would not actually interfere with her domestic arrangements He now started ahead to join the men in advance of the slow moving procession thus leaving her in undivided charge of her household One or two of the pack ponies were not well trained and required all her attention Nakpa had been a faithful servant until her escapade of the morning and she was now obviously satisfied with her mistress arrangements She walked alongside with her lariat dragging and perfectly free to do as she pleased Some hours later the party ascended a slope from the river bottom to cross over the divide which lay between the Powder River and a tributary stream The ford was deep with a swift current Here and there a bald butte stood out in full relief against the brilliant blue sky Whoo whoo came the blood curdling signal of danger from the front It was no unfamiliar sound the rovers knew it only too well It meant sudden death or at best a cruel struggle and frantic flight Terrified yet self possessed the women turned to fly while yet there was time Instantly the mother looked to Nakpa who carried on either side of the saddle her precious boys She hurriedly examined the fastenings to see that all was secure and then caught her swiftest pony for like all Indian women she knew just what was happening and that while her husband was engaged in front with the enemy she must seek safety with her babies Hardly was she in the saddle when a heartrending war whoop sounded on their flank and she knew that they were surrounded Instinctively she reached for her husband s second quiver of arrows which was carried by one of the pack ponies Alas the Crow warriors were already upon them The ponies became unmanageable and the wild screams of women and children pierced the awful confusion Quick as a flash Weeko turned again to her babies but Nakpa had already disappeared When the Crows made their flank charge Nakpa apparently appreciated the situation To save herself and the babies she took a desperate chance She fled straight through the attacking force When the warriors came howling upon her in great numbers she at once started back the way she had come to the camp left behind They had travelled nearly three days To be sure they did not travel more than fifteen miles a day but it was full forty miles to cover before dark Look look exclaimed a warrior two babies hung from the saddle of a mule No one heeded this man s call and his arrow did not touch Nakpa or either of the boys but it struck the thick part of the saddle over the mule s back Whoo whoo yelled another Crow to his comrades the Sioux have dispatched a runner to get reinforcements There he goes down on the flat Now he has almost reached the river bottom It was only Nakpa She laid back her ears and stretched out more and more to gain the river for she realized that when she had crossed the ford the Crows would not pursue her farther Now she had reached the bank With the intense heat from her exertions she was extremely nervous and she imagined a warrior behind every bush Yet she had enough sense left to realize that she must not satisfy her thirst She tried the bottom with her forefoot then waded carefully into the deep stream She kept her big ears well to the front as she swam to catch the slightest sound As she stepped on the opposite shore she shook herself and the boys vigorously then pulled a few mouthfuls of grass and started on Soon one of the babies began to cry and the other was not long in joining him Nakpa did not know what to do She gave a gentle whinny and both babies apparently stopped to listen then she took up an easy gait as if to put them to sleep These tactics answered only for a time As she fairly flew over the lowlands the babies hunger increased and they screamed so loud that a passing coyote had to sit upon his haunches and wonder what in the world the fleeing long eared horse was carrying on his saddle Even magpies and crows flew near as if to ascertain the meaning of this curious sound Nakpa now came to the Little Trail creek a tributary of the Powder not far from the old camp There she swerved aside so suddenly as almost to jerk her babies out of their cradles Two gray wolves one on each side approached her growling low their white teeth showing Never in her humble life had Nakpa been in more desperate straits The larger of the wolves came fiercely forward to engage her attention while his mate was to attack her behind and cut her hamstrings But for once the pair had made a miscalculation The mule used her front hoofs vigorously on the foremost wolf while her hind ones were doing even more effective work The larger wolf soon went limping away with a broken hip and the one in the rear received a deep cut on the jaw which proved an effectual discouragement A little further on an Indian hunter drew near on horseback but Nakpa did not pause or slacken her pace On she fled through the long dry grass of the river bottoms while her babies slept again from sheer exhaustion Toward sunset she entered the Sioux camp amid great excitement for some one had spied her afar off and the boys and the dogs announced her coming Whoo whoo Weeko s Nakpa has come back with the twins Whoo whoo exclaimed the men Tokee tokee cried the women Zeezeewin a sister to Weeko who was in the village came forward and released the children as Nakpa gave a low whinny and stopped Sing a Brave Heart song for the Long Eared One She has escaped alone with her charge She is entitled to wear an eagle s feather Look at the arrow in her saddle and more she has a knife wound in her jaw and an arrow cut on her hind leg No those are the marks of a wolf s teeth She has passed through many dangers and saved two chief s sons who will some day make the Crows sorry for this day s work The speaker was an old man who thus addressed the fast gathering throng Zeezeewin now came forward again with an eagle feather and some white paint in her hands The young men rubbed Nakpa down and the feather marked with red to indicate her wounds was fastened to her mane Shoulders and hips were touched with red paint to show her endurance in running Then the crier praising her brave deed in heroic verse led her around the camp inside of the circle of teepees All the people stood outside their lodges and listened respectfully for the Dakota loves well to honor the faithful and the brave During the next day riders came in from the ill fated party bringing the sad news of the fight and heavy loss Late in the afternoon came Weeko her face swollen with crying her beautiful hair cut short in mourning her garments torn and covered with dust and blood Her husband had fallen in the fight and her twin boys she supposed to have been taken captive by the Crows Singing in a hoarse voice the praises of her departed warrior she entered the camp As she approached her sister s teepee there stood Nakpa still wearing her honorable decorations At the same moment Zeezeewin came out to meet her with both babies in her arms Mechinkshee mechinkshee my sons my sons was all that the poor mother could say as she all but fell from the saddle to the ground The despised Long Ears had not betrayed her trust V SNANA S FAWN The Little Missouri was in her spring fulness and the hills among which she found her way to the Great Muddy were profusely adorned with colors much like those worn by the wild red man upon a holiday Between the gorgeous buttes and rainbow tinted ridges there were narrow plains broken here and there by dry creeks or gulches and these again were clothed scantily with poplars and sad colored bull berry bushes 
6978-92210-0000	train-other-500	while the bare spots were purple with the wild Dakota crocuses
6978-92210-0001	train-other-500	Upon the lowest of a series of natural terraces there stood on this May morning a young Sioux girl whose graceful movements were not unlike those of a doe which chanced to be lurking in a neighboring gulch On the upper plains not far away were her young companions all busily employed with the wewoptay as it is called
6978-92210-0002	train-other-500	the sharp pointed stick with which the Sioux women dig wild turnips They were gayly gossiping together or each humming a love song as she worked only Snana stood somewhat apart from the rest in fact concealed by the crest of the ridge
6978-92210-0003	train-other-500	It was now full born day The sun shone hot upon the bare ground and the drops stood upon Snana s forehead as she plied her long pole There was a cool spring in the dry creek bed near by
6978-92210-0004	train-other-500	well hidden by a clump of choke cherry bushes and she turned thither to cool her thirsty throat In the depths of the ravine her eye caught a familiar footprint the track of a doe with the young fawn beside it The hunting instinct arose within
6978-92210-0005	train-other-500	It will be a great feat if I can find and take from her the babe The little tawny skin shall be beautifully dressed by my mother
none	none	 The legs and the nose shall be embossed with porcupine quills It will be my work bag she said to herself As she stole forward on the fresh trail she scanned every nook every clump of bushes There was a sudden rustle from within a grove of wild plum trees thickly festooned with grape and clematis and the doe mother bounded away as carelessly as if she were never to return 
6978-92210-0006	train-other-500	Ah a mother s ruse Snana entered the thorny enclosure which was almost a rude teepee and tucked away in the further most corner lay something with a trout like speckled tawny coat She bent over it The fawn was apparently sleeping
6978-92210-0007	train-other-500	Presently its eyes moved a bit and a shiver passed through its subtle body Thou shalt not die thy skin shall not become my work bag unconsciously the maiden spoke
6978-92210-0008	train-other-500	The mother sympathy had taken hold on her mind She picked the fawn up tenderly bound its legs and put it on her back to carry like an Indian babe in the folds of her robe
none	none	 I cannot leave you alone Tachinchala Your mother is not here Our hunters will soon return by this road and your mother has left behind her two plain tracks leading to this thicket she murmured The wild creature struggled vigorously for a minute and then became quiet Its graceful head protruded from the elk skin robe just over Snana s shoulder She was slowly climbing the slope with her burden when suddenly like an apparition the doe mother stood before her The fawn called loudly when it was first seized 
6978-92210-0009	train-other-500	and the mother was not too far away to hear Now she called frantically for her child at the same time stamping with her delicate forefeet Yes sister you are right she is yours but you cannot save her to day
6978-92210-0010	train-other-500	The hunters will soon be here Let me keep her for you I will return her to you safely And hear me O sister of the woods that some day I may become the mother of a noble race of warriors and of fine women as handsome as you are
6978-92210-0011	train-other-500	At this moment the quick eyes of the Indian girl detected something strange in the doe s actions She glanced in every direction and behold
none	none	 a grizzly bear was cautiously approaching the group from a considerable distance Run run sister I shall save your child if I can she cried 
6978-92210-0012	train-other-500	and flew for the nearest scrub oak on the edge of the bank Up the tree she scrambled with the fawn still securely bound to her back The grizzly came on with teeth exposed and the doe mother in her flight came between him and the tree
6978-92210-0013	train-other-500	giving a series of indignant snorts as she ran
none	none	 and so distracted Mato from his object of attack but only for a few seconds then on he came Desist O brave Mato It does not become a great medicine man to attack a helpless woman with a burden upon her back Snana spoke as if the huge brute could understand her and indeed the Indians hold that wild animals understand intuitively when appealed to by human beings in distress Yet he replied only with a hoarse growl as rising upon his hind legs he shook the little tree vigorously Ye ye heyupi ye Snana called loudly to her companion turnip diggers Her cry soon brought all the women into sight upon a near by ridge 
6978-92210-0014	train-other-500	and they immediately gave a general alarm Mato saw them but appeared not at all concerned and was still intent upon dislodging the girl who clung frantically to her perch Presently there appeared upon the little knoll several warriors mounted and uttering the usual war whoop
6978-92210-0015	train-other-500	as if they were about to swoop down upon a human enemy This touched the dignity of Mato and he immediately prepared to accept the challenge Every Indian was alive to the possibilities of the occasion for it is well known that Mato or grizzly bear alone among animals
6978-92210-0016	train-other-500	is given the rank of a warrior so that whoever conquers him may wear an eagle feather Woo woo the warriors shouted as they maneuvered to draw him into the open plain
6978-92210-0017	train-other-500	He answered with hoarse growls threatening a rider who had ventured too near But arrows were many and well aimed and in a few minutes the great and warlike Mato lay dead at the foot of the tree
6978-92210-0018	train-other-500	The men ran forward and counted their coups on him just as when an enemy is fallen Then they looked at one another and placed their hands over their mouths as the young girl descended the tree with a fawn bound upon her back
6978-92210-0019	train-other-500	So that was the bait they cried And will you not make a feast with that fawn for us who came to your rescue The fawn is young and tender and we have not eaten meat for two days It will be a generous thing to do added her father who was among them Ye e e she cried out in distress Do not ask it I have seen this fawn s mother I have promised to keep her child safe See I have saved its life
6978-92210-0020	train-other-500	even when my own was in danger Ho ho wakan ye lo Yes yes tis holy or mysterious they exclaimed approvingly
6978-92210-0021	train-other-500	It was no small trouble for Snana to keep her trust As may well be supposed all the dogs of the teepee village must be watched and kept at a distance Neither was it easy to feed the little captive
none	none	 but in gaining its confidence the girl was an adept The fawn soon followed her everywhere and called to her when hungry exactly as she had called to her own mother After several days when her fright at the encounter with the bear had somewhat worn off Snana took her pet into the woods and back to the very spot in which she had found it In the furthest corner of the wild plum grove she laid it down gently stroked its soft forehead and smoothed the leaf like ears The little thing closed its eyes Once more the Sioux girl bent over and laid her cheek against the fawn s head then reluctantly she moved away hoping and yet dreading 
6978-92210-0022	train-other-500	that the mother would return She crouched under a clump of bushes near by and gave the doe call It was a reckless thing for her to do for such a call might bring upon her a mountain lion or ever watchful silver tip but Snana did not think of that
6978-92210-0023	train-other-500	In a few minutes she heard the light patter of hoofs and caught a glimpse of a doe running straight toward the fawn s hiding place When she stole near enough to see the doe and the fawn were examining one another carefully as if fearing some treachery At last both were apparently satisfied
6978-92210-0024	train-other-500	The doe caressed her natural child and the little one accepted the milk she offered In the Sioux maiden s mind there was turmoil A close attachment to the little wild creature had already taken root there contending with the sense of justice that was strong within her
6978-92210-0025	train-other-500	Now womanly sympathy for the mother was in control and now a desire to possess and protect her helpless pet I can take care of her against all hunters both animal and human
6978-92210-0026	train-other-500	They are ever ready to seize the helpless fawn for food Her life will be often exposed You cannot save her from disaster O Takcha my sister let me still keep her for you she finally appealed to the poor doe
6978-92210-0027	train-other-500	who was nervously watching the intruder and apparently thinking how she might best escape with the fawn Just at this moment there came a low call from the wood It was a doe call but the wild mother and her new friend both knew that it was not the call of a real doe
6978-92210-0028	train-other-500	It is a Sioux hunter whispered the girl You must go my sister Be off I will take your child to safety While she was yet speaking the doe seemed to realize the danger She stopped only an instant to lick fondly the tawny coat of the little one
6978-92210-0029	train-other-500	then she bounded away As Snana emerged from the bushes with her charge a young hunter met her face to face and stared at her curiously He was not of her father s camp but a stranger Ugh you have my game
6978-92210-0030	train-other-500	Tosh she replied coquettishly It was so often said among the Indians that the doe was wont to put on human form to mislead the hunter that it looked strange to see a woman with a fawn and the young man could not forbear to gaze upon Snana You are not the real mother in maiden s guise Tell me truly if you are of human blood
6978-92210-0031	train-other-500	he demanded rudely I am a Sioux maiden Do you not know my father she replied Ah but who is your father What is his name he insisted nervously fingering his arrows
6978-92210-0032	train-other-500	Do not be a coward Surely you should know a maid of your own race she replied reproachfully Ah you know the tricks of the doe What is thy name Hast thou forgotten the etiquette of thy people
6978-92210-0033	train-other-500	and wouldst compel me to pronounce my own name I refuse thou art jesting she retorted with a smile
none	none	 Thou dost give the tricky answers of a doe I cannot wait I must act before I lose my natural mind But already I am yours Whatever purpose you may have in thus charming a poor hunter be merciful and throwing aside his quiver he sat down The maiden stole a glance at his face and then another He was handsome Softly she reentered the thicket and laid down the little fawn Promise me never to hunt here again she said earnestly as she came forth without her pretty burden and he exacted another promise in return Thus Snana lost her fawn and found a lover VI HAKADAH S FIRST OFFERING 
6978-92211-0000	train-other-500	Hakadah coowah was the sonorous call
none	none	 that came from a large teepee in the midst of the Indian encampment 
6978-92211-0001	train-other-500	In answer to the summons there emerged from the woods which were only a few steps away a boy accompanied by a splendid black dog There was little in the appearance of the little fellow to distinguish him from the other Sioux boys
6978-92211-0002	train-other-500	He hastened to the tent from which he had been summoned carrying in his hands a bow and arrows gorgeously painted while the small birds and squirrels that he had killed with these weapons dangled from his belt
6978-92211-0003	train-other-500	Within the tent sat two old women one on each side of the fire Uncheedah was the boy s grandmother who had brought up the motherless child
6978-92211-0004	train-other-500	Wahchewin was only a caller but she had been invited to remain and assist in the first personal offering of Hakadah to the Great Mystery It had been whispered through the teepee village that Uncheedah intended to give a feast in honor of her grandchild s first sacrificial offering
6978-92211-0005	train-other-500	This was mere speculation however for the clear sighted old woman had determined to keep this part of the matter secret until the offering should be completed
6978-92211-0006	train-other-500	believing that the Great Mystery should be met in silence and dignity The boy came rushing into the lodge followed by his dog Ohitika
6978-92211-0007	train-other-500	who was wagging his tail promiscuously as if to say Master and I are really hunters Hakadah breathlessly gave a descriptive narrative of the killing of each bird and squirrel as he pulled them off his belt and threw them before his grandmother
6978-92211-0008	train-other-500	This blunt headed arrow said he actually had eyes this morning
none	none	 Before the squirrel can dodge around the tree it strikes him in the head and as he falls to the ground 
6978-92211-0009	train-other-500	my Ohitika is upon him He knelt upon one knee as he talked his black eyes shining like evening stars Sit down here said Uncheedah to the boy I have something to say to you
6978-92211-0010	train-other-500	You see that you are now almost a man Observe the game you have brought me It will not be long before you will leave me
6978-92211-0011	train-other-500	for a warrior must seek opportunities to make him great among his people You must endeavor to equal your father and grandfather she went on They were warriors and feast makers
6978-92211-0012	train-other-500	But it is not the poor hunter who makes many feasts Do you not remember the Legend of the Feast Maker who gave forty feasts in twelve moons And have you forgotten the story of the warrior who sought the will of the Great Mystery
6978-92211-0013	train-other-500	To day you will make your first offering to him The concluding sentence fairly dilated the eyes of the young hunter for he felt that a great event was about to occur in which he would be the principal actor But Uncheedah resumed her speech
none	none	 You must give up one of your belongings whichever is dearest to you for this is to be a sacrificial offering 
6978-92211-0014	train-other-500	This somewhat confused the boy not that he was selfish but rather uncertain as to what would be the most appropriate thing to give Then too he supposed that his grandmother referred to his ornaments and playthings only So he volunteered
none	none	 I can give up my best bow and arrows and all the paints I have and and my bear s claws necklace grandmother 
6978-92211-0015	train-other-500	Are these the things dearest to you she demanded Not the bow and arrows but the paints will be very hard to get for there are no white people near and the necklace it is not easy to get one like it again
none	none	 I will also give up my otter skin head dress if you think that it not enough 
6978-92211-0016	train-other-500	But think my boy you have not yet mentioned the thing that will be a pleasant offering to the Great Mystery The boy looked into the woman s face with a puzzled expression
none	none	 I have nothing else as good as those things I have named grandmother unless it is my spotted pony and I am sure that the Great Mystery will not require a little boy to make him so large a gift Besides my uncle gave three otter skins and five eagle feathers for him and I promised to keep him a long while 
6978-92211-0017	train-other-500	if the Blackfeet or the Crows do not steal him Uncheedah was not fully satisfied with the boy s free offerings Perhaps it had not occurred to him what she really wanted But Uncheedah knew where his affection was vested His faithful dog
none	none	 his pet and companion Hakadah was almost inseparable from the loving beast She was sure that it would be difficult to obtain his consent to sacrifice the animal but she ventured upon a final appeal 
6978-92211-0018	train-other-500	You must remember she said that in this offering you will call upon him who looks at you from every creation In the wind you hear him whisper to you He gives his war whoop in the thunder He watches you by day with his eye the sun
6978-92211-0019	train-other-500	at night he gazes upon your sleeping countenance through the moon In short it is the Mystery of Mysteries who controls all things to whom you will make your first offering By this act you will ask him to grant to you what he has granted to few men
6978-92211-0020	train-other-500	I know you wish to be a great warrior and hunter I am not prepared to see my Hakadah show any cowardice for the love of possessions is a woman s trait and not a brave s
6978-92211-0021	train-other-500	During this speech the boy had been completely aroused to the spirit of manliness and in his excitement was willing to give up anything he had even his pony
6978-92211-0022	train-other-500	But he was unmindful of his friend and companion Ohitika the dog So scarcely had Uncheedah finished speaking when he almost shouted Grandmother I will give up any of my possessions for the offering to the Great Mystery
none	none	 You may select what you think will be most pleasing to him There were two silent spectators of this little dialogue One was Wahchewin 
6978-92211-0023	train-other-500	the other was Ohitika The woman had been invited to stay although only a neighbor The dog by force of habit had taken up his usual position by the side of his master when they entered the teepee
6978-92211-0024	train-other-500	Without moving a muscle save those of his eyes he had been a very close observer of what passed Had the dog but moved once to attract the attention of his little friend he might have been dissuaded from that impetuous exclamation
6978-92211-0025	train-other-500	Grandmother I will give up any of my possessions It was hard for Uncheedah to tell the boy that he must part with his dog but she was equal to the situation Hakadah she proceeded cautiously you are a young brave
none	none	 I know though young your heart is strong and your courage is great You will be pleased to give up the dearest thing you have for your first offering You must give up Ohitika 
6978-92211-0026	train-other-500	He is brave and you too are brave He will not fear death you will bear his loss bravely Come here are four bundles of paints and a filled pipe let us go to the place
6978-92211-0027	train-other-500	When the last words were uttered Hakadah did not seem to hear them He was simply unable to speak To a civilized eye he would have appeared at that moment like a little copper statue His bright black eyes were fast melting in floods of tears
6978-92211-0028	train-other-500	when he caught his grandmother s eye and recollected her oft repeated adage Tears for woman and the war whoop for man to drown sorrow He swallowed two or three big mouthfuls of heartache
6978-92211-0029	train-other-500	and the little warrior was master of the situation Grandmother my Brave will have to die Let me tie together two of the prettiest tails of the squirrels that he and I killed this morning to show to the Great Mystery what a hunter he has been
6978-92211-0030	train-other-500	Let me paint him myself This request Uncheedah could not refuse and she left the pair alone for a few minutes while she went to ask Wacoota to execute Ohitika
6978-92211-0031	train-other-500	Every Indian boy knows that when a warrior is about to meet death he must sing a death dirge Hakadah thought of his Ohitika as a person who would meet his death without a struggle
none	none	 so he began to sing a dirge for him at the same time hugging him tight to himself As if he were a human being he whispered in his ear Illustration He began to sing a dirge for him Page one hundred forty Be brave my Ohitika I shall remember you the first time I am upon the war path in the Ojibway country At last he heard Uncheedah talking with a man outside the teepee so he quickly took up his paints Ohitika was a jet black dog with a silver tip on the end of his tail and on his nose beside one white paw and a white star upon a protuberance between his ears Hakadah knew that a man who prepares for death usually paints with red and black Nature had partially provided Ohitika in this respect 
6978-92211-0032	train-other-500	so that only red was required and this Hakadah supplied generously
none	none	 Then he took off a piece of red cloth and tied it around the dog s neck

6978-92211-0035	train-other-500	Had she not feared the wrath of the Great Mystery she would have been happy to call out to the boy Keep your dear dog my child
6978-92211-0036	train-other-500	As it was Hakadah came out of the teepee with his face looking like an eclipsed moon leading his beautiful dog who was even handsomer than ever with the red touches on his specks of white It was now Uncheedah s turn to struggle with the storm and burden in her soul
6978-92211-0037	train-other-500	But the boy was emboldened by the people s admiration of his bravery and did not shed a tear As soon as she was able to speak the loving grandmother said No my young brave not so You must not mourn for your first offering Wash your face

6978-92211-0038	train-other-500	submitted Ohitika to Wacoota with a smile and walked off with his grandmother and Wahchewin The boy and his grandmother descended the bank following a tortuous foot path until they reached the water s edge
6978-92211-0039	train-other-500	Then they proceeded to the mouth of an immense cave some fifty feet above the river under the cliff
6978-92211-0040	train-other-500	A little stream of limpid water trickled down from a spring within the cave The little watercourse served as a sort of natural staircase for the visitors A cool pleasant atmosphere exhaled from the mouth of the cavern

6978-92211-0041	train-other-500	A feeling of awe and reverence came to the boy It is the home of the Great Mystery he thought to himself and the impressiveness of his surroundings made him forget his sorrow Very soon Wahchewin came with some difficulty to the steps

6978-92211-0043	train-other-500	while the filled pipe was laid beside the dead Ohitika She scattered paints and tobacco all about Again they stood a few moments silently then she drew a deep breath and began her prayer to the Great Mystery
6978-92211-0044	train-other-500	O Great Mystery we hear thy voice in the rushing waters below us We hear thy whisper in the great oaks above Our spirits are refreshed with thy breath from within this cave O hear our prayer Behold this little boy and bless him
none	none	 Make him a warrior and a hunter as great as thou didst make his father and grandfather And with this prayer the little warrior had completed his first offering VII THE GRAVE OF THE DOG The full moon was just clear of the high mountain ranges when the game scout moved slowly homeward well wrapped in his long buffalo robe which was securely belted to his strong loins his quiver tightly tied to his shoulders so as not to impede his progress As he emerged from the lowlands into the upper regions he loomed up a gigantic figure against the clear moonlit horizon His picturesque foxskin cap with all its trimmings was incrusted with frost from the breath of his nostrils and his lagging footfall sounded crisply The distance he had that day covered was enough for any human endurance yet he was neither faint nor hungry but his feet were frozen into the psay the snow shoes so that he could not run faster than an easy slip and slide At last he reached the much coveted point the crown of the last ascent and when he smelled fire and the savory odor of the jerked buffalo meat it well nigh caused him to waver But he must not fail to follow the custom of untold ages and give the game scout s wolf call before entering camp Accordingly he paused upon the highest point of the ridge and uttered a cry to which the hungry cry of a real wolf would have seemed but a coyote s yelp in comparison Then it was that the rest of the buffalo hunters knew that their game scout was returning with welcome news for the unsuccessful scout enters the camp silently In the meantime the hunters at the temporary camp were aroused to a high pitch of excitement Some turned their buffalo robes and put them on in such a way as to convert themselves into make believe bison and began to tread the snow while others were singing the buffalo song that their spirits might be charmed and allured within the circle of the camp fires The scout too was singing his buffalo bull song in a guttural lowing chant as he neared the hunting camp Within arrow shot he paused again while the usual ceremonies were enacted for his reception This done he was seated with the leaders in a chosen place It was a long run he said but there were no difficulties I found the first herd directly north of here The second herd a great one is northeast near Shell Lake The snow is deep The buffalo can only follow their leader in their retreat Hi hi hi the hunters exclaimed solemnly in token of gratitude raising their hands heavenward and then pointing them toward the ground Ho kola one more round of the buffalo pipe then we shall retire to rise before daybreak for the hunt advised one of the leaders Silently they partook in turn of the long stemmed pipe and one by one with a dignified Ho departed to their teepees The scout betook himself to his little old buffalo teepee which he used for winter hunting expeditions His faithful Shunka who had been all this time its only occupant met him at the entrance as dogs alone know how to welcome a lifelong friend As his master entered he stretched himself in his old time way from the tip of his tail to that of his tongue and finished by curling both ends upward Ho mita Shunka eat this for you must be hungry So saying the scout laid before his canine friend the last piece of his dried buffalo meat It was the sweetest meal ever eaten by a dog judging by his long smacking of his lips after he had swallowed it The hunting party was soon lost in heavy slumber Not a sound could be heard save the gnawing of the ponies upon the cottonwood bark which was provided for them instead of hay in the winter time When Wapashaw the game scout had rolled himself in his warm buffalo robe and was sound asleep his faithful companion hunter the great Esquimaux wolf dog silently rose and again stretched himself then stood quiet for a moment as if meditating It was clear that he knew well what he had planned to do but was considering how he should do it without arousing any suspicion of his movements This is a dog s art and the night tricks and marauding must always be the joy and secret of his life Softly he emerged from the lodge and gave a sweeping glance around to assure him that there were none to spy upon him Suspiciously he sniffed the air as if to ascertain whether there could be any danger to his sleeping master while he should be away Up the long ascent he trotted in a northerly direction yet not following his master s trail He was large and formidable in strength combining the features of his wild brothers of the plains with those of the dogs who keep company with the red men His jet black hair and sharp ears and nose appeared to immense advantage against the spotless and jewelled snow until presently his own warm breath had coated him with heavy frost After a time Shunka struck into his master s trail and followed it all the way only taking a short cut here and there when by dog instinct he knew that a man must go around such a point to get to his destination He met many travellers during the night but none had dared to approach him though some few followed at a distance as if to discover his purpose At last he reached Shell Lake and there beheld a great gathering of the herds They stood in groups like enormous rocks no longer black but white with frost Every one of them emitted a white steam quickly frozen into a fine snow in the air Shunka sat upon his haunches and gazed Wough this is it he said to himself He had kept still when the game scout gave the wolf call though the camp was in an uproar and from the adjacent hills the wild hunters were equally joyous because they understood the meaning of the unwonted noise Yet his curiosity was not fully satisfied and he had set out to discover the truth and it may be to protect or serve his master in case of danger At daybreak the great dog meekly entered his master s rude teepee and found him already preparing for the prospective hunt He was filling his inside moccasins full of buffalo hair to serve as stockings over which he put on his large buffalo moccasins with the hair inside and adjusted his warm leggins He then adjusted his snow shoes and filled his quiver full of good arrows The dog quietly lay down in a warm place making himself as small as possible as if to escape observation and calmly watched his master Soon all the hunters were running in single file upon the trail of the scout each Indian closely followed by his trusty hunting dog In less than two hours they stood just back of the low ridge which rounded the south side of Shell Lake The narrow strip of land between its twin divisions was literally filled with the bison In the gulches beyond between the dark lines of timber there were also scattered groups but the hunters at once saw their advantage over the herd upon the peninsula Hechetu kola This is well friends exclaimed the first to speak These can be forced to cross the slippery ice and the mire around the springs This will help us to get more meat Our people are hungry and we must kill many in order to feed them Ugh he is always right Our dogs must help us here The meat will be theirs as well as ours another added Tosh kola The game scout s dog is the greatest Shunka of them all He has a mind near like that of a man Let him lead the attack of his fellows while we crawl up on the opposite side and surround the buffalo upon the slippery ice and in the deceitful mire spoke up a third So it was agreed that the game scout and his Shunka should lead the attack Woo woo woo was the hoarse signal from the throat of the game scout but his voice was drowned by the howling and barking of the savage dogs as they made their charge In a moment all was confusion among the buffalo Some started this way others that and the great mass swayed to and fro uncertainly A few were ready to fight but the snow was too deep for a countercharge upon the dogs save on the ice just in front of them where the wind had always full sweep There all was slippery and shining In their excitement and confusion the bison rushed upon this uncertain plain Their weight and the momentum of their rush carried them hopelessly far out where they were again confused as to which way to go and many were stuck in the mire which was concealed by the snow except here and there an opening above a spring from which there issued a steaming vapor The game scout and his valiant dog led on the force of canines with deafening war cries and one could see black heads here and there popping from behind the embankments As the herd finally swept toward the opposite shore many dead were left behind Pierced by the arrows of the hunters they lay like black mounds upon the glassy plain It was a great hunt Once more the camp will be fed they thought and this good fortune will help us to reach the spring alive A chant of rejoicing rang out from the opposite shore while the game scout unsheathed his big knife and began the work which is ever the sequel of the hunt to dress the game although the survivors of the slaughter had scarcely disappeared behind the hills All were busily skinning and cutting up the meat into pieces convenient for carrying when suddenly a hunter called the attention of those near him to an ominous change in the atmosphere There are signs of a blizzard We must hurry into the near woods before it reaches us he shouted Some heard him others did not Those who saw or heard passed on the signal and hurried toward the wood where others had already arranged rude shelters and gathered piles of dry wood for fuel Around the several camp fires the hunters sat or stood while slices of savory meat were broiled and eaten with a relish by the half starved men But the storm had now fairly enveloped them in whirling whiteness Woo woo they called to those who had not yet reached camp One after another answered and emerged from the blinding pall of snow At last none were missing save the game scout and his Shunka The hunters passed the time in eating and telling stories until a late hour occasionally giving a united shout to guide the lost one should he chance to pass near their camp Fear not for our scout friends finally exclaimed a leader among them He is a brave and experienced man He will find a safe resting place and join us when the wind ceases to rage So they all wrapped themselves in their robes and lay down to sleep All that night and the following day it was impossible to give succor and the hunters felt much concern for the absent Late in the second night the great storm subsided Ho ho Iyotanka Rise up So the first hunter to awaken aroused all the others As after every other storm it was wonderfully still so still that one could hear distinctly the pounding feet of the jack rabbits coming down over the slopes to the willows for food All dry vegetation was buried beneath the deep snow and everywhere they saw this white robed creature of the prairie coming down to the woods Now the air was full of the wolf and coyote game call and they were seen in great numbers upon the ice See see the hungry wolves are dragging the carcasses away Harken to the war cries of the scout s Shunka Hurry hurry they urged one another in chorus Away they ran and out upon the lake now upon the wind swept ice now upon the crusted snow running when they could sliding when they must There was certainly a great concourse of the wolves whirling in frantic circles but continually moving toward the farther end of the lake They could hear distinctly the hoarse bark of the scout s Shunka and occasionally the muffled war whoop of a man as if it came from under the ice As they approached nearer the scene they could hear more distinctly the voice of their friend but still as it were from underground When they reached the spot to which the wolves had dragged two of the carcasses of the buffalo Shunka was seen to stand by one of them but at that moment he staggered and fell The hunters took out their knives and ripped up the frozen hide covering the abdominal cavity It revealed a warm nest of hay and buffalo hair in which the scout lay wrapped in his own robe He had placed his dog in one of the carcasses and himself in another for protection from the storm but the dog was wiser than the man for he kept his entrance open The man lapped the hide over and it froze solidly shutting him securely in When the hungry wolves came Shunka promptly extricated himself and held them off as long as he could meanwhile sliding and pulling the wolves continued to drag over the slippery ice the body of the buffalo in which his master had taken refuge The poor faithful dog with no care for his own safety stood by his imprisoned master until the hunters came up But it was too late for he had received more than one mortal wound As soon as the scout got out with a face more anxious for another than for himself he exclaimed Where is Shunka the bravest of his tribe Ho kola it is so indeed and here he lies replied one sadly His master knelt by his side gently stroking the face of the dog Ah my friend you go where all spirits live The Great Mystery has a home for every living creature May he permit our meeting there At daybreak the scout carried him up to one of the pretty round hills overlooking the lake and built up around him walls of loose stone Red paints were scattered over the snow in accordance with Indian custom and the farewell song was sung Since that day the place has been known to the Sioux as Shunkahanakapi the Grave of
