THE CONSOLATION OF PHILOSOPHY OF BOETHIUS Translated into English Prose and Verse by H R JAMES M A CH CH OXFORD Quantumlibet igitur saeviant mali sapienti tamen corona non decidet non arescet Melioribus animum conformaveris nihil opus est judice praemium deferente tu te ipse excellentioribus addidisti studium ad pejora deflexeris extra ne quaesieris ultorem tu te ipse in deteriora trusisti LONDON ELLIOT STOCK sixty two PATERNOSTER ROW eighteen ninety seven PREFACE The book called The Consolation of Philosophy was throughout the Middle Ages and down to the beginnings of the modern epoch in the sixteenth century the scholar s familiar companion Few books have exercised a wider influence in their time It has been translated into every European tongue and into English nearly a dozen times from King Alfred s paraphrase to the translations of Lord Preston Causton Ridpath and Duncan in the eighteenth century The belief that what once pleased so widely must still have some charm is my excuse for attempting the present translation The great work of Boethius with its alternate prose and verse skilfully fitted together like dialogue and chorus in a Greek play is unique in literature and has a pathetic interest from the time and circumstances of its composition It ought not to be forgotten Those who can go to the original will find their reward There may be room also for a new translation in English after an interval of close on a hundred years Some of the editions contain a reproduction of a bust purporting to represent Boethius Lord Preston s translation for example has such a portrait which it refers to an original in marble at Rome This I have been unable to trace and suspect that it is apocryphal The Hope Collection at Oxford contains a completely different portrait in a print which gives no authority I have ventured to use as a frontispiece a reproduction from a plaster cast in the Ashmolean Museum taken from an ivory diptych preserved in the Bibliotheca Quiriniana at Brescia which represents Narius Manlius Boethius the father of the philosopher Portraiture of this period is so rare that it seemed that failing a likeness of the author himself this authentic representation of his father might have interest as giving the consular dress and insignia of the time and also as illustrating the decadence of contemporary art The consul wears a richly embroidered cloak his right hand holds a staff surmounted by the Roman eagle his left the mappa circensis or napkin used for starting the races in the circus at his feet are palms and bags of money prizes for the victors in the games For permission to use this cast my thanks are due to the authorities of the Ashmolean Museum as also to mister T W Jackson Curator of the Hope Collection who first called my attention to its existence I have to thank my brother mister L James of Radley College for much valuable help and for correcting the proof sheets of the translation The text used is that of Peiper Leipsic eighteen seventy four PROEM Anicus Manlius Severinus Boethius lived in the last quarter of the fifth century A D and the first quarter of the sixth He was growing to manhood when Theodoric the famous Ostrogoth crossed the Alps and made himself master of Italy Boethius belonged to an ancient family which boasted a connection with the legendary glories of the Republic and was still among the foremost in wealth and dignity in the days of Rome s abasement His parents dying early he was brought up by Symmachus whom the age agreed to regard as of almost saintly character and afterwards became his son in law His varied gifts aided by an excellent education won for him the reputation of the most accomplished man of his time He was orator poet musician philosopher It is his peculiar distinction to have handed on to the Middle Ages the tradition of Greek philosophy by his Latin translations of the works of Aristotle Called early to a public career the highest honours of the State came to him unsought He was sole Consul in five hundred ten A D and was ultimately raised by Theodoric to the dignity of Magister Officiorum or head of the whole civil administration He was no less happy in his domestic life in the virtues of his wife Rusticiana and the fair promise of his two sons Symmachus and Boethius happy also in the society of a refined circle of friends Noble wealthy accomplished universally esteemed for his virtues high in the favour of the Gothic King he appeared to all men a signal example of the union of merit and good fortune His felicity seemed to culminate in the year five hundred twenty two A D when by special and extraordinary favour his two sons young as they were for so exalted an honour were created joint Consuls and rode to the senate house attended by a throng of senators and the acclamations of the multitude Boethius himself amid the general applause delivered the public speech in the King s honour usual on such occasions Within a year he was a solitary prisoner at Pavia stripped of honours wealth and friends with death hanging over him and a terror worse than death in the fear lest those dearest to him should be involved in the worst results of his downfall It is in this situation that the opening of the Consolation of Philosophy brings Boethius before us He represents himself as seated in his prison distraught with grief indignant at the injustice of his misfortunes and seeking relief for his melancholy in writing verses descriptive of his condition Suddenly there appears to him the Divine figure of Philosophy in the guise of a woman of superhuman dignity and beauty who by a succession of discourses convinces him of the vanity of regret for the lost gifts of fortune raises his mind once more to the contemplation of the true good and makes clear to him the mystery of the world s moral government INDEX OF VERSE INTERLUDES BOOK I THE SORROWS OF BOETHIUS SONG PAGE I BOETHIUS COMPLAINT

none	none	the disordered condition of his mind CH II Boethius is speechless with amazement Philosophy wipes away the tears that have clouded his eyesight CH III Boethius recognises his mistress Philosophy To his wondering inquiries she explains her presence and recalls to his mind the persecutions to which Philosophy has oftentimes from of old been subjected by an ignorant world CH IV Philosophy bids Boethius declare his griefs He relates the story of his unjust accusation and ruin He concludes with a prayer Song V that the moral disorder in human affairs may be set right CH V Philosophy admits the justice of Boethius self vindication but grieves rather for the unhappy change in his mind She will first tranquillize his spirit by soothing remedies CH VI Philosophy tests Boethius mental state by certain questions and discovers three chief causes of his soul s sickness one He has forgotten his own true nature two he knows not the end towards which the whole universe tends three he knows not the means by which the world is governed BOOK I SONG I BOETHIUS COMPLAINT Who wrought my studious numbers Smoothly once in happier days Now perforce in tears and sadness Learn a mournful strain to raise Lo the Muses grief dishevelled Guide my pen and voice my woe Down their cheeks unfeigned the tear drops To my sad complainings flow These alone in danger s hour Faithful found have dared attend On the footsteps of the exile To his lonely journey s end These that were the pride and pleasure Of my youth and high estate Still remain the only solace Of the old man s mournful fate Old Ah yes swift ere I knew it By these sorrows on me pressed Age hath come lo Grief hath bid me Wear the garb that fits her best O er my head untimely sprinkled These white hairs my woes proclaim And the skin hangs loose and shrivelled On this sorrow shrunken frame Blest is death that intervenes not In the sweet sweet years of peace But unto the broken hearted When they call him brings release Yet Death passes by the wretched Shuts his ear and slumbers deep Will not heed the cry of anguish Will not close the eyes that weep For while yet inconstant Fortune Poured her gifts and all was bright Death s dark hour had all but whelmed me In the gloom of endless night Now because misfortune s shadow Hath o erclouded that false face Cruel Life still halts and lingers Though I loathe his weary race Friends why did ye once so lightly Vaunt me happy among men Surely he who so hath fallen Was not firmly founded then I While I was thus mutely pondering within myself and recording my sorrowful complainings with my pen it seemed to me that there appeared above my head a woman of a countenance exceeding venerable Her eyes were bright as fire and of a more than human keenness her complexion was lively her vigour showed no trace of enfeeblement and yet her years were right full and she plainly seemed not of our age and time Her stature was difficult to judge At one moment it exceeded not the common height at another her forehead seemed to strike the sky and whenever she raised her head higher she began to pierce within the very heavens and to baffle the eyes of them that looked upon her Her garments were of an imperishable fabric wrought with the finest threads and of the most delicate workmanship and these as her own lips afterwards assured me she had herself woven with her own hands The beauty of this vesture had been somewhat tarnished by age and neglect and wore that dingy look which marble contracts from exposure On the lower most edge was inwoven the Greek letter Greek P on the topmost the letter Greek Th A and between the two were to be seen steps like a staircase from the lower to the upper letter This robe moreover had been torn by the hands of violent persons who had each snatched away what he could clutch B Her right hand held a note book in her left she bore a staff And when she saw the Muses of Poesie standing by my bedside dictating the words of my lamentations she was moved awhile to wrath and her eyes flashed sternly Who said she has allowed yon play acting wantons to approach this sick man these who so far from giving medicine to heal his malady even feed it with sweet poison These it is who kill the rich crop of reason with the barren thorns of passion who accustom men s minds to disease instead of setting them free Now were it some common man whom your allurements were seducing as is usually your way I should be less indignant On such a one I should not have spent my pains for naught But this is one nurtured in the Eleatic and Academic philosophies Nay get ye gone ye sirens whose sweetness lasteth not leave him for my muses to tend and heal At these words of upbraiding the whole band in deepened sadness with downcast eyes and blushes that confessed their shame dolefully left the chamber But I because my sight was dimmed with much weeping and I could not tell who was this woman of authority so commanding I was dumfoundered and with my gaze fastened on the earth continued silently to await what she might do next Then she drew near me and sat on the edge of my couch and looking into my face all heavy with grief and fixed in sadness on the ground she bewailed in these words the disorder of my mind FOOTNOTES A Greek P P stands for the Political life the life of action Greek Th Th for the Theoretical life the life of thought B The Stoic Epicurean and other philosophical sects which Boethius regards as heterodox See also below ch iii p fourteen SONG II HIS DESPONDENCY Alas in what abyss his mind Is plunged how wildly tossed Still still towards the outer night She sinks her true light lost As oft as lashed tumultuously By earth born blasts care s waves rise high Yet once he ranged the open heavens The sun s bright pathway tracked Watched how the cold moon waxed and waned Nor rested till there lacked To his wide ken no star that steers Amid the maze of circling spheres The causes why the blusterous winds Vex ocean s tranquil face Whose hand doth turn the stable globe Or why his even race From out the ruddy east the sun Unto the western waves doth run What is it tempers cunningly The placid hours of spring So that it blossoms with the rose For earth s engarlanding Who loads the year s maturer prime With clustered grapes in autumn time All this he knew thus ever strove Deep Nature s lore to guess Now reft of reason s light he lies And bonds his neck oppress While by the heavy load constrained His eyes to this dull earth are chained II But the time said she calls rather for healing than for lamentation Then with her eyes bent full upon me Art thou that man she cries who erstwhile fed with the milk and reared upon the nourishment which is mine to give had grown up to the full vigour of a manly spirit And yet I had bestowed such armour on thee as would have proved an invincible defence hadst thou not first cast it away Dost thou know me Why art thou silent Is it shame or amazement that hath struck thee dumb Would it were shame but as I see a stupor hath seized upon thee Then when she saw me not only answering nothing but mute and utterly incapable of speech she gently touched my breast with her hand and said There is no danger these are the symptoms of lethargy the usual sickness of deluded minds For awhile he has forgotten himself he will easily recover his memory if only he first recognises me And that he may do so let me now wipe his eyes that are clouded with a mist of mortal things Thereat with a fold of her robe she dried my eyes all swimming with tears SONG III THE MISTS DISPELLED Then the gloom of night was scattered Sight returned unto mine eyes So when haply rainy Caurus Rolls the storm clouds through the skies Hidden is the sun all heaven Is obscured in starless night But if in wild onset sweeping Boreas frees day s prisoned light All suddenly the radiant god outstreams And strikes our dazzled eyesight with his beams III Even so the clouds of my melancholy were broken up I saw the clear sky and regained the power to recognise the face of my physician Accordingly when I had lifted my eyes and fixed my gaze upon her I beheld my nurse Philosophy whose halls I had frequented from my youth up Ah why I cried mistress of all excellence hast thou come down from on high and entered the solitude of this my exile Is it that thou too even as I mayst be persecuted with false accusations Could I desert thee child said she and not lighten the burden which thou hast taken upon thee through the hatred of my name by sharing this trouble Even forgetting that it were not lawful for Philosophy to leave companionless the way of the innocent should I thinkest thou fear to incur reproach or shrink from it as though some strange new thing had befallen Thinkest thou that now for the first time in an evil age Wisdom hath been assailed by peril Did I not often in days of old before my servant Plato lived wage stern warfare with the rashness of folly In his lifetime too Socrates his master won with my aid the victory of an unjust death And when one after the other the Epicurean herd the Stoic and the rest each of them as far as in them lay went about to seize the heritage he left and were dragging me off protesting and resisting as their booty they tore in pieces the garment which I had woven with my own hands and clutching the torn pieces went off believing that the whole of me had passed into their possession And some of them because some traces of my vesture were seen upon them were destroyed through the mistake of the lewd multitude who falsely deemed them to be my disciples It may be thou knowest not of the banishment of Anaxagoras of the poison draught of Socrates nor of Zeno s torturing because these things happened in a distant country yet mightest thou have learnt the fate of Arrius of Seneca of Soranus whose stories are neither old nor unknown to fame These men were brought to destruction for no other reason than that settled as they were in my principles their lives were a manifest contrast to the ways of the wicked So there is nothing thou shouldst wonder at if on the seas of this life we are tossed by storm blasts seeing that we have made it our chiefest aim to refuse compliance with evil doers And though maybe the host of the wicked is many in number yet is it contemptible since it is under no leadership but is hurried hither and thither at the blind driving of mad error And if at times and seasons they set in array against us and fall on in overwhelming strength our leader draws off her forces into the citadel while they are busy plundering the useless baggage But we from our vantage ground safe from all this wild work laugh to see them making prize of the most valueless of things protected by a bulwark which aggressive folly may not aspire to reach SONG IV NOTHING CAN SUBDUE VIRTUE Whoso calm serene sedate Sets his foot on haughty fate Firm and steadfast come what will Keeps his mien unconquered still Him the rage of furious seas Tossing high wild menaces Nor the flames from smoky forges That Vesuvius disgorges Nor the bolt that from the sky Smites the tower can terrify Why then shouldst thou feel affright At the tyrant s weakling might Dread him not nor fear no harm And thou shall his rage disarm But who to hope or fear gives way Lost his bosom s rightful sway He hath cast away his shield Like a coward fled the field He hath forged all unaware Fetters his own neck must bear IV Dost thou understand she asks Do my words sink into thy mind Or art thou dull as the ass to the sound of the lyre Why dost thou weep Why do tears stream from thy eyes Speak out hide it not in thy heart If thou lookest for the physician s help thou must needs disclose thy wound Then I gathering together what strength I could began Is there still need of telling Is not the cruelty of fortune against me plain enough Doth not the very aspect of this place move thee Is this the library the room which thou hadst chosen as thy constant resort in my home the place where we so often sat together and held discourse of all things in heaven and earth Was my garb and mien like this when I explored with thee nature s hid secrets and thou didst trace for me with thy wand the courses of the stars moulding the while my character and the whole conduct of my life after the pattern of the celestial order Is this the recompense of my obedience Yet thou hast enjoined by Plato s mouth the maxim that states would be happy either if philosophers ruled them or if it should so befall that their rulers would turn philosophers By his mouth likewise thou didst point out this imperative reason why philosophers should enter public life to wit lest if the reins of government be left to unprincipled and profligate citizens trouble and destruction should come upon the good Following these precepts I have tried to apply in the business of public administration the principles which I learnt from thee in leisured seclusion Thou art my witness and that divinity who hath implanted thee in the hearts of the wise that I brought to my duties no aim but zeal for the public good For this cause I have become involved in bitter and irreconcilable feuds and as happens inevitably if a man holds fast to the independence of conscience I have had to think nothing of giving offence to the powerful in the cause of justice How often have I encountered and balked Conigastus in his assaults on the fortunes of the weak How often have I thwarted Trigguilla steward of the king s household even when his villainous schemes were as good as accomplished How often have I risked my position and influence to protect poor wretches from the false charges innumerable with which they were for ever being harassed by the greed and license of the barbarians No one has ever drawn me aside from justice to oppression When ruin was overtaking the fortunes of the provincials through the combined pressure of private rapine and public taxation I grieved no less than the sufferers When at a season of grievous scarcity a forced sale disastrous as it was unjustifiable was proclaimed and threatened to overwhelm Campania with starvation I embarked on a struggle with the praetorian prefect in the public interest I fought the case at the king s judgment seat and succeeded in preventing the enforcement of the sale I rescued the consular Paulinus from the gaping jaws of the court bloodhounds who in their covetous hopes had already made short work of his wealth To save Albinus who was of the same exalted rank from the penalties of a prejudged charge I exposed myself to the hatred of Cyprian the informer Thinkest thou I had laid up for myself store of enmities enough Well with the rest of my countrymen at any rate my safety should have been assured since my love of justice had left me no hope of security at court Yet who was it brought the charges by which I have been struck down Why one of my accusers is Basil who after being dismissed from the king s household was driven by his debts to lodge an information against my name There is Opilio there is Gaudentius men who for many and various offences the king s sentence had condemned to banishment and when they declined to obey and sought to save themselves by taking sanctuary the king as soon as he heard of it decreed that if they did not depart from the city of Ravenna within a prescribed time they should be branded on the forehead and expelled What would exceed the rigour of this severity And yet on that same day these very men lodged an information against me and the information was admitted Just Heaven had I deserved this by my way of life Did it make them fit accusers that my condemnation was a foregone conclusion Has fortune no shame if not at the accusation of the innocent at least for the vileness of the accusers Perhaps thou wonderest what is the sum of the charges laid against me I wished they say to save the senate But how I am accused of hindering an informer from producing evidence to prove the senate guilty of treason Tell me then what is thy counsel O my mistress Shall I deny the charge lest I bring shame on thee But I did wish it and I shall never cease to wish it Shall I admit it Then the work of thwarting the informer will come to an end Shall I call the wish for the preservation of that illustrious house a crime Of a truth the senate by its decrees concerning me has made it such But blind folly though it deceive itself with false names cannot alter the true merits of things and mindful of the precept of Socrates I do not think it right either to keep the truth concealed or allow falsehood to pass But this however it may be I leave to thy judgment and to the verdict of the discerning Moreover lest the course of events and the true facts should be hidden from posterity I have myself committed to writing an account of the transaction What need to speak of the forged letters by which an attempt is made to prove that I hoped for the freedom of Rome Their falsity would have been manifest if I had been allowed to use the confession of the informers themselves evidence which has in all matters the most convincing force Why what hope of freedom is left to us Would there were any I should have answered with the epigram of Canius when Caligula declared him to have been cognisant of a conspiracy against him If I had known said he thou shouldst never have known Grief hath not so blunted my perceptions in this matter that I should complain because impious wretches contrive their villainies against the virtuous but at their achievement of their hopes I do exceedingly marvel For evil purposes are perchance due to the imperfection of human nature that it should be possible for scoundrels to carry out their worst schemes against the innocent while God beholdeth is verily monstrous For this cause not without reason one of thy disciples asked If God exists whence comes evil Yet whence comes good if He exists not However it might well be that wretches who seek the blood of all honest men and of the whole senate should wish to destroy me also whom they saw to be a bulwark of the senate and all honest men But did I deserve such a fate from the Fathers also Thou rememberest methinks since thou didst ever stand by my side to direct what I should do or say thou rememberest I say how at Verona when the king eager for the general destruction was bent on implicating the whole senatorial order in the charge of treason brought against Albinus with what indifference to my own peril I maintained the innocence of its members one and all Thou knowest that what I say is the truth and that I have never boasted of my good deeds in a spirit of self praise For whenever a man by proclaiming his good deeds receives the recompense of fame he diminishes in a measure the secret reward of a good conscience What issues have overtaken my innocency thou seest Instead of reaping the rewards of true virtue I undergo the penalties of a guilt falsely laid to my charge nay more than this never did an open confession of guilt cause such unanimous severity among the assessors but that some consideration either of the mere frailty of human nature or of fortune s universal instability availed to soften the verdict of some few Had I been accused of a design to fire the temples to slaughter the priests with impious sword of plotting the massacre of all honest men I should yet have been produced in court and only punished on due confession or conviction Now for my too great zeal towards the senate I have been condemned to outlawry and death unheard and undefended at a distance of near five hundred miles away C Oh my judges well do ye deserve that no one should hereafter be convicted of a fault like mine Yet even my very accusers saw how honourable was the charge they brought against me and in order to overlay it with some shadow of guilt they falsely asserted that in the pursuit of my ambition I had stained my conscience with sacrilegious acts And yet thy spirit indwelling in me had driven from the chamber of my soul all lust of earthly success and with thine eye ever upon me there could be no place left for sacrilege For thou didst daily repeat in my ear and instil into my mind the Pythagorean maxim Follow after God It was not likely then that I should covet the assistance of the vilest spirits when thou wert moulding me to such an excellence as should conform me to the likeness of God Again the innocency of the inner sanctuary of my home the company of friends of the highest probity a father in law revered at once for his pure character and his active beneficence shield me from the very suspicion of sacrilege Yet atrocious as it is they even draw credence for this charge from thee I am like to be thought implicated in wickedness on this very account that I am imbued with thy teachings and stablished in thy ways So it is not enough that my devotion to thee should profit me nothing but thou also must be assailed by reason of the odium which I have incurred Verily this is the very crown of my misfortunes that men s opinions for the most part look not to real merit but to the event and only recognise foresight where Fortune has crowned the issue with her approval Whereby it comes to pass that reputation is the first of all things to abandon the unfortunate I remember with chagrin how perverse is popular report how various and discordant men s judgments This only will I say that the most crushing of misfortune s burdens is that as soon as a charge is fastened upon the unhappy they are believed to have deserved their sufferings I for my part who have been banished from all life s blessings stripped of my honours stained in repute am punished for well doing And now methinks I see the villainous dens of the wicked surging with joy and gladness all the most recklessly unscrupulous threatening a new crop of lying informations the good prostrate with terror at my danger every ruffian incited by impunity to new daring and to success by the profits of audacity the guiltless not only robbed of their peace of mind but even of all means of defence Wherefore I would fain cry out FOOTNOTES C The distance from Rome to Pavia the place of Boethius imprisonment is four hundred fifty five Roman miles SONG V BOETHIUS PRAYER Builder of yon starry dome Thou that whirlest throned eternal Heaven s swift globe and as they roam Guid saint the stars by laws supernal So in full sphered splendour dight Cynthia dims the lamps of night But unto the orb fraternal Closer drawn D doth lose her light Who at fall of eventide Hesper his cold radiance showeth Lucifer his beams doth hide Paling as the sun s light groweth Brief while winter s frost holds sway By thy will the space of day Swift when summer s fervour gloweth Speed the hours of night away Thou dost rule the changing year When rude Boreas oppresses Fall the leaves they reappear Wooed by Zephyr s soft caresses Fields that Sirius burns deep grown By Arcturus watch were sown Each the reign of law confesses Keeps the place that is his own Sovereign Ruler Lord of all Can it be that Thou disdainest Only man Gainst him poor thrall Wanton Fortune plays her vainest Guilt s deserved punishment Falleth on the innocent High uplifted the profanest On the just their malice vent Virtue cowers in dark retreats Crime s foul stain the righteous beareth Perjury and false deceits Hurt not him the wrong who dareth But whene er the wicked trust In ill strength to work their lust Kings whom nations awe declareth Mighty grovel in the dust Look oh look upon this earth Thou who on law s sure foundation Framedst all Have we no worth We poor men of all creation Sore we toss on fortune s tide Master bid the waves subside And earth s ways with consummation Of Thy heaven s order guide FOOTNOTES D The moon is regarded as farthest from the sun at the full and as she wanes approaching gradually nearer V When I had poured out my griefs in this long and unbroken strain of lamentation she with calm countenance and in no wise disturbed at my complainings thus spake When I saw thee sorrowful in tears I straightway knew thee wretched and an exile But how far distant that exile I should not know had not thine own speech revealed it Yet how far indeed from thy country hast thou not been banished but rather hast strayed or if thou wilt have it banishment hast banished thyself For no one else could ever lawfully have had this power over thee Now if thou wilt call to mind from what country thou art sprung it is not ruled as once was the Athenian polity by the sovereignty of the multitude but one is its Ruler one its King who takes delight in the number of His citizens not in their banishment to submit to whose governance and to obey whose ordinances is perfect freedom Art thou ignorant of that most ancient law of this thy country whereby it is decreed that no one whatsoever who hath chosen to fix there his dwelling may be sent into exile For truly there is no fear that one who is encompassed by its ramparts and defences should deserve to be exiled But he who has ceased to wish to dwell therein he likewise ceases to deserve to do so And so it is not so much the aspect of this place which moves me as thy aspect not so much the library walls set off with glass and ivory which I miss as the chamber of thy mind wherein I once placed not books but that which gives books their value the doctrines which my books contain Now what thou hast said of thy services to the commonweal is true only too little compared with the greatness of thy deservings The things laid to thy charge whereof thou hast spoken whether such as redound to thy credit or mere false accusations are publicly known As for the crimes and deceits of the informers thou hast rightly deemed it fitting to pass them over lightly because the popular voice hath better and more fully pronounced upon them Thou hast bitterly complained of the injustice of the senate Thou hast grieved over my calumniation and likewise hast lamented the damage to my good name Finally thine indignation blazed forth against fortune thou hast complained of the unfairness with which thy merits have been recompensed Last of all thy frantic muse framed a prayer that the peace which reigns in heaven might rule earth also But since a throng of tumultuous passions hath assailed thy soul since thou art distraught with anger pain and grief strong remedies are not proper for thee in this thy present mood And so for a time I will use milder methods that the tumours which have grown hard through the influx of disturbing passion may be softened by gentle treatment till they can bear the force of sharper remedies SONG VI ALL THINGS HAVE THEIR NEEDFUL ORDER He who to th unwilling furrows Gives the generous grain When the Crab with baleful fervours Scorches all the plain He shall find his garner bare Acorns for his scanty fare Go not forth to cull sweet violets From the purpled steep While the furious blasts of winter Through the valleys sweep Nor the grape o erhasty bring To the press in days of spring For to each thing God hath given Its appointed time No perplexing change permits He In His plan sublime So who quits the order due Shall a luckless issue rue VI First then wilt thou suffer me by a few questions to make some attempt to test the state of thy mind that I may learn in what way to set about thy cure Ask what thou wilt said I for I will answer whatever questions thou choosest to put Then said she This world of ours thinkest thou it is governed haphazard and fortuitously or believest thou that there is in it any rational guidance Nay said I in no wise may I deem that such fixed motions can be determined by random hazard but I know that God the Creator presideth over His work nor will the day ever come that shall drive me from holding fast the truth of this belief Yes said she thou didst even but now affirm it in song lamenting that men alone had no portion in the divine care As to the rest thou wert unshaken in the belief that they were ruled by reason Yet I marvel exceedingly how in spite of thy firm hold on this opinion thou art fallen into sickness But let us probe more deeply something or other is missing I think Now tell me since thou doubtest not that God governs the world dost thou perceive by what means He rules it I scarcely understand what thou meanest I said much less can I answer thy question Did I not say truly that something is missing whereby as through a breach in the ramparts disease hath crept in to disturb thy mind But tell me dost thou remember the universal end towards which the aim of all nature is directed I once heard said I but sorrow hath dulled my recollection And yet thou knowest whence all things have proceeded Yes that I know said I and have answered that it is from God Yet how is it possible that thou knowest not what is the end of existence when thou dost understand its source and origin However these disturbances of mind have force to shake a man s position but cannot pluck him up and root him altogether out of himself But answer this also I pray thee rememberest thou that thou art a man How should I not said I Then canst thou say what man is Is this thy question Whether I know myself for a being endowed with reason and subject to death Surely I do acknowledge myself such Then she Dost know nothing else that thou art Nothing Now said she I know another cause of thy disease one too of grave moment Thou hast ceased to know thy own nature So then I have made full discovery both of the causes of thy sickness and the means of restoring thy health It is because forgetfulness of thyself hath bewildered thy mind that thou hast bewailed thee as an exile as one stripped of the blessings that were his it is because thou knowest not the end of existence that thou deemest abominable and wicked men to be happy and powerful while because thou hast forgotten by what means the earth is governed thou deemest that fortune s changes ebb and flow without the restraint of a guiding hand These are serious enough to cause not sickness only but even death but thanks be to the Author of our health the light of nature hath not yet left thee utterly In thy true judgment concerning the world s government in that thou believest it subject not to the random drift of chance but to divine reason we have the divine spark from which thy recovery may be hoped Have then no fear from these weak embers the vital heat shall once more be kindled within thee But seeing that it is not yet time for strong remedies and that the mind is manifestly so constituted that when it casts off true opinions it straightway puts on false wherefrom arises a cloud of confusion that disturbs its true vision I will now try and disperse these mists by mild and soothing application that so the darkness of misleading passion may be scattered and thou mayst come to discern the splendour of the true light SONG VII THE PERTURBATIONS OF PASSION Stars shed no light Through the black night When the clouds hide And the lashed wave If the winds rave O er ocean s tide Though once serene As day s fair sheen Soon fouled and spoiled By the storm s spite Shows to the sight Turbid and soiled Oft the fair rill Down the steep hill Seaward that strays Some tumbled block Of fallen rock Hinders and stays Then art thou fain Clear and most plain Truth to discern In the right way Firmly to stay Nor from it turn Joy hope and fear Suffer not near Drive grief away Shackled and blind And lost is the mind Where these have sway BOOK II THE VANITY OF FORTUNE S GIFTS Summary CH I Philosophy reproves Boethius for the foolishness of his complaints against Fortune Her very nature is caprice CH II Philosophy in Fortune s name replies to Boethius reproaches and proves that the gifts of Fortune are hers to give and to take away CH III Boethius falls back upon his present sense of misery Philosophy reminds him of the brilliancy of his former fortunes CH IV Boethius objects that the memory of past happiness is the bitterest portion of the lot of the unhappy Philosophy shows that much is still left for which he may be thankful None enjoy perfect satisfaction with their lot But happiness depends not on anything which Fortune can give It is to be sought within CH V All the gifts of Fortune are external they can never truly be our own Man cannot find his good in worldly possessions Riches bring anxiety and trouble CH VI High place without virtue is an evil not a good Power is an empty name CH VII Fame is a thing of little account when compared with the immensity of the Universe and the endlessness of Time CH VIII One service only can Fortune do when she reveals her own nature and distinguishes true friends from false BOOK II I Thereafter for awhile she remained silent and when she had restored my flagging attention by a moderate pause in her discourse she thus began If I have thoroughly ascertained the character and causes of thy sickness thou art pining with regretful longing for thy former fortune It is the change as thou deemest of this fortune that hath so wrought upon thy mind Well do I understand that Siren s manifold wiles the fatal charm of the friendship she pretends for her victims so long as she is scheming to entrap them how she unexpectedly abandons them and leaves them overwhelmed with insupportable grief Bethink thee of her nature character and deserts and thou wilt soon acknowledge that in her thou hast neither possessed nor hast thou lost aught of any worth Methinks I need not spend much pains in bringing this to thy mind since even when she was still with thee even while she was caressing thee thou usedst to assail her in manly terms to rebuke her with maxims drawn from my holy treasure house But all sudden changes of circumstances bring inevitably a certain commotion of spirit Thus it hath come to pass that thou also for awhile hast been parted from thy mind s tranquillity But it is time for thee to take and drain a draught soft and pleasant to the taste which as it penetrates within may prepare the way for stronger potions Wherefore I call to my aid the sweet persuasiveness of Rhetoric who then only walketh in the right way when she forsakes not my instructions and Music my handmaid I bid to join with her singing now in lighter now in graver strain What is it then poor mortal that hath cast thee into lamentation and mourning Some strange unwonted sight methinks have thine eyes seen Thou deemest Fortune to have changed towards thee thou mistakest Such ever were her ways ever such her nature Rather in her very mutability hath she preserved towards thee her true constancy Such was she when she loaded thee with caresses when she deluded thee with the allurements of a false happiness Thou hast found out how changeful is the face of the blind goddess She who still veils herself from others hath fully discovered to thee her whole character If thou likest her take her as she is and do not complain If thou abhorrest her perfidy turn from her in disdain renounce her for baneful are her delusions The very thing which is now the cause of thy great grief ought to have brought thee tranquillity Thou hast been forsaken by one of whom no one can be sure that she will not forsake him Or dost thou indeed set value on a happiness that is certain to depart Again I ask Is Fortune s presence dear to thee if she cannot be trusted to stay and though she will bring sorrow when she is gone Why if she cannot be kept at pleasure and if her flight overwhelms with calamity what is this fleeting visitant but a token of coming trouble Truly it is not enough to look only at what lies before the eyes wisdom gauges the issues of things and this same mutability with its two aspects makes the threats of Fortune void of terror and her caresses little to be desired Finally thou oughtest to bear with whatever takes place within the boundaries of Fortune s demesne when thou hast placed thy head beneath her yoke But if thou wishest to impose a law of staying and departing on her whom thou hast of thine own accord chosen for thy mistress art thou not acting wrongfully art thou not embittering by impatience a lot which thou canst not alter Didst thou commit thy sails to the winds thou wouldst voyage not whither thy intention was to go but whither the winds drave thee didst thou entrust thy seed to the fields thou wouldst set off the fruitful years against the barren Thou hast resigned thyself to the sway of Fortune thou must submit to thy mistress s caprices What art thou verily striving to stay the swing of the revolving wheel Oh stupidest of mortals if it takes to standing still it ceases to be the wheel of Fortune SONG I FORTUNE S MALICE Mad Fortune sweeps along in wanton pride Uncertain as Euripus surging tide Now tramples mighty kings beneath her feet Now sets the conquered in the victor s seat She heedeth not the wail of hapless woe But mocks the griefs that from her mischief flow Such is her sport so proveth she her power And great the marvel when in one brief hour She shows her darling lifted high in bliss Then headlong plunged in misery s abyss II Now I would fain also reason with thee a little in Fortune s own words Do thou observe whether her contentions be just Man she might say why dost thou pursue me with thy daily complainings What wrong have I done thee What goods of thine have I taken from thee Choose an thou wilt a judge and let us dispute before him concerning the rightful ownership of wealth and rank If thou succeedest in showing that any one of these things is the true property of mortal man I freely grant those things to be thine which thou claimest When nature brought thee forth out of thy mother s womb I took thee naked and destitute as thou wast I cherished thee with my substance and in the partiality of my favour for thee I brought thee up somewhat too indulgently and this it is which now makes thee rebellious against me I surrounded thee with a royal abundance of all those things that are in my power Now it is my pleasure to draw back my hand Thou hast reason to thank me for the use of what was not thine own thou hast no right to complain as if thou hadst lost what was wholly thine Why then dost bemoan thyself I have done thee no violence Wealth honour and all such things are placed under my control My handmaidens know their mistress with me they come and at my going they depart I might boldly affirm that if those things the loss of which thou lamentest had been thine thou couldst never have lost them Am I alone to be forbidden to do what I will with my own Unrebuked the skies now reveal the brightness of day now shroud the daylight in the darkness of night the year may now engarland the face of the earth with flowers and fruits now disfigure it with storms and cold The sea is permitted to invite with smooth and tranquil surface to day to morrow to roughen with wave and storm Shall man s insatiate greed bind me to a constancy foreign to my character This is my art this the game I never cease to play I turn the wheel that spins I delight to see the high come down and the low ascend Mount up if thou wilt but only on condition that thou wilt not think it a hardship to come down when the rules of my game require it Wert thou ignorant of my character Didst not know how Croesus King of the Lydians erstwhile the dreaded rival of Cyrus was afterwards pitiably consigned to the flame of the pyre and only saved by a shower sent from heaven Has it scaped thee how Paullus paid a meed of pious tears to the misfortunes of King Perseus his prisoner What else do tragedies make such woeful outcry over save the overthrow of kingdoms by the indiscriminate strokes of Fortune Didst thou not learn in thy childhood how there stand at the threshold of Zeus two jars the one full of blessings the other of calamities How if thou hast drawn over liberally from the good jar What if not even now have I departed wholly from thee What if this very mutability of mine is a just ground for hoping better things But listen now and cease to let thy heart consume away with fretfulness nor expect to live on thine own terms in a realm that is common to all SONG II MAN S COVETOUSNESS What though Plenty pour her gifts With a lavish hand Numberless as are the stars Countless as the sand Will the race of man content Cease to murmur and lament Nay though God all bounteous give Gold at man s desire Honours rank and fame content Not a whit is nigher But an all devouring greed Yawns with ever widening need Then what bounds can e er restrain This wild lust of having When with each new bounty fed Grows the frantic craving He is never rich whose fear Sees grim Want forever near III If Fortune should plead thus against thee assuredly thou wouldst not have one word to offer in reply or if thou canst find any justification of thy complainings thou must show what it is I will give thee space to speak Then said I Verily thy pleas are plausible yea steeped in the honeyed sweetness of music and rhetoric But their charm lasts only while they are sounding in the ear the sense of his misfortunes lies deeper in the heart of the wretched So when the sound ceases to vibrate upon the air the heart s indwelling sorrow is felt with renewed bitterness Then said she It is indeed as thou sayest for we have not yet come to the curing of thy sickness as yet these are but lenitives conducing to the treatment of a malady hitherto obstinate The remedies which go deep I will apply in due season Nevertheless to deprecate thy determination to be thought wretched I ask thee Hast thou forgotten the extent and bounds of thy felicity I say nothing of how when orphaned and desolate thou wast taken into the care of illustrious men how thou wast chosen for alliance with the highest in the state and even before thou wert bound to their house by marriage wert already dear to their love which is the most precious of all ties Did not all pronounce thee most happy in the virtues of thy wife the splendid honours of her father and the blessing of male issue I pass over for I care not to speak of blessings in which others also have shared the distinctions often denied to age which thou enjoyedst in thy youth I choose rather to come to the unparalleled culmination of thy good fortune If the fruition of any earthly success has weight in the scale of happiness can the memory of that splendour be swept away by any rising flood of troubles That day when thou didst see thy two sons ride forth from home joint consuls followed by a train of senators and welcomed by the good will of the people when these two sat in curule chairs in the Senate house and thou by thy panegyric on the king didst earn the fame of eloquence and ability when in the Circus seated between the two consuls thou didst glut the multitude thronging around with the triumphal largesses for which they looked methinks thou didst cozen Fortune while she caressed thee and made thee her darling Thou didst bear off a boon which she had never before granted to any private person Art thou then minded to cast up a reckoning with Fortune Now for the first time she has turned a jealous glance upon thee If thou compare the extent and bounds of thy blessings and misfortunes thou canst not deny that thou art still fortunate Or if thou esteem not thyself favoured by Fortune in that thy then seeming prosperity hath departed deem not thyself wretched since what thou now believest to be calamitous passeth also What art thou but now come suddenly and a stranger to the scene of this life Thinkest thou there is any stability in human affairs when man himself vanishes away in the swift course of time It is true that there is little trust that the gifts of chance will abide yet the last day of life is in a manner the death of all remaining Fortune What difference then thinkest thou is there whether thou leavest her by dying or she leave thee by fleeing away SONG III ALL PASSES When in rosy chariot drawn Phoebus gins to light the dawn By his flaming beams assailed Every glimmering star is paled When the grove by Zephyrs fed With rose blossom blushes red Doth rude Auster breathe thereon Bare it stands its glory gone Smooth and tranquil lies the deep While the winds are hushed in sleep Soon when angry tempests lash Wild and high the billows dash Thus if Nature s changing face Holds not still a moment s space Fleeting deem man s fortunes deem Bliss as transient as a dream One law only standeth fast Things created may not last IV Then said I True are thine admonishings thou nurse of all excellence nor can I deny the wonder of my fortune s swift career Yet it is this which chafes me the more cruelly in the recalling For truly in adverse fortune the worst sting of misery is to have been happy Well said she if thou art paying the penalty of a mistaken belief thou canst not rightly impute the fault to circumstances If it is the felicity which Fortune gives that moves thee mere name though it be come reckon up with me how rich thou art in the number and weightiness of thy blessings Then if by the blessing of Providence thou hast still preserved unto thee safe and inviolate that which howsoever thou mightest reckon thy fortune thou wouldst have thought thy most precious possession what right hast thou to talk of ill fortune whilst keeping all Fortune s better gifts Yet Symmachus thy wife s father a man whose splendid character does honour to the human race is safe and unharmed and while he bewails thy wrongs this rare nature in whom wisdom and virtue are so nobly blended is himself out of danger a boon thou wouldst have been quick to purchase at the price of life itself Thy wife yet lives with her gentle disposition her peerless modesty and virtue this the epitome of all her graces that she is the true daughter of her sire she lives I say and for thy sake only preserves the breath of life though she loathes it and pines away in grief and tears for thy absence wherein if in naught else I would allow some marring of thy felicity What shall I say of thy sons and their consular dignity how in them so far as may be in youths of their age the example of their father s and grandfather s character shines out Since then the chief care of mortal man is to preserve his life how happy art thou couldst thou but recognise thy blessings who possessest even now what no one doubts to be dearer than life Wherefore now dry thy tears Fortune s hate hath not involved all thy dear ones the stress of the storm that has assailed thee is not beyond measure intolerable since there are anchors still holding firm which suffer thee not to lack either consolation in the present or hope for the future I pray that they still may hold For while they still remain however things may go I shall ride out the storm Yet thou seest how much is shorn of the splendour of my fortunes We are gaining a little ground said she if there is something in thy lot wherewith thou art not yet altogether discontented But I cannot stomach thy daintiness when thou complainest with such violence of grief and anxiety because thy happiness falls short of completeness Why who enjoys such settled felicity as not to have some quarrel with the circumstances of his lot A troublous matter are the conditions of human bliss either they are never realized in full or never stay permanently One has abundant riches but is shamed by his ignoble birth Another is conspicuous for his nobility but through the embarrassments of poverty would prefer to be obscure A third richly endowed with both laments the loneliness of an unwedded life Another though happily married is doomed to childlessness and nurses his wealth for a stranger to inherit Yet another blest with children mournfully bewails the misdeeds of son or daughter Wherefore it is not easy for anyone to be at perfect peace with the circumstances of his lot There lurks in each several portion something which they who experience it not know nothing of but which makes the sufferer wince Besides the more favoured a man is by Fortune the more fastidiously sensitive is he and unless all things answer to his whim he is overwhelmed by the most trifling misfortunes because utterly unschooled in adversity So petty are the trifles which rob the most fortunate of perfect happiness How many are there dost thou imagine who would think themselves nigh heaven if but a small portion from the wreck of thy fortune should fall to them This very place which thou callest exile is to them that dwell therein their native land So true is it that nothing is wretched but thinking makes it so and conversely every lot is happy if borne with equanimity Who is so blest by Fortune as not to wish to change his state if once he gives rein to a rebellious spirit With how many bitternesses is the sweetness of human felicity blent And even if that sweetness seem to him to bring delight in the enjoying yet he cannot keep it from departing when it will How manifestly wretched then is the bliss of earthly fortune which lasts not for ever with those whose temper is equable and can give no perfect satisfaction to the anxious minded Why then ye children of mortality seek ye from without that happiness whose seat is only within us Error and ignorance bewilder you I will show thee in brief the hinge on which perfect happiness turns Is there anything more precious to thee than thyself Nothing thou wilt say If then thou art master of thyself thou wilt possess that which thou wilt never be willing to lose and which Fortune cannot take from thee And that thou mayst see that happiness cannot possibly consist in these things which are the sport of chance reflect that if happiness is the highest good of a creature living in accordance with reason and if a thing which can in any wise be reft away is not the highest good since that which cannot be taken away is better than it it is plain that Fortune cannot aspire to bestow happiness by reason of its instability And besides a man borne along by this transitory felicity must either know or not know its unstability If he knows not how poor is a happiness which depends on the blindness of ignorance If he knows it he needs must fear to lose a happiness whose loss he believes to be possible Wherefore a never ceasing fear suffers him not to be happy Or does he count the possibility of this loss a trifling matter Insignificant then must be the good whose loss can be borne so equably And further I know thee to be one settled in the belief that the souls of men certainly die not with them and convinced thereof by numerous proofs it is clear also that the felicity which Fortune bestows is brought to an end with the death of the body therefore it cannot be doubted but that if happiness is conferred in this way the whole human race sinks into misery when death brings the close of all But if we know that many have sought the joy of happiness not through death only but also through pain and suffering how can life make men happy by its presence when it makes them not wretched by its loss SONG IV THE GOLDEN MEAN Who founded firm and sure Would ever live secure In spite of storm and blast Immovable and fast Whoso would fain deride The ocean s threatening tide His dwelling should not seek On sands or mountain peak Upon the mountain s height The storm winds wreak their spite The shifting sands disdain Their burden to sustain Do thou these perils flee Fair though the prospect be And fix thy resting place On some low rock s sure base Then though the tempests roar Seas thunder on the shore Thou in thy stronghold blest And undisturbed shalt rest Live all thy days serene And mock the heavens spleen V But since my reasonings begin to work a soothing effect within thy mind methinks I may resort to remedies somewhat stronger Come suppose now the gifts of Fortune were not fleeting and transitory what is there in them capable of ever becoming truly thine or which does not lose value when looked at steadily and fairly weighed in the balance Are riches I pray thee precious either through thy nature or in their own What are they but mere gold and heaps of money Yet these fine things show their quality better in the spending than in the hoarding for I suppose tis plain that greed Alva s makes men hateful while liberality brings fame But that which is transferred to another cannot remain in one s own possession and if that be so then money is only precious when it is given away and by being transferred to others ceases to be one s own Again if all the money in the world were heaped up in one man s possession all others would be made poor Sound fills the ears of many at the same time without being broken into parts but your riches cannot pass to many without being lessened in the process And when this happens they must needs impoverish those whom they leave How poor and cramped a thing then is riches which more than one cannot possess as an unbroken whole which falls not to any one man s lot without the impoverishment of everyone else Or is it the glitter of gems that allures the eye Yet how rarely excellent soever may be their splendour remember the flashing light is in the jewels not in the man Indeed I greatly marvel at men s admiration of them for what can rightly seem beautiful to a being endowed with life and reason if it lack the movement and structure of life And although such things do in the end take on them more beauty from their Maker s care and their own brilliancy still they in no wise merit your admiration since their excellence is set at a lower grade than your own Does the beauty of the fields delight you Surely yes it is a beautiful part of a right beautiful whole Fitly indeed do we at times enjoy the serene calm of the sea admire the sky the stars the moon the sun Yet is any of these thy concern Dost thou venture to boast thyself of the beauty of any one of them Art thou decked with spring s flowers is it thy fertility that swelleth in the fruits of autumn Why art thou moved with empty transports why embracest thou an alien excellence as thine own Never will fortune make thine that which the nature of things has excluded from thy ownership Doubtless the fruits of the earth are given for the sustenance of living creatures But if thou art content to supply thy wants so far as suffices nature there is no need to resort to fortune s bounty Nature is content with few things and with a very little of these If thou art minded to force superfluities upon her when she is satisfied that which thou addest will prove either unpleasant or harmful But now thou thinkest it fine to shine in raiment of divers colours yet if indeed there is any pleasure in the sight of such things it is the texture or the artist s skill which I shall admire Or perhaps it is a long train of servants that makes thee happy Why if they behave viciously they are a ruinous burden to thy house and exceeding dangerous to their own master while if they are honest how canst thou count other men s virtue in the sum of thy possessions From all which tis plainly proved that not one of these things which thou reckonest in the number of thy possessions is really thine And if there is in them no beauty to be desired why shouldst thou either grieve for their loss or find joy in their continued possession While if they are beautiful in their own nature what is that to thee They would have been not less pleasing in themselves though never included among thy possessions For they derive not their preciousness from being counted in thy riches but rather thou hast chosen to count them in thy riches because they seemed to thee precious Then what seek ye by all this noisy outcry about fortune To chase away poverty I ween by means of abundance And yet ye find the result just contrary Why this varied array of precious furniture needs more accessories for its protection it is a true saying that they want most who possess most and conversely they want very little who measure their abundance by nature s requirements not by the superfluity of vain display Have ye no good of your own implanted within you that ye seek your good in things external and separate Is the nature of things so reversed that a creature divine by right of reason can in no other way be splendid in his own eyes save by the possession of lifeless chattels Yet while other things are content with their own ye who in your intellect are God like seek from the lowest of things adornment for a nature of supreme excellence and perceive not how great a wrong ye do your Maker His will was that mankind should excel all things on earth Ye thrust down your worth beneath the lowest of things For if that in which each thing finds its good is plainly more precious than that whose good it is by your own estimation ye put yourselves below the vilest of things when ye deem these vile things to be your good nor does this fall out undeservedly Indeed man is so constituted that he then only excels other things when he knows himself but he is brought lower than the beasts if he lose this self knowledge For that other creatures should be ignorant of themselves is natural in man it shows as a defect How extravagant then is this error of yours in thinking that anything can be embellished by adornments not its own It cannot be For if such accessories add any lustre it is the accessories that get the praise while that which they veil and cover remains in its pristine ugliness And again I say That is no good which injures its possessor Is this untrue No quite true thou sayest And yet riches have often hurt those that possessed them since the worst of men who are all the more covetous by reason of their wickedness think none but themselves worthy to possess all the gold and gems the world contains So thou who now dreadest pike and sword mightest have trolled a carol in the robber s face hadst thou entered the road of life with empty pockets Oh wondrous blessedness of perishable wealth whose acquisition robs thee of security SONG V THE FORMER AGE Too blest the former age their life Who in the fields contented led And still by luxury unspoiled On frugal acorns sparely fed No skill was theirs the luscious grape With honey s sweetness to confuse Nor China s soft and sheeny silks T empurple with brave Tyrian hues The grass their wholesome couch their drink The stream their roof the pine s tall shade Not theirs to cleave the deep nor seek In strange far lands the spoils of trade The trump of war was heard not yet Nor soiled the fields by bloodshed s stain For why should war s fierce madness arm When strife brought wound but brought not gain Ah would our hearts might still return To following in those ancient ways Alas the greed of getting glows More fierce than Etna s fiery blaze Woe woe for him whoe er it was Who first gold s hidden store revealed And perilous treasure trove dug out The gems that fain would be concealed VI What now shall I say of rank and power whereby because ye know not true power and dignity ye hope to reach the sky Yet when rank and power have fallen to the worst of men did ever an Etna belching forth flame and fiery deluge work such mischief Verily as I think thou dost remember how thine ancestors sought to abolish the consular power which had been the foundation of their liberties on account of the overweening pride of the consuls and how for that self same pride they had already abolished the kingly title And if as happens but rarely these prerogatives are conferred on virtuous men it is only the virtue of those who exercise them that pleases So it appears that honour cometh not to virtue from rank but to rank from virtue Look too at the nature of that power which ye find so attractive and glorious Do ye never consider ye creatures of earth what ye are and over whom ye exercise your fancied lordship Suppose now that in the mouse tribe there should rise up one claiming rights and powers for himself above the rest would ye not laugh consumedly Yet if thou lookest to his body alone what creature canst thou find more feeble than man who oftentimes is killed by the bite of a fly or by some insect creeping into the inner passage of his system Yet what rights can one exercise over another save only as regards the body and that which is lower than the body I mean fortune What wilt thou bind with thy mandates the free spirit Canst thou force from its due tranquillity the mind that is firmly composed by reason A tyrant thought to drive a man of free birth to reveal his accomplices in a conspiracy but the prisoner bit off his tongue and threw it into the furious tyrant s face thus the tortures which the tyrant thought the instrument of his cruelty the sage made an opportunity for heroism Moreover what is there that one man can do to another which he himself may not have to undergo in his turn We are told that Busiris who used to kill his guests was himself slain by his guest Hercules Regulus had thrown into bonds many of the Carthaginians whom he had taken in war soon after he himself submitted his hands to the chains of the vanquished Then thinkest thou that man hath any power who cannot prevent another s being able to do to him what he himself can do to others Besides if there were any element of natural and proper good in rank and power they would never come to the utterly bad since opposites are not wont to be associated Nature brooks not the union of contraries So seeing there is no doubt that wicked wretches are oftentimes set in high places it is also clear that things which suffer association with the worst of men cannot be good in their own nature Indeed this judgment may with some reason be passed concerning all the gifts of fortune which fall so plentifully to all the most wicked This ought also to be considered here I think No one doubts a man to be brave in whom he has observed a brave spirit residing It is plain that one who is endowed with speed is swift footed So also music makes men musical the healing art physicians rhetoric public speakers For each of these has naturally its own proper working there is no confusion with the effects of contrary things nay even of itself it rejects what is incompatible And yet wealth cannot extinguish insatiable greed nor has power ever made him master of himself whom vicious lusts kept bound in indissoluble fetters dignity conferred on the wicked not only fails to make them worthy but contrarily reveals and displays their unworthiness Why does it so happen Because ye take pleasure in calling by false names things whose nature is quite incongruous thereto by names which are easily proved false by the very effects of the things themselves even so it is these riches that power this dignity are none of them rightly so called Finally we may draw the same conclusion concerning the whole sphere of Fortune within which there is plainly nothing to be truly desired nothing of intrinsic excellence for she neither always joins herself to the good nor does she make good men of those to whom she is united SONG VI NERO S INFAMY We know what mischief dire he wrought Rome fired the Fathers slain Whose hand with brother s slaughter wet A mother s blood did stain No pitying tear his cheek bedewed As on the corse he gazed That mother s beauty once so fair A critic s voice appraised Yet far and wide from East to West His sway the nations own And scorching South and icy North Obey his will alone Did then high power a curb impose On Nero s phrenzied will Ah woe when to the evil heart Is joined the sword to kill VII Then said I Thou knowest thyself that ambition for worldly success hath but little swayed me Yet I have desired opportunity for action lest virtue in default of exercise should languish away Then she This is that last infirmity which is able to allure minds which though of noble quality have not yet been moulded to any exquisite refinement by the perfecting of the virtues I mean the love of glory and fame for high services rendered to the commonweal And yet consider with me how poor and unsubstantial a thing this glory is The whole of this earth s globe as thou hast learnt from the demonstration of astronomy compared with the expanse of heaven is found no bigger than a point that is to say if measured by the vastness of heaven s sphere it is held to occupy absolutely no space at all Now of this so insignificant portion of the universe it is about a fourth part as Ptolemy s proofs have taught us which is inhabited by living creatures known to us If from this fourth part you take away in thought all that is usurped by seas and marshes or lies a vast waste of waterless desert barely is an exceeding narrow area left for human habitation You then who are shut in and prisoned in this merest fraction of a point s space do ye take thought for the blazoning of your fame for the spreading abroad of your renown Why what amplitude or magnificence has glory when confined to such narrow and petty limits Besides the straitened bounds of this scant dwelling place are inhabited by many nations differing widely in speech in usages in mode of life to many of these from the difficulty of travel from diversities of speech from want of commercial intercourse the fame not only of individual men but even of cities is unable to reach Why in Cicero s days as he himself somewhere points out the fame of the Roman Republic had not yet crossed the Caucasus and yet by that time her name had grown formidable to the Parthians and other nations of those parts Seest thou then how narrow how confined is the glory ye take pains to spread abroad and extend Can the fame of a single Roman penetrate where the glory of the Roman name fails to pass Moreover the customs and institutions of different races agree not together so that what is deemed praise worthy in one country is thought punishable in another Wherefore if any love the applause of fame it shall not profit him to publish his name among many peoples Then each must be content to have the range of his glory limited to his own people the splendid immortality of fame must be confined within the bounds of a single race Once more how many of high renown in their own times have been lost in oblivion for want of a record Indeed of what avail are written records even which with their authors are overtaken by the dimness of age after a somewhat longer time But ye when ye think on future fame fancy it an immortality that ye are begetting for yourselves Why if thou scannest the infinite spaces of eternity what room hast thou left for rejoicing in the durability of thy name Verily if a single moment s space be compared with ten thousand years it has a certain relative duration however little since each period is definite But this same number of years ay and a number many times as great cannot even be compared with endless duration for indeed finite periods may in a sort be compared one with another but a finite and an infinite never So it comes to pass that fame though it extend to ever so wide a space of years if it be compared to never lessening eternity seems not short lived merely but altogether nothing But as for you ye know not how to act aright unless it be to court the popular breeze and win the empty applause of the multitude nay ye abandon the superlative worth of conscience and virtue and ask a recompense from the poor words of others Let me tell thee how wittily one did mock the shallowness of this sort of arrogance A certain man assailed one who had put on the name of philosopher as a cloak to pride and vain glory not for the practice of real virtue and added Now shall I know if thou art a philosopher if thou bearest reproaches calmly and patiently The other for awhile affected to be patient and having endured to be abused cried out derisively Now do you see that I am a philosopher The other with biting sarcasm retorted I should have hadst thou held thy peace Moreover what concern have choice spirits for it is of such men we speak men who seek glory by virtue what concern I say have these with fame after the dissolution of the body in death s last hour For if men die wholly which our reasonings forbid us to believe there is no such thing as glory at all since he to whom the glory is said to belong is altogether non existent But if the mind conscious of its own rectitude is released from its earthly prison and seeks heaven in free flight doth it not despise all earthly things when it rejoices in its deliverance from earthly bonds and enters upon the joys of heaven SONG VII GLORY MAY NOT LAST Oh let him who pants for glory s guerdon Deeming glory all in all Look and see how wide the heaven expandeth Earth s enclosing bounds how small Shame it is if your proud swelling glory May not fill this narrow room Why then strive so vainly oh ye proud ones To escape your mortal doom Though your name to distant regions bruited O er the earth be widely spread Though full many a lofty sounding title On your house its lustre shed Death at all this pomp and glory spurneth When his hour draweth nigh Shrouds alike th exalted and the humble Levels lowest and most high Where are now the bones of stanch Fabricius Brutus Cato where are they Lingering fame with a few graven letters Doth their empty name display But to know the great dead is not given From a gilded name alone Nay ye all alike must lie forgotten Tis not you that fame makes known Fondly do ye deem life s little hour Lengthened by fame s mortal breath There but waits you when this too is taken At the last a second death VIII But that thou mayst not think that I wage implacable warfare against Fortune I own there is a time when the deceitful goddess serves men well I mean when she reveals herself uncovers her face and confesses her true character Perhaps thou dost not yet grasp my meaning Strange is the thing I am trying to express and for this cause I can scarce find words to make clear my thought For truly I believe that Ill Fortune is of more use to men than Good Fortune For Good Fortune when she wears the guise of happiness and most seems to caress is always lying Ill Fortune is always truthful since in changing she shows her inconstancy The one deceives the other teaches the one enchains the minds of those who enjoy her favour by the semblance of delusive good the other delivers them by the knowledge of the frail nature of happiness Accordingly thou mayst see the one fickle shifting as the breeze and ever self deceived the other sober minded alert and wary by reason of the very discipline of adversity Finally Good Fortune by her allurements draws men far from the true good Ill Fortune ofttimes draws men back to true good with grappling irons Again should it be esteemed a trifling boon thinkest thou that this cruel this odious Fortune hath discovered to thee the hearts of thy faithful friends that other hid from thee alike the faces of the true friends and of the false but in departing she hath taken away her friends and left thee thine What price wouldst thou not have given for this service in the fulness of thy prosperity when thou seemedst to thyself fortunate Cease then to seek the wealth thou hast lost since in true friends thou hast found the most precious of all riches

none	none	LOVE IS LORD OF ALL Why are Nature s changes bound To a fixed and ordered round What to leagued peace hath bent Every warring element Wherefore doth the rosy morn Rise on Phoebus car upborne Why should Phoebe rule the night Led by Hesper s guiding light What the power that doth restrain In his place the restless main That within fixed bounds he keeps Nor o er earth in deluge sweeps Love it is that holds the chains Love o er sea and earth that reigns Love whom else but sovereign Love Love high lord in heaven above Yet should he his care remit All that now so close is knit In sweet love and holy peace Would no more from conflict cease But with strife s rude shock and jar All the world s fair fabric mar Tribes and nations Love unites By just treaty s sacred rites Wedlock s bonds he sanctifies By affection s softest ties Love appointeth as is due Faithful laws to comrades true Love all sovereign Love oh then Ye are blest ye sons of men If the love that rules the sky In your hearts is throned on high BOOK III TRUE HAPPINESS AND FALSE SUMMARY CH I Boethius beseeches Philosophy to continue She promises to lead him to true happiness CH II Happiness is the one end which all created beings seek They aim variously at a wealth or b rank or c sovereignty or d glory or e pleasure because they think thereby to attain either a contentment b reverence c power d renown or e gladness of heart in one or other of which they severally imagine happiness to consist CH III Philosophy proceeds to consider whether happiness can really be secured in any of these ways a So far from bringing contentment riches only add to men s wants CH IV b High position cannot of itself win respect Titles command no reverence in distant and barbarous lands They even fall into contempt through lapse of time CH V c Sovereignty cannot even bestow safety History tells of the downfall of kings and their ministers Tyrants go in fear of their lives CH VI d Fame conferred on the unworthy is but disgrace The splendour of noble birth is not a man s own but his ancestors CH VII e Pleasure begins in the restlessness of desire and ends in repentance Even the pure pleasures of home may turn to gall and bitterness CH VIII All fail then to give what they promise There is moreover some accompanying evil involved in each of these aims Beauty and bodily strength are likewise of little worth In strength man is surpassed by the brutes beauty is but outward show CH IX The source of men s error in following these phantoms of good is that they break up and separate that which is in its nature one and indivisible Contentment power reverence renown and joy are essentially bound up one with the other and if they are to be attained at all must be attained together True happiness if it can be found will include them all But it cannot be found among the perishable things hitherto considered CH X Such a happiness necessarily exists Its seat is in God Nay God is very happiness and in a manner therefore the happy man partakes also of the Divine nature All other ends are relative to this good since they are all pursued only for the sake of good it is good which is the sole ultimate end And since the sole end is also happiness it is plain that this good and happiness are in essence the same CH XI Unity is another aspect of goodness Now all things subsist so long only as they preserve the unity of their being when they lose this unity they perish But the bent of nature forces all things plants and inanimate things as well as animals to strive to continue in life Therefore all things desire unity for unity is essential to life But unity and goodness were shown to be the same Therefore good is proved to be the end towards which the whole universe tends E CH XII Boethius acknowledges that he is but recollecting truths he once knew Philosophy goes on to show that it is goodness also by which the whole world is governed F Boethius professes compunction for his former folly But the paradox of evil is introduced and he is once more perplexed FOOTNOTES E This solves the second of the points left in doubt at the end of bk i ch vi F This solves the third No distinct account is given of the first but an answer may be gathered from the general argument of bks ii iii and iv BOOK III I She ceased but I stood fixed by the sweetness of the song in wonderment and eager expectation my ears still strained to listen And then after a little I said Thou sovereign solace of the stricken soul what refreshment hast thou brought me no less by the sweetness of thy singing than by the weightiness of thy discourse Verily I think not that I shall hereafter be unequal to the blows of Fortune Wherefore I no longer dread the remedies which thou saidst were something too severe for my strength nay rather I am eager to hear of them and call for them with all vehemence Then said she I marked thee fastening upon my words silently and intently and I expected or to speak more truly I myself brought about in thee this state of mind What now remains is of such sort that to the taste indeed it is biting but when received within it turns to sweetness But whereas thou dost profess thyself desirous of hearing with what ardour wouldst thou not burn didst thou but perceive whither it is my task to lead thee Whither said I To true felicity said she which even now thy spirit sees in dreams but cannot behold in very truth while thine eyes are engrossed with semblances Then said I I beseech thee do thou show to me her true shape without a moment s loss Gladly will I for thy sake said she But first I will try to sketch in words and describe a cause which is more familiar to thee that when thou hast viewed this carefully thou mayst turn thy eyes the other way and recognise the beauty of true happiness SONG I THE THORNS OF ERROR Who fain would sow the fallow field And see the growing corn Must first remove the useless weeds The bramble and the thorn After ill savour honey s taste Is to the mouth more sweet After the storm the twinkling stars The eyes more cheerly greet When night hath past the bright dawn comes In car of rosy hue So drive the false bliss from thy mind And thou shall see the true II For a little space she remained in a fixed gaze withdrawn as it were into the august chamber of her mind then she thus began All mortal creatures in those anxious aims which find employment in so many varied pursuits though they take many paths yet strive to reach one goal the goal of happiness Now the good is that which when a man hath got he can lack nothing further This it is which is the supreme good of all containing within itself all particular good so that if anything is still wanting thereto this cannot be the supreme good since something would be left outside which might be desired Tis clear then that happiness is a state perfected by the assembling together of all good things To this state as we have said all men try to attain but by different paths For the desire of the true good is naturally implanted in the minds of men only error leads them aside out of the way in pursuit of the false Some deeming it the highest good to want for nothing spare no pains to attain affluence others judging the good to be that to which respect is most worthily paid strive to win the reverence of their fellow citizens by the attainment of official dignity Some there are who fix the chief good in supreme power these either wish themselves to enjoy sovereignty or try to attach themselves to those who have it Those again who think renown to be something of supreme excellence are in haste to spread abroad the glory of their name either through the arts of war or of peace A great many measure the attainment of good by joy and gladness of heart these think it the height of happiness to give themselves over to pleasure Others there are again who interchange the ends and means one with the other in their aims for instance some want riches for the sake of pleasure and power some covet power either for the sake of money or in order to bring renown to their name So it is on these ends then that the aim of human acts and wishes is centred and on others like to these for instance noble birth and popularity which seem to compass a certain renown wife and children which are sought for the sweetness of their possession while as for friendship the most sacred kind indeed is counted in the category of virtue not of fortune but other kinds are entered upon for the sake of power or of enjoyment And as for bodily excellences it is obvious that they are to be ranged with the above For strength and stature surely manifest power beauty and fleetness of foot bring celebrity health brings pleasure It is plain then that the only object sought for in all these ways is happiness For that which each seeks in preference to all else that is in his judgment the supreme good And we have defined the supreme good to be happiness Therefore that state which each wishes in preference to all others is in his judgment happy Thou hast then set before thine eyes something like a scheme of human happiness wealth rank power glory pleasure Now Epicurus from a sole regard to these considerations with some consistency concluded the highest good to be pleasure because all the other objects seem to bring some delight to the soul But to return to human pursuits and aims man s mind seeks to recover its proper good in spite of the mistiness of its recollection but like a drunken man knows not by what path to return home Think you they are wrong who strive to escape want Nay truly there is nothing which can so well complete happiness as a state abounding in all good things needing nothing from outside but wholly self sufficing Do they fall into error who deem that which is best to be also best deserving to receive the homage of reverence Not at all That cannot possibly be vile and contemptible to attain which the endeavours of nearly all mankind are directed Then is power not to be reckoned in the category of good Why can that which is plainly more efficacious than anything else be esteemed a thing feeble and void of strength Or is renown to be thought of no account Nay it cannot be ignored that the highest renown is constantly associated with the highest excellence And what need is there to say that happiness is not haunted by care and gloom nor exposed to trouble and vexation since that is a condition we ask of the very least of things from the possession and enjoyment of which we expect delight So then these are the blessings men wish to win they want riches rank sovereignty glory pleasure because they believe that by these means they will secure independence reverence power renown and joy of heart Therefore it is the good which men seek by such divers courses and herein is easily shown the might of Nature s power since although opinions are so various and discordant yet they agree in cherishing good as the end SONG II THE BENT OF NATURE How the might of Nature sways All the world in ordered ways How resistless laws control Each least portion of the whole Fain would I in sounding verse On my pliant strings rehearse Lo the lion captive ta en Meekly wears his gilded chain Yet though he by hand be fed Though a master s whip he dread If but once the taste of gore Whet his cruel lips once more Straight his slumbering fierceness wakes With one roar his bonds he breaks And first wreaks his vengeful force On his trainer s mangled corse And the woodland songster pent In forlorn imprisonment Though a mistress lavish care Store of honeyed sweets prepare Yet if in his narrow cage As he hops from bar to bar He should spy the woods afar Cool with sheltering foliage All these dainties he will spurn To the woods his heart will turn Only for the woods he longs Pipes the woods in all his songs To rude force the sapling bends While the hand its pressure lends If the hand its pressure slack Straight the supple wood springs back Phoebus in the western main Sinks but swift his car again By a secret path is borne To the wonted gates of morn Thus are all things seen to yearn In due time for due return And no order fixed may stay Save which in th appointed way Joins the end to the beginning In a steady cycle spinning III Ye too creatures of earth have some glimmering of your origin however faint and though in a vision dim and clouded yet in some wise notwithstanding ye discern the true end of happiness and so the aim of nature leads you thither to that true good while error in many forms leads you astray therefrom For reflect whether men are able to win happiness by those means through which they think to reach the proposed end Truly if either wealth rank or any of the rest bring with them anything of such sort as seems to have nothing wanting to it that is good we too acknowledge that some are made happy by the acquisition of these things But if they are not able to fulfil their promises and moreover lack many good things is not the happiness men seek in them clearly discovered to be a false show Therefore do I first ask thee thyself who but lately wert living in affluence amid all that abundance of wealth was thy mind never troubled in consequence of some wrong done to thee Nay said I I cannot ever remember a time when my mind was so completely at peace as not to feel the pang of some uneasiness Was it not because either something was absent which thou wouldst not have absent or present which thou wouldst have away Yes said I Then thou didst want the presence of the one the absence of the other Admitted But a man lacks that of which he is in want He does And he who lacks something is not in all points self sufficing No certainly not said I So wert thou then in the plenitude of thy wealth supporting this insufficiency I must have been Wealth then cannot make its possessor independent and free from all want yet this was what it seemed to promise Moreover I think this also well deserves to be considered that there is nothing in the special nature of money to hinder its being taken away from those who possess it against their will I admit it Why
157_121907_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 of course 
none	none	when every day the stronger wrests it from the weaker without his consent Else whence come lawsuits except in seeking to recover moneys which have been taken away against their owner s will by force or fraud True said I Then everyone will need some extraneous means of protection to keep his money safe Who can venture to deny it Yet he would not unless he possessed the money which it is possible to lose No he certainly would not Then we have worked round to an opposite conclusion the wealth which was thought to make a man independent rather puts him in need of further protection How in the world then can want be driven away by riches Cannot the rich feel hunger Cannot they thirst Are not the limbs of the wealthy sensitive to the winter s cold But thou wilt say the rich have the wherewithal to sate their hunger the means to get rid of thirst and cold True enough want can thus be soothed by riches wholly removed it cannot be For if this ever gaping ever craving want is glutted by wealth it needs must be that the want itself which can be so glutted still remains I do not speak of how very little suffices for nature and how for avarice nothing is enough Wherefore if wealth cannot get rid of want and makes new wants of its own how can ye believe that it bestows independence SONG III THE INSATIABLENESS OF AVARICE Though the covetous grown wealthy See his piles of gold rise high Though he gather store of treasure That can never satisfy Though with pearls his gorget blazes Rarest that the ocean yields Though a hundred head of oxen Travail in his ample fields Ne er shall carking care forsake him While he draws this vital breath And his riches go not with him When his eyes are closed in death IV Well but official dignity clothes him to whom it comes with honour and reverence Have then offices of state such power as to plant virtue in the minds of their possessors and drive out vice Nay they are rather wont to signalize iniquity than to chase it away and hence arises our indignation that honours so often fall to the most iniquitous of men Accordingly Catullus calls Nonius an ulcer spot though sitting in the curule chair Dost not see what infamy high position brings upon the bad Surely their unworthiness will be less conspicuous if their rank does not draw upon them the public notice In thy own case wouldst thou ever have been induced by all these perils to think of sharing office with Decoratus since thou hast discerned in him the spirit of a rascally parasite and informer No we cannot deem men worthy of reverence on account of their office whom we deem unworthy of the office itself But didst thou see a man endued with wisdom couldst thou suppose him not worthy of reverence nor of that wisdom with which he was endued No certainly not There is in Virtue a dignity of her own which she forthwith passes over to those to whom she is united And since public honours cannot do this it is clear that they do not possess the true beauty of dignity And here this well deserves to be noticed that if a man is the more scorned in proportion as he is despised by a greater number high position not only fails to win reverence for the wicked but even loads them the more with contempt by drawing more attention to them But not without retribution for the wicked pay back a return in kind to the dignities they put on by the pollution of their touch Perhaps too another consideration may teach thee to confess that true reverence cannot come through these counterfeit dignities It is this If one who had been many times consul chanced to visit barbaric lands would his office win him the reverence of the barbarians And yet if reverence were the natural effect of dignities they would not forego their proper function in any part of the world even as fire never anywhere fails to give forth heat But since this effect is not due to their own efficacy but is attached to them by the mistaken opinion of mankind they disappear straightway when they are set before those who do not esteem them dignities Thus the case stands with foreign peoples But does their repute last for ever even in the land of their origin Why the prefecture which was once a great power is now an empty name a burden merely on the senator s fortune the commissioner of the public corn supply was once a personage now what is more contemptible than this office For as we said just now that which hath no true comeliness of its own now receives now loses lustre at the caprice of those who have to do with it So then if dignities cannot win men reverence if they are actually sullied by the contamination of the wicked if they lose their splendour through time s changes if they come into contempt merely for lack of public estimation what precious beauty have they in themselves much less to give to others SONG IV DISGRACE OF HONOURS CONFERRED BY A TYRANT Though royal purple soothes his pride And snowy pearls his neck adorn Nero in all his riot lives The mark of universal scorn Yet he on reverend heads conferred Th inglorious honours of the state Shall we then deem them truly blessed Whom such preferment hath made great V Well then does sovereignty and the intimacy of kings prove able to confer power Why surely does not the happiness of kings endure for ever And yet antiquity is full of examples and these days also of kings whose happiness has turned into calamity How glorious a power which is not even found effectual for its own preservation But if happiness has its source in sovereign power is not happiness diminished and misery inflicted in its stead in so far as that power falls short of completeness Yet however widely human sovereignty be extended there must still be more peoples left over whom each several king holds no sway Now at whatever point the power on which happiness depends ceases here powerlessness steals in and makes wretchedness so by this way of reckoning there must needs be a balance of wretchedness in the lot of the king The tyrant who had made trial of the perils of his condition figured the fears that haunt a throne under the image of a sword hanging over a man s head G What sort of power then is this which cannot drive away the gnawings of anxiety or shun the stings of terror Fain would they themselves have lived secure but they cannot then they boast about their power Dost thou count him to possess power whom thou seest to wish what he cannot bring to pass Dost thou count him to possess power who encompasses himself with a body guard who fears those he terrifies more than they fear him who to keep up the semblance of power is himself at the mercy of his slaves Need I say anything of the friends of kings when I show royal dominion itself so utterly and miserably weak why ofttimes the royal power in its plenitude brings them low ofttimes involves them in its fall Nero drove his friend and preceptor Seneca to the choice of the manner of his death Antoninus exposed Papinianus who was long powerful at court to the swords of the soldiery Yet each of these was willing to renounce his power Seneca tried to surrender his wealth also to Nero and go into retirement but neither achieved his purpose When they tottered their very greatness dragged them down What manner of thing then is this power which keeps men in fear while they possess it which when thou art fain to keep thou art not safe and when thou desirest to lay it aside thou canst not rid thyself of Are friends any protection who have been attached by fortune not by virtue Nay him whom good fortune has made a friend ill fortune will make an enemy And what plague is more effectual to do hurt than a foe of one s own household FOOTNOTES G The sword of Damocles SONG V SELF MASTERY Who on power sets his aim First must his own spirit tame He must shun his neck to thrust Neath th unholy yoke of lust For though India s far off land Bow before his wide command Utmost Thule homage pay If he cannot drive away Haunting care and black distress In his power he s powerless VI Again how misleading how base a thing ofttimes is glory Well does the tragic poet exclaim Oh fond Repute how many a time and oft Hast them raised high in pride the base born churl For many have won a great name through the mistaken beliefs of the multitude and what can be imagined more shameful than that Nay they who are praised falsely must needs themselves blush at their own praises And even when praise is won by merit still how does it add to the good conscience of the wise man who measures his good not by popular repute but by the truth of inner conviction And if at all it does seem a fair thing to get this same renown spread abroad it follows that any failure so to spread it is held foul But if as I set forth but now there must needs be many tribes and peoples whom the fame of any single man cannot reach it follows that he whom thou esteemest glorious seems all inglorious in a neighbouring quarter of the globe As to popular favour I do not think it even worthy of mention in this place since it never cometh of judgment and never lasteth steadily Then again who does not see how empty how foolish is the fame of noble birth Why if the nobility is based on renown the renown is another s For truly nobility seems to be a sort of reputation coming from the merits of ancestors But if it is the praise which brings renown of necessity it is they who are praised that are famous Wherefore the fame of another clothes thee not with splendour if thou hast none of thine own So if there is any excellence in nobility of birth methinks it is this alone that it would seem to impose upon the nobly born the obligation not to degenerate from the virtue of their ancestors SONG VI TRUE NOBILITY All men are of one kindred stock though scattered far and wide For one is Father of us all one doth for all provide He gave the sun his golden beams the moon her silver horn He set mankind upon the earth as stars the heavens adorn He shut a soul a heaven born soul within the body s frame The noble origin he gave each mortal wight may claim Why boast ye then so loud of race and high ancestral line If ye behold your being s source and God s supreme design None is degenerate none base unless by taint of sin And cherished vice he foully stain his heavenly origin VII Then what shall I say of the pleasures of the body The lust thereof is full of uneasiness the sating of repentance What sicknesses what intolerable pains are they wont to bring on the bodies of those who enjoy them the fruits of iniquity as it were Now what sweetness the stimulus of pleasure may have I do not know But that the issues of pleasure are painful everyone may understand who chooses to recall the memory of his own fleshly lusts Nay if these can make happiness there is no reason why the beasts also should not be happy since all their efforts are eagerly set upon satisfying the bodily wants I know indeed that the sweetness of wife and children should be right comely yet only too true to nature is what was said of one that he found in his sons his tormentors And how galling such a contingency would be I must needs put thee in mind since thou hast never in any wise suffered such experiences nor art thou now under any uneasiness In such a case I agree with my servant Euripides who said that a man without children was fortunate in his misfortune H FOOTNOTES H Paley translates the lines in Euripides Andromache They the childless are indeed spared from much pain and sorrow but their supposed happiness is after all but wretchedness Euripides meaning is therefore really just the reverse of that which Boethius makes it See Euripides Andromache Il four hundred eighteen four hundred twenty SONG VII PLEASURE S STING This is the way of Pleasure She stings them that despoil her And like the winged toiler Who s lost her honeyed treasure She flies but leaves her smart Deep rankling in the heart VIII It is beyond doubt then that these paths do not lead to happiness they cannot guide anyone to the promised goal Now I will very briefly show what serious evils are involved in following them Just consider Is it thy endeavour to heap up money 
115_121896_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Why thou must wrest it from its present possessor 
none	none	Art thou minded to put on the splendour of official dignity Thou must beg from those who have the giving of it thou who covetest to outvie others in honour must lower thyself to the humble posture of petition 
115_121896_000004_000006	train-clean-360	Dost thou long for power 
none	none	Thou must face perils for thou wilt be at the mercy of thy subjects plots Is glory thy aim Thou art lured on through all manner of hardships and there is an end to thy peace of mind Art fain to lead a life of pleasure Yet who does not scorn and contemn one who is the slave of the weakest and vilest of things the body 
115_121896_000004_000011	train-clean-360	Again on how slight and perishable a possession do they rely who set before themselves bodily excellences 
115_121896_000004_000012	train-clean-360	Can ye ever surpass the elephant in bulk or the bull in strength 
none	none	Can ye excel the tiger in swiftness 
115_121896_000004_000014	train-clean-360	Look upon the infinitude the solidity the swift motion of the heavens and for once cease to admire things mean and worthless 
none	none	And yet the heavens are not so much to be admired on this account as for the reason which guides them Then how transient is the lustre of beauty how soon gone more fleeting than the fading bloom of spring flowers And yet if as Aristotle says men should see with the eyes of Lynceus so that their sight might pierce through obstructions would not that body of Alcibiades so gloriously fair in outward seeming appear altogether loathsome when all its inward parts lay open to the view Therefore it is not thy own nature that makes thee seem beautiful but the weakness of the eyes that see thee Yet prize as unduly as ye will that body s excellences so long as ye know that this that ye admire whatever its worth can be dissolved away by the feeble flame of a three days fever From all which considerations we may conclude as a whole that these things which cannot make good the advantages they promise which are never made perfect by the assemblage of all good things these neither lead as by ways to happiness nor themselves make men completely happy SONG VIII HUMAN FOLLY Alas how wide astray Doth Ignorance these wretched mortals lead From Truth s own way For not on leafy stems Do ye within the green wood look for gold Nor strip the vine for gems Your nets ye do not spread Upon the hill tops that the groaning board With fish be furnished If ye are fain to chase The bounding goat ye sweep not in vain search The ocean s ruffled face The sea s far depths they know Each hidden nook wherein the waves o erwash The pearl as white as snow Where lurks the Tyrian shell Where fish and prickly urchins do abound All this they know full well But not to know or care Where hidden lies the good all hearts desire This blindness they can bear With gaze on earth low bent They seek for that which reacheth far beyond The starry firmament 
115_121896_000011_000000	train-clean-360	What curse shall I call down On hearts so dull 
none	none	May they the race still run For wealth and high renown And when with much ado The false good they have grasped ah then too late May they discern the true IX This much may well suffice to set forth the form of false happiness if this is now clear to thine eyes the next step is to show what true happiness is 
161-121897-0000	train-other-500	Indeed said I I see clearly enough that neither is independence to be found in wealth nor power in sovereignty nor reverence in dignities nor fame in glory nor true joy in pleasures
none	none	 Hast thou discerned also the causes why this is so 
161-121897-0001	train-other-500	I seem to have some inkling but I should like to learn more at large from thee Why truly the reason is hard at hand
161-121897-0002	train-other-500	That which is simple and indivisible by nature human error separates and transforms from the true and perfect to the false and imperfect Dost thou imagine that which lacketh nothing can want power
161-121897-0003	train-other-500	Certainly not Right for if there is any feebleness of strength in anything in this there must necessarily be need of external protection That is so Accordingly
161-121897-0004	train-other-500	the nature of independence and power is one and the same It seems so Well but dost think that anything of such a nature as this can be looked upon with contempt
161-121897-0005	train-other-500	or is it rather of all things most worthy of veneration Nay there can be no doubt as to that Let us then add reverence to independence and power
161-121897-0006	train-other-500	and conclude these three to be one We must if we will acknowledge the truth Thinkest thou then this combination of qualities to be obscure and without distinction
161-121897-0007	train-other-500	or rather famous in all renown Just consider can that want renown which has been agreed to be lacking in nothing to be supreme in power
none	none	 and right worthy of honour for the reason that it cannot bestow this upon itself 
161-121897-0008	train-other-500	and so comes to appear somewhat poor in esteem I cannot but acknowledge that being what it is this union of qualities is also right famous It follows then
161-121897-0009	train-other-500	that we must admit that renown is not different from the other three It does said I That then which needs nothing outside itself which can accomplish all things in its own strength
none	none	 which enjoys fame and compels reverence must not this evidently be also fully crowned with joy In sooth I cannot conceive said I 
161-121897-0010	train-other-500	how any sadness can find entrance into such a state wherefore I must needs acknowledge it full of joy at least if our former conclusions are to hold Then for the same reasons
161-121897-0011	train-other-500	this also is necessary that independence power renown reverence and sweetness of delight are different only in name but in substance differ no wise one from the other
161-121897-0012	train-other-500	It is said I This then which is one and simple by nature human perversity separates and in trying to win a part of that which has no parts
none	none	 fails to attain not only that portion 
161-121897-0013	train-other-500	since there are no portions but also the whole to which it does not dream of aspiring How so said I He who to escape want seeks riches gives himself no concern about power
161-121897-0014	train-other-500	he prefers a mean and low estate and also denies himself many pleasures dear to nature to avoid losing the money which he has gained But at this rate he does not even attain to independence
161-121897-0015	train-other-500	a weakling void of strength vexed by distresses mean and despised and buried in obscurity He again who thirsts alone for power squanders his wealth
none	none	 despises pleasure 
161-121897-0016	train-other-500	and thinks fame and rank alike worthless without power But thou seest in how many ways his state also is defective Sometimes it happens that he lacks necessaries
none	none	 that he is gnawed by anxieties 
161-121897-0017	train-other-500	and since he cannot rid himself of these inconveniences even ceases to have that power which was his whole end and aim In like manner may we cast up the reckoning in case of rank
161-121897-0018	train-other-500	of glory or of pleasure For since each one of these severally is identical with the rest whosoever seeks any one of them without the others
161-121897-0019	train-other-500	does not even lay hold of that one which he makes his aim Well said I what then Suppose anyone desire to obtain them together
161-121897-0020	train-other-500	he does indeed wish for happiness as a whole but will he find it in these things which as we have proved
none	none	 are unable to bestow what they promise 
161-121897-0021	train-other-500	Nay by no means said I Then happiness must certainly not be sought in these things which severally are believed to afford some one of the blessings most to be desired They must not I admit
161-121897-0022	train-other-500	No conclusion could be more true So then the form and the causes of false happiness are set before thine eyes Now turn thy gaze to the other side there
161-121897-0023	train-other-500	thou wilt straightway see the true happiness I promised
none	none	 Yea indeed 
161-121897-0024	train-other-500	tis plain to the blind said I Thou didst point it out even now in seeking to unfold the causes of the false
none	none	 For unless I am mistaken 
161-121897-0025	train-other-500	that is true and perfect happiness which crowns one with the union of independence power reverence renown and joy And to prove to thee with how deep an insight I have listened since all these are the same
161-121897-0026	train-other-500	that which can truly bestow one of them I know to be without doubt full and complete happiness Happy art thou my scholar in this thy conviction only one thing shouldst thou add
161-121897-0027	train-other-500	What is that said I Is there aught thinkest thou amid these mortal and perishable things which can produce a state such as this Nay surely not
161-121897-0028	train-other-500	and this thou hast so amply demonstrated that no word more is needed Well then these things seem to give to mortals shadows of the true good or some kind of imperfect good
161-121897-0029	train-other-500	but the true and perfect good they cannot bestow Even so said I Since then thou hast learnt what that true happiness is and what men falsely call happiness
161-121897-0030	train-other-500	it now remains that thou shouldst learn from what source to seek this Yes to this I have long been eagerly looking forward Well since as Plato maintains in the Timaeus
161-121897-0031	train-other-500	we ought even in the most trivial matters to implore the Divine protection what thinkest thou should we now do in order to deserve to find the seat of that highest good
161-121897-0032	train-other-500	We must invoke the Father of all things said I for without this no enterprise sets out from a right beginning

161-121897-0033	train-other-500	and forthwith lifted up her voice and sang
none	none	 SONG IX I INVOCATION Maker of earth and sky from age to age Who rul saint the world by reason at whose word Time issues from Eternity s abyss

161-121898-0000	train-other-500	Since now thou hast seen what is the form of the imperfect good and what the form of the perfect also
161-121898-0001	train-other-500	methinks I should next show in what manner this perfection of felicity is built up And here I conceive it proper to inquire first whether any excellence such as thou hast lately defined
161-121898-0002	train-other-500	can exist in the nature of things lest we be deceived by an empty fiction of thought to which no true reality answers
none	none	 But it cannot be denied that such does exist and is as it were 
161-121898-0003	train-other-500	the source of all things good For everything which is called imperfect is spoken of as imperfect by reason of the privation of some perfection
161-121898-0004	train-other-500	so it comes to pass that whenever imperfection is found in any particular there must necessarily be a perfection in respect of that particular also For were there no such perfection
161-121898-0005	train-other-500	it is utterly inconceivable how that so called im perfection should come into existence Nature does not make a beginning with things mutilated and imperfect
161-121898-0006	train-other-500	she starts with what is whole and perfect and falls away later to these feeble and inferior productions So if there is as we showed before a happiness of a frail and imperfect kind
161-121898-0007	train-other-500	it cannot be doubted but there is also a happiness substantial and perfect Most true is thy conclusion and most sure said I Next
161-121898-0008	train-other-500	to consider where the dwelling place of this happiness may be The common belief of all mankind agrees that God the supreme of all things is good For since nothing can be imagined better than God
161-121898-0009	train-other-500	how can we doubt Him to be good than whom there is nothing better Now reason shows God to be good in such wise as to prove that in Him is perfect good For were it not so
161-121898-0010	train-other-500	He would not be supreme of all things for there would be something else more excellent possessed of perfect good which would seem to have the advantage in priority and dignity
none	none	 since it has clearly appeared that all perfect things are prior to those less complete Wherefore lest we fall into an infinite regression we must acknowledge the supreme God to be full of supreme and perfect good 
161-121898-0011	train-other-500	But we have determined that true happiness is the perfect good therefore true happiness must dwell in the supreme Deity I accept thy reasonings said I
161-121898-0012	train-other-500	they cannot in any wise be disputed But come see how strictly and incontrovertibly thou mayst prove this our assertion
none	none	 that the supreme Godhead hath fullest possession 
161-121898-0013	train-other-500	of the highest good In what way pray said I Do not rashly suppose that He who is the Father of all things hath received that highest good of which He is said to be possessed either from some external source
161-121898-0014	train-other-500	or hath it as a natural endowment in such sort that thou mightest consider the essence of the happiness possessed
none	none	 and of the God who possesses it 
161-121898-0015	train-other-500	distinct and different For if thou deemest it received from without thou mayst esteem that which gives more excellent than that which has received
161-121898-0016	train-other-500	But Him we most worthily acknowledge to be the most supremely excellent of all things If however it is in Him by nature yet is logically distinct the thought is inconceivable
161-121898-0017	train-other-500	since we are speaking of God who is supreme of all things Who was there to join these distinct essences Finally when one thing is different from another the things so conceived as distinct
161-121898-0018	train-other-500	cannot be identical Therefore that which of its own nature is distinct from the highest good is not itself the highest good an impious thought of Him than whom tis plain nothing can be more excellent
161-121898-0019	train-other-500	For universally nothing can be better in nature than the source from which it has come therefore on most true grounds of reason would I conclude that which is the source of all things to be
161-121898-0020	train-other-500	in its own essence the highest good And most justly said I But the highest good has been admitted to be happiness Yes Then said she
161-121898-0021	train-other-500	it is necessary to acknowledge that God is very happiness Yes said I I cannot gainsay my former admissions and I see clearly that this is a necessary inference therefrom
161-121898-0022	train-other-500	Reflect also said she whether the same conclusion is not further confirmed by considering that there cannot be two supreme goods distinct one from the other For the goods which are different
161-121898-0023	train-other-500	clearly cannot be severally each what the other is wherefore neither of the two can be perfect since to either the other is wanting
none	none	 but since it is not perfect it cannot manifestly be the supreme good 
161-121898-0024	train-other-500	By no means then can goods which are supreme be different one from the other But we have concluded that both happiness and God are the supreme good wherefore that which is highest Divinity
none	none	 must also itself necessarily be supreme happiness No conclusion said I could be truer to fact nor more soundly reasoned out nor more worthy of God Then further said she just as geometricians are wont to draw inferences from their demonstrations 
161-121898-0025	train-other-500	to which they give the name deductions so will I add here a sort of corollary For since men become happy by the acquisition of happiness while happiness is very Godship
161-121898-0026	train-other-500	it is manifest that they become happy by the acquisition of Godship But as by the acquisition of justice men become just and wise by the acquisition of wisdom
161-121898-0027	train-other-500	so by parity of reasoning by acquiring Godship they must of necessity become gods So every man who is happy is a god and though in nature God is One only yet there is nothing to hinder that very many
161-121898-0028	train-other-500	should be gods by participation in that nature A fair conclusion and a precious said I deduction or corollary by whichever name thou wilt call it And yet said she
none	none	 not one whit fairer than this which reason persuades us to add Why what said I 
161-121898-0029	train-other-500	Why seeing happiness has many particulars included under it should all these be regarded as forming one body of happiness as it were made up of various parts
161-121898-0030	train-other-500	or is there some one of them which forms the full essence of happiness while all the rest are relative to this I would thou wouldst unfold the whole matter to me at large
161-121898-0031	train-other-500	We judge happiness to be good do we not Yea the supreme good And this superlative applies to all for this same happiness is adjudged to be the completest independence
161-121898-0032	train-other-500	the highest power reverence renown and pleasure What then Are all these goods independence power and the rest to be deemed members of happiness as it were
161-121898-0033	train-other-500	or are they all relative to good as to their summit and crown I understand the problem but I desire to hear how thou wouldst solve it Well then listen to the determination of the matter
161-121898-0034	train-other-500	Were all these members composing happiness they would differ severally one from the other For this is the nature of parts
none	none	 that by their difference they compose one body 
161-121898-0035	train-other-500	All these however have been proved to be the same therefore they cannot possibly be members otherwise happiness will seem to be built up out of one member which cannot be
161-121898-0036	train-other-500	There can be no doubt as to that said I but I am impatient to hear what remains Why it is manifest that all the others are relative to the good
161-121898-0037	train-other-500	For the very reason why independence is sought is that it is judged good and so power also because it is believed to be good The same too may be supposed of reverence of renown and of pleasant delight
161-121898-0038	train-other-500	Good then is the sum and source of all desirable things That which has not in itself any good either in reality or in semblance can in no wise be desired Contrariwise
161-121898-0039	train-other-500	even things which by nature are not good are desired as if they were truly good if they seem to be so
none	none	 Whereby it comes to pass that goodness is rightly believed to be the sum and hinge and cause of all things desirable 
161-121898-0040	train-other-500	Now that for the sake of which anything is desired itself seems to be most wished for For instance if anyone wishes to ride for the sake of health he does not so much wish for the exercise of riding
161-121898-0041	train-other-500	as the benefit of his health Since then all things are sought for the sake of the good it is not these so much as good itself that is sought by all
none	none	 But that on account of which all other things are wished for 
161-121898-0042	train-other-500	was we agreed happiness wherefore thus also it appears that it is happiness alone which is sought From all which it is transparently clear that the essence of absolute good and of happiness
161-121898-0043	train-other-500	is one and the same I cannot see how anyone can dissent from these conclusions
none	none	 But we have also proved 
161-121898-0044	train-other-500	that God and true happiness are one and the same Yes said I Then we can safely conclude also that God s essence is seated in absolute good and nowhere else
none	none	 SONG X THE TRUE LIGHT 
161-121898-0045	train-other-500	Hither come all ye whose minds Lust with rosy fetters binds Lust to bondage hard compelling
none	none	 Th earthy souls that are his dwelling 
161-121898-0046	train-other-500	Here shall be your labour s close Here your haven of repose Come to your one refuge press Wide it stands to all distress
none	none	 Not the glint of yellow gold Down bright Hermus current rolled 
161-121898-0047	train-other-500	Not the Tagus precious sands
none	none	 Nor in far off scorching lands All the radiant gems that hide Under Indus storied tide 
161-121898-0048	train-other-500	Emerald green and glistering white
none	none	 Can illume our feeble sight 
161-121898-0049	train-other-500	But they rather leave the mind In its native darkness blind For the fairest beams they shed In earth s lowest depths were fed But the splendour that supplies Strength and vigour to the skies
161-121898-0050	train-other-500	And the universe controls
none	none	 Shunneth dark and ruined souls He who once hath seen this light Will not call the sunbeam bright XI I quite agree said I truly all thy reasonings hold admirably together Then said she What value wouldst thou put upon the boon shouldst thou come to the knowledge of the absolute good Oh an infinite said I if only I were so blest as to learn to know God also who is the good Yet this will I make clear to thee on truest grounds of reason if only our recent conclusions stand fast They will Have we not shown that those things which most men desire are not true and perfect good precisely for this cause that they differ severally one from another and seeing that one is wanting to another they cannot bestow full and absolute good but that they become the true good when they are gathered as it were into one form and agency so that that which is independence is likewise power reverence renown and pleasant delight and unless they are all one and the same they have no claim to be counted among things desirable Yes this was clearly proved and cannot in any wise be doubted Now when things are far from being good while they are different but become good as soon as they are one is it not true that these become good by acquiring unity It seems so said I But dost not thou allow that all which is good is good by participation in goodness It is Then thou must on similar grounds admit that unity and goodness are the same for when the effects of things in their natural working differ not their essence is one and the same There is no denying it Now dost thou know said she that all which is abides and subsists so long as it continues one but so soon as it ceases to be one it perishes and falls to pieces In what way Why take animals for example When soul and body come together and continue in one this is we say a living creature but when this unity is broken by the separation of these two the creature dies and is clearly no longer living The body also while it remains in one form by the joining together of its members presents a human appearance but if the separation and dispersal of the parts break up the body s unity it ceases to be what it was And if we extend our survey to all other things without doubt it will manifestly appear that each several thing subsists while it is one but when it ceases to be one perishes Yes when I consider further I see it to be even as thou sayest Well is there aught said she which in so far as it acts conformably to nature abandons the wish for life and desires to come to death and corruption Looking to living creatures which have some faults of choice I find none that without external compulsion forego the will to live and of their own accord hasten to destruction For every creature diligently pursues the end of self preservation and shuns death and destruction As to herbs and trees and inanimate things generally I am altogether in doubt what to think And yet there is no possibility of question about this either since thou seest how herbs and trees grow in places suitable for them where as far as their nature admits they cannot quickly wither and die Some spring up in the plains others in the mountains some grow in marshes others cling to rocks and others again find a fertile soil in the barren sands and if you try to transplant these elsewhere they wither away Nature gives to each the soil that suits it and uses her diligence to prevent any of them dying so long as it is possible for them to continue alive Why do they all draw their nourishment from roots as from a mouth dipped into the earth and distribute the strong bark over the pith Why are all the softer parts like the pith deeply encased within while the external parts have the strong texture of wood and outside of all is the bark to resist the weather s inclemency like a champion stout in endurance Again how great is nature s diligence to secure universal propagation by multiplying seed Who does not know all these to be contrivances not only for the present maintenance of a species but for its lasting continuance generation after generation for ever And do not also the things believed inanimate on like grounds of reason seek each what is proper to itself Why do the flames shoot lightly upward while the earth presses downward with its weight if it is not that these motions and situations are suitable to their respective natures Moreover each several thing is preserved by that which is agreeable to its nature even as it is destroyed by things inimical Things solid like stones resist disintegration by the close adhesion of their parts Things fluid like air and water yield easily to what divides them but swiftly flow back and mingle with those parts from which they have been severed while fire again refuses to be cut at all And we are not now treating of the voluntary motions of an intelligent soul but of the drift of nature Even so is it that we digest our food without thinking about it and draw our breath unconsciously in sleep nay even in living creatures the love of life cometh not of conscious will but from the principles of nature For oftentimes in the stress of circumstances will chooses the death which nature shrinks from and contrarily in spite of natural appetite will restrains that work of reproduction by which alone the persistence of perishable creatures is maintained So entirely does this love of self come from drift of nature not from animal impulse Providence has furnished things with this most cogent reason for continuance they must desire life so long as it is naturally possible for them to continue living Wherefore in no way mayst thou doubt but that things naturally aim at continuance of existence and shun destruction I confess said I that what I lately thought uncertain I now perceive to be indubitably clear Now that which seeks to subsist and continue desires to be one for if its oneness be gone its very existence cannot continue True said I All things then desire to be one I agree But we have proved that one is the very same thing as good We have All things then seek the good indeed you may express the fact by defining good as that which all desire Nothing could be more truly thought out Either there is no single end to which all things are relative or else the end to which all things universally hasten must be the highest good of all Then she Exceedingly do I rejoice dear pupil thine eye is now fixed on the very central mark of truth Moreover herein is revealed that of which thou didst erstwhile profess thyself ignorant What is that said I The end and aim of the whole universe Surely it is that which is desired of all and since we have concluded the good to be such we ought to acknowledge the end and aim of the whole universe to be the good SONG XI REMINISCENCE J Who truth pursues who from false ways His heedful steps would keep By inward light must search within In meditation deep All outward bent he must repress His soul s true treasure to possess Then all that error s mists obscured Shall shine more clear than light This fleshly frame s oblivious weight Hath quenched not reason quite The germs of truth still

613-121900-0000	train-other-500	Then said I With all my heart I agree with Plato indeed this is now the second time that these things have been brought back to my mind first I lost them through the clogging contact of the body
613-121900-0001	train-other-500	then after through the stress of heavy grief Then she continued If thou wilt reflect upon thy former admissions it will not be long before thou dost also recollect that of which
613-121900-0002	train-other-500	erstwhile thou didst confess thyself ignorant What is that said I The principles of the world s government said she Yes I remember my confession and
613-121900-0003	train-other-500	although I now anticipate what thou intendest I have a desire to hear the argument plainly set forth Awhile ago thou deemedst it beyond all doubt that God doth govern the world
613-121900-0004	train-other-500	I do not think it doubtful now nor shall I ever and by what reasons I am brought to this assurance I will briefly set forth
none	none	 This world could never have taken shape as a single system out of parts so diverse and opposite were it not that there is One who joins together these so diverse things 
613-121900-0005	train-other-500	And when it had once come together
none	none	 the very diversity of natures would have dissevered it and torn it asunder in universal discord 
613-121900-0006	train-other-500	were there not One who keeps together what He has joined Nor would the order of nature proceed so regularly nor could its course exhibit motions so fixed in respect of position time range efficacy
613-121900-0007	train-other-500	and character unless there were One who Himself abiding disposed these various vicissitudes of change This power whatsoever it be whereby they remain as they were created and are kept in motion
613-121900-0008	train-other-500	I call by the name which all recognise God Then said she Seeing that such is thy belief it will cost me little trouble I think to enable thee to win happiness and return in safety to thy own country
613-121900-0009	train-other-500	But let us give our attention to the task that we have set before ourselves Have we not counted independence in the category of happiness and agreed that God is absolute happiness Truly we have Then
613-121900-0010	train-other-500	He will need no external assistance for the ruling of the world Otherwise if He stands in need of aught He will not possess complete independence That is necessarily so said I Then
613-121900-0011	train-other-500	by His own power alone He disposes all things It cannot be denied Now God was proved to be absolute good
none	none	 Yes I remember 
613-121900-0012	train-other-500	Then He disposes all things by the agency of good if it be true that He rules all things by His own power whom we have agreed to be good and He is as it were the rudder and helm by which the world s mechanism is kept steady and in order
613-121900-0013	train-other-500	Heartily do I agree and indeed I anticipated what thou wouldst say though it may be in feeble surmise only I well believe it said she for as I think
613-121900-0014	train-other-500	thou now bringest to the search eyes quicker in discerning truth but what I shall say next is no less plain and easy to see What is it said I Why said she
613-121900-0015	train-other-500	since God is rightly believed to govern all things with the rudder of goodness and since all things do likewise as I have taught haste towards good by the very aim of nature can it be doubted that His governance is willingly accepted
none	none	 and that all submit themselves to the sway of the Disposer as conformed and attempered to His rule 
613-121900-0016	train-other-500	Necessarily so said I no rule would seem happy if it were a yoke imposed on reluctant wills and not the safe keeping of obedient subjects There is nothing then which
613-121900-0017	train-other-500	while it follows nature endeavours to resist good No nothing But if anything should will it have the least success against Him whom we rightly agreed to be supreme Lord of happiness
613-121900-0018	train-other-500	It would be utterly impotent There is nothing then which has either the will or the power to oppose this supreme good No I think not So then
613-121900-0019	train-other-500	said she it is the supreme good which rules in strength and graciously disposes all things Then said I How delighted am I at thy reasonings and the conclusion to which thou hast brought them
613-121900-0020	train-other-500	but most of all at these very words which thou usest I am now at last ashamed of the folly that so sorely vexed me Thou hast heard the story of the giants assailing heaven
none	none	 but a beneficent strength disposed of them also as they deserved But shall we submit our arguments to the shock 
613-121900-0021	train-other-500	of mutual collision it may be from the impact some fair spark of truth may be struck out If it be thy good pleasure said I No one can doubt that God is all powerful
613-121900-0022	train-other-500	No one at all can question it who thinks consistently Now there is nothing which One who is all powerful cannot do Nothing But can God do evil then
613-121900-0023	train-other-500	Nay by no means Then evil is nothing said she since He to whom nothing is impossible is unable to do evil Art thou mocking me said I
613-121900-0024	train-other-500	weaving a labyrinth of tangled arguments now seeming to begin where thou didst end and now to end where thou didst begin or dost thou build up some wondrous circle of Divine simplicity For truly
613-121900-0025	train-other-500	a little before thou didst begin with happiness and say it was the supreme good and didst declare it to be seated in the supreme Godhead God Himself too
none	none	 thou didst affirm to be supreme good and all complete happiness 
613-121900-0026	train-other-500	and from this thou didst go on to add as by the way the proof that no one would be happy unless he were likewise God Again thou didst say that the very form of good was the essence both of God
613-121900-0027	train-other-500	and of happiness and didst teach that the absolute One was the absolute good which was sought by universal nature
613-121900-0028	train-other-500	Thou didst maintain also that God rules the universe by the governance of goodness that all things obey Him willingly and that evil has no existence in nature And all this
613-121900-0029	train-other-500	thou didst unfold without the help of assumptions from without but by inherent and proper proofs drawing credence one from the other Then answered she Far is it from me to mock thee nay

the full CH II Accordingly a she first expounds the paradox that the good alone have power the bad are altogether powerless CH III b The righteous never lack their reward nor the wicked their punishment CH IV c The wicked are more unhappy when they accomplish their desires than when they fail to attain them d Evil doers are more fortunate when they expiate their crimes by suffering punishment than when they escape unpunished e The wrong doer is more wretched than he who suffers injury CH V Boethius still cannot understand why the distribution of happiness and misery to the righteous and the wicked seems the result of chance Philosophy replies that this only seems so because we do not understand the principles of God s moral governance CH VI The distinction of Fate and Providence The apparent moral confusion is due to our ignorance of the secret counsels of God s providence If we possessed the key we should see how all things are guided to good CH VII Thus all fortune is good fortune for it either rewards disciplines amends or punishes and so is either useful or just BOOK IV I Softly and sweetly Philosophy sang these verses to the end without losing aught of the dignity of her expression or the seriousness of her tones then forasmuch as I was as yet unable to forget my deeply seated sorrow just as she was about to say something further I broke in and cried O thou guide into the way of true light all that thy voice hath uttered from the beginning even unto now has manifestly seemed to me at once divine contemplated in itself and by the force of thy arguments placed beyond the possibility of overthrow Moreover these truths have not been altogether unfamiliar to me heretofore though because of indignation at my wrongs they have for a time been forgotten But lo herein is the very chiefest cause of my grief that while there exists a good ruler of the universe it is possible that evil should be at all still more that it should go unpunished Surely thou must see how deservedly this of itself provokes astonishment But a yet greater marvel follows While wickedness reigns and flourishes virtue not only lacks its reward but is even thrust down and trampled under the feet of the wicked and suffers punishment in the place of crime That this should happen under the rule of a God who knows all things and can do all things but wills only the good cannot be sufficiently wondered at nor sufficiently lamented Then said she It would indeed be infinitely astounding and of all monstrous things most horrible if as thou esteemest in the well ordered home of so great a householder the base vessels should be held in honour the precious left to neglect But it is not so For if we hold unshaken those conclusions which we lately reached thou shall learn that by the will of Him of whose realm we are speaking the good are always strong the bad always weak and impotent that vices never go unpunished nor virtues unrewarded that good fortune ever befalls the good and ill fortune the bad and much more of the sort which shall hush thy murmurings and stablish thee in the strong assurance of conviction And since by my late instructions thou hast seen the form of happiness hast learnt too the seat where it is to be found all due preliminaries being discharged I will now show thee the road which will lead thee home Wings also will I fasten to thy mind wherewith thou mayst soar aloft that so all disturbing doubts removed thou mayst return safe to thy country under my guidance in the path I will show thee and by the means which I furnish SONG I THE SOUL S FLIGHT Wings are mine above the pole Far aloft I soar Clothed with these my nimble soul Scorns earth s hated shore Cleaves the skies upon the wind Sees the clouds left far behind Soon the glowing point she nears Where the heavens rotate Follows through the starry spheres Phoebus course or straight Takes for comrade mid the stars Saturn cold or glittering Mars Thus each circling orb explores Through Night s stole that peers Then when all are numbered soars Far beyond the spheres Mounting heaven s supremest height To the very Fount of light There the Sovereign of the world His calm sway maintains As the globe is onward whirled Guides the chariot reins And in splendour glittering Reigns the universal King Hither if thy wandering feet Find at last a way Here thy long lost home thou lieutenant greet Dear lost land thou lieutenant say Though from thee I ve wandered wide Hence I came here will abide Yet if ever thou art fain Visitant to be Of earth s gloomy night again Surely thou wilt see Tyrants whom the nations fear Dwell in hapless exile here II Then said I Verily wondrous great are thy promises yet I do not doubt but thou canst make them good only keep me not in suspense after raising such hopes Learn then first said she how that power ever waits upon the good while the bad are left wholly destitute of strength K Of these truths the one proves the other for since good and evil are contraries if it is made plain that good is power the feebleness of evil is clearly seen and conversely if the frail nature of evil is made manifest the strength of good is thereby known However to win ampler credence for my conclusion I will pursue both paths and draw confirmation for my statements first in one way and then in the other The carrying out of any human action depends upon two things to wit will and power if either be wanting nothing can be accomplished For if the will be lacking no attempt at all is made to do what is not willed whereas if there be no power the will is all in vain And so if thou seest any man wishing to attain some end yet utterly failing to attain it thou canst not doubt that he lacked the power of getting what he wished for Why certainly not there is no denying it Canst thou then doubt that he whom thou seest to have accomplished what he willed had also the power to accomplish it Of course not Then in respect of what he can accomplish a man is to be reckoned strong in respect of what he cannot accomplish weak Granted said I Then dost thou remember that by our former reasonings it was concluded that the whole aim of man s will though the means of pursuit vary is set intently upon happiness I do remember that this too was proved Dost thou also call to mind how happiness is absolute good and therefore that when happiness is sought it is good which is in all cases the object of desire Nay I do not so much call to mind as keep it fixed in my memory Then all men good and bad alike with one indistinguishable purpose strive to reach good Yes that follows But it is certain that by the attainment of good men become good It is Then do the good attain their object It seems so But if the bad were to attain the good which is their object they could not be bad No Then since both seek good but while the one sort attain it the other attain it not is there any doubt that the good are endued with power while they who are bad are weak If any doubt it he is incapable of reflecting on the nature of things or the consequences involved in reasoning Again supposing there are two things to which the same function is prescribed in the course of nature and one of these successfully accomplishes the function by natural action the other is altogether incapable of that natural action instead of which in a way other than is agreeable to its nature it I will not say fulfils its function but feigns to fulfil it which of these two would in thy view be the stronger I guess thy meaning but I pray thee let me hear thee more at large Walking is man s natural motion is it not Certainly Thou dost not doubt I suppose that it is natural for the feet to discharge this function No surely I do not Now if one man who is able to use his feet walks and another to whom the natural use of his feet is wanting tries to walk on his hands which of the two wouldst thou rightly esteem the stronger Go on said I no one can question but that he who has the natural capacity has more strength than he who has it not Now the supreme good is set up as the end alike for the bad and for the good but the good seek it through the natural action of the virtues whereas the bad try to attain this same good through all manner of concupiscence which is not the natural way of attaining good Or dost thou think otherwise Nay rather one further consequence is clear to me for from my admissions it must needs follow that the good have power and the bad are impotent Thou anticipatest rightly and that as physicians reckon is a sign that nature is set working and is throwing off the disease But since I see thee so ready at understanding I will heap proof on proof Look how manifest is the extremity of vicious men s weakness they cannot even reach that goal to which the aim of nature leads and almost constrains them What if they were left without this mighty this well nigh irresistible help of nature s guidance Consider also how momentous is the powerlessness which incapacitates the wicked Not light or trivial L are the prizes which they contend for but which they cannot win or hold nay their failure concerns the very sum and crown of things Poor wretches they fail to compass even that for which they toil day and night Herein also the strength of the good conspicuously appears For just as thou wouldst judge him to be the strongest walker whose legs could carry him to a point beyond which no further advance was possible so must thou needs account him strong in power who so attains the end of his desires that nothing further to be desired lies beyond Whence follows the obvious conclusion that they who are wicked are seen likewise to be wholly destitute of strength For why do they forsake virtue and follow vice Is it from ignorance of what is good Well what is more weak and feeble than the blindness of ignorance Do they know what they ought to follow but lust drives them aside out of the way If it be so they are still frail by reason of their incontinence for they cannot fight against vice Or do they knowingly and wilfully forsake the good and turn aside to vice Why at this rate they not only cease to have power but cease to be at all For they who forsake the common end of all things that are they likewise also cease to be at all Now to some it may seem strange that we should assert that the bad who form the greater part of mankind do not exist But the fact is so I do not indeed deny that they who are bad are bad but that they are in an unqualified and absolute sense I deny Just as we call a corpse a dead man but cannot call it simply man so I would allow the vicious to be bad but that they are in an absolute sense I cannot allow That only is which maintains its place and keeps its nature whatever falls away from this forsakes the existence which is essential to its nature But thou wilt say the bad have an ability Nor do I wish to deny it only this ability of theirs comes not from strength but from impotence For their ability is to do evil which would have had no efficacy at all if they could have continued in the performance of good So this ability of theirs proves them still more plainly to have no power For if as we concluded just now evil is nothing tis clear that the wicked can effect nothing since they are only able to do evil Tis evident And that thou mayst understand what is the precise force of this power we determined did we not awhile back that nothing has more power than supreme good We did said I But that same highest good cannot do evil Certainly not Is there anyone then who thinks that men are able to do all things None but a madman Yet they are able to do evil Ay would they could not Since then he who can do only good is omnipotent while they who can do evil also are not omnipotent it is manifest that they who can do evil have less power There is this also we have shown that all power is to be reckoned among things desirable and that all desirable things are referred to good as to a kind of consummation of their nature But the ability to commit crime cannot be referred to the good therefore it is not a thing to be desired And yet all power is desirable it is clear then that ability to do evil is not power From all which considerations appeareth the power of the good and the indubitable weakness of the bad and it is clear that Plato s judgment was true the wise alone are able to do what they would while the wicked follow their own hearts lust but can not accomplish what they would For they go on in their wilfulness fancying they will attain what they wish for in the paths of delight but they are very far from its attainment since shameful deeds lead not to happiness FOOTNOTES K

937-121903-0000	train-other-500	with what splendour righteousness shines Whereby it is manifest that goodness never lacks its reward nor crime its punishment For verily in all manner of transactions
937-121903-0001	train-other-500	that for the sake of which the particular action is done may justly be accounted the reward of that action even as the wreath
none	none	 for the sake of which the race is run 
937-121903-0002	train-other-500	is the reward offered for running Now we have shown happiness to be that very good for the sake of which all things are done Absolute good then
937-121903-0003	train-other-500	is offered as the common prize as it were of all human actions But truly this is a reward from which it is impossible to separate the good man for one who is without good
937-121903-0004	train-other-500	cannot properly be called good at all wherefore righteous dealing
none	none	 never misses its reward 
937-121903-0005	train-other-500	Rage the wicked then never so violently the crown shall not fall from the head of the wise nor wither Verily other men s unrighteousness
937-121903-0006	train-other-500	cannot pluck from righteous souls their proper glory Were the reward in which the soul of the righteous delighteth received from without then might it be taken away by him who gave it or some other
937-121903-0007	train-other-500	but since it is conferred by his own righteousness then only will he lose his prize when he has ceased to be righteous Lastly since every prize is desired because it is believed to be good
937-121903-0008	train-other-500	who can account him who possesses good to be without reward And what a prize the fairest and grandest of all For remember the corollary which I chiefly insisted on a little while back
937-121903-0009	train-other-500	and reason thus Since absolute good is happiness tis clear that all the good must be happy for the very reason that they are good But it was agreed that those who are happy are gods
937-121903-0010	train-other-500	So then the prize of the good is one which no time may impair no man s power lessen no man s unrighteousness tarnish tis very Godship
937-121903-0011	train-other-500	And this being so the wise man cannot doubt that punishment is inseparable from the bad For since good and bad and likewise reward and punishment are contraries it necessarily follows that
937-121903-0012	train-other-500	corresponding to all that we see accrue as reward of the good there is some penalty attached as punishment of evil As then righteousness itself is the reward of the righteous
937-121903-0013	train-other-500	so wickedness itself is the punishment of the unrighteous Now no one who is visited with punishment doubts that he is visited with evil Accordingly
937-121903-0014	train-other-500	if they were but willing to weigh their own case could they think themselves free from punishment whom wickedness worst of all evils has not only touched but deeply tainted
937-121903-0015	train-other-500	See also from the opposite standpoint the standpoint of the good what a penalty attends upon the wicked Thou didst learn a little since that whatever is is one
937-121903-0016	train-other-500	and that unity itself is good Accordingly by this way of reckoning whatever falls away from goodness ceases to be whence it comes to pass that the bad cease to be what they were while only the outward aspect
937-121903-0017	train-other-500	is still left to show they have been men Wherefore by their perversion to badness they have lost their true human nature Further since righteousness alone can raise men above the level of humanity
937-121903-0018	train-other-500	it must needs be that unrighteousness degrades below man s level those whom it has cast out of man s estate It results then that thou canst not consider him human
937-121903-0019	train-other-500	whom thou seest transformed by vice The violent despoiler of other men s goods enflamed with covetousness surely resembles a wolf A bold and restless spirit
937-121903-0020	train-other-500	ever wrangling in law courts is like some yelping cur The secret schemer taking pleasure in fraud and stealth is own brother to the fox The passionate man
937-121903-0021	train-other-500	phrenzied with rage we might believe to be animated with the soul of a lion The coward and runaway afraid where no fear is may be likened to the timid deer He who is sunk in ignorance and stupidity
937-121903-0022	train-other-500	lives like a dull ass He who is light and inconstant never holding long to one thing is for all the world like a bird He who wallows in foul and unclean lusts is sunk in the pleasures of a filthy hog
none	none	 So it comes to pass that he who by forsaking righteousness ceases to be a man cannot pass into a Godlike condition but actually turns into a brute beast SONG III CIRCE S CUP

none	none	 Which subtly penetrate And leave the body whole But deep infect the soul IV Then said I This is very true I see that the vicious though they keep the outward form of man are rightly said to be changed into beasts in respect of their spiritual nature but inasmuch as their cruel and polluted minds vent their rage in the destruction of the good I would this license were not permitted to them Nor is it said she as shall be shown in the fitting place Yet if that license which thou believest to be permitted to them were taken away the punishment of the wicked would be in great part remitted For verily incredible as it may seem to some it needs must be that the bad are more unfortunate when they have accomplished their desires than if they are unable to get them fulfilled If it is wretched to will evil to have been able to accomplish evil is more wretched for without the power the wretched will would fail of effect Accordingly those whom thou seest to will to be able to accomplish and to accomplish crime must needs be the victims of a threefold wretchedness since each one of these states has its own measure of wretchedness Yes said I yet I earnestly wish they might speedily be quit of this misfortune by losing the ability to accomplish crime They will lose it said she sooner than perchance thou wishest or they themselves think likely since verily within the narrow bounds of our brief life there is nothing so late in coming that anyone least of all an immortal spirit should deem it long to wait for Their great expectations the lofty fabric of their crimes is oft overthrown by a sudden and unlooked for ending and this but sets a limit to their misery For if wickedness makes men wretched he is necessarily more wretched who is wicked for a longer time and were it not that death at all events puts an end to the evil doings of the wicked I should account them wretched to the last degree Indeed if we have formed true conclusions about the ill fortune of wickedness that wretchedness is plainly infinite which is doomed to be eternal Then said I A wonderful inference and difficult to grant but I see that it agrees entirely with our previous conclusions Thou art right said she but if anyone finds it hard to admit the conclusion he ought in fairness either to prove some falsity in the premises or to show that the combination of propositions does not adequately enforce the necessity of the conclusion otherwise if the premises be granted nothing whatever can be said against the inference of the conclusion And here is another statement which seems not less wonderful but on the premises assumed is equally necessary What is that The wicked are happier in undergoing punishment than if no penalty of justice chasten them And I am not now meaning what might occur to anyone that bad character is amended by retribution and is brought into the right path by the terror of punishment or that it serves as an example to warn others to avoid transgression but I believe that in another way the wicked are more unfortunate when they go unpunished even though no account be taken of amendment and no regard be paid to example Why what other way is there beside these said I Then said she Have we not agreed that the good are happy and the evil wretched Yes said I Now if said she to one in affliction there be given along with his misery some good thing is he not happier than one whose misery is misery pure and simple without admixture of any good It would seem so But if to one thus wretched one destitute of all good some further evil be added besides those which make him wretched is he not to be judged far more unhappy than he whose ill fortune is alleviated by some share of good It could scarcely be otherwise Surely then the wicked when they are punished have a good thing added to them to wit the punishment which by the law of justice is good and likewise when they escape punishment a new evil attaches to them in that very freedom from punishment which thou hast rightly acknowledged to be an evil in the case of the unrighteous I cannot deny it Then the wicked are far more unhappy when indulged with an unjust freedom from punishment than when punished by a just retribution Now it is manifest that it is just for the wicked to be punished and for them to escape unpunished is unjust Why who would venture to deny it This too no one can possibly deny that all which is just is good and conversely all which is unjust is bad Then I answered These inferences do indeed follow from what we lately concluded but tell me said I dost thou take no account of the punishment of the soul after the death of the body Nay truly said she great are these penalties some of them inflicted I imagine in the severity of retribution others in the mercy of purification But it is not my present purpose to speak of these So far my aim hath been to make thee recognise that the power of the bad which shocked thee so exceedingly is no power to make thee see that those of whose freedom from punishment thou didst complain are never without the proper penalties of their unrighteousness to teach thee that the license which thou prayedst might soon come to an end is not long enduring that it would be more unhappy if it lasted longer most unhappy of all if it lasted for ever thereafter that the unrighteous are more wretched if unjustly let go without punishment than if punished by a just retribution from which point of view it follows that the wicked are afflicted with more severe penalties just when they are supposed to escape punishment Then said I While I follow thy reasonings I am deeply impressed with their truth but if I turn to the common convictions of men I find few who will even listen to such arguments let alone admit them to be credible True said she they cannot lift eyes accustomed to darkness to the light of clear truth and are like those birds whose vision night illumines and day blinds for while they regard not the order of the universe but their own dispositions of mind they think the license to commit crime and the escape from punishment to be fortunate But mark the ordinance of eternal law Hast thou fashioned thy soul to the likeness of the better thou hast no need of a judge to award the prize by thine own act hast thou raised thyself in the scale of excellence hast thou perverted thy affections to baser things look not for punishment from one without thee thine own act hath degraded thee and thrust thee down Even so if alternately thou turn thy gaze upon the vile earth and upon the heavens though all without thee stand still by the mere laws of sight thou seemest now sunk in the mire now soaring among the stars But the common herd regards not these things What then Shall we go over to those whom we have shown to be like brute beasts Why suppose now one who had quite lost his sight should likewise forget that he had ever possessed the faculty of vision and should imagine that nothing was wanting in him to human perfection should we deem those who saw as well as ever blind Why they will not even assent to this either that they who do wrong are more wretched than those who suffer wrong though the proof of this rests on grounds of reason no less strong Let me hear these same reasons said I Wouldst thou deny that every wicked man deserves punishment I would not certainly And that those who are wicked are unhappy is clear in manifold ways Yes I replied Thou dost not doubt then that those who deserve punishment are wretched Agreed said I So then if thou wert sitting in judgment on whom wouldst thou decree the infliction of punishment on him who had done the wrong or on him who had suffered it Without doubt I would compensate the sufferer at the cost of the doer of the wrong Then the injurer would seem more wretched than the injured Yes it follows And so for this and other reasons resting on the same ground inasmuch as baseness of its own nature makes men wretched it is plain that a wrong involves the misery of the doer not of the sufferer And yet says she the practice of the law courts is just the opposite advocates try to arouse the commiseration of the judges for those who have endured some grievous and cruel wrong whereas pity is rather due to the criminal who ought to be brought to the judgment seat by his accusers in a spirit not of anger but of compassion and kindness as a sick man to the physician to have the ulcer of his fault cut away by punishment Whereby the business of the advocate would either wholly come to a standstill or did men prefer to make it serviceable to mankind would be restricted to the practice of accusation The wicked themselves also if through some chink or cranny they were permitted to behold the virtue they have forsaken and were to see that by the pains of punishment they would rid themselves of the uncleanness of their vices and win in exchange the recompense of righteousness they would no longer think these sufferings pains they would refuse the help of advocates and would commit themselves wholly into the hands of their accusers and judges Whence it comes to pass that for the wise no place is left for hatred only the most foolish would hate the good and to hate the bad is unreasonable For if vicious propensity is as it were a disease of the soul like bodily sickness even as we account the sick in body by no means deserving of hate but rather of pity so and much more should they be pitied whose minds are assailed by wickedness which is more frightful than any sickness SONG IV THE UNREASONABLENESS OF HATRED Why all this furious strife Oh why With rash and wilful hand provoke death s destined day If death ye seek lo Death is nigh Not of their master s will those coursers swift delay The wild beasts vent on man their rage Yet gainst their brothers lives men point the murderous steel Unjust and cruel wars they wage And haste with flying darts the death to meet or deal No right nor reason can they show Tis but because their lands and laws are not the same Wouldst thou give each his due then know Thy love the good must have the bad thy pity claim V On this I said I see how there is a happiness and misery founded on the actual deserts of the righteous and the wicked Nevertheless I wonder in myself whether there is not some good and evil in fortune as the vulgar understand it Surely no sensible man would rather be exiled poor and disgraced than dwell prosperously in his own country powerful wealthy and high in honour Indeed the work of wisdom is more clear and manifest in its operation when the happiness of rulers is somehow passed on to the people around them especially considering that the prison the law and the other pains of legal punishment are properly due only to mischievous citizens on whose account they were originally instituted Accordingly I do exceedingly marvel why all this is completely reversed why the good are harassed with the penalties due to crime and the bad carry off the rewards of virtue and I long to hear from thee what reason may be found for so unjust a state of disorder For assuredly I should wonder less if I could believe that all things are the confused result of chance But now my belief in God s governance doth add amazement to amazement For seeing that He sometimes assigns fair fortune to the good and harsh fortune to the bad and then again deals harshly with the good and grants to the bad their hearts desire how does this differ from chance unless some reason is discovered for it all Nay it is not wonderful said she if all should be thought random and confused when the principle of order is not known And though thou knowest not the causes on which this great system depends yet forasmuch as a good ruler governs the world doubt not for thy part that all is rightly done SONG V WONDER AND IGNORANCE Who knoweth not how near the pole Bootes course doth go Must marvel by what

Primitive Culture pp two hundred ninety six three hundred two VI True said I but since it is thy office to unfold the hidden cause of things and explain principles veiled in darkness inform me I pray thee of thine own conclusions in this matter since the marvel of it is what more than aught else disturbs my mind A smile played one moment upon her lips as she replied Thou callest me to the greatest of all subjects of inquiry a task for which the most exhaustive treatment barely suffices Such is its nature that as fast as one doubt is cut away innumerable others spring up like Hydra s heads nor could we set any limit to their renewal did we not apply the mind s living fire to suppress them For there come within its scope the questions of the essential simplicity of providence of the order of fate of unforeseen chance of the Divine knowledge and predestination and of the freedom of the will How heavy is the weight of all this thou canst judge for thyself But inasmuch as to know these things also is part of the treatment of thy malady we will try to give them some consideration despite the restrictions of the narrow limits of our time Moreover thou must for a time dispense with the pleasures of music and song if so be that thou findest any delight therein whilst I weave together the connected train of reasons in proper order As thou wilt said I Then as if making a new beginning she thus discoursed The coming into being of all things the whole course of development in things that change every sort of thing that moves in any wise receives its due cause order and form from the steadfastness of the Divine mind This mind calm in the citadel of its own essential simplicity has decreed that the method of its rule shall be manifold Viewed in the very purity of the Divine intelligence this method is called providence but viewed in regard to those things which it moves and disposes it is what the ancients called fate That these two are different will easily be clear to anyone who passes in review their respective efficacies Providence is the Divine reason itself seated in the Supreme Being which disposes all things fate is the disposition inherent in all things which move through which providence joins all things in their proper order Providence embraces all things however different however infinite fate sets in motion separately individual things and assigns to them severally their position form and time So the unfolding of this temporal order unified into the foreview of the Divine mind is providence while the same unity broken up and unfolded in time is fate And although these are different yet is there a dependence between them for the order of destiny issues from the essential simplicity of providence For as the artificer forming in his mind beforehand the idea of the thing to be made carries out his design and develops from moment to moment what he had before seen in a single instant as a whole so God in His providence ordains all things as parts of a single unchanging whole but carries out these very ordinances by fate in a time of manifold unity So whether fate is accomplished by Divine spirits as the ministers of providence or by a soul or by the service of all nature whether by the celestial motion of the stars by the efficacy of angels or by the many sided cunning of demons whether by all or by some of these the destined series is woven this at least is manifest that providence is the fixed and simple form of destined events fate their shifting series in order of time as by the disposal of the Divine simplicity they are to take place Whereby it is that all things which are under fate are subjected also to providence on which fate itself is dependent whereas certain things which are set under providence are above the chain of fate viz those things which by their nearness to the primal Divinity are steadfastly fixed and lie outside the order of fate s movements For as the innermost of several circles revolving round the same centre approaches the simplicity of the midmost point and is as it were a pivot round which the exterior circles turn while the outermost whirled in ampler orbit takes in a wider and wider sweep of space in proportion to its departure from the indivisible unity of the centre while further whatever joins and allies itself to the centre is narrowed to a like simplicity and no longer expands vaguely into space even so whatsoever departs widely from primal mind is involved more deeply in the meshes of fate and things are free from fate in proportion as they seek to come nearer to that central pivot while if aught cleaves close to supreme mind in its absolute fixity this too being free from movement rises above fate s necessity Therefore as is reasoning to pure intelligence as that which is generated to that which is time to eternity a circle to its centre so is the shifting series of fate to the steadfastness and simplicity of providence It is this causal series which moves heaven and the stars attempers the elements to mutual accord and again in turn transforms them into new combinations this which renews the series of all things that are born and die through like successions of germ and birth it is its operation which binds the destinies of men by an indissoluble nexus of causality and since it issues in the beginning from unalterable providence these destinies also must of necessity be immutable Accordingly the world is ruled for the best if this unity abiding in the Divine mind puts forth an inflexible order of causes And this order by its intrinsic immutability restricts things mutable which otherwise would ebb and flow at random And so it happens that although to you who are not altogether capable of understanding this order all things seem confused and disordered nevertheless there is everywhere an appointed limit which guides all things to good Verily nothing can be done for the sake of evil even by the wicked themselves for as we abundantly proved they seek good but are drawn out of the way by perverse error far less can this order which sets out from the supreme centre of good turn aside anywhither from the way in which it began Yet what confusion thou wilt say can be more unrighteous than that prosperity and adversity should indifferently befall the good what they like and what they loathe come alternately to the bad Yes but have men in real life such soundness of mind that their judgments of righteousness and wickedness must necessarily correspond with facts Why on this very point their verdicts conflict and those whom some deem worthy of reward others deem worthy of punishment Yet granted there were one who could rightly distinguish the good and bad yet would he be able to look into the soul s inmost constitution as it were if we may borrow an expression used of the body The marvel here is not unlike that which astonishes one who does not know why in health sweet things suit some constitutions and bitter others or why some sick men are best alleviated by mild remedies others by severe But the physician who distinguishes the precise conditions and characteristics of health and sickness does not marvel Now the health of the soul is nothing but righteousness and vice is its sickness God the guide and physician of the mind it is who preserves the good and banishes the bad And He looks forth from the lofty watch tower of His providence perceives what is suited to each and assigns what He knows to be suitable This then is what that extraordinary mystery of the order of destiny comes to that something is done by one who knows whereat the ignorant are astonished But let us consider a few instances whereby appears what is the competency of human reason to fathom the Divine unsearchableness Here is one whom thou deemest the perfection of justice and scrupulous integrity to all knowing Providence it seems far otherwise We all know our Lucan s admonition that it was the winning cause that found favour with the gods the beaten cause with Cato So shouldst thou see anything in this world happening differently from thy expectation doubt not but events are rightly ordered it is in thy judgment that there is perverse confusion Grant however there be somewhere found one of so happy a character that God and man alike agree in their judgments about him yet is he somewhat infirm in strength of mind It may be if he fall into adversity he will cease to practise that innocency which has failed to secure his fortune Therefore God s wise dispensation spares him whom adversity might make worse will not let him suffer who is ill fitted for endurance Another there is perfect in all virtue so holy and nigh to God that providence judges it unlawful that aught untoward should befall him nay doth not even permit him to be afflicted with bodily disease As one more excellent than I N hath said The very body of the holy saint Is built of purest ether Often it happens that the governance is given to the good that a restraint may be put upon superfluity of wickedness To others providence assigns some mixed lot suited to their spiritual nature some it will plague lest they grow rank through long prosperity others it will suffer to be vexed with sore afflictions to confirm their virtues by the exercise and practice of patience Some fear overmuch what they have strength to bear others despise overmuch that to which their strength is unequal All these it brings to the test of their true self through misfortune Some also have bought a name revered to future ages at the price of a glorious death some by invincible constancy under their sufferings have afforded an example to others that virtue cannot be overcome by calamity all which things without doubt come to pass rightly and in due order and to the benefit of those to whom they are seen to happen As to the other side of the marvel that the bad now meet with affliction now get their hearts desire this too springs from the same causes As to the afflictions of course no one marvels because all hold the wicked to be ill deserving The truth is their punishments both frighten others from crime and amend those on whom they are inflicted while their prosperity is a powerful sermon to the good what judgments they ought to pass on good fortune of this kind which often attends the wicked so assiduously There is another object which may I believe be attained in such cases there is one perhaps whose nature is so reckless and violent that poverty would drive him more desperately into crime His disorder providence relieves by allowing him to amass money Such a one in the uneasiness of a conscience stained with guilt while he contrasts his character with his fortune perchance grows alarmed lest he should come to mourn the loss of that whose possession is so pleasant to him He will then reform his ways and through the fear of losing his fortune he forsakes his iniquity Some through a prosperity unworthily borne have been hurled headlong to ruin to some the power of the sword has been committed to the end that the good may be tried by discipline and the bad punished For while there can be no peace between the righteous and the wicked neither can the wicked agree among themselves How should they when each is at variance with himself because his vices rend his conscience and ofttimes they do things which when they are done they judge ought not to have been done Hence it is that this supreme providence brings to pass this notable marvel that the bad make the bad good For some when they see the injustice which they themselves suffer at the hands of evil doers are inflamed with detestation of the offenders and in the endeavour to be unlike those whom they hate return to the ways of virtue It is the Divine power alone to which things evil are also good in that by putting them to suitable use it bringeth them in the end to some good issue For order in some way or other embraceth all things so that even that which has departed from the appointed laws of the order nevertheless falleth within an order though another order that nothing in the realm of providence may be left to haphazard But Hard were the task as a god to recount all nothing omitting Nor truly is it lawful for man to compass in thought all the mechanism of the Divine work or set it forth in speech Let us be content to have apprehended this only that God the creator of universal nature likewise disposeth all things and guides them to good and while He studies to preserve in likeness to Himself all that He has created He banishes all evil from the borders of His commonweal through the links of fatal necessity Whereby it comes to pass that if thou look to disposing providence thou wilt nowhere find the evils which are believed so to abound on earth But I see thou hast long been burdened with the weight of the subject and fatigued with the prolixity of the argument and now lookest for some refreshment of sweet poesy Listen then and may the draught so restore thee that thou wilt bend thy mind more resolutely to what remains FOOTNOTES N

of all that we have said Nay what consequence That absolutely every fortune is good fortune And how can that be said I Attend said she Since every fortune welcome and unwelcome alike has for its object the reward or trial of the good and the punishing or amending of the bad every fortune must be good since it is either just or useful The reasoning is exceeding true said I the conclusion so long as I reflect upon the providence and fate of which thou hast taught me based on a strong foundation Yet with thy leave we will count it among those which just now thou didst set down as paradoxical And why so said she Because ordinary speech is apt to assert and that frequently that some men s fortune is bad Shall we then for awhile approach more nearly to the language of the vulgar that we may not seem to have departed too far from the usages of men At thy good pleasure said I That which advantageth thou callest good dost thou not Certainly And that which either tries or amends advantageth Granted

none	none	Of course Well this is their case who have attained virtue and wage war with adversity or turn from vice and lay hold on the path of virtue I cannot deny it What of the good fortune which is given as reward of the good do the vulgar adjudge it bad Anything but that they deem it to be the best as indeed it is What then of that which remains which though it is harsh puts the restraint of just punishment on the bad does popular opinion deem it good Nay of all that can be imagined it is accounted the most miserable Observe then if in following popular opinion we have not ended in a conclusion quite paradoxical How so said I Why it results from our admissions that of all who have attained or are advancing in or are aiming at virtue the fortune is in every case good while for those who remain in their wickedness fortune is always utterly bad It is true said I yet no one dare acknowledge it Wherefore said she the wise man ought not to take it ill if ever he is involved in one of fortune s conflicts any more than it becomes a brave soldier to be offended when at any time the trumpet sounds for battle The time of trial is the express opportunity for the one to win glory for the other to perfect his wisdom Hence indeed virtue gets its name because relying on its own efficacy it yieldeth not to adversity And ye who have taken your stand on virtue s steep ascent it is not for you to be dissolved in delights or enfeebled by pleasure ye close in conflict yea in conflict most sharp with all fortune s vicissitudes lest ye suffer foul fortune to overwhelm or fair fortune to corrupt you Hold the mean with all your strength Whatever falls short of this or goes beyond is fraught with scorn of happiness and misses the reward of toil It rests with you to make your fortune what you will Verily every harsh seeming fortune unless it either disciplines or amends is punishment SONG VII THE HERO S PATH Ten years a tedious warfare raged Ere Ilium s smoking ruins paid For wedlock stained and faith betrayed And great Atrides wrath assuaged But when heaven s anger asked a life And baffling winds his course withstood The king put off his fatherhood And slew his child

bitter tears and sore annoy For that foul feast s unholy joy Grim Polyphemus paid again His labours for Alcides win A name of glory far and wide He tamed the Centaur s haughty pride And from the lion reft his skin The foul birds with sure darts he slew The golden fruit he stole in vain The dragon s watch with triple chain From hell s depths Cerberus he drew With their fierce lord s own flesh he fed The wild steeds Hydra overcame With fire Neath his own waves in shame Maimed Achelous hid his head Huge Cacus for his crimes was slain On Libya s sands Antaeus hurled The shoulders that upheld the world The great boar s dribbled spume did stain Last toil of all his might sustained The ball of heaven nor did he bend Beneath this toil his labour s end The prize of heaven s high glory gained Brave hearts press on Lo heavenward lead These bright examples From the fight Turn not your backs in coward flight Earth s conflict won the stars your meed BOOK V FREE WILL AND GOD S FOREKNOWLEDGE SUMMARY CH I Boethius asks if there is really any such thing as chance Philosophy answers in conformity with Aristotle s definition Phys II iv that chance is merely relative to human purpose and that what seems fortuitous really depends on a more subtle form of causation CH II Has man then any freedom if the reign of law is thus absolute Freedom of choice replies Philosophy is a necessary attribute of reason Man has a measure of freedom though a less perfect freedom than divine natures CH III But how can man s freedom be reconciled with God s absolute foreknowledge If God s foreknowledge be certain it seems to exclude the possibility of man s free will But if man has no freedom of choice it follows that rewards and punishments are unjust as well as useless that merit and demerit are mere names that God is the cause of men s wickednesses that prayer is meaningless CH IV The explanation is that man s reasoning faculties are not adequate to the apprehension of the ways of God s foreknowledge If we could know as He knows all that is most perplexing in this problem would be made plain For knowledge depends not on the nature of the thing known but on the faculty of the knower CH V Now where our senses conflict with our reason we defer the judgment of the lower faculty to the judgment of the higher Our present perplexity arises from our viewing God s foreknowledge from the standpoint of human reason We must try and rise to the higher standpoint of God s immediate intuition CH VI To understand this higher form of cognition we must consider God s nature God is eternal Eternity is more than mere everlasting duration Accordingly His knowledge surveys past and future in the timelessness of an eternal present His foreseeing is seeing Yet this foreseeing does not in itself impose necessity any more than our seeing things happen makes their happening necessary We may however if we please distinguish two necessities one absolute the other conditional on knowledge In this conditional sense alone do the things which God foresees necessarily come to pass But this kind of necessity affects not the nature of things It leaves the reality of free will unimpaired and the evils feared do not ensue Our responsibility is great since all that we do is done in the sight of all seeing Providence BOOK V I She ceased and was about to pass on in her discourse to the exposition of other matters when I break in and say Excellent is thine exhortation and such as well beseemeth thy high authority but I am even now experiencing one of the many difficulties which as thou saidst but now beset the question of providence I want to know whether thou deemest that there is any such thing as chance at all and if so what it is Then she made answer I am anxious to fulfil my promise completely and open to thee a way of return to thy native land As for these matters though very useful to know they are yet a little removed from the path of our design and I fear lest digressions should fatigue thee and thou shouldst find thyself unequal to completing the direct journey to our goal Have no fear for that said I It is rest to me to learn where learning brings delight so exquisite especially when thy argument has been built up on all sides with undoubted conviction and no place is left for uncertainty in what follows She made answer I will accede to thy request and forthwith she thus began If chance be defined as a result produced by random movement without any link of causal connection I roundly affirm that there is no such thing as chance at all and consider the word to be altogether without meaning except as a symbol of the thing designated What place can be left for random action when God constraineth all things to order For ex nihilo nihil is sound doctrine which none of the ancients gainsaid although they used it of material substance not of the efficient principle this they laid down as a kind of basis for all their reasonings concerning nature Now if a thing arise without causes it will appear to have arisen from nothing But if this cannot be neither is it possible for there to be chance in accordance with the definition just given Well said I is there then nothing which can properly be called chance or accident or is there something to which these names are appropriate though its nature is dark to the vulgar Our good Aristotle says she has defined it concisely in his Physics and closely in accordance with the truth How pray said I Thus says she Whenever something is done for the sake of a particular end and for certain reasons some other result than that designed ensues this is called chance for instance if a man is digging the earth for tillage and finds a mass of buried gold Now such a find is regarded as accidental yet it is not ex nihilo for it has its proper causes the unforeseen and unexpected concurrence of which has brought the chance about For had not the cultivator been digging had not the man who hid the money buried it in that precise spot the gold would not have been found These then are the reasons why the find is a chance one in that it results from causes which met together and concurred not from any intention on the part of the discoverer Since neither he who buried the gold nor he who worked in the field intended that the money should be found but as I said it happened by coincidence that one dug where the other buried the treasure We may then define chance as being an unexpected result flowing from a concurrence of causes where the several factors had some definite end But the meeting and concurrence of these causes arises from that inevitable chain of order which flowing from the fountain head of Providence disposes all things in their due time and place SONG I CHANCE In the rugged Persian highlands Where the masters of the bow Skill to feign a flight and fleeing Hurl their darts and pierce the foe There the Tigris and Euphrates At one source O their waters blend Soon to draw apart and plainward Each its separate way to wend When once more their waters mingle In a channel deep and wide All the flotsam comes together That is borne upon the tide Ships and trunks of trees uprooted In the torrent s wild career Meet as mid the swirling waters Chance their random way may steer Yet the shelving of the channel And the flowing water s force Guides each movement and determines Every floating fragment s course Thus where er the drift of hazard Seems most unrestrained to flow Chance herself is reined and bitted And the curb of law doth know FOOTNOTES O This is not of course literally true though the Tigris and Euphrates rise in the same mountain district II I am following needfully said I and I agree that it is as thou sayest But in this series of linked causes is there any freedom left to our will or does the chain of fate bind also the very motions of our souls There is freedom said she nor indeed can any creature be rational unless he be endowed with free will For that which hath the natural use of reason has the faculty of discriminative judgment and of itself distinguishes what is to be shunned or desired Now everyone seeks what he judges desirable and avoids what he thinks should be shunned Wherefore beings endowed with reason possess also the faculty of free choice and refusal But I suppose this faculty not equal alike in all The higher Divine essences possess a clear sighted judgment an uncorrupt will and an effective power of accomplishing their wishes Human souls must needs be comparatively free while they abide in the contemplation of the Divine mind less free when they pass into bodily form and still less again when they are enwrapped in earthly members But when they are given over to vices and fall from the possession of their proper reason then indeed their condition is utter slavery For when they let their gaze fall from the light of highest truth to the lower world where darkness reigns soon ignorance blinds their vision they are disturbed by baneful affections by yielding and assenting to which they help to promote the slavery in which they are involved and are in a manner led captive by reason of their very liberty Yet He who seeth all things from eternity beholdeth these things with the eyes of His providence and assigneth to each what is predestined for it by its merits All things surveying all things overhearing SONG II THE TRUE SUN Homer with mellifluous tongue Phoebus glorious light hath sung Hymning high his praise Yet his feeble rays Ocean s hollows may not brighten Nor earth s central gloom enlighten But the might of Him who skilled This great universe to build Is not thus confined Not earth s solid rind Nor night s blackest canopy Baffle His all seeing eye All that is hath been shall be In one glance s compass He Limitless descries And save His no eyes All the world survey no none Him then truly name the Sun III Then said I But now I am once more perplexed by a problem yet more difficult And what is that said she yet in truth I can guess what it is that troubles you It seems said I too much of a paradox and a contradiction that God should know all things and yet there should be free will For if God foresees everything and can in no wise be deceived that which providence foresees to be about to happen must necessarily come to pass Wherefore if from eternity He foreknows not only what men will do but also their designs and purposes there can be no freedom of the will seeing that nothing can be done nor can any sort of purpose be entertained save such as a Divine providence incapable of being deceived has perceived beforehand For if the issues can be turned aside to some other end than that foreseen by providence there will not then be any sure foreknowledge of the future but uncertain conjecture instead and to think this of God I deem impiety Moreover I do not approve the reasoning by which some think to solve this puzzle For they say that it is not because God has foreseen the coming of an event that therefore it is sure to come to pass but conversely because something is about to come to pass it cannot be hidden from Divine providence and accordingly the necessity passes to the opposite side and it is not that what is foreseen must necessarily come to pass but that what is about to come to pass must necessarily be foreseen But this is just as if the matter in debate were which is cause and which effect whether foreknowledge of the future cause of the necessity or the necessity of the future of the foreknowledge But we need not be at the pains of demonstrating that whatsoever be the order of the causal sequence the occurrence of things foreseen is necessary even though the foreknowledge of future events does not in itself impose upon them the necessity of their occurrence For example if a man be seated the supposition of his being seated is necessarily true and conversely if the supposition of his being seated is true because he is really seated he must necessarily be sitting So in either case there is some necessity involved in this latter case the necessity of the fact in the former of the truth of the statement But in both cases the sitter is not therefore seated because the opinion is true but rather the opinion is true because antecedently he was sitting as a matter of fact Thus though the cause of the truth of the opinion comes from the other side P yet there is a necessity on both sides alike We can obviously reason similarly in the case of providence and the future Even if future events are foreseen because they are about to happen and do not come to pass because they are foreseen still all the same there is a necessity both that they should be foreseen by God as about to come to pass and that when they are foreseen they should happen and this is sufficient for the destruction of free will However it is preposterous to speak of the occurrence of events in time as the cause of eternal foreknowledge And yet if we believe that God foresees future events because they are about to come to pass what is it but to think that the occurrence of events is the cause of His supreme providence Further just as when I know that anything is that thing necessarily is so when I know that anything will be it will necessarily be It follows then that things foreknown come to pass inevitably Lastly to think of a thing as being in any way other than what it is is not only not knowledge but it is false opinion widely different from the truth of knowledge Consequently if anything is about to be and yet its occurrence is not certain and necessary how can anyone foreknow that it will occur For just as knowledge itself is free from all admixture of falsity so any conception drawn from knowledge cannot be other than as it is conceived For this indeed is the cause why knowledge is free from falsehood because of necessity each thing must correspond exactly with the knowledge which grasps its nature In what way then are we to suppose that God foreknows these uncertainties as about to come to pass For if He thinks of events which possibly may not happen at all as inevitably destined to come to pass He is deceived and this it is not only impious to believe but even so much as to express in words If on the other hand He sees them in the future as they are in such a sense as to know that they may equally come to pass or not what sort of foreknowledge is this which comprehends nothing certain nor fixed What better is this than the absurd vaticination of Teiresias Whate er I say Shall either come to pass or not In that case too in what would Divine providence surpass human opinion if it holds for uncertain things the occurrence of which is uncertain even as men do But if at that perfectly sure Fountain head of all things no shadow of uncertainty can possibly be found then the occurrence of those things which He has surely foreknown as coming is certain Wherefore there can be no freedom in human actions and designs but the Divine mind which foresees all things without possibility of mistake ties and binds them down to one only issue But this admission once made what an upset of human affairs manifestly ensues Vainly are rewards and punishments proposed for the good and bad since no free and voluntary motion of the will has deserved either one or the other nay the punishment of the wicked and the reward of the righteous which is now esteemed the perfection of justice will seem the most flagrant injustice since men are determined either way not by their own proper volition but by the necessity of what must surely be And therefore neither virtue nor vice is anything but rather good and ill desert are confounded together without distinction Moreover seeing that the whole course of events is deduced from providence and nothing is left free to human design it comes to pass that our vices also are referred to the Author of all good a thought than which none more abominable can possibly be conceived Again no ground is left for hope or prayer since how can we hope for blessings or pray for mercy when every object of desire depends upon the links of an unalterable chain of causation Gone then is the one means of intercourse between God and man the communion of hope and prayer if it be true that we ever earn the inestimable recompense of the Divine favour at the price of a due humility for this is the one way whereby men seem able to hold communion with God and are joined to that unapproachable light by the very act of supplication even before they obtain their petitions Then since these things can scarcely be believed to have any efficacy if the necessity of future events be admitted what means will there be whereby we may be brought near and cleave to Him who is the supreme Head of all Wherefore it needs must be that the human race even as thou didst erstwhile declare in song parted and dissevered from its Source should fall to ruin FOOTNOTES P I e the necessity of the truth of the statement from the fact SONG III TRUTH S PARADOXES Why does a strange discordance break The ordered scheme s fair harmony Hath God decreed twixt truth and truth There may such lasting warfare be That truths each severally plain We strive to reconcile in vain Or is the discord not in truth Since truth is self consistent ever But close in fleshly wrappings held The blinded mind of man can never Discern so faint her taper shines The subtle chain that all combines Ah then why burns man s restless mind Truth s hidden portals to unclose Knows he already what he seeks Why toil to seek it if he knows Yet haply if he knoweth not Why blindly seek he knows not what Q Who for a good he knows

fleshly vapours dimmed Not all forgot her visions past For while the several parts are lost To the one whole she cleaveth fast Whence he who yearns the truth to find Is neither sound of sight nor

128-121911-0003	train-other-500	I inquire into the reasons why thou art dissatisfied with the solution proposed which is to the effect that
none	none	 seeing the fact of foreknowledge is not thought the cause of the necessity of future events 
128-121911-0004	train-other-500	foreknowledge is not to be deemed any hindrance to the freedom of the will Now surely the sole ground on which thou arguest the necessity of the future is that things which are foreknown cannot fail to come to pass But if
128-121911-0005	train-other-500	as thou wert ready to acknowledge just now the fact of foreknowledge imposes no necessity on things future what reason is there for supposing the results of voluntary action constrained to a fixed issue Suppose for the sake of argument
128-121911-0006	train-other-500	and to see what follows we assume that there is no foreknowledge Are willed actions then tied down to any necessity in this case Certainly not
128-121911-0007	train-other-500	Let us assume foreknowledge again but without its involving any actual necessity the freedom of the will I imagine will remain in complete integrity But
none	none	 thou wilt say that even although the foreknowledge is not the necessity of the future event s occurrence yet it is a sign that it will necessarily happen 
128-121911-0008	train-other-500	Granted but in this case it is plain that even if there had been no foreknowledge
none	none	 the issues would have been inevitably certain 
128-121911-0009	train-other-500	For a sign only indicates something which is does not bring to pass that of which it is the sign We require to show beforehand that all things without exception happen of necessity
none	none	 in order that a preconception may be a sign of this necessity 
128-121911-0010	train-other-500	Otherwise if there is no such universal necessity neither can any preconception be a sign of a necessity which exists not
none	none	 Manifestly too a proof established on firm grounds of reason 
128-121911-0011	train-other-500	must be drawn not from signs and loose general arguments but from suitable and necessary causes But how can it be that things foreseen should ever fail to come to pass
none	none	 Why this is to suppose us to believe that the events which providence foresees to be coming 
128-121911-0012	train-other-500	were not about to happen instead of our supposing that although they should come to pass yet there was no necessity involved in their own nature compelling their occurrence
none	none	 Take an illustration that will help to convey my meaning 
128-121911-0013	train-other-500	There are many things which we see taking place before our eyes the movements of charioteers for instance in guiding and turning their cars and so on Now is any one of these movements compelled by any necessity No certainly not
128-121911-0014	train-other-500	There would be no efficacy in skill if all motions took place perforce Then things which in taking place are free from any necessity as to their being in the present must also before they take place be about to happen without necessity
128-121911-0015	train-other-500	Wherefore there are things which will come to pass the occurrence of which is perfectly free from necessity At all events I imagine that no one will deny that things now taking place were about to come to pass before they were actually happening
128-121911-0016	train-other-500	Such things however much foreknown are in their occurrence free
none	none	 For even as knowledge of things present imports no necessity into things that are taking place so foreknowledge of the future imports none into things that are about to come 
128-121911-0017	train-other-500	But this thou wilt say is the very point in dispute whether any foreknowing is possible of things whose occurrence is not necessary For here there seems to thee a contradiction and if they are foreseen their necessity follows
128-121911-0018	train-other-500	whereas if there is no necessity they can by no means be foreknown and thou thinkest that nothing can be grasped as known unless it is certain but if things whose occurrence is uncertain are foreknown as certain
128-121911-0019	train-other-500	this is the very mist of opinion not the truth of knowledge
none	none	 For to think of things otherwise than as they are 
128-121911-0020	train-other-500	thou believest to be incompatible with the soundness of knowledge Now the cause of the mistake is this that men think that all knowledge is cognized purely by the nature and efficacy of the thing known
128-121911-0021	train-other-500	Whereas the case is the very reverse all that is known is grasped not conformably to its own efficacy but rather conformably to the faculty of the knower
none	none	 An example will make this clear 
128-121911-0022	train-other-500	the roundness of a body is recognised in one way by sight in another by touch Sight looks upon it from a distance as a whole by a simultaneous reflection of rays touch grasps the roundness piecemeal
128-121911-0023	train-other-500	by contact and attachment to the surface and by actual movement round the periphery itself Man himself likewise is viewed in one way by Sense in another by Imagination in another way again by Thought
128-121911-0024	train-other-500	in another by pure Intelligence Sense judges figure clothed in material substance Imagination figure alone without matter Thought transcends this again
none	none	 and by its contemplation of universals considers the type itself which is contained in the individual 
128-121911-0025	train-other-500	The eye of Intelligence is yet more exalted
none	none	 for overpassing the sphere of the universal it will behold absolute form itself 
128-121911-0026	train-other-500	by the pure force of the mind s vision Wherein the main point to be considered is this the higher faculty of comprehension embraces the lower while the lower cannot rise to the higher For Sense has no efficacy beyond matter
128-121911-0027	train-other-500	nor can Imagination behold universal ideas nor Thought embrace pure form but Intelligence looking down as it were from its higher standpoint in its intuition of form discriminates also the several elements which underlie it
128-121911-0028	train-other-500	but it comprehends them in the same way as it comprehends that form itself which could be cognized by no other than itself
none	none	 For it cognizes the universal of Thought the figure of Imagination and the matter of Sense without employing Thought Imagination or Sense 
128-121911-0029	train-other-500	but surveying all things so to speak under the aspect of pure form by a single flash of intuition Thought also
none	none	 in considering the universal 
128-121911-0030	train-other-500	embraces images and sense impressions without resorting to Imagination or Sense
none	none	 For it is Thought which has thus defined the universal from its conceptual point of view 
128-121911-0031	train-other-500	Man is a two legged animal endowed with reason This is indeed a universal notion yet no one is ignorant that the thing is imaginable and presentable to Sense because Thought considers it not by Imagination or Sense
128-121911-0032	train-other-500	but by means of rational conception
none	none	 Imagination too though its faculty of viewing and forming representations 
128-121911-0033	train-other-500	is founded upon the senses nevertheless surveys sense impressions without calling in Sense not in the way of Sense perception but of Imagination
none	none	 See saint thou then how all things in cognizing use rather their own faculty 
128-121911-0034	train-other-500	than the faculty of the things which they cognize Nor is this strange for since every judgment is the act of the judge it is necessary that each should accomplish its task by its own not by another s power
none	none	 SONG IV A PSYCHOLOGICAL FALLACY R From the Porch s murky depths 
128-121911-0035	train-other-500	Comes a doctrine sage That doth liken living mind To a written page Since all knowledge comes through Sense Graven by Experience As say they the pen its marks Curiously doth trace
128-121911-0036	train-other-500	On the smooth unsullied white Of the paper s face So do outer things impress Images on consciousness But if verily the mind Thus all passive lies If no living power within Its own force supplies
128-121911-0037	train-other-500	If it but reflect again Like a glass things false and vain
none	none	 Whence the wondrous faculty That perceives and knows That in one fair ordered scheme Doth the world dispose 
128-121911-0038	train-other-500	Grasps each whole that Sense presents Or breaks into elements So divides and recombines And in changeful wise Now to low descends and now To the height doth rise
128-121911-0039	train-other-500	Last in inward swift review Strictly sifts the false and true Of these ample potencies Fitter cause I ween Were Mind s self than marks impressed By the outer scene Yet the body through the sense
128-121911-0040	train-other-500	Stirs the soul s intelligence When light flashes on the eye Or sound strikes the ear Mind aroused to due response Makes the message clear
none	none	 And the dumb external signs With the hidden forms combines FOOTNOTES R A criticism of the doctrine of the mind as a blank sheet of paper on which experience writes as held by the Stoics in anticipation of Locke See Zeller Stoics Epicureans and Sceptics Reichel s translation p seventy six V Now although in the case of bodies endowed with sentiency the qualities of external objects affect the sense organs and the activity of mind is preceded by a bodily affection which calls forth the mind s action upon itself and stimulates the forms till that moment lying inactive within yet I say if in these bodies endowed with sentiency the mind is not inscribed by mere passive affection but of its own efficacy discriminates the impressions furnished to the body how much more do intelligences free from all bodily affections employ in their discrimination their own mental activities instead of conforming to external objects So on these principles various modes of cognition belong to distinct and different substances For to creatures void of motive power shell fish and other such creatures which cling to rocks and grow there belongs Sense alone void of all other modes of gaining knowledge to beasts endowed with movement in whom some capacity of seeking and shunning seems to have arisen Imagination also Thought pertains only to the human race as Intelligence to Divinity alone hence it follows that that form of knowledge exceeds the rest which of its own nature cognizes not only its proper object but the objects of the other forms of knowledge also But what if Sense and Imagination were to gainsay Thought and declare that universal which Thought deems itself to behold to be nothing For the object of Sense and Imagination cannot be universal so that either the judgment of Reason is true and there is no sense object or since they know full well that many objects are presented to Sense and Imagination the conception of Reason which looks on that which is perceived by Sense and particular as if it were a something universal is empty of content Suppose further that Reason maintains in reply that it does indeed contemplate the object of both Sense and Imagination under the form of universality while Sense and Imagination cannot aspire to the knowledge of the universal since their cognizance cannot go beyond bodily figures and that in the cognition of reality we ought rather to trust the stronger and more perfect faculty of judgment In a dispute of this sort should not we in whom is planted the faculty of reasoning as well as of imagining and perceiving espouse the cause of Reason In like manner is it that human reason thinks that Divine Intelligence cannot see the future except after the fashion in which its own knowledge is obtained For thy contention is if events do not appear to involve certain and necessary issues they cannot be foreseen as certainly about to come to pass There is then no foreknowledge of such events or if we can ever bring ourselves to believe that there is there can be nothing which does not happen of necessity If however we could have some part in the judgment of the Divine mind even as we participate in Reason we should think it perfectly just that human Reason should submit itself to the Divine mind no less than we judged that Imagination and Sense ought to yield to Reason Wherefore let us soar if we can to the heights of that Supreme Intelligence for there Reason will see what in itself it cannot look upon and that is in what way things whose occurrence is not certain may yet be seen in a sure and definite foreknowledge and that this foreknowledge is not conjecture but rather knowledge in its supreme simplicity free of all limits and restrictions SONG V THE UPWARD LOOK In what divers shapes and fashions do the creatures great and small Over wide earth s teeming surface skim or scud or walk or crawl Some with elongated body sweep the ground and as they move Trail perforce with writhing belly in the dust a sinuous groove Some on light wing upward soaring swiftly do the winds divide And through heaven s ample spaces in free motion smoothly glide These earth s solid surface pressing with firm paces onward rove Ranging through the verdant meadows crouching in the woodland grove Great and wondrous is their variance Yet in all the head low bent Dulls the soul and blunts the senses though their forms be different Man alone erect aspiring lifts his forehead to the skies And in upright posture steadfast seems earth s baseness to despise If with earth not all besotted to this parable give ear Thou whose gaze is fixed on heaven who thy face on high dost rear Lift thy soul too heavenward haply lest it stain its heavenly worth And thine eyes alone look upward while thy mind cleaves to the earth VI Since then as we lately proved everything that is known is cognized not in accordance with its own nature but in accordance with the nature of the faculty that comprehends it let us now contemplate as far as lawful the character of the Divine essence that we may be able to understand also the nature of its knowledge God is eternal in this judgment all rational beings agree Let us then consider what eternity is For this word carries with it a revelation alike of the Divine nature and of the Divine knowledge Now eternity is the possession of endless life whole and perfect at a single moment What this is becomes more clear and manifest from a comparison with things temporal For whatever lives in time is a present proceeding from the past to the future and there is nothing set in time which can embrace the whole space of its life together To morrow s state it grasps not yet while it has already lost yesterday s nay even in the life of to day ye live no longer than one brief transitory moment Whatever therefore is subject to the condition of time although as Aristotle deemed of the world it never have either beginning or end and its life be stretched to the whole extent of time s infinity it yet is not such as rightly to be thought eternal For it does not include and embrace the whole space of infinite life at once but has no present hold on things to come not yet accomplished Accordingly that which includes and possesses the whole fulness of unending life at once from which nothing future is absent from which nothing past has escaped this is rightly called eternal this must of necessity be ever present to itself in full self possession and hold the infinity of movable time in an abiding present Wherefore they deem not rightly who imagine that on Plato s principles the created world is made company eternal with the Creator because they are told that he believed the world to have had no beginning in time S and to be destined never to come to an end For it is one thing for existence to be endlessly prolonged which was what Plato ascribed to the world another for the whole of an endless life to be embraced in the present which is manifestly a property peculiar to the Divine mind Nor need God appear earlier in mere duration of time to created things but only prior in the unique simplicity of His nature For the infinite progression of things in time copies this immediate existence in the present of the changeless life and when it cannot succeed in equalling it declines from movelessness into motion and falls away from the simplicity of a perpetual present to the infinite duration of the future and the past and since it cannot possess the whole fulness of its life together for the very reason that in a manner it never ceases to be it seems up to a certain point to rival that which it cannot complete and express by attaching itself indifferently to any present moment of time however swift and brief and since this bears some resemblance to that ever abiding present it bestows on everything to which it is assigned the semblance of existence But since it cannot abide it hurries along the infinite path of time and the result has been that it continues by ceaseless movement the life the completeness of which it could not embrace while it stood still So if we are minded to give things their right names we shall follow Plato in saying that God indeed is eternal but the world everlasting Since then every mode of judgment comprehends its objects conformably to its own nature and since God abides for ever in an eternal present His knowledge also transcending all movement of time dwells in the simplicity of its own changeless present and embracing the whole infinite sweep of the past and of the future contemplates all that falls within its simple cognition as if it were now taking place And therefore if thou wilt carefully consider that immediate presentment whereby it discriminates all things thou wilt more rightly deem it not foreknowledge as of something future but knowledge of a moment that never passes For this cause the name chosen to describe it is not prevision but providence because since utterly removed in nature from things mean and trivial its outlook embraces all things as from some lofty height Why then dost thou insist that the things which are surveyed by the Divine eye are involved in necessity whereas clearly men impose no necessity on things which they see Does the act of vision add any necessity to the things which thou seest before thy eyes Assuredly not And yet if we may without unfitness compare God s present and man s just as ye see certain things in this your temporary present so does He see all things in His eternal present Wherefore this Divine anticipation changes not the natures and properties of things and it beholds things present before it just as they will hereafter come to pass in time Nor does it confound things in its judgment but in the one mental view distinguishes alike what will come necessarily and what without necessity For even as ye when at one and the same time ye see a man walking on the earth and the sun rising in the sky distinguish between the two though one glance embraces both and judge the former voluntary the latter necessary action so also the Divine vision in its universal range of view does in no wise confuse the characters of the things which are present to its regard though future in respect of time Whence it follows that when it perceives that something will come into existence and yet is perfectly aware that this is unbound by any necessity its apprehension is not opinion but rather knowledge based on truth And if to this thou sayest that what God sees to be about to come to pass cannot fail to come to pass and that what cannot fail to come to pass happens of necessity and wilt tie me down to this word necessity I will acknowledge that thou affirmest a most solid truth but one which scarcely anyone can approach to who has not made the Divine his special study For my answer would be that the same future event is necessary from the standpoint of Divine knowledge but when considered in its own nature it seems absolutely free and unfettered So then there are two necessities one simple as that men are necessarily mortal the other conditioned as that if you know that someone is walking he must necessarily be walking For that which is known cannot indeed be otherwise than as it is known to be and yet this fact by no means carries with it that other simple necessity For the former necessity is not imposed by the thing s own proper nature but by the addition of a condition No necessity compels one who is voluntarily walking to go forward although it is necessary for him to go forward at the moment of walking In the same way then if Providence sees anything as present that must necessarily be though it is bound by no necessity of nature Now God views as present those coming events which happen of free will These accordingly from the standpoint of the Divine vision are made necessary conditionally on the Divine cognizance viewed however in themselves they desist not from the absolute freedom naturally theirs Accordingly without doubt all things will come to pass which God foreknows as about to happen but of these certain proceed of free will and though these happen yet by the fact of their existence they do not lose their proper nature in virtue of which before they happened it was really possible that they might not have come to pass What difference then does the denial of necessity make since through their being conditioned by Divine knowledge they come to pass as if they were in all respects under the compulsion of necessity This difference surely which we saw in the case of the instances I formerly took the sun s rising and the man s walking which at the moment of their occurrence could not but be taking place and yet one of them before it took place was necessarily obliged to be while the other was not so at all So likewise the things which to God are present without doubt exist but some of them come from the necessity of things others from the power of the agent Quite rightly then have we said that these things are necessary if viewed from the standpoint of the Divine knowledge but if they are considered in themselves they are free from the bonds of necessity even as everything which is accessible to sense regarded from the standpoint of Thought is universal but viewed in its own nature particular But thou wilt say if it is in my power to change my purpose I shall make void providence since I shall perchance change something which comes within its foreknowledge My answer is Thou canst indeed turn aside thy purpose but since the truth of providence is ever at hand to see that thou canst and whether thou dost and whither thou turnest thyself thou canst not avoid the Divine foreknowledge even as thou canst not escape the sight of a present spectator although of thy free will thou turn thyself to various actions Wilt thou then say Shall the Divine knowledge be changed at my discretion so that when I will this or that providence changes its knowledge correspondingly Surely not True for the Divine vision anticipates all that is coming and transforms and reduces it to the form of its own present knowledge and varies not as thou deemest in its foreknowledge alternating to this or that but in a single flash it forestalls and includes thy mutations without altering And this ever present comprehension and survey of all things God has received not from the issue of future events but from the simplicity of His own nature Hereby also is resolved the objection which a little while ago gave thee offence that our doings in the future were spoken of as if supplying the cause of God s knowledge For this faculty of knowledge embracing all things in its immediate cognizance has itself fixed the bounds of all things yet itself owes nothing to what comes after And all this being so the freedom of man s will stands unshaken and laws are not unrighteous since their rewards and punishments are held forth to wills unbound by any necessity God who foreknoweth all things still looks down from above and the ever present eternity of His vision concurs with the future character of all our acts and dispenseth to the good rewards to the bad punishments Our hopes and prayers also are not fixed on God in vain and when they are rightly directed cannot fail of effect Therefore withstand vice practise virtue lift up your souls to right hopes offer humble prayers to Heaven Great is the necessity of righteousness laid upon you if ye will not hide it from yourselves seeing that all your actions are done before the eyes of a Judge who seeth all things FOOTNOTES S Plato expressly states the opposite in the Timaeus twenty eightB though possibly there the account of the
