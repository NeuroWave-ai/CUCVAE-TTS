Outside Dorlcote Mill A wide plain where the broadening Floss hurries on between its green banks to the sea and the loving tide rushing to meet it checks its passage with an impetuous embrace On this mighty tide the black ships laden with the fresh scented fir planks with rounded sacks of oil bearing seed or with the dark glitter of coal are borne along to the town of saint Ogg s which shows its aged fluted red roofs and the broad gables of its wharves between the low wooded hill and the river brink tingeing the water with a soft purple hue under the transient glance of this February sun Far away on each hand stretch the rich pastures and the patches of dark earth made ready for the seed of broad leaved green crops or touched already with the tint of the tender bladed autumn sown corn There is a remnant still of last year s golden clusters of beehive ricks rising at intervals beyond the hedgerows and everywhere the hedgerows are studded with trees the distant ships seem to be lifting their masts and stretching their red brown sails close among the branches of the spreading ash Just by the red roofed town the tributary Ripple flows with a lively current into the Floss How lovely the little river is with its dark changing wavelets It seems to me like a living companion while I wander along the bank and listen to its low placid voice as to the voice of one who is deaf and loving I remember those large dipping willows I remember the stone bridge And this is Dorlcote Mill I must stand a minute or two here on the bridge and look at it though the clouds are threatening and it is far on in the afternoon Even in this leafless time of departing February it is pleasant to look at perhaps the chill damp season adds a charm to the trimly kept comfortable dwelling house as old as the elms and chestnuts that shelter it from the northern blast The stream is brimful now and lies high in this little withy plantation and half drowns the grassy fringe of the croft in front of the house As I look at the full stream the vivid grass the delicate bright green powder softening the outline of the great trunks and branches that gleam from under the bare purple boughs I am in love with moistness and envy the white ducks that are dipping their heads far into the water here among the withes unmindful of the awkward appearance they make in the drier world above The rush of the water and the booming of the mill bring a dreamy deafness which seems to heighten the peacefulness of the scene They are like a great curtain of sound shutting one out from the world beyond And now there is the thunder of the huge covered wagon coming home with sacks of grain That honest wagoner is thinking of his dinner getting sadly dry in the oven at this late hour but he will not touch it till he has fed his horses the strong submissive meek eyed beasts who I fancy are looking mild reproach at him from between their blinkers that he should crack his whip at them in that awful manner as if they needed that hint See how they stretch their shoulders up the slope toward the bridge with all the more energy because they are so near home Look at their grand shaggy feet that seem to grasp the firm earth at the patient strength of their necks bowed under the heavy collar at the mighty muscles of their struggling haunches I should like well to hear them neigh over their hardly earned feed of corn and see them with their moist necks freed from the harness dipping their eager nostrils into the muddy pond Now they are on the bridge and down they go again at a swifter pace and the arch of the covered wagon disappears at the turning behind the trees Now I can turn my eyes toward the mill again and watch the unresting wheel sending out its diamond jets of water That little girl is watching it too she has been standing on just the same spot at the edge of the water ever since I paused on the bridge And that queer white cur with the brown ear seems to be leaping and barking in ineffectual remonstrance with the wheel perhaps he is jealous because his playfellow in the beaver bonnet is so rapt in its movement It is time the little playfellow went in I think and there is a very bright fire to tempt her the red light shines out under the deepening gray of the sky It is time too for me to leave off resting my arms on the cold stone of this bridge Ah my arms are really benumbed I have been pressing my elbows on the arms of my chair and dreaming that I was standing on the bridge in front of Dorlcote Mill as it looked one February afternoon many years ago Before I dozed off I was going to tell you what mister and missus Tulliver were talking about as they sat by the bright fire in the left hand parlor on that very afternoon I have been dreaming of Chapter II mister Tulliver of Dorlcote Mill Declares His Resolution about Tom What I want you know said mister Tulliver what I want is to give Tom a good eddication an eddication as ll be a bread to him That was what I was thinking of when I gave notice for him to leave the academy at Lady day I mean to put him to a downright good school at Midsummer The two years at th academy ud ha done well enough if I d meant to make a miller and farmer of him for he s had a fine sight more schoolin nor I ever got All the learnin my father ever paid for was a bit o birch at one end and the alphabet at th other But I should like Tom to be a bit of a scholard so as he might be up to the tricks o these fellows as talk fine and write with a flourish It ud be a help to me wi these lawsuits and arbitrations and things I wouldn t make a downright lawyer o the lad I should be sorry for him to be a raskill but a sort o engineer or a surveyor or an auctioneer and vallyer like Riley or one o them smartish businesses as are all profits and no outlay only for a big watch chain and a high stool They re pretty nigh all one and they re not far off being even wi the law I believe for Riley looks Lawyer Wakem i the face as hard as one cat looks another He s none frightened at him mister Tulliver was speaking to his wife a blond comely woman in a fan shaped cap I am afraid to think how long it is since fan shaped caps were worn they must be so near coming in again At that time when missus Tulliver was nearly forty they were new at saint Ogg s and considered sweet things Well mister Tulliver you know best I ve no objections But hadn t I better kill a couple o fowl and have th aunts and uncles to dinner next week so as you may hear what sister Glegg and sister Pullet have got to say about it There s a couple o fowl wants killing You may kill every fowl i the yard if you like Bessy but I shall ask neither aunt nor uncle what I m to do wi my own lad said mister Tulliver defiantly Dear heart said missus Tulliver shocked at this sanguinary rhetoric how can you talk so mister Tulliver But it s your way to speak disrespectful o my family and sister Glegg throws all the blame upo me though I m sure I m as innocent as the babe unborn For nobody s ever heard me say as it wasn t lucky for my children to have aunts and uncles as can live independent Howiver if Tom s to go to a new school I should like him to go where I can wash him and mend him else he might as well have calico as linen for they d be one as yallow as th other before they d been washed half a dozen times And then when the box is goin back ard and forrard I could send the lad a cake or a pork pie or an apple for he can do with an extry bit bless him whether they stint him at the meals or no My children can eat as much victuals as most thank God Well well we won t send him out o reach o the carrier s cart if other things fit in said mister Tulliver But you mustn t put a spoke i the wheel about the washin if we can t get a school near enough That s the fault I have to find wi you Bessy if you see a stick i the road you re allays thinkin you can t step over it You d want me not to hire a good wagoner cause he d got a mole on his face Dear heart said missus Tulliver in mild surprise when did I iver make objections to a man because he d got a mole on his face I m sure I m rether fond o the moles for my brother as is dead an gone had a mole on his brow But I can t remember your iver offering to hire a wagoner with a mole mister Tulliver There was John Gibbs hadn t a mole on his face no more nor you have an I was all for having you hire him an so you did hire him an if he hadn t died o th inflammation as we paid doctor Turnbull for attending him he d very like ha been drivin the wagon now He might have a mole somewhere out o sight but how was I to know that mister Tulliver No no Bessy I didn t mean justly the mole I meant it to stand for summat else but niver mind it s puzzling work talking is What I m thinking on is how to find the right sort o school to send Tom to for I might be ta en in again as I ve been wi th academy I ll have nothing to do wi a cademy again whativer school I send Tom to it sha n t be a cademy it shall be a place where the lads spend their time i summat else besides blacking the family s shoes and getting up the potatoes It s an uncommon puzzling thing to know what school to pick mister Tulliver paused a minute or two and dived with both hands into his breeches pockets as if he hoped to find some suggestion there Apparently he was not disappointed for he presently said I know what I ll do I ll talk it over wi Riley he s coming to morrow t arbitrate about the dam Well mister Tulliver I ve put the sheets out for the best bed and Kezia s got em hanging at the fire They aren t the best sheets but they re good enough for anybody to sleep in be he who he will for as for them best Holland sheets I should repent buying em only they ll do to lay us out in An if you was to die to morrow mister Tulliver they re mangled beautiful an all ready an smell o lavender as it ud be a pleasure to lay em out an they lie at the left hand corner o the big oak linen chest at the back not as I should trust anybody to look em out but myself As missus Tulliver uttered the last sentence she drew a bright bunch of keys from her pocket and singled out one rubbing her thumb and finger up and down it with a placid smile while she looked at the clear fire If mister Tulliver had been a susceptible man in his conjugal relation he might have supposed that she drew out the key to aid her imagination in anticipating the moment when he would be in a state to justify the production of the best Holland sheets Happily he was not so he was only susceptible in respect of his right to water power moreover he had the marital habit of not listening very closely and since his mention of mister Riley had been apparently occupied in a tactile examination of his woollen stockings I think I ve hit it Bessy was his first remark after a short silence Riley s as likely a man as any to know o some school he s had schooling himself an goes about to all sorts o places arbitratin and vallyin and that And we shall have time to talk it over to morrow night when the business is done I want Tom to be such a sort o man as Riley you know as can talk pretty nigh as well as if it was all wrote out for him and knows a good lot o words as don t mean much so as you can t lay hold of em i law and a good solid knowledge o business too Well said missus Tulliver so far as talking proper and knowing everything and walking with a bend in his back and setting his hair up I shouldn t mind the lad being brought up to that But them fine talking men from the big towns mostly wear the false shirt fronts they wear a frill till it s all a mess and then hide it with a bib I know Riley does And then if Tom s to go and live at Mudport like Riley he ll have a house with a kitchen hardly big enough to turn in an niver get a fresh egg for his breakfast an sleep up three pair o stairs or four for what I know and be burnt to death before he can get down No no said mister Tulliver I ve no thoughts of his going to Mudport I mean him to set up his office at saint Ogg s close by us an live at home But continued mister Tulliver after a pause what I m a bit afraid on is as Tom hasn t got the right sort o brains for a smart fellow I doubt he s a bit slowish He takes after your family Bessy Yes that he does said missus Tulliver accepting the last proposition entirely on its own merits he s wonderful for liking a deal o salt in his broth That was my brother s way and my father s before him It seems a bit a pity though said mister Tulliver as the lad should take after the mother s side instead o the little wench That s the worst on t wi crossing o breeds you can never justly calkilate what ll come on t The little un takes after my side now she s twice as cute as Tom Too cute for a woman I m afraid continued mister Tulliver turning his head dubiously first on one side and then on the other It s no mischief much while she s a little un but an over cute woman s no better nor a long tailed sheep she ll fetch none the bigger price for that Yes it is a mischief while she s a little un mister Tulliver for it runs to naughtiness How to keep her in a clean pinafore two hours together passes my cunning An now you put me i mind continued missus Tulliver rising and going to the window I don t know where she is now an it s pretty nigh tea time Ah I thought so wanderin up an down by the water like a wild thing She ll tumble in some day missus Tulliver rapped the window sharply beckoned and shook her head a process which she repeated more than once before she returned to her chair You talk o cuteness mister Tulliver she observed as she sat down but I m sure the child s half an idiot i some things for if I send her upstairs to fetch anything she forgets what she s gone for an perhaps ull sit down on the floor i the sunshine an plait her hair an sing to herself like a Bedlam creatur all the while I m waiting for her downstairs That niver run i my family thank God no more nor a brown skin as makes her look like a mulatter I don t like to fly i the face o Providence but it seems hard as I should have but one gell an her so comical Pooh nonsense said mister Tulliver she s a straight black eyed wench as anybody need wish to see I don t know i what she s behind other folks s children and she can read almost as well as the parson But her hair won t curl all I can do with it and she s so franzy about having it put i paper and I ve such work as never was to make her stand and have it pinched with th irons Cut it off cut it off short said the father rashly How can you talk so mister Tulliver She s too big a gell gone nine and tall of her age to have her hair cut short an there s her cousin Lucy s got a row o curls round her head an not a hair out o place It seems hard as my sister Deane should have that pretty child I m sure Lucy takes more after me nor my own child does Maggie Maggie continued the mother in a tone of half coaxing fretfulness as this small mistake of nature entered the room where s the use o my telling you to keep away from the water You ll tumble in and be drownded some day an then you ll be sorry you didn t do as mother told you Maggie s hair as she threw off her bonnet painfully confirmed her mother s accusation missus Tulliver desiring her daughter to have a curled crop like other folks s children had had it cut too short in front to be pushed behind the ears and as it was usually straight an hour after it had been taken out of paper Maggie was incessantly tossing her head to keep the dark heavy locks out of her gleaming black eyes an action which gave her very much the air of a small Shetland pony Oh dear oh dear Maggie what are you thinkin of to throw your bonnet down there Take it upstairs there s a good gell an let your hair be brushed an put your other pinafore on an change your shoes do for shame an come an go on with your patchwork like a little lady Oh mother said Maggie in a vehemently cross tone I don t want to do my patchwork What not your pretty patchwork to make a counterpane for your aunt Glegg It s foolish work said Maggie with a toss of her mane tearing things to pieces to sew em together again And I don t want to do anything for my aunt Glegg I don t like her Exit Maggie dragging her bonnet by the string while mister Tulliver laughs audibly I wonder at you as you ll laugh at her mister Tulliver said the mother with feeble fretfulness in her tone You encourage her i naughtiness An her aunts will have it as it s me spoils her missus Tulliver was what is called a good tempered person never cried when she was a baby on any slighter ground than hunger and pins and from the cradle upward had been healthy fair plump and dull witted in short the flower of her family for beauty and amiability But milk and mildness are not the best things for keeping and when they turn only a little sour they may disagree with young stomachs seriously I have often wondered whether those early Madonnas of Raphael with the blond faces and somewhat stupid expression kept their placidity undisturbed when their strong limbed strong willed boys got a little too old to do without clothing I think they must have been given to feeble remonstrance getting more and more peevish as it became more and more ineffectual Chapter III mister Riley Gives His Advice Concerning a School for Tom The gentleman in the ample white cravat and shirt frill taking his brandy and water so pleasantly with his good friend Tulliver is mister Riley a gentleman with a waxen complexion and fat hands rather highly educated for an auctioneer and appraiser but large hearted enough to show a great deal of bonhomie toward simple country acquaintances of hospitable habits mister Riley spoke of such acquaintances kindly as people of the old school The conversation had come to a pause mister Tulliver not without a particular reason had abstained from a seventh recital of the cool retort by which Riley had shown himself too many for Dix and how Wakem had had his comb cut for once in his life now the business of the dam had been settled by arbitration and how there never would have been any dispute at all about the height of water if everybody was what they should be and Old Harry hadn t made the lawyers mister Tulliver was on the whole a man of safe traditional opinions but on one or two points he had trusted to his unassisted intellect and had arrived at several questionable conclusions amongst the rest that rats weevils and lawyers were created by Old Harry Unhappily he had no one to tell him that this was rampant Manichaeism else he might have seen his error But to day it was clear that the good principle was triumphant this affair of the water power had been a tangled business somehow for all it seemed look at it one way as plain as water s water but big a puzzle as it was it hadn t got the better of Riley mister Tulliver took his brandy and water a little stronger than usual and for a man who might be supposed to have a few hundreds lying idle at his banker s was rather incautiously open in expressing his high estimate of his friend s business talents But the dam was a subject of conversation that would keep it could always be taken up again at the same point and exactly in the same condition and there was another subject as you know on which mister Tulliver was in pressing want of mister Riley s advice This was his particular reason for remaining silent for a short space after his last draught and rubbing his knees in a meditative manner He was not a man to make an abrupt transition This was a puzzling world as he often said and if you drive your wagon in a hurry you may light on an awkward corner mister Riley meanwhile was not impatient Why should he be Even Hotspur one would think must have been patient in his slippers on a warm hearth taking copious snuff and sipping gratuitous brandy and water There s a thing I ve got i my head said mister Tulliver at last in rather a lower tone than usual as he turned his head and looked steadfastly at his companion Ah said mister Riley in a tone of mild interest He was a man with heavy waxen eyelids and high arched eyebrows looking exactly the same under all circumstances This immovability of face and the habit of taking a pinch of snuff before he gave an answer made him trebly oracular to mister Tulliver It s a very particular thing he went on it s about my boy Tom At the sound of this name Maggie who was seated on a low stool close by the fire with a large book open on her lap shook her heavy hair back and looked up eagerly There were few sounds that roused Maggie when she was dreaming over her book but Tom s name served as well as the shrillest whistle in an instant she was on the watch with gleaming eyes like a Skye terrier suspecting mischief or at all events determined to fly at any one who threatened it toward Tom You see I want to put him to a new school at Midsummer said mister Tulliver he s comin away from the cademy at Lady day an I shall let him run loose for a quarter but after that I want to send him to a downright good school where they ll make a scholard of him Well said mister Riley there s no greater advantage you can give him than a good education Not he added with polite significance not that a man can t be an excellent miller and farmer and a shrewd sensible fellow into the bargain without much help from the schoolmaster I believe you said mister Tulliver winking and turning his head on one side but that s where it is I don t mean Tom to be a miller and farmer I see no fun i that Why if I made him a miller an farmer he d be expectin to take to the mill an the land an a hinting at me as it was time for me to lay by an think o my latter end Nay nay I ve seen enough o that wi sons I ll never pull my coat off before I go to bed I shall give Tom an eddication an put him to a business as he may make a nest for himself an not want to push me out o mine Pretty well if he gets it when I m dead an gone I sha n t be put off wi spoon meat afore I ve lost my teeth This was evidently a point on which mister Tulliver felt strongly and the impetus which had given unusual rapidity and emphasis to his speech showed itself still unexhausted for some minutes afterward in a defiant motion of the head from side to side and an occasional Nay nay like a subsiding growl These angry symptoms were keenly observed by Maggie and cut her to the quick Tom it appeared was supposed capable of turning his father out of doors and of making the future in some way tragic by his wickedness This was not to be borne and Maggie jumped up from her stool forgetting all about her heavy book which fell with a bang within the fender and going up between her father s knees said in a half crying half indignant voice Father Tom wouldn t be naughty to you ever I know he wouldn t missus Tulliver was out of the room superintending a choice supper dish and mister Tulliver s heart was touched so Maggie was not scolded about the book mister Riley quietly picked it up and looked at it while the father laughed with a certain tenderness in his hard lined face and patted his little girl on the back and then held her hands and kept her between his knees What they mustn t say any harm o Tom eh said mister Tulliver looking at Maggie with a twinkling eye Then in a lower voice turning to mister Riley as though Maggie couldn t hear She understands what one s talking about so as never was And you should hear her read straight off as if she knowed it all beforehand And allays at her book But it s bad it s bad mister Tulliver added sadly checking this blamable exultation A woman s no business wi being so clever it ll turn to trouble I doubt But bless you here the exultation was clearly recovering the mastery she ll read the books and understand em better nor half the folks as are growed up Maggie s cheeks began to flush with triumphant excitement She thought mister Riley would have a respect for her now it had been evident that he thought nothing of her before mister Riley was turning over the leaves of the book and she could make nothing of his face with its high arched eyebrows but he presently looked at her and said Come come and tell me something about this book here are some pictures I want to know what they mean Maggie with deepening color went without hesitation to mister Riley s elbow and looked over the book eagerly seizing one corner and tossing back her mane while she said Oh I ll tell you what that means It s a dreadful picture isn t it But I can t help looking at it That old woman in the water s a witch they ve put her in to find out whether she s a witch or no and if she swims she s a witch and if she s drowned and killed you know she s innocent and not a witch but only a poor silly old woman But what good would it do her then you know when she was drowned Only I suppose she d go to heaven and God would make it up to her And this dreadful blacksmith with his arms akimbo laughing oh isn t he ugly I ll tell you what he is He s the Devil really here Maggie s voice became louder and more emphatic and not a right blacksmith for the Devil takes the shape of wicked men and walks about and sets people doing wicked things and he s oftener in the shape of a bad man than any other because you know if people saw he was the Devil and he roared at em they d run away and he couldn t make em do what he pleased mister Tulliver had listened to this exposition of Maggie s with petrifying wonder Why what book is it the wench has got hold on he burst out at last The History of the Devil by Daniel Defoe not quite the right book for a little girl said mister Riley How came it among your books mister Tulliver Maggie looked hurt and discouraged while her father said Why it s one o the books I bought at Partridge s sale They was all bound alike it s a good binding you see and I thought they d be all good books There s Jeremy Taylor s Holy Living and Dying among em I read in it often of a Sunday mister Tulliver felt somehow a familiarity with that great writer because his name was Jeremy and there s a lot more of em sermons mostly I think but they ve all got the same covers and I thought they were all o one sample as you may say But it seems one mustn t judge by th outside This is a puzzlin world Well said mister Riley in an admonitory patronizing tone as he patted Maggie on the head I advise you to put by the History of the Devil and read some prettier book Have you no prettier books Oh yes said Maggie reviving a little in the desire to vindicate the variety of her reading I know the reading in this book isn t pretty but I like the pictures and I make stories to the pictures out of my own head you know But I ve got AEsop s Fables and a book about Kangaroos and things and the Pilgrim s Progress Ah a beautiful book said mister Riley you can t read a better Well but there s a great deal about the Devil in that said Maggie triumphantly and I ll show you the picture of him in his true shape as he fought with Christian Maggie ran in an instant to the corner of the room jumped on a chair and reached down from the small bookcase a shabby old copy of Bunyan which opened at once without the least trouble of search at the picture she wanted Here he is she said running back to mister Riley and Tom colored him for me with his paints when he was at home last holidays the body all black you know and the eyes red like fire because he s all fire inside and it shines out at his eyes Go go said mister Tulliver peremptorily beginning to feel rather uncomfortable at these free remarks on the personal appearance of a being powerful enough to create lawyers shut up the book and let s hear no more o such talk It is as I thought the child ull learn more mischief nor good wi the books Go go and see after your mother Maggie shut up the book at once with a sense of disgrace but not being inclined to see after her mother she compromised the matter by going into a dark corner behind her father s chair and nursing her doll toward which she had an occasional fit of fondness in Tom s absence neglecting its toilet but lavishing so many warm kisses on it that the waxen cheeks had a wasted unhealthy appearance Did you ever hear the like on t said mister Tulliver as Maggie retired It s a pity but what she d been the lad she d ha been a match for the lawyers she would It s the wonderful saint thing here he lowered his voice as I picked the mother because she wasn t o er cute bein a good looking woman too an come of a rare family for managing but I picked her from her sisters o purpose cause she was a bit weak like for I wasn t agoin to be told the rights o things by my own fireside But you see when a man s got brains himself there s no knowing where they ll run to an a pleasant sort o soft woman may go on breeding you stupid lads and cute wenches till it s like as if the world was turned topsy turvy It s an uncommon puzzlin thing mister Riley s gravity gave way and he shook a little under the application of his pinch of snuff before he said But your lad s not stupid is he I saw him when I was here last busy making fishing tackle he seemed quite up to it Well he isn t not to say stupid he s got a notion o things out o door an a sort o common sense as he d lay hold o things by the right handle But he s slow with his tongue you see and he reads but poorly and can t abide the books and spells all wrong they tell me an as shy as can be wi strangers an you never hear him say cute things like the little wench Now what I want is to send him to a school where they ll make him a bit nimble with his tongue and his pen and make a smart chap of him I want my son to be even wi these fellows as have got the start o me with having better schooling Not but what if the world had been left as God made it I could ha seen my way and held my own wi the best of em but things have got so twisted round and wrapped up i unreasonable words as aren t a bit like em as I m clean at fault often an often Everything winds about so the more straightforrad you are the more you re puzzled mister Tulliver took a draught swallowed it slowly and shook his head in a melancholy manner conscious of exemplifying the truth that a perfectly sane intellect is hardly at home in this insane world You re quite in the right of it Tulliver observed mister Riley Better spend an extra hundred or two on your son s education than leave it him in your will I know I should have tried to do so by a son of mine if I d had one though God knows I haven t your ready money to play with Tulliver and I have a houseful of daughters into the bargain I dare say now you know of a school as ud be just the thing for Tom said mister Tulliver not diverted from his purpose by any sympathy with mister Riley s deficiency of ready cash mister Riley took a pinch of snuff and kept mister Tulliver in suspense by a silence that seemed deliberative before he said I know of a very fine chance for any one that s got the necessary money and that s what you have Tulliver The fact is I wouldn t recommend any friend of mine to send a boy to a regular school if he could afford to do better But if any one wanted his boy to get superior instruction and training where he would be the companion of his master and that master a first rate fellow I know his man I wouldn t mention the chance to everybody because I don t think everybody would succeed in getting it if he were to try but I mention it to you Tulliver between ourselves The fixed inquiring glance with which mister Tulliver had been watching his friend s oracular face became quite eager Ay now let s hear he said adjusting himself in his chair with the complacency of a person who is thought worthy of important communications He s an Oxford man said mister Riley sententiously shutting his mouth close and looking at mister Tulliver to observe the effect of this stimulating information What a parson said mister Tulliver rather doubtfully Yes and an M A The bishop I understand thinks very highly of him why it was the bishop who got him his present curacy Ah said mister Tulliver to whom one thing was as wonderful as another concerning these unfamiliar phenomena But what can he want wi Tom then Why the fact is he s fond of teaching and wishes to keep up his studies and a clergyman has but little opportunity for that in his parochial duties He s willing to take one or two boys as pupils to fill up his time profitably The boys would be quite of the family the finest thing in the world for them under Stelling s eye continually But do you think they d give the poor lad twice o pudding said missus Tulliver who was now in her place again He s such a boy for pudding as never was an a growing boy like that it s dreadful to think o their stintin him And what money ud he want said mister Tulliver whose instinct told him that the services of this admirable M A would bear a high price Why I know of a clergyman who asks a hundred and fifty with his youngest pupils and he s not to be mentioned with Stelling the man I speak of I know on good authority that one of the chief people at Oxford said Stelling might get the highest honors if he chose But he didn t care about university honors he s a quiet man not noisy Ah a deal better a deal better said mister Tulliver but a hundred and fifty s an uncommon price I never thought o paying so much as that A good education let me tell you Tulliver a good education is cheap at the money But Stelling is moderate in his terms he s not a grasping man I ve no doubt he d take your boy at a hundred and that s what you wouldn t get many other clergymen to do I ll write to him about it if you like mister Tulliver rubbed his knees and looked at the carpet in a meditative manner But belike he s a bachelor observed missus Tulliver in the interval an I ve no opinion o housekeepers There was my brother as is dead an gone had a housekeeper once an she took half the feathers out o the best bed an packed em up an sent em away An it s unknown the linen she made away with Stott her name was It ud break my heart to send Tom where there s a housekeeper an I hope you won t think of it mister Tulliver You may set your mind at rest on that score missus Tulliver said mister Riley for Stelling is married to as nice a little woman as any man need wish for a wife There isn t a kinder little soul in the world I know her family well She has very much your complexion light curly hair She comes of a good Mudport family and it s not every offer that would have been acceptable in that quarter But Stelling s not an every day man rather a particular fellow as to the people he chooses to be connected with But I think he would have no objection to take your son I think he would not on my representation I don t know what he could have against the lad said missus Tulliver with a slight touch of motherly indignation a nice fresh skinned lad as anybody need wish to see But there s one thing I m thinking on said mister Tulliver turning his head on one side and looking at mister Riley after a long perusal of the carpet Wouldn t a parson be almost too high learnt to bring up a lad to be a man o business My notion o the parsons was as they d got a sort o learning as lay mostly out o sight And that isn t what I want for Tom I want him to know figures and write like print and see into things quick and know what folks mean and how to wrap things up in words as aren t actionable It s an uncommon fine thing that is concluded mister Tulliver shaking his head when you can let a man know what you think of him without paying for it Oh my dear Tulliver said mister Riley you re quite under a mistake about the clergy all the best schoolmasters are of the clergy The schoolmasters who are not clergymen are a very low set of men generally Ay that Jacobs is at the cademy interposed mister Tulliver To be sure men who have failed in other trades most likely Now a clergyman is a gentleman by profession and education and besides that he has the knowledge that will ground a boy and prepare him for entering on any career with credit There may be some clergymen who are mere bookmen but you may depend upon it Stelling is not one of them a man that s wide awake let me tell you Drop him a hint and that s enough You talk of figures now you have only to say to Stelling I want my son to be a thorough arithmetician and you may leave the rest to him mister Riley paused a moment while mister Tulliver some what reassured as to clerical tutorship was inwardly rehearsing to an imaginary mister Stelling the statement I want my son to know rethmetic You see my dear Tulliver mister Riley continued when you get a thoroughly educated man like Stelling he s at no loss to take up any branch of instruction When a workman knows the use of his tools he can make a door as well as a window Ay that s true said mister Tulliver almost convinced now that the clergy must be the best of schoolmasters Well I ll tell you what I ll do for you said mister Riley and I wouldn t do it for everybody I ll see Stelling s father in law or drop him a line when I get back to Mudport to say that you wish to place your boy with his son in law and I dare say Stelling will write to you and send you his terms But there s no hurry is there said missus Tulliver for I hope mister Tulliver you won t let Tom begin at his new school before Midsummer He began at the cademy at the Lady day quarter and you see what good s come of it Ay ay Bessy never brew wi bad malt upo Michael masday else you ll have a poor tap said mister Tulliver winking and smiling at mister Riley with the natural pride of a man who has a buxom wife conspicuously his inferior in intellect But it s true there s no hurry you ve hit it there Bessy It might be as well not to defer the arrangement too long said mister Riley quietly for Stelling may have propositions from other parties and I know he would not take more than two or three boarders if so many If I were you I think I would enter on the subject with Stelling at once there s no necessity for sending the boy before Midsummer but I would be on the safe side and make sure that nobody forestalls you Ay there s summat in that said mister Tulliver Father broke in Maggie who had stolen unperceived to her father s elbow again listening with parted lips while she held her doll topsy turvy and crushed its nose against the wood of the chair father is it a long way off where Tom is to go Sha n t we ever go to see him I don t know my wench said the father tenderly Ask mister Riley he knows Maggie came round promptly in front of mister Riley and said How far is it please sir Oh a long long way off that gentleman answered being of opinion that children when they are not naughty should always be spoken to jocosely You must borrow the seven leagued boots to get to him That s nonsense said Maggie tossing her head haughtily and turning away with the tears springing in her eyes She began to dislike mister Riley it was evident he thought her silly and of no consequence Hush Maggie for shame of you asking questions and chattering said her mother Come and sit down on your little stool and hold your tongue do But added missus Tulliver who had her own alarm awakened is it so far off as I couldn t wash him and mend him About fifteen miles that s all said mister Riley You can drive there and back in a day quite comfortably Or Stelling is a hospitable pleasant man he d be glad to have you stay But it s too far off for the linen I doubt said missus Tulliver sadly The entrance of supper opportunely adjourned this difficulty and relieved mister Riley from the labor of suggesting some solution or compromise a labor which he would otherwise doubtless have undertaken for as you perceive he was a man of very obliging manners And he had really given himself the trouble of recommending mister Stelling to his friend Tulliver without any positive expectation of a solid definite advantage resulting to himself notwithstanding the subtle indications to the contrary which might have misled a too sagacious observer For there is nothing more widely misleading than sagacity if it happens to get on a wrong scent and sagacity persuaded that men usually act and speak from distinct motives with a consciously proposed end in view is certain to waste its energies on imaginary game Plotting covetousness and deliberate contrivance in order to compass a selfish end are nowhere abundant but in the world of the dramatist they demand too intense a mental action for many of our fellow parishioners to be guilty of them It is easy enough to spoil the lives of our neighbors without taking so much trouble we can do it by lazy acquiescence and lazy omission by trivial falsities for which we hardly know a reason by small frauds neutralized by small extravagances by maladroit flatteries and clumsily improvised insinuations We live from hand to mouth most of us with a small family of immediate desires we do little else than snatch a morsel to satisfy the hungry brood rarely thinking of seed corn or the next year s crop mister Riley was a man of business and not cold toward his own interest yet even he was more under the influence of small promptings than of far sighted designs He had no private understanding with the reverend Walter Stelling on the contrary he knew very little of that M A and his acquirements not quite enough perhaps to warrant so strong a recommendation of him as he had given to his friend Tulliver But he believed mister Stelling to be an excellent classic for Gadsby had said so and Gadsby s first cousin was an Oxford tutor which was better ground for the belief even than his own immediate observation would have been for though mister Riley had received a tincture of the classics at the great Mudport Free School and had a sense of understanding Latin generally his comprehension of any particular Latin was not ready Doubtless there remained a subtle aroma from his juvenile contact with the De Senectute and the fourth book of the AEneid but it had ceased to be distinctly recognizable as classical and was only perceived in the higher finish and force of his auctioneering style Then Stelling was an Oxford man and the Oxford men were always no no it was the Cambridge men who were always good mathematicians But a man who had had a university education could teach anything he liked especially a man like Stelling who had made a speech at a Mudport dinner on a political occasion and had acquitted himself so well that it was generally remarked this son in law of Timpson s was a sharp fellow It was to be expected of a Mudport man from the parish of saint Ursula that he would not omit to do a good turn to a son in law of Timpson s for Timpson was one of the most useful and influential men in the parish and had a good deal of business which he knew how to put into the right hands mister Riley liked such men quite apart from any money which might be diverted through their good judgment from less worthy pockets into his own and it would be a satisfaction to him to say to Timpson on his return home I ve secured a good pupil for your son in law Timpson had a large family of daughters mister Riley felt for him besides Louisa Timpson s face with its light curls had been a familiar object to him over the pew wainscot on a Sunday for nearly fifteen years it was natural her husband should be a commendable tutor Moreover mister Riley knew of no other schoolmaster whom he had any ground for recommending in preference why then should he not recommend Stelling His friend Tulliver had asked him for an opinion it is always chilling in friendly intercourse to say you have no opinion to give And if you deliver an opinion at all it is mere stupidity not to do it with an air of conviction and well founded knowledge You make it your own in uttering it and naturally get fond of it Thus mister Riley knowing no harm of Stelling to begin with and wishing him well so far as he had any wishes at all concerning him had no sooner recommended him than he began to think with admiration of a man recommended on such high authority and would soon have gathered so warm an interest on the subject that if mister Tulliver had in the end declined to send Tom to Stelling mister Riley would have thought his friend of the old school a thoroughly pig headed fellow If you blame mister Riley very severely for giving a recommendation on such slight grounds I must say you are rather hard upon him Why should an auctioneer and appraiser thirty years ago who had as good as forgotten his free school Latin be expected to manifest a delicate scrupulosity which is not always exhibited by gentlemen of the learned professions even in our present advanced stage of morality Besides a man with the milk of human kindness in him can scarcely abstain from doing a good natured action and one cannot be good natured all round Nature herself occasionally quarters an inconvenient parasite on an animal toward whom she has otherwise no ill will What then We admire her care for the parasite If mister Riley had shrunk from giving a recommendation that was not based on valid evidence he would not have helped mister Stelling to a paying pupil and that would not have been so well for the reverend gentleman Consider too that all the pleasant little dim ideas and complacencies of standing well with Timpson of dispensing advice when he was asked for it of impressing his friend Tulliver with additional respect of saying something and saying it emphatically with other inappreciably minute ingredients that went along with the warm hearth and the brandy and water to make up mister Riley s consciousness on this occasion would have been a mere blank Chapter IV Tom Is Expected It was a heavy disappointment to Maggie that she was not allowed to go with her father in the gig when he went to fetch Tom home from the academy but the morning was too wet missus Tulliver said for a little girl to go out in her best bonnet Maggie took the opposite view very strongly and it was a direct consequence of this difference of opinion that when her mother was in the act of brushing out the reluctant black crop Maggie suddenly rushed from under her hands and dipped her head in a basin of water standing near in the vindictive determination that there should be no more chance of curls that day Maggie Maggie exclaimed missus Tulliver sitting stout and helpless with the brushes on her lap what is to become of you if you re so naughty I ll tell your aunt Glegg and your aunt Pullet when they come next week and they ll never love you any more Oh dear oh dear look at your clean pinafore wet from top to bottom Folks ull think it s a judgment on me as I ve got such a child they ll think I ve done summat wicked Before this remonstrance was finished Maggie was already out of hearing making her way toward the great attic that run under the old high pitched roof shaking the water from her black locks as she ran like a Skye terrier escaped from his bath This attic was Maggie s favorite retreat on a wet day when the weather was not too cold here she fretted out all her ill humors and talked aloud to the worm eaten floors and the worm eaten shelves and the dark rafters festooned with cobwebs and here she kept a Fetish which she punished for all her misfortunes This was the trunk of a large wooden doll which once stared with the roundest of eyes above the reddest of cheeks but was now entirely defaced by a long career of vicarious suffering Three nails driven into the head commemorated as many crises in Maggie s nine years of earthly struggle that luxury of vengeance having been suggested to her by the picture of Jael destroying Sisera in the old Bible The last nail had been driven in with a fiercer stroke than usual for the Fetish on that occasion represented aunt Glegg But immediately afterward Maggie had reflected that if she drove many nails in she would not be so well able to fancy that the head was hurt when she knocked it against the wall nor to comfort it and make believe to poultice it when her fury was abated for even aunt Glegg would be pitiable when she had been hurt very much and thoroughly humiliated so as to beg her niece s pardon Since then she had driven no more nails in but had soothed herself by alternately grinding and beating the wooden head against the rough brick of the great chimneys that made two square pillars supporting the roof That was what she did this morning on reaching the attic sobbing all the while with a passion that expelled every other form of consciousness even the memory of the grievance that had caused it As at last the sobs were getting quieter and the grinding less fierce a sudden beam of sunshine falling through the wire lattice across the worm eaten shelves made her throw away the Fetish and run to the window The sun was really breaking out the sound of the mill seemed cheerful again the granary doors were open and there was Yap the queer white and brown terrier with one ear turned back trotting about and sniffing vaguely as if he were in search of a companion It was irresistible Maggie tossed her hair back and ran downstairs seized her bonnet without putting it on peeped and then dashed along the passage lest she should encounter her mother and was quickly out in the yard whirling round like a Pythoness and singing as she whirled Yap Yap Tom s coming home while Yap danced and barked round her as much as to say if there was any noise wanted he was the dog for it Hegh hegh Miss you ll make yourself giddy an tumble down i the dirt said Luke the head miller a tall broad shouldered man of forty black eyed and black haired subdued by a general mealiness like an auricula Maggie paused in her whirling and said staggering a little Oh no it doesn t make me giddy Luke may I go into the mill with you Maggie loved to linger in the great spaces of the mill and often came out with her black hair powdered to a soft whiteness that made her dark eyes flash out with new fire The resolute din the unresting motion of the great stones giving her a dim delicious awe as at the presence of an uncontrollable force the meal forever pouring pouring the fine white powder softening all surfaces and making the very spidernets look like a faery lace work the sweet pure scent of the meal all helped to make Maggie feel that the mill was a little world apart from her outside every day life The spiders were especially a subject of speculation with her She wondered if they had any relatives outside the mill for in that case there must be a painful difficulty in their family intercourse a fat and floury spider accustomed to take his fly well dusted with meal must suffer a little at a cousin s table where the fly was au naturel and the lady spiders must be mutually shocked at each other s appearance But the part of the mill she liked best was the topmost story the corn hutch where there were the great heaps of grain which she could sit on and slide down continually She was in the habit of taking this recreation as she conversed with Luke to whom she was very communicative wishing him to think well of her understanding as her father did Perhaps she felt it necessary to recover her position with him on the present occasion for as she sat sliding on the heap of grain near which he was busying himself she said at that shrill pitch which was requisite in mill society I think you never read any book but the Bible did you Luke Nay Miss an not much o that said Luke with great frankness I m no reader I aren t But if I lent you one of my books Luke I ve not got any very pretty books that would be easy for you to read but there s Pug s Tour of Europe that would tell you all about the different sorts of people in the world and if you didn t understand the reading the pictures would help you they show the looks and ways of the people and what they do There are the Dutchmen very fat and smoking you know and one sitting on a barrel Nay Miss I n no opinion o Dutchmen There ben t much good i knowin about them But they re our fellow creatures Luke we ought to know about our fellow creatures Not much o fellow creaturs I think Miss all I know my old master as war a knowin man used to say says he If e er I sow my wheat wi out brinin I m a Dutchman says he an that war as much as to say as a Dutchman war a fool or next door Nay nay I aren t goin to bother mysen about Dutchmen There s fools enoo an rogues enoo wi out lookin i books for em Oh well said Maggie rather foiled by Luke s unexpectedly decided views about Dutchmen perhaps you would like Animated Nature better that s not Dutchmen you know but elephants and kangaroos and the civet cat and the sunfish and a bird sitting on its tail I forget its name There are countries full of those creatures instead of horses and cows you know Shouldn t you like to know about them Luke Nay Miss I n got to keep count o the flour an corn I can t do wi knowin so many things besides my work That s what brings folks to the gallows knowin everything but what they n got to get their bread by An they re mostly lies I think what s printed i the books them printed sheets are anyhow as the men cry i the streets Why you re like my brother Tom Luke said Maggie wishing to turn the conversation agreeably Tom s not fond of reading I love Tom so dearly Luke better than anybody else in the world When he grows up I shall keep his house and we shall always live together I can tell him everything he doesn t know But I think Tom s clever for all he doesn t like books he makes beautiful whipcord and rabbit pens Ah said Luke but he ll be fine an vexed as the rabbits are all dead Dead screamed Maggie jumping up from her sliding seat on the corn Oh dear Luke What the lop eared one and the spotted doe that Tom spent all his money to buy As dead as moles said Luke fetching his comparison from the unmistakable corpses nailed to the stable wall Oh dear Luke said Maggie in a piteous tone while the big tears rolled down her cheek Tom told me to take care of em and I forgot What shall I do Well you see Miss they were in that far tool house an it was nobody s business to see to em I reckon Master Tom told Harry to feed em but there s no countin on Harry he s an offal creatur as iver come about the primises he is He remembers nothing but his own inside an I wish it ud gripe him Oh Luke Tom told me to be sure and remember the rabbits every day but how could I when they didn t come into my head you know Oh he will be so angry with me I know he will and so sorry about his rabbits and so am I sorry Oh what shall I do Don t you fret Miss said Luke soothingly they re nash things them lop eared rabbits they d happen ha died if they d been fed Things out o natur niver thrive God A mighty doesn t like em He made the rabbits ears to lie back an it s nothin but contrairiness to make em hing down like a mastiff dog s Master Tom ull know better nor buy such things another time Don t you fret Miss Will you come along home wi me and see my wife I m a goin this minute The invitation offered an agreeable distraction to Maggie s grief and her tears gradually subsided as she trotted along by Luke s side to his pleasant cottage which stood with its apple and pear trees and with the added dignity of a lean to pigsty at the other end of the Mill fields missus Moggs Luke s wife was a decidedly agreeable acquaintance She exhibited her hospitality in bread and treacle and possessed various works of art Maggie actually forgot that she had any special cause of sadness this morning as she stood on a chair to look at a remarkable series of pictures representing the Prodigal Son in the costume of Sir Charles Grandison except that as might have been expected from his defective moral character he had not like that accomplished hero the taste and strength of mind to dispense with a wig But the indefinable weight the dead rabbits had left on her mind caused her to feel more than usual pity for the career of this weak young man particularly when she looked at the picture where he leaned against a tree with a flaccid appearance his knee breeches unbuttoned and his wig awry while the swine apparently of some foreign breed seemed to insult him by their good spirits over their feast of husks I m very glad his father took him back again aren t you Luke she said For he was very sorry you know and wouldn t do wrong again Eh Miss said Luke he d be no great shakes I doubt let s feyther do what he would for him That was a painful thought to Maggie and she wished much that the subsequent history of the young man had not been left a blank Chapter V Tom Comes Home Tom was to arrive early in the afternoon and there was another fluttering heart besides Maggie s when it was late enough for the sound of the gig wheels to be expected for if missus Tulliver had a strong feeling it was fondness for her boy At last the sound came that quick light bowling of the gig wheels and in spite of the wind which was blowing the clouds about and was not likely to respect missus Tulliver s curls and cap strings she came outside the door and even held her hand on Maggie s offending head forgetting all the griefs of the morning There he is my sweet lad But Lord ha mercy he s got never a collar on it s been lost on the road I ll be bound and spoilt the set missus Tulliver stood with her arms open Maggie jumped first on one leg and then on the other while Tom descended from the gig and said with masculine reticence as to the tender emotions Hallo Yap what are you there Nevertheless he submitted to be kissed willingly enough though Maggie hung on his neck in rather a strangling fashion while his blue gray eyes wandered toward the croft and the lambs and the river where he promised himself that he would begin to fish the first thing to morrow morning He was one of those lads that grow everywhere in England and at twelve or thirteen years of age look as much alike as goslings a lad with light brown hair cheeks of cream and roses full lips indeterminate nose and eyebrows a physiognomy in which it seems impossible to discern anything but the generic character to boyhood as different as possible from poor Maggie s phiz which Nature seemed to have moulded and colored with the most decided intention But that same Nature has the deep cunning which hides itself under the appearance of openness so that simple people think they can see through her quite well and all the while she is secretly preparing a refutation of their confident prophecies Under these average boyish physiognomies that she seems to turn off by the gross she conceals some of her most rigid inflexible purposes some of her most unmodifiable characters and the dark eyed demonstrative rebellious girl may after all turn out to be a passive being compared with this pink and white bit of masculinity with the indeterminate features Maggie said Tom confidentially taking her into a corner as soon as his mother was gone out to examine his box and the warm parlor had taken off the chill he had felt from the long drive you don t know what I ve got in my pockets nodding his head up and down as a means of rousing her sense of mystery No said Maggie How stodgy they look Tom Is it marls marbles or cobnuts Maggie s heart sank a little because Tom always said it was no good playing with her at those games she played so badly Marls no I ve swopped all my marls with the little fellows and cobnuts are no fun you silly only when the nuts are green But see here He drew something half out of his right hand pocket What is it said Maggie in a whisper I can see nothing but a bit of yellow Why it s a new guess Maggie Oh I can t guess Tom said Maggie impatiently Don t be a spitfire else I won t tell you said Tom thrusting his hand back into his pocket and looking determined No Tom said Maggie imploringly laying hold of the arm that was held stiffly in the pocket I m not cross Tom it was only because I can t bear guessing Please be good to me Tom s arm slowly relaxed and he said Well then it s a new fish line two new uns one for you Maggie all to yourself I wouldn t go halves in the toffee and gingerbread on purpose to save the money and Gibson and Spouncer fought with me because I wouldn t And here s hooks see here I say won t we go and fish to morrow down by the Round Pool And you shall catch your own fish Maggie and put the worms on and everything won t it be fun Maggie s answer was to throw her arms round Tom s neck and hug him and hold her cheek against his without speaking while he slowly unwound some of the line saying after a pause Wasn t I a good brother now to buy you a line all to yourself You know I needn t have bought it if I hadn t liked Yes very very good I do love you Tom Tom had put the line back in his pocket and was looking at the hooks one by one before he spoke again And the fellows fought me because I wouldn t give in about the toffee Oh dear I wish they wouldn t fight at your school Tom Didn t it hurt you Hurt me no said Tom putting up the hooks again taking out a large pocket knife and slowly opening the largest blade which he looked at meditatively as he rubbed his finger along it Then he added I gave Spouncer a black eye I know that s what he got by wanting to leather me I wasn t going to go halves because anybody leathered me Oh how brave you are Tom I think you re like Samson If there came a lion roaring at me I think you d fight him wouldn t you Tom How can a lion come roaring at you you silly thing There s no lions only in the shows No but if we were in the lion countries I mean in Africa where it s very hot the lions eat people there I can show it you in the book where I read it Well I should get a gun and shoot him But if you hadn t got a gun we might have gone out you know not thinking just as we go fishing and then a great lion might run toward us roaring and we couldn t get away from him What should you do Tom Tom paused and at last turned away contemptuously saying But the lion isn t coming What s the use of talking But I like to fancy how it would be said Maggie following him Just think what you would do Tom Oh don t bother Maggie you re such a silly I shall go and see my rabbits Maggie s heart began to flutter with fear She dared not tell the sad truth at once but she walked after Tom in trembling silence as he went out thinking how she could tell him the news so as to soften at once his sorrow and his anger for Maggie dreaded Tom s anger of all things it was quite a different anger from her own Tom she said timidly when they were out of doors how much money did you give for your rabbits Two half crowns and a sixpence said Tom promptly I think I ve got a great deal more than that in my steel purse upstairs I ll ask mother to give it you What for said Tom I don t want your money you silly thing I ve got a great deal more money than you because I m a boy I always have half sovereigns and sovereigns for my Christmas boxes because I shall be a man and you only have five shilling pieces because you re only a girl Well but Tom if mother would let me give you two half crowns and a sixpence out of my purse to put into your pocket and spend you know and buy some more rabbits with it More rabbits I don t want any more Oh but Tom they re all dead Tom stopped immediately in his walk and turned round toward Maggie You forgot to feed em then and Harry forgot he said his color heightening for a moment but soon subsiding I ll pitch into Harry I ll have him turned away And I don t love you Maggie You sha n t go fishing with me to morrow I told you to go and see the rabbits every day He walked on again Yes but I forgot and I couldn t help it indeed Tom I m so very sorry said Maggie while the tears rushed fast You re a naughty girl said Tom severely and I m sorry I bought you the fish line I don t love you Oh Tom it s very cruel sobbed Maggie I d forgive you if you forgot anything I wouldn t mind what you did I d forgive you and love you Yes you re silly but I never do forget things I don t Oh please forgive me Tom my heart will break said Maggie shaking with sobs clinging to Tom s arm and laying her wet cheek on his shoulder Tom shook her off and stopped again saying in a peremptory tone Now Maggie you just listen Aren t I a good brother to you Ye ye es sobbed Maggie her chin rising and falling convulsedly Didn t I think about your fish line all this quarter and mean to buy it and saved my money o purpose and wouldn t go halves in the toffee and Spouncer fought me because I wouldn t Ye ye es and I lo lo love you so Tom But you re a naughty girl Last holidays you licked the paint off my lozenge box and the holidays before that you let the boat drag my fish line down when I d set you to watch it and you pushed your head through my kite all for nothing But I didn t mean said Maggie I couldn t help it Yes you could said Tom if you d minded what you were doing And you re a naughty girl and you sha n t go fishing with me to morrow With this terrible conclusion Tom ran away from Maggie toward the mill meaning to greet Luke there and complain to him of Harry Maggie stood motionless except from her sobs for a minute or two then she turned round and ran into the house and up to her attic where she sat on the floor and laid her head against the worm eaten shelf with a crushing sense of misery Tom was come home and she had thought how happy she should be and now he was cruel to her What use was anything if Tom didn t love her Oh he was very cruel Hadn t she wanted to give him the money and said how very sorry she was She knew she was naughty to her mother but she had never been naughty to Tom had never meant to be naughty to him Oh he is cruel Maggie sobbed aloud finding a wretched pleasure in the hollow resonance that came through the long empty space of the attic She never thought of beating or grinding her Fetish she was too miserable to be angry These bitter sorrows of childhood when sorrow is all new and strange when hope has not yet got wings to fly beyond the days and weeks and the space from summer to summer seems measureless Maggie soon thought she had been hours in the attic and it must be tea time and they were all having their tea and not thinking of her Well then she would stay up there and starve herself hide herself behind the tub and stay there all night and then they would all be frightened and Tom would be sorry Thus Maggie thought in the pride of her heart as she crept behind the tub but presently she began to cry again at the idea that they didn t mind her being there If she went down again to Tom now would he forgive her Perhaps her father would be there and he would take her part But then she wanted Tom to forgive her because he loved her not because his father told him No she would never go down if Tom didn t come to fetch her This resolution lasted in great intensity for five dark minutes behind the tub but then the need of being loved the strongest need in poor Maggie s nature began to wrestle with her pride and soon threw it She crept from behind her tub into the twilight of the long attic but just then she heard a quick foot step on the stairs Tom had been too much interested in his talk with Luke in going the round of the premises walking in and out where he pleased and whittling sticks without any particular reason except that he didn t whittle sticks at school to think of Maggie and the effect his anger had produced on her He meant to punish her and that business having been performed he occupied himself with other matters like a practical person But when he had been called in to tea his father said Why where s the little wench and missus Tulliver almost at the same moment said Where s your little sister both of them having supposed that Maggie and Tom had been together all the afternoon I don t know said Tom He didn t want to tell of Maggie though he was angry with her for Tom Tulliver was a lad of honor What hasn t she been playing with you all this while said the father She d been thinking o nothing but your coming home I haven t seen her this two hours says Tom commencing on the plumcake Goodness heart she s got drownded exclaimed missus Tulliver rising from her seat and running to the window How could you let her do so she added as became a fearful woman accusing she didn t know whom of she didn t know what Nay nay she s none drownded said mister Tulliver You ve been naughty to her I doubt Tom I m sure I haven t father said Tom indignantly I think she s in the house Perhaps up in that attic said missus Tulliver a singing and talking to herself and forgetting all about meal times You go and fetch her down Tom said mister Tulliver rather sharply his perspicacity or his fatherly fondness for Maggie making him suspect that the lad had been hard upon the little un else she would never have left his side And be good to her do you hear Else I ll let you know better Tom never disobeyed his father for mister Tulliver was a peremptory man and as he said would never let anybody get hold of his whip hand but he went out rather sullenly carrying his piece of plumcake and not intending to reprieve Maggie s punishment which was no more than she deserved Tom was only thirteen and had no decided views in grammar and arithmetic regarding them for the most part as open questions but he was particularly clear and positive on one point namely that he would punish everybody who deserved it Why he wouldn t have minded being punished himself if he deserved it but then he never did deserve it It was Tom s step then that Maggie heard on the stairs when her need of love had triumphed over her pride and she was going down with her swollen eyes and dishevelled hair to beg for pity At least her father would stroke her head and say Never mind my wench It is a wonderful subduer this need of love this hunger of the heart as peremptory as that other hunger by which Nature forces us to submit to the yoke and change the face of the world But she knew Tom s step and her heart began to beat violently with the sudden shock of hope He only stood still at the top of the stairs and said Maggie you re to come down But she rushed to him and clung round his neck sobbing Oh Tom please forgive me I can t bear it I will always be good always remember things do love me please dear Tom We learn to restrain ourselves as we get older We keep apart when we have quarrelled express ourselves in well bred phrases and in this way preserve a dignified alienation showing much firmness on one side and swallowing much grief on the other We no longer approximate in our behavior to the mere impulsiveness of the lower animals but conduct ourselves in every respect like members of a highly civilized society Maggie and Tom were still very much like young animals and so she could rub her cheek against his and kiss his ear in a random sobbing way and there were tender fibres in the lad that had been used to answer to Maggie s fondling so that he behaved with a weakness quite inconsistent with his resolution to punish her as much as she deserved He actually began to kiss her in return and say Don t cry then Magsie here eat a bit o cake Maggie s sobs began to subside and she put out her mouth for the cake and bit a piece and then Tom bit a piece just for company and they ate together and rubbed each other s cheeks and brows and noses together while they ate with a humiliating resemblance to two friendly ponies Come along Magsie and have tea said Tom at last when there was no more cake except what was down stairs So ended the sorrows of this day and the next morning Maggie was trotting with her own fishing rod in one hand and a handle of the basket in the other stepping always by a peculiar gift in the muddiest places and looking darkly radiant from under her beaver bonnet because Tom was good to her She had told Tom however that she should like him to put the worms on the hook for her although she accepted his word when he assured her that worms couldn t feel it was Tom s private opinion that it didn t much matter if they did He knew all about worms and fish and those things and what birds were mischievous and how padlocks opened and which way the handles of the gates were to be lifted Maggie thought this sort of knowledge was very wonderful much more difficult than remembering what was in the books and she was rather in awe of Tom s superiority for he was the only person who called her knowledge stuff and did not feel surprised at her cleverness Tom indeed was of opinion that Maggie was a silly little thing all girls were silly they couldn t throw a stone so as to hit anything couldn t do anything with a pocket knife and were frightened at frogs Still he was very fond of his sister and meant always to take care of her make her his housekeeper and punish her when she did wrong They were on their way to the Round Pool that wonderful pool which the floods had made a long while ago No one knew how deep it was and it was mysterious too that it should be almost a perfect round framed in with willows and tall reeds so that the water was only to be seen when you got close to the brink The sight of the old favorite spot always heightened Tom s good humor and he spoke to Maggie in the most amicable whispers as he opened the precious basket and prepared their tackle He threw her line for her and put the rod into her hand Maggie thought it probable that the small fish would come to her hook and the large ones to Tom s But she had forgotten all about the fish and was looking dreamily at the glassy water when Tom said in a loud whisper Look look Maggie and came running to prevent her from snatching her line away Maggie was frightened lest she had been doing something wrong as usual but presently Tom drew out her line and brought a large tench bouncing on the grass Tom was excited O Magsie you little duck Empty the basket Maggie was not conscious of unusual merit but it was enough that Tom called her Magsie and was pleased with her There was nothing to mar her delight in the whispers and the dreamy silences when she listened to the light dripping sounds of the rising fish and the gentle rustling as if the willows and the reeds and the water had their happy whisperings also Maggie thought it would make a very nice heaven to sit by the pool in that way and never be scolded She never knew she had a bite till Tom told her but she liked fishing very much It was one of their happy mornings They trotted along and sat down together with no thought that life would ever change much for them they would only get bigger and not go to school and it would always be like the holidays they would always live together and be fond of each other And the mill with its booming the great chestnut tree under which they played at houses their own little river the Ripple where the banks seemed like home and Tom was always seeing the water rats while Maggie gathered the purple plumy tops of the reeds which she forgot and dropped afterward above all the great Floss along which they wandered with a sense of travel to see the rushing spring tide the awful Eagle come up like a hungry monster or to see the Great Ash which had once wailed and groaned like a man these things would always be just the same to them Tom thought people were at a disadvantage who lived on any other spot of the globe and Maggie when she read about Christiana passing the river over which there is no bridge always saw the Floss between the green pastures by the Great Ash Life did change for Tom and Maggie and yet they were not wrong in believing that the thoughts and loves of these first years would always make part of their lives We could never have loved the earth so well if we had had no childhood in it if it were not the earth where the same flowers come up again every spring that we used to gather with our tiny fingers as we sat lisping to ourselves on the grass the same hips and haws on the autumn s hedgerows the same redbreasts that we used to call God s birds because they did no harm to the precious crops What novelty is worth that sweet monotony where everything is known and loved because it is known The wood I walk in on this mild May day with the young yellow brown foliage of the oaks between me and the blue sky the white star flowers and the blue eyed speedwell and the ground ivy at my feet what grove of tropic palms what strange ferns or splendid broad petalled blossoms could ever thrill such deep and delicate fibres within me as this home scene These familiar flowers these well remembered bird notes this sky with its fitful brightness these furrowed and grassy fields each with a sort of personality given to it by the capricious hedgerows such things as these are the mother tongue of our imagination the language that is laden with all the subtle inextricable associations the fleeting hours of our childhood left behind them Our delight in the sunshine on the deep bladed grass to day might be no more than the faint perception of wearied souls if it were not for the sunshine and the grass in the far off years which still live in us and transform our perception into love Chapter VI The Aunts and Uncles Are Coming It was Easter week and missus Tulliver s cheesecakes were more exquisitely light than usual A puff o wind ud make em blow about like feathers Kezia the housemaid said feeling proud to live under a mistress who could make such pastry so that no season or circumstances could have been more propitious for a family party even if it had not been advisable to consult sister Glegg and sister Pullet about Tom s going to school I d as lief not invite sister Deane this time said missus Tulliver for she s as jealous and having as can be and s allays trying to make the worst o my poor children to their aunts and uncles Yes yes said mister Tulliver ask her to come I never hardly get a bit o talk with Deane now we haven t had him this six months What s it matter what she says My children need be beholding to nobody That s what you allays say mister Tulliver but I m sure there s nobody o your side neither aunt nor uncle to leave em so much as a five pound note for a leggicy And there s sister Glegg and sister Pullet too saving money unknown for they put by all their own interest and butter money too their husbands buy em everything missus Tulliver was a mild woman but even a sheep will face about a little when she has lambs Tchuh said mister Tulliver It takes a big loaf when there s many to breakfast What signifies your sisters bits o money when they ve got half a dozen nevvies and nieces to divide it among And your sister Deane won t get em to leave all to one I reckon and make the country cry shame on em when they are dead I don t know what she won t get em to do said missus Tulliver for my children are so awk ard wi their aunts and uncles Maggie s ten times naughtier when they come than she is other days and Tom doesn t like em bless him though it s more nat ral in a boy than a gell And there s Lucy Dean s such a good child you may set her on a stool and there she ll sit for an hour together and never offer to get off I can t help loving the child as if she was my own and I m sure she s more like my child than sister Deane s for she d allays a very poor color for one of our family sister Deane had Well well if you re fond o the child ask her father and mother to bring her with em And won t you ask their aunt and uncle Moss too and some o their children Oh dear mister Tulliver why there d be eight people besides the children and I must put two more leaves i the table besides reaching down more o the dinner service and you know as well as I do as my sisters and your sister don t suit well together Well well do as you like Bessy said mister Tulliver taking up his hat and walking out to the mill Few wives were more submissive than missus Tulliver on all points unconnected with her family relations but she had been a Miss Dodson and the Dodsons were a very respectable family indeed as much looked up to as any in their own parish or the next to it The Miss Dodsons had always been thought to hold up their heads very high and no one was surprised the two eldest had married so well not at an early age for that was not the practice of the Dodson family There were particular ways of doing everything in that family particular ways of bleaching the linen of making the cowslip wine curing the hams and keeping the bottled gooseberries so that no daughter of that house could be indifferent to the privilege of having been born a Dodson rather than a Gibson or a Watson Funerals were always conducted with peculiar propriety in the Dodson family the hat bands were never of a blue shade the gloves never split at the thumb everybody was a mourner who ought to be and there were always scarfs for the bearers When one of the family was in trouble or sickness all the rest went to visit the unfortunate member usually at the same time and did not shrink from uttering the most disagreeable truths that correct family feeling dictated if the illness or trouble was the sufferer s own fault it was not in the practice of the Dodson family to shrink from saying so In short there was in this family a peculiar tradition as to what was the right thing in household management and social demeanor and the only bitter circumstance attending this superiority was a painful inability to approve the condiments or the conduct of families ungoverned by the Dodson tradition A female Dodson when in strange houses always ate dry bread with her tea and declined any sort of preserves having no confidence in the butter and thinking that the preserves had probably begun to ferment from want of due sugar and boiling There were some Dodsons less like the family than others that was admitted but in so far as they were kin they were of necessity better than those who were no kin And it is remarkable that while no individual Dodson was satisfied with any other individual Dodson each was satisfied not only with him or her self but with the Dodsons collectively The feeblest member of a family the one who has the least character is often the merest epitome of the family habits and traditions and missus Tulliver was a thorough Dodson though a mild one as small beer so long as it is anything is only describable as very weak ale and though she had groaned a little in her youth under the yoke of her elder sisters and still shed occasional tears at their sisterly reproaches it was not in missus Tulliver to be an innovator on the family ideas She was thankful to have been a Dodson and to have one child who took after her own family at least in his features and complexion in liking salt and in eating beans which a Tulliver never did In other respects the true Dodson was partly latent in Tom and he was as far from appreciating his kin on the mother s side as Maggie herself generally absconding for the day with a large supply of the most portable food when he received timely warning that his aunts and uncles were coming a moral symptom from which his aunt Glegg deduced the gloomiest views of his future It was rather hard on Maggie that Tom always absconded without letting her into the secret but the weaker sex are acknowledged to be serious impedimenta in cases of flight On Wednesday the day before the aunts and uncles were coming there were such various and suggestive scents as of plumcakes in the oven and jellies in the hot state mingled with the aroma of gravy that it was impossible to feel altogether gloomy there was hope in the air Tom and Maggie made several inroads into the kitchen and like other marauders were induced to keep aloof for a time only by being allowed to carry away a sufficient load of booty Tom said Maggie as they sat on the boughs of the elder tree eating their jam puffs shall you run away to morrow No said Tom slowly when he had finished his puff and was eying the third which was to be divided between them no I sha n t Why Tom Because Lucy s coming No said Tom opening his pocket knife and holding it over the puff with his head on one side in a dubitative manner It was a difficult problem to divide that very irregular polygon into two equal parts What do I care about Lucy She s only a girl she can t play at bandy Is it the tipsy cake then said Maggie exerting her hypothetic powers while she leaned forward toward Tom with her eyes fixed on the hovering knife No you silly that ll be good the day after It s the pudden I know what the pudden s to be apricot roll up O my buttons With this interjection the knife descended on the puff and it was in two but the result was not satisfactory to Tom for he still eyed the halves doubtfully At last he said Shut your eyes Maggie What for You never mind what for Shut em when I tell you Maggie obeyed Now which ll you have Maggie right hand or left I ll have that with the jam run out said Maggie keeping her eyes shut to please Tom Why you don t like that you silly You may have it if it comes to you fair but I sha n t give it you without Right or left you choose now Ha a a said Tom in a tone of exasperation as Maggie peeped You keep your eyes shut now else you sha n t have any Maggie s power of sacrifice did not extend so far indeed I fear she cared less that Tom should enjoy the utmost possible amount of puff than that he should be pleased with her for giving him the best bit So she shut her eyes quite close till Tom told her to say which and then she said Left hand You ve got it said Tom in rather a bitter tone What the bit with the jam run out No here take it said Tom firmly handing decidedly the best piece to Maggie Oh please Tom have it I don t mind I like the other please take this No I sha n t said Tom almost crossly beginning on his own inferior piece Maggie thinking it was no use to contend further began too and ate up her half puff with considerable relish as well as rapidity But Tom had finished first and had to look on while Maggie ate her last morsel or two feeling in himself a capacity for more Maggie didn t know Tom was looking at her she was seesawing on the elder bough lost to almost everything but a vague sense of jam and idleness Oh you greedy thing said Tom when she had swallowed the last morsel He was conscious of having acted very fairly and thought she ought to have considered this and made up to him for it He would have refused a bit of hers beforehand but one is naturally at a different point of view before and after one s own share of puff is swallowed Maggie turned quite pale Oh Tom why didn t you ask me I wasn t going to ask you for a bit you greedy You might have thought of it without when you knew I gave you the best bit But I wanted you to have it you know I did said Maggie in an injured tone Yes but I wasn t going to do what wasn t fair like Spouncer He always takes the best bit if you don t punch him for it and if you choose the best with your eyes shut he changes his hands But if I go halves I ll go em fair only I wouldn t be a greedy With this cutting innuendo Tom jumped down from his bough and threw a stone with a hoigh as a friendly attention to Yap who had also been looking on while the eatables vanished with an agitation of his ears and feelings which could hardly have been without bitterness Yet the excellent dog accepted Tom s attention with as much alacrity as if he had been treated quite generously But Maggie gifted with that superior power of misery which distinguishes the human being and places him at a proud distance from the most melancholy chimpanzee sat still on her bough and gave herself up to the keen sense of unmerited reproach She would have given the world not to have eaten all her puff and to have saved some of it for Tom Not but that the puff was very nice for Maggie s palate was not at all obtuse but she would have gone without it many times over sooner than Tom should call her greedy and be cross with her And he had said he wouldn t have it and she ate it without thinking how could she help it The tears flowed so plentifully that Maggie saw nothing around her for the next ten minutes but by that time resentment began to give way to the desire of reconciliation and she jumped from her bough to look for Tom He was no longer in the paddock behind the rickyard where was he likely to be gone and Yap with him Maggie ran to the high bank against the great holly tree where she could see far away toward the Floss There was Tom but her heart sank again as she saw how far off he was on his way to the great river and that he had another companion besides Yap naughty Bob Jakin whose official if not natural function of frightening the birds was just now at a standstill Maggie felt sure that Bob was wicked without very distinctly knowing why unless it was because Bob s mother was a dreadfully large fat woman who lived at a queer round house down the river and once when Maggie and Tom had wandered thither there rushed out a brindled dog that wouldn t stop barking and when Bob s mother came out after it and screamed above the barking to tell them not to be frightened Maggie thought she was scolding them fiercely and her heart beat with terror Maggie thought it very likely that the round house had snakes on the floor and bats in the bedroom for she had seen Bob take off his cap to show Tom a little snake that was inside it and another time he had a handful of young bats altogether he was an irregular character perhaps even slightly diabolical judging from his intimacy with snakes and bats and to crown all when Tom had Bob for a companion he didn t mind about Maggie and would never let her go with him It must be owned that Tom was fond of Bob s company How could it be otherwise Bob knew directly he saw a bird s egg whether it was a swallow s or a tomtit s or a yellow hammer s he found out all the wasps nests and could set all sort of traps he could climb the trees like a squirrel and had quite a magical power of detecting hedgehogs and stoats and he had courage to do things that were rather naughty such as making gaps in the hedgerows throwing stones after the sheep and killing a cat that was wandering incognito Such qualities in an inferior who could always be treated with authority in spite of his superior knowingness had necessarily a fatal fascination for Tom and every holiday time Maggie was sure to have days of grief because he had gone off with Bob Well there was no hope for it he was gone now and Maggie could think of no comfort but to sit down by the hollow or wander by the hedgerow and fancy it was all different refashioning her little world into just what she should like it to be Maggie s was a troublous life and this was the form in which she took her opium Meanwhile Tom forgetting all about Maggie and the sting of reproach which he had left in her heart was hurrying along with Bob whom he had met accidentally to the scene of a great rat catching in a neighboring barn Bob knew all about this particular affair and spoke of the sport with an enthusiasm which no one who is not either divested of all manly feeling or pitiably ignorant of rat catching can fail to imagine For a person suspected of preternatural wickedness Bob was really not so very villanous looking there was even something agreeable in his snub nosed face with its close curled border of red hair But then his trousers were always rolled up at the knee for the convenience of wading on the slightest notice and his virtue supposing it to exist was undeniably virtue in rags which on the authority even of bilious philosophers who think all well dressed merit overpaid is notoriously likely to remain unrecognized perhaps because it is seen so seldom I know the chap as owns the ferrets said Bob in a hoarse treble voice as he shuffled along keeping his blue eyes fixed on the river like an amphibious animal who foresaw occasion for darting in He lives up the Kennel Yard at Sut Ogg s he does He s the biggest rot catcher anywhere he is I d sooner be a rot catcher nor anything I would The moles is nothing to the rots But Lors you mun ha ferrets Dogs is no good Why there s that dog now Bob continued pointing with an air of disgust toward Yap he s no more good wi a rot nor nothin I see it myself I did at the rot catchin i your feyther s barn Yap feeling the withering influence of this scorn tucked his tail in and shrank close to Tom s leg who felt a little hurt for him but had not the superhuman courage to seem behindhand with Bob in contempt for a dog who made so poor a figure No no he said Yap s no good at sport I ll have regular good dogs for rats and everything when I ve done school Hev ferrets Measter Tom said Bob eagerly them white ferrets wi pink eyes Lors you might catch your own rots an you might put a rot in a cage wi a ferret an see em fight you might That s what I d do I know an it ud be better fun a most nor seein two chaps fight if it wasn t them chaps as sold cakes an oranges at the Fair as the things flew out o their baskets an some o the cakes was smashed But they tasted just as good added Bob by way of note or addendum after a moment s pause But I say Bob said Tom in a tone of deliberation ferrets are nasty biting things they ll bite a fellow without being set on Lors why that s the beauty on em If a chap lays hold o your ferret he won t be long before he hollows out a good un he won t At this moment a striking incident made the boys pause suddenly in their walk It was the plunging of some small body in the water from among the neighboring bulrushes if it was not a water rat Bob intimated that he was ready to undergo the most unpleasant consequences Hoigh Yap hoigh there he is said Tom clapping his hands as the little black snout made its arrowy course to the opposite bank Seize him lad seize him Yap agitated his ears and wrinkled his brows but declined to plunge trying whether barking would not answer the purpose just as well Ugh you coward said Tom and kicked him over feeling humiliated as a sportsman to possess so poor spirited an animal Bob abstained from remark and passed on choosing however to walk in the shallow edge of the overflowing river by way of change He s none so full now the Floss isn t said Bob as he kicked the water up before him with an agreeable sense of being insolent to it Why last ear the meadows was all one sheet o water they was Ay but said Tom whose mind was prone to see an opposition between statements that were really accordant but there was a big flood once when the Round Pool was made I know there was cause father says so And the sheep and cows all drowned and the boats went all over the fields ever such a way I don t care about a flood comin said Bob I don t mind the water no more nor the land I d swim I would Ah but if you got nothing to eat for ever so long said Tom his imagination becoming quite active under the stimulus of that dread When I m a man I shall make a boat with a wooden house on the top of it like Noah s ark and keep plenty to eat in it rabbits and things all ready And then if the flood came you know Bob I shouldn t mind And I d take you in if I saw you swimming he added in the tone of a benevolent patron I aren t frighted said Bob to whom hunger did not appear so appalling But I d get in an knock the rabbits on th head when you wanted to eat em Ah and I should have halfpence and we d play at heads and tails said Tom not contemplating the possibility that this recreation might have fewer charms for his mature age I d divide fair to begin with and then we d see who d win I ve got a halfpenny o my own said Bob proudly coming out of the water and tossing his halfpenny in the air Yeads or tails Tails said Tom instantly fired with the desire to win It s yeads said Bob hastily snatching up the halfpenny as it fell It wasn t said Tom loudly and peremptorily You give me the halfpenny I ve won it fair I sha n t said Bob holding it tight in his pocket Then I ll make you see if I don t said Tom Yes I can You can t make me do nothing you can t said Bob No you can t I m master I don t care for you But I ll make you care you cheat said Tom collaring Bob and shaking him You get out wi you said Bob giving Tom a kick Tom s blood was thoroughly up he went at Bob with a lunge and threw him down but Bob seized hold and kept it like a cat and pulled Tom down after him They struggled fiercely on the ground for a moment or two till Tom pinning Bob down by the shoulders thought he had the mastery You say you ll give me the halfpenny now he said with difficulty while he exerted himself to keep the command of Bob s arms But at this moment Yap who had been running on before returned barking to the scene of action and saw a favorable opportunity for biting Bob s bare leg not only with inpunity but with honor The pain from Yap s teeth instead of surprising Bob into a relaxation of his hold gave it a fiercer tenacity and with a new exertion of his force he pushed Tom backward and got uppermost But now Yap who could get no sufficient purchase before set his teeth in a new place so that Bob harassed in this way let go his hold of Tom and almost throttling Yap flung him into the river By this time Tom was up again and before Bob had quite recovered his balance after the act of swinging Yap Tom fell upon him threw him down and got his knees firmly on Bob s chest You give me the halfpenny now said Tom Take it said Bob sulkily No I sha n t take it you give it me Bob took the halfpenny out of his pocket and threw it away from him on the ground Tom loosed his hold and left Bob to rise There the halfpenny lies he said I don t want your halfpenny I wouldn t have kept it But you wanted to cheat I hate a cheat I sha n t go along with you any more he added turning round homeward not without casting a regret toward the rat catching and other pleasures which he must relinquish along with Bob s society You may let it alone then Bob called out after him I shall cheat if I like there s no fun i playing else and I know where there s a goldfinch s nest but I ll take care you don t An you re a nasty fightin turkey cock you are Tom walked on without looking around and Yap followed his example the cold bath having moderated his passions Go along wi you then wi your drowned dog I wouldn t own such a dog I wouldn t said Bob getting louder in a last effort to sustain his defiance But Tom was not to be provoked into turning round and Bob s voice began to falter a little as he said An I n gi en you everything an showed you everything an niver wanted nothin from you An there s your horn handed knife then as you gi en me Here Bob flung the knife as far as he could after Tom s retreating footsteps But it produced no effect except the sense in Bob s mind that there was a terrible void in his lot now that knife was gone He stood still till Tom had passed through the gate and disappeared behind the hedge The knife would do not good on the ground there it wouldn t vex Tom and pride or resentment was a feeble passion in Bob s mind compared with the love of a pocket knife His very fingers sent entreating thrills that he would go and clutch that familiar rough buck s horn handle which they had so often grasped for mere affection as it lay idle in his pocket And there were two blades and they had just been sharpened What is life without a pocket knife to him who has once tasted a higher existence No to throw the handle after the hatchet is a comprehensible act of desperation but to throw one s pocket knife after an implacable friend is clearly in every sense a hyperbole or throwing beyond the mark So Bob shuffled back to the spot where the beloved knife lay in the dirt and felt quite a new pleasure in clutching it again after the temporary separation in opening one blade after the other and feeling their edge with his well hardened thumb Poor Bob he was not sensitive on the point of honor not a chivalrous character That fine moral aroma would not have been thought much of by the public opinion of Kennel Yard which was the very focus or heart of Bob s world even if it could have made itself perceptible there yet for all that he was not utterly a sneak and a thief as our friend Tom had hastily decided But Tom you perceive was rather a Rhadamanthine personage having more than the usual share of boy s justice in him the justice that desires to hurt culprits as much as they deserve to be hurt and is troubled with no doubts concerning the exact amount of their deserts Maggie saw a cloud on his brow when he came home which checked her joy at his coming so much sooner than she had expected and she dared hardly speak to him as he stood silently throwing the small gravel stones into the mill dam It is not pleasant to give up a rat catching when you have set your mind on it But if Tom had told his strongest feeling at that moment he would have said I d do just the same again That was his usual mode of viewing his past actions whereas Maggie was always wishing she had done something different Chapter VII Enter the Aunts and Uncles The Dodsons were certainly a handsome family and missus Glegg was not the least handsome of the sisters As she sat in missus Tulliver s arm chair no impartial observer could have denied that for a woman of fifty she had a very comely face and figure though Tom and Maggie considered their aunt Glegg as the type of ugliness It is true she despised the advantages of costume for though as she often observed no woman had better clothes it was not her way to wear her new things out before her old ones Other women if they liked might have their best thread lace in every wash but when missus Glegg died it would be found that she had better lace laid by in the right hand drawer of her wardrobe in the Spotted Chamber than ever missus Wooll of saint Ogg s had bought in her life although missus Wooll wore her lace before it was paid for So of her curled fronts missus Glegg had doubtless the glossiest and crispest brown curls in her drawers as well as curls in various degrees of fuzzy laxness but to look out on the week day world from under a crisp and glossy front would be to introduce a most dreamlike and unpleasant confusion between the sacred and the secular Occasionally indeed missus Glegg wore one of her third best fronts on a week day visit but not at a sister s house especially not at missus Tulliver s who since her marriage had hurt her sister s feelings greatly by wearing her own hair though as missus Glegg observed to missus Deane a mother of a family like Bessy with a husband always going to law might have been expected to know better But Bessy was always weak So if missus Glegg s front to day was more fuzzy and lax than usual she had a design under it she intended the most pointed and cutting allusion to missus Tulliver s bunches of blond curls separated from each other by a due wave of smoothness on each side of the parting missus Tulliver had shed tears several times at sister Glegg s unkindness on the subject of these unmatronly curls but the consciousness of looking the handsomer for them naturally administered support missus Glegg chose to wear her bonnet in the house to day untied and tilted slightly of course a frequent practice of hers when she was on a visit and happened to be in a severe humor she didn t know what draughts there might be in strange houses For the same reason she wore a small sable tippet which reached just to her shoulders and was very far from meeting across her well formed chest while her long neck was protected by a chevaux de frise of miscellaneous frilling One would need to be learned in the fashions of those times to know how far in the rear of them missus Glegg s slate colored silk gown must have been but from certain constellations of small yellow spots upon it and a mouldy odor about it suggestive of a damp clothes chest it was probable that it belonged to a stratum of garments just old enough to have come recently into wear missus Glegg held her large gold watch in her hand with the many doubled chain round her fingers and observed to missus Tulliver who had just returned from a visit to the kitchen that whatever it might be by other people s clocks and watches it was gone half past twelve by hers I don t know what ails sister Pullet she continued It used to be the way in our family for one to be as early as another I m sure it was so in my poor father s time and not for one sister to sit half an hour before the others came But if the ways o the family are altered it sha n t be my fault I ll never be the one to come into a house when all the rest are going away I wonder at sister Deane she used to be more like me But if you ll take my advice Bessy you ll put the dinner forrard a bit sooner than put it back because folks are late as ought to ha known better Oh dear there s no fear but what they ll be all here in time sister said missus Tulliver in her mild peevish tone The dinner won t be ready till half past one But if it s long for you to wait let me fetch you a cheesecake and a glass o wine Well Bessy said missus Glegg with a bitter smile and a scarcely perceptible toss of her head I should ha thought you d known your own sister better I never did eat between meals and I m not going to begin Not but what I hate that nonsense of having your dinner at half past one when you might have it at one You was never brought up in that way Bessy Why Jane what can I do mister Tulliver doesn t like his dinner before two o clock but I put it half an hour earlier because o you Yes yes I know how it is with husbands they re for putting everything off they ll put the dinner off till after tea if they ve got wives as are weak enough to give in to such work but it s a pity for you Bessy as you haven t got more strength o mind It ll be well if your children don t suffer for it And I hope you ve not gone and got a great dinner for us going to expense for your sisters as ud sooner eat a crust o dry bread nor help to ruin you with extravagance I wonder you don t take pattern by your sister Deane she s far more sensible And here you ve got two children to provide for and your husband s spent your fortin i going to law and s likely to spend his own too A boiled joint as you could make broth of for the kitchen missus Glegg added in a tone of emphatic protest and a plain pudding with a spoonful o sugar and no spice ud be far more becoming With sister Glegg in this humor there was a cheerful prospect for the day missus Tulliver never went the length of quarrelling with her any more than a water fowl that puts out its leg in a deprecating manner can be said to quarrel with a boy who throws stones But this point of the dinner was a tender one and not at all new so that missus Tulliver could make the same answer she had often made before mister Tulliver says he always will have a good dinner for his friends while he can pay for it she said and he s a right to do as he likes in his own house sister Well Bessy I can t leave your children enough out o my savings to keep em from ruin And you mustn t look to having any o mister Glegg s money for it s well if I don t go first he comes of a long lived family and if he was to die and leave me well for my life he d tie all the money up to go back to his own kin The sound of wheels while missus Glegg was speaking was an interruption highly welcome to missus Tulliver who hastened out to receive sister Pullet it must be sister Pullet because the sound was that of a four wheel missus Glegg tossed her head and looked rather sour about the mouth at the thought of the four wheel She had a strong opinion on that subject Sister Pullet was in tears when the one horse chaise stopped before missus Tulliver s door and it was apparently requisite that she should shed a few more before getting out for though her husband and missus Tulliver stood ready to support her she sat still and shook her head sadly as she looked through her tears at the vague distance Why whativer is the matter sister said missus Tulliver She was not an imaginative woman but it occurred to her that the large toilet glass in sister Pullet s best bedroom was possibly broken for the second time There was no reply but a further shake of the head as missus Pullet slowly rose and got down from the chaise not without casting a glance at mister Pullet to see that he was guarding her handsome silk dress from injury mister Pullet was a small man with a high nose small twinkling eyes and thin lips in a fresh looking suit of black and a white cravat that seemed to have been tied very tight on some higher principle than that of mere personal ease He bore about the same relation to his tall good looking wife with her balloon sleeves abundant mantle and a large befeathered and beribboned bonnet as a small fishing smack bears to a brig with all its sails spread It is a pathetic sight and a striking example of the complexity introduced into the emotions by a high state of civilization the sight of a fashionably dressed female in grief From the sorrow of a Hottentot to that of a woman in large buckram sleeves with several bracelets on each arm an architectural bonnet and delicate ribbon strings what a long series of gradations In the enlightened child of civilization the abandonment characteristic of grief is checked and varied in the subtlest manner so as to present an interesting problem to the analytic mind If with a crushed heart and eyes half blinded by the mist of tears she were to walk with a too devious step through a door place she might crush her buckram sleeves too and the deep consciousness of this possibility produces a composition of forces by which she takes a line that just clears the door post Perceiving that the tears are hurrying fast she unpins her strings and throws them languidly backward a touching gesture indicative even in the deepest gloom of the hope in future dry moments when cap strings will once more have a charm As the tears subside a little and with her head leaning backward at the angle that will not injure her bonnet she endures that terrible moment when grief which has made all things else a weariness has itself become weary she looks down pensively at her bracelets and adjusts their clasps with that pretty studied fortuity which would be gratifying to her mind if it were once more in a calm and healthy state missus Pullet brushed each door post with great nicety about the latitude of her shoulders at that period a woman was truly ridiculous to an instructed eye if she did not measure a yard and a half across the shoulders and having done that sent the muscles of her face in quest of fresh tears as she advanced into the parlor where missus Glegg was seated Well sister you re late what s the matter said missus Glegg rather sharply as they shook hands missus Pullet sat down lifting up her mantle carefully behind before she answered She s gone unconsciously using an impressive figure of rhetoric It isn t the glass this time then thought missus Tulliver Died the day before yesterday continued missus Pullet an her legs was as thick as my body she added with deep sadness after a pause They d tapped her no end o times and the water they say you might ha swum in it if you d liked Well Sophy it s a mercy she s gone then whoever she may be said missus Glegg with the promptitude and emphasis of a mind naturally clear and decided but I can t think who you re talking of for my part But I know said missus Pullet sighing and shaking her head and there isn t another such a dropsy in the parish I know as it s old missus Sutton o the Twentylands Well she s no kin o yours nor much acquaintance as I ve ever heared of said missus Glegg who always cried just as much as was proper when anything happened to her own kin but not on other occasions She s so much acquaintance as I ve seen her legs when they was like bladders And an old lady as had doubled her money over and over again and kept it all in her own management to the last and had her pocket with her keys in under her pillow constant There isn t many old par ish ners like her I doubt And they say she d took as much physic as ud fill a wagon observed mister Pullet Ah sighed missus Pullet she d another complaint ever so many years before she had the dropsy and the doctors couldn t make out what it was And she said to me when I went to see her last Christmas she said missus Pullet if ever you have the dropsy you ll think o me She did say so added missus Pullet beginning to cry bitterly again those were her very words And she s to be buried o Saturday and Pullet s bid to the funeral Sophy said missus Glegg unable any longer to contain her spirit of rational remonstrance Sophy I wonder at you fretting and injuring your health about people as don t belong to you Your poor father never did so nor your aunt Frances neither nor any o the family as I ever heard of You couldn t fret no more than this if we d heared as our cousin Abbott had died sudden without making his will missus Pullet was silent having to finish her crying and rather flattered than indignant at being upbraided for crying too much It was not everybody who could afford to cry so much about their neighbors who had left them nothing but missus Pullet had married a gentleman farmer and had leisure and money to carry her crying and everything else to the highest pitch of respectability missus Sutton didn t die without making her will though said mister Pullet with a confused sense that he was saying something to sanction his wife s tears ours is a rich parish but they say there s nobody else to leave as many thousands behind em as missus Sutton And she s left no leggicies to speak on left it all in a lump to her husband s nevvy There wasn t much good i being so rich then said missus Glegg if she d got none but husband s kin to leave it to It s poor work when that s all you ve got to pinch yourself for Not as I m one o those as ud like to die without leaving more money out at interest than other folks had reckoned but it s a poor tale when it must go out o your own family I m sure sister said missus Pullet who had recovered sufficiently to take off her veil and fold it carefully it s a nice sort o man as missus Sutton has left her money to for he s troubled with the asthmy and goes to bed every night at eight o clock He told me about it himself as free as could be one Sunday when he came to our church He wears a hareskin on his chest and has a trembling in his talk quite a gentleman sort o man I told him there wasn t many months in the year as I wasn t under the doctor s hands And he said missus Pullet I can feel for you That was what he said the very words Ah sighed missus Pullet shaking her head at the idea that there were but few who could enter fully into her experiences in pink mixture and white mixture strong stuff in small bottles and weak stuff in large bottles damp boluses at a shilling and draughts at eighteenpence Sister I may as well go and take my bonnet off now Did you see as the cap box was put out she added turning to her husband mister Pullet by an unaccountable lapse of memory had forgotten it and hastened out with a stricken conscience to remedy the omission They ll bring it upstairs sister said missus Tulliver wishing to go at once lest missus Glegg should begin to explain her feelings about Sophy s being the first Dodson who ever ruined her constitution with doctor s stuff missus Tulliver was fond of going upstairs with her sister Pullet and looking thoroughly at her cap before she put it on her head and discussing millinery in general This was part of Bessy s weakness that stirred missus Glegg s sisterly compassion Bessy went far too well dressed considering and she was too proud to dress her child in the good clothing her sister Glegg gave her from the primeval strata of her wardrobe it was a sin and a shame to buy anything to dress that child if it wasn t a pair of shoes In this particular however missus Glegg did her sister Bessy some injustice for missus Tulliver had really made great efforts to induce Maggie to wear a leghorn bonnet and a dyed silk frock made out of her aunt Glegg s but the results had been such that missus Tulliver was obliged to bury them in her maternal bosom for Maggie declaring that the frock smelt of nasty dye had taken an opportunity of basting it together with the roast beef the first Sunday she wore it and finding this scheme answer she had subsequently pumped on the bonnet with its green ribbons so as to give it a general resemblance to a sage cheese garnished with withered lettuces I must urge in excuse for Maggie that Tom had laughed at her in the bonnet and said she looked like an old Judy Aunt Pullet too made presents of clothes but these were always pretty enough to please Maggie as well as her mother Of all her sisters missus Tulliver certainly preferred her sister Pullet not without a return of preference but missus Pullet was sorry Bessy had those naughty awkward children she would do the best she could by them but it was a pity they weren t as good and as pretty as sister Deane s child Maggie and Tom on their part thought their aunt Pullet tolerable chiefly because she was not their aunt Glegg Tom always declined to go more than once during his holidays to see either of them Both his uncles tipped him that once of course but at his aunt Pullet s there were a great many toads to pelt in the cellar area so that he preferred the visit to her Maggie shuddered at the toads and dreamed of them horribly but she liked her uncle Pullet s musical snuff box Still it was agreed by the sisters in missus Tulliver s absence that the Tulliver blood did not mix well with the Dodson blood that in fact poor Bessy s children were Tullivers and that Tom notwithstanding he had the Dodson complexion was likely to be as contrairy as his father As for Maggie she was the picture of her aunt Moss mister Tulliver s sister a large boned woman who had married as poorly as could be had no china and had a husband who had much ado to pay his rent But when missus Pullet was alone with missus Tulliver upstairs the remarks were naturally to the disadvantage of missus Glegg and they agreed in confidence that there was no knowing what sort of fright sister Jane would come out next But their tete a tete was curtailed by the appearance of missus Deane with little Lucy and missus Tulliver had to look on with a silent pang while Lucy s blond curls were adjusted It was quite unaccountable that missus Deane the thinnest and sallowest of all the Miss Dodsons should have had this child who might have been taken for missus Tulliver s any day And Maggie always looked twice as dark as usual when she was by the side of Lucy She did to day when she and Tom came in from the garden with their father and their uncle Glegg Maggie had thrown her bonnet off very carelessly and coming in with her hair rough as well as out of curl rushed at once to Lucy who was standing by her mother s knee Certainly the contrast between the cousins was conspicuous and to superficial eyes was very much to the disadvantage of Maggie though a connoisseur might have seen points in her which had a higher promise for maturity than Lucy s natty completeness It was like the contrast between a rough dark overgrown puppy and a white kitten Lucy put up the neatest little rosebud mouth to be kissed everything about her was neat her little round neck with the row of coral beads her little straight nose not at all snubby her little clear eyebrows rather darker than her curls to match hazel eyes which looked up with shy pleasure at Maggie taller by the head though scarcely a year older Maggie always looked at Lucy with delight She was fond of fancying a world where the people never got any larger than children of their own age and she made the queen of it just like Lucy with a little crown on her head and a little sceptre in her hand only the queen was Maggie herself in Lucy s form Oh Lucy she burst out after kissing her you ll stay with Tom and me won t you Oh kiss her Tom Tom too had come up to Lucy but he was not going to kiss her no he came up to her with Maggie because it seemed easier on the whole than saying How do you do to all those aunts and uncles He stood looking at nothing in particular with the blushing awkward air and semi smile which are common to shy boys when in company very much as if they had come into the world by mistake and found it in a degree of undress that was quite embarrassing Heyday said aunt Glegg with loud emphasis Do little boys and gells come into a room without taking notice of their uncles and aunts That wasn t the way when I was a little gell Go and speak to your aunts and uncles my dears said missus Tulliver looking anxious and melancholy She wanted to whisper to Maggie a command to go and have her hair brushed Well and how do you do And I hope you re good children are you said Aunt Glegg in the same loud emphatic way as she took their hands hurting them with her large rings and kissing their cheeks much against their desire Look up Tom look up Boys as go to boarding schools should hold their heads up Look at me now Tom declined that pleasure apparently for he tried to draw his hand away Put your hair behind your ears Maggie and keep your frock on your shoulder Aunt Glegg always spoke to them in this loud emphatic way as if she considered them deaf or perhaps rather idiotic it was a means she thought of making them feel that they were accountable creatures and might be a salutary check on naughty tendencies Bessy s children were so spoiled they d need have somebody to make them feel their duty Well my dears said aunt Pullet in a compassionate voice you grow wonderful fast I doubt they ll outgrow their strength she added looking over their heads with a melancholy expression at their mother I think the gell has too much hair I d have it thinned and cut shorter sister if I was you it isn t good for her health It s that as makes her skin so brown I shouldn t wonder Don t you think so sister Deane I can t say I m sure sister said missus Deane shutting her lips close again and looking at Maggie with a critical eye No no said mister Tulliver the child s healthy enough there s nothing ails her There s red wheat as well as white for that matter and some like the dark grain best But it ud be as well if Bessy ud have the child s hair cut so as it ud lie smooth A dreadful resolve was gathering in Maggie s breast but it was arrested by the desire to know from her aunt Deane whether she would leave Lucy behind Aunt Deane would hardly ever let Lucy come to see them After various reasons for refusal missus Deane appealed to Lucy herself You wouldn t like to stay behind without mother should you Lucy Yes please mother said Lucy timidly blushing very pink all over her little neck Well done Lucy Let her stay missus Deane let her stay said mister Deane a large but alert looking man with a type of physique to be seen in all ranks of English society bald crown red whiskers full forehead and general solidity without heaviness You may see noblemen like mister Deane and you may see grocers or day laborers like him but the keenness of his brown eyes was less common than his contour He held a silver snuff box very tightly in his hand and now and then exchanged a pinch with mister Tulliver whose box was only silver mounted so that it was naturally a joke between them that mister Tulliver wanted to exchange snuff boxes also mister Deane s box had been given him by the superior partners in the firm to which he belonged at the same time that they gave him a share in the business in acknowledgment of his valuable services as manager No man was thought more highly of in saint Ogg s than mister Deane and some persons were even of opinion that Miss Susan Dodson who was once held to have made the worst match of all the Dodson sisters might one day ride in a better carriage and live in a better house even than her sister Pullet There was no knowing where a man would stop who had got his foot into a great mill owning shipowning business like that of Guest company with a banking concern attached And missus Deane as her intimate female friends observed was proud and having enough she wouldn t let her husband stand still in the world for want of spurring Maggie said missus Tulliver beckoning Maggie to her and whispering in her ear as soon as this point of Lucy s staying was settled go and get your hair brushed do for shame I told you not to come in without going to Martha first you know I did Tom come out with me whispered Maggie pulling his sleeve as she passed him and Tom followed willingly enough Come upstairs with me Tom she whispered when they were outside the door There s something I want to do before dinner There s no time to play at anything before dinner said Tom whose imagination was impatient of any intermediate prospect Oh yes there is time for this do come Tom Tom followed Maggie upstairs into her mother s room and saw her go at once to a drawer from which she took out a large pair of scissors What are they for Maggie said Tom feeling his curiosity awakened Maggie answered by seizing her front locks and cutting them straight across the middle of her forehead Oh my buttons Maggie you ll catch it exclaimed Tom you d better not cut any more off Snip went the great scissors again while Tom was speaking and he couldn t help feeling it was rather good fun Maggie would look so queer Here Tom cut it behind for me said Maggie excited by her own daring and anxious to finish the deed You ll catch it you know said Tom nodding his head in an admonitory manner and hesitating a little as he took the scissors Never mind make haste said Maggie giving a little stamp with her foot Her cheeks were quite flushed The black locks were so thick nothing could be more tempting to a lad who had already tasted the forbidden pleasure of cutting the pony s mane I speak to those who know the satisfaction of making a pair of scissors meet through a duly resisting mass of hair One delicious grinding snip and then another and another and the hinder locks fell heavily on the floor and Maggie stood cropped in a jagged uneven manner but with a sense of clearness and freedom as if she had emerged from a wood into the open plain Oh Maggie said Tom jumping round her and slapping his knees as he laughed Oh my buttons what a queer thing you look Look at yourself in the glass you look like the idiot we throw out nutshells to at school Maggie felt an unexpected pang She had thought beforehand chiefly at her own deliverance from her teasing hair and teasing remarks about it and something also of the triumph she should have over her mother and her aunts by this very decided course of action she didn t want her hair to look pretty that was out of the question she only wanted people to think her a clever little girl and not to find fault with her But now when Tom began to laugh at her and say she was like an idiot the affair had quite a new aspect She looked in the glass and still Tom laughed and clapped his hands and Maggie s cheeks began to pale and her lips to tremble a little Oh Maggie you ll have to go down to dinner directly said Tom Oh my Don t laugh at me Tom said Maggie in a passionate tone with an outburst of angry tears stamping and giving him a push Now then spitfire said Tom What did you cut it off for then I shall go down I can smell the dinner going in He hurried downstairs and left poor Maggie to that bitter sense of the irrevocable which was almost an every day experience of her small soul She could see clearly enough now the thing was done that it was very foolish and that she should have to hear and think more about her hair than ever for Maggie rushed to her deeds with passionate impulse and then saw not only their consequences but what would have happened if they had not been done with all the detail and exaggerated circumstance of an active imagination Tom never did the same sort of foolish things as Maggie having a wonderful instinctive discernment of what would turn to his advantage or disadvantage and so it happened that though he was much more wilful and inflexible than Maggie his mother hardly ever called him naughty But if Tom did make a mistake of that sort he espoused it and stood by it he didn t mind If he broke the lash of his father s gigwhip by lashing the gate he couldn t help it the whip shouldn t have got caught in the hinge If Tom Tulliver whipped a gate he was convinced not that the whipping of gates by all boys was a justifiable act but that he Tom Tulliver was justifiable in whipping that particular gate and he wasn t going to be sorry But Maggie as she stood crying before the glass felt it impossible that she should go down to dinner and endure the severe eyes and severe words of her aunts while Tom and Lucy and Martha who waited at table and perhaps her father and her uncles would laugh at her for if Tom had laughed at her of course every one else would and if she had only let her hair alone she could have sat with Tom and Lucy and had the apricot pudding and the custard What could she do but sob She sat as helpless and despairing among her black locks as Ajax among the slaughtered sheep Very trivial perhaps this anguish seems to weather worn mortals who have to think of Christmas bills dead loves and broken friendships but it was not less bitter to Maggie perhaps it was even more bitter than what we are fond of calling antithetically the real troubles of mature life Ah my child you will have real troubles to fret about by and by is the consolation we have almost all of us had administered to us in our childhood and have repeated to other children since we have been grown up We have all of us sobbed so piteously standing with tiny bare legs above our little socks when we lost sight of our mother or nurse in some strange place but we can no longer recall the poignancy of that moment and weep over it as we do over the remembered sufferings of five or ten years ago Every one of those keen moments has left its trace and lives in us still but such traces have blent themselves irrecoverably with the firmer texture of our youth and manhood and so it comes that we can look on at the troubles of our children with a smiling disbelief in the reality of their pain Is there any one who can recover the experience of his childhood not merely with a memory of what he did and what happened to him of what he liked and disliked when he was in frock and trousers but with an intimate penetration a revived consciousness of what he felt then when it was so long from one Midsummer to another what he felt when his school fellows shut him out of their game because he would pitch the ball wrong out of mere wilfulness or on a rainy day in the holidays when he didn t know how to amuse himself and fell from idleness into mischief from mischief into defiance and from defiance into sulkiness or when his mother absolutely refused to let him have a tailed coat that half although every other boy of his age had gone into tails already Surely if we could recall that early bitterness and the dim guesses the strangely perspectiveless conception of life that gave the bitterness its intensity we should not pooh pooh the griefs of our children Miss Maggie you re to come down this minute said Kezia entering the room hurriedly Lawks what have you been a doing I never see such a fright Don t Kezia said Maggie angrily Go away But I tell you you re to come down Miss this minute your mother says so said Kezia going up to Maggie and taking her by the hand to raise her from the floor Get away Kezia I don t want any dinner said Maggie resisting Kezia s arm I sha n t come Oh well I can t stay I ve got to wait at dinner said Kezia going out again Maggie you little silly said Tom peeping into the room ten minutes after why don t you come and have your dinner There s lots o goodies and mother says you re to come What are you crying for you little spooney Oh it was dreadful Tom was so hard and unconcerned if he had been crying on the floor Maggie would have cried too And there was the dinner so nice and she was so hungry It was very bitter But Tom was not altogether hard He was not inclined to cry and did not feel that Maggie s grief spoiled his prospect of the sweets but he went and put his head near her and said in a lower comforting tone Won t you come then Magsie Shall I bring you a bit o pudding when I ve had mine and a custard and things Ye e es said Maggie beginning to feel life a little more tolerable Very well said Tom going away But he turned again at the door and said But you d better come you know There s the dessert nuts you know and cowslip wine Maggie s tears had ceased and she looked reflective as Tom left her His good nature had taken off the keenest edge of her suffering and nuts with cowslip wine began to assert their legitimate influence Slowly she rose from amongst her scattered locks and slowly she made her way downstairs Then she stood leaning with one shoulder against the frame of the dining parlour door peeping in when it was ajar She saw Tom and Lucy with an empty chair between them and there were the custards on a side table it was too much She slipped in and went toward the empty chair But she had no sooner sat down than she repented and wished herself back again missus Tulliver gave a little scream as she saw her and felt such a turn that she dropped the large gravy spoon into the dish with the most serious results to the table cloth For Kezia had not betrayed the reason of Maggie s refusal to come down not liking to give her mistress a shock in the moment of carving and missus Tulliver thought there was nothing worse in question than a fit of perverseness which was inflicting its own punishment by depriving Maggie of half her dinner missus Tulliver s scream made all eyes turn towards the same point as her own and Maggie s cheeks and ears began to burn while uncle Glegg a kind looking white haired old gentleman said Heyday what little gell s this Why I don t know her Is it some little gell you ve picked up in the road Kezia Why she s gone and cut her hair herself said mister Tulliver in an undertone to mister Deane laughing with much enjoyment Did you ever know such a little hussy as it is Why little miss you ve made yourself look very funny said Uncle Pullet and perhaps he never in his life made an observation which was felt to be so lacerating Fie for shame said aunt Glegg in her loudest severest tone of reproof Little gells as cut their own hair should be whipped and fed on bread and water not come and sit down with their aunts and uncles Ay ay said uncle Glegg meaning to give a playful turn to this denunciation she must be sent to jail I think and they ll cut the rest of her hair off there and make it all even She s more like a gypsy nor ever said aunt Pullet in a pitying tone it s very bad luck sister as the gell should be so brown the boy s fair enough I doubt it ll stand in her way i life to be so brown She s a naughty child as ll break her mother s heart said missus Tulliver with the tears in her eyes Maggie seemed to be listening to a chorus of reproach and derision Her first flush came from anger which gave her a transient power of defiance and Tom thought she was braving it out supported by the recent appearance of the pudding and custard Under this impression he whispered Oh my Maggie I told you you d catch it He meant to be friendly but Maggie felt convinced that Tom was rejoicing in her ignominy Her feeble power of defiance left her in an instant her heart swelled and getting up from her chair she ran to her father hid her face on his shoulder and burst out into loud sobbing Come come my wench said her father soothingly putting his arm round her never mind you was i the right to cut it off if it plagued you give over crying father ll take your part Delicious words of tenderness Maggie never forgot any of these moments when her father took her part she kept them in her heart and thought of them long years after when every one else said that her father had done very ill by his children How your husband does spoil that child Bessy said missus Glegg in a loud aside to missus Tulliver It ll be the ruin of her if you don t take care My father never brought his children up so else we should ha been a different sort o family to what we are missus Tulliver s domestic sorrows seemed at this moment to have reached the point at which insensibility begins She took no notice of her sister s remark but threw back her capstrings and dispensed the pudding in mute resignation With the dessert there came entire deliverance for Maggie for the children were told they might have their nuts and wine in the summer house since the day was so mild and they scampered out among the budding bushes of the garden with the alacrity of small animals getting from under a burning glass missus Tulliver had her special reason for this permission now the dinner was despatched and every one s mind disengaged it was the right moment to communicate mister Tulliver s intention concerning Tom and it would be as well for Tom himself to be absent The children were used to hear themselves talked of as freely as if they were birds and could understand nothing however they might stretch their necks and listen but on this occasion missus Tulliver manifested an unusual discretion because she had recently had evidence that the going to school to a clergyman was a sore point with Tom who looked at it as very much on a par with going to school to a constable missus Tulliver had a sighing sense that her husband would do as he liked whatever sister Glegg said or sister Pullet either but at least they would not be able to say if the thing turned out ill that Bessy had fallen in with her husband s folly without letting her own friends know a word about it mister Tulliver she said interrupting her husband in his talk with mister Deane it s time now to tell the children s aunts and uncles what you re thinking of doing with Tom isn t it Very well said mister Tulliver rather sharply I ve no objections to tell anybody what I mean to do with him I ve settled he added looking toward mister Glegg and mister Deane I ve settled to send him to a mister Stelling a parson down at King s Lorton there an uncommon clever fellow I understand as ll put him up to most things There was a rustling demonstration of surprise in the company such as you may have observed in a country congregation when they hear an allusion to their week day affairs from the pulpit It was equally astonishing to the aunts and uncles to find a parson introduced into mister Tulliver s family arrangements As for uncle Pullet he could hardly have been more thoroughly obfuscated if mister Tulliver had said that he was going to send Tom to the Lord Chancellor for uncle Pullet belonged to that extinct class of British yeoman who dressed in good broadcloth paid high rates and taxes went to church and ate a particularly good dinner on Sunday without dreaming that the British constitution in Church and State had a traceable origin any more than the solar system and the fixed stars It is melancholy but true that mister Pullet had the most confused idea of a bishop as a sort of a baronet who might or might not be a clergyman and as the rector of his own parish was a man of high family and fortune the idea that a clergyman could be a schoolmaster was too remote from mister Pullet s experience to be readily conceivable I know it is difficult for people in these instructed times to believe in uncle Pullet s ignorance but let them reflect on the remarkable results of a great natural faculty under favoring circumstances And uncle Pullet had a great natural faculty for ignorance He was the first to give utterance to his astonishment Why what can you be going to send him to a parson for he said with an amazed twinkling in his eyes looking at mister Glegg and mister Deane to see if they showed any signs of comprehension Why because the parsons are the best schoolmasters by what I can make out said poor mister Tulliver who in the maze of this puzzling world laid hold of any clue with great readiness and tenacity Jacobs at th academy s no parson and he s done very bad by the boy and I made up my mind if I send him to school again it should be to somebody different to Jacobs And this mister Stelling by what I can make out is the sort o man I want And I mean my boy to go to him at Midsummer he concluded in a tone of decision tapping his snuff box and taking a pinch You ll have to pay a swinging half yearly bill then eh Tulliver The clergymen have highish notions in general said mister Deane taking snuff vigorously as he always did when wishing to maintain a neutral position What do you think the parson ll teach him to know a good sample o wheat when he sees it neighbor Tulliver said mister Glegg who was fond of his jest and having retired from business felt that it was not only allowable but becoming in him to take a playful view of things Why you see I ve got a plan i my head about Tom said mister Tulliver pausing after that statement and lifting up his glass Well if I may be allowed to speak and it s seldom as I am said missus Glegg with a tone of bitter meaning I should like to know what good is to come to the boy by bringin him up above his fortin Why said mister Tulliver not looking at missus Glegg but at the male part of his audience you see I ve made up my mind not to bring Tom up to my own business I ve had my thoughts about it all along and I made up my mind by what I saw with Garnett and his son I mean to put him to some business as he can go into without capital and I want to give him an eddication as he ll be even wi the lawyers and folks and put me up to a notion now an then missus Glegg emitted a long sort of guttural sound with closed lips that smiled in mingled pity and scorn It ud be a fine deal better for some people she said after that introductory note if they d let the lawyers alone Is he at the head of a grammar school then this clergyman such as that at Market Bewley said mister Deane No nothing of that said mister Tulliver He won t take more than two or three pupils and so he ll have the more time to attend to em you know Ah and get his eddication done the sooner they can t learn much at a time when there s so many of em said uncle Pullet feeling that he was getting quite an insight into this difficult matter But he ll want the more pay I doubt said mister Glegg Ay ay a cool hundred a year that s all said mister Tulliver with some pride at his own spirited course But then you know it s an investment Tom s eddication ull be so much capital to him Ay there s something in that said mister Glegg Well well neighbor Tulliver you may be right you may be right When land is gone and money s spent Then learning is most excellent I remember seeing those two lines wrote on a window at Buxton But us that have got no learning had better keep our money eh neighbor Pullet mister Glegg rubbed his knees and looked very pleasant mister Glegg I wonder at you said his wife It s very unbecoming in a man o your age and belongings What s unbecoming missus G said mister Glegg winking pleasantly at the company My new blue coat as I ve got on I pity your weakness mister Glegg I say it s unbecoming to be making a joke when you see your own kin going headlongs to ruin If you mean me by that said mister Tulliver considerably nettled you needn t trouble yourself to fret about me I can manage my own affairs without troubling other folks Bless me said mister Deane judiciously introducing a new idea why now I come to think of it somebody said Wakem was going to send his son the deformed lad to a clergyman didn t they Susan appealing to his wife I can give no account of it I m sure said missus Deane closing her lips very tightly again missus Deane was not a woman to take part in a scene where missiles were flying Well said mister Tulliver speaking all the more cheerfully that missus Glegg might see he didn t mind her if Wakem thinks o sending his son to a clergyman depend on it I shall make no mistake i sending Tom to one Wakem s as big a scoundrel as Old Harry ever made but he knows the length of every man s foot he s got to deal with Ay ay tell me who s Wakem s butcher and I ll tell you where to get your meat But lawyer Wakem s son s got a hump back said missus Pullet who felt as if the whole business had a funereal aspect it s more nat ral to send him to a clergyman Yes said mister Glegg interpreting missus Pullet s observation with erroneous plausibility you must consider that neighbor Tulliver Wakem s son isn t likely to follow any business Wakem ull make a gentleman of him poor fellow mister Glegg said missus G in a tone which implied that her indignation would fizz and ooze a little though she was determined to keep it corked up you d far better hold your tongue mister Tulliver doesn t want to know your opinion nor mine either There s folks in the world as know better than everybody else Why I should think that s you if we re to trust your own tale said mister Tulliver beginning to boil up again Oh I say nothing said missus Glegg sarcastically My advice has never been asked and I don t give it It ll be the first time then said mister Tulliver It s the only thing you re over ready at giving I ve been over ready at lending then if I haven t been over ready at giving said missus Glegg There s folks I ve lent money to as perhaps I shall repent o lending money to kin Come come come said mister Glegg soothingly But mister Tulliver was not to be hindered of his retort You ve got a bond for it I reckon he said and you ve had your five per cent kin or no kin Sister said missus Tulliver pleadingly drink your wine and let me give you some almonds and raisins Bessy I m sorry for you said missus Glegg very much with the feeling of a cur that seizes the opportunity of diverting his bark toward the man who carries no stick It s poor work talking o almonds and raisins Lors sister Glegg don t be so quarrelsome said missus Pullet beginning to cry a little You may be struck with a fit getting so red in the face after dinner and we are but just out o mourning all of us and all wi gowns craped alike and just put by it s very bad among sisters I should think it is bad said missus Glegg Things are come to a fine pass when one sister invites the other to her house o purpose to quarrel with her and abuse her Softly softly Jane be reasonable be reasonable said mister Glegg But while he was speaking mister Tulliver who had by no means said enough to satisfy his anger burst out again Who wants to quarrel with you he said It s you as can t let people alone but must be gnawing at em forever I should never want to quarrel with any woman if she kept her place My place indeed said missus Glegg getting rather more shrill There s your betters mister Tulliver as are dead and in their grave treated me with a different sort o respect to what you do though I ve got a husband as ll sit by and see me abused by them as ud never ha had the chance if there hadn t been them in our family as married worse than they might ha done If you talk o that said mister Tulliver my family s as good as yours and better for it hasn t got a damned ill tempered woman in it Well said missus Glegg rising from her chair I don t know whether you think it s a fine thing to sit by and hear me swore at mister Glegg but I m not going to stay a minute longer in this house You can stay behind and come home with the gig and I ll walk home Dear heart dear heart said mister Glegg in a melancholy tone as he followed his wife out of the room mister Tulliver how could you talk so said missus Tulliver with the tears in her eyes Let her go said mister Tulliver too hot to be damped by any amount of tears Let her go and the sooner the better she won t be trying to domineer over me again in a hurry Sister Pullet said missus Tulliver helplessly do you think it ud be any use for you to go after her and try to pacify her Better not better not said mister Deane You ll make it up another day Then sisters shall we go and look at the children said missus Tulliver drying her eyes No proposition could have been more seasonable mister Tulliver felt very much as if the air had been cleared of obtrusive flies now the women were out of the room There were few things he liked better than a chat with mister Deane whose close application to business allowed the pleasure very rarely mister Deane he considered was the knowingest man of his acquaintance and he had besides a ready causticity of tongue that made an agreeable supplement to mister Tulliver s own tendency that way which had remained in rather an inarticulate condition And now the women were gone they could carry on their serious talk without frivolous interruption They could exchange their views concerning the Duke of Wellington whose conduct in the Catholic Question had thrown such an entirely new light on his character and speak slightingly of his conduct at the battle of Waterloo which he would never have won if there hadn t been a great many Englishmen at his back not to speak of Blucher and the Prussians who as mister Tulliver had heard from a person of particular knowledge in that matter had come up in the very nick of time though here there was a slight dissidence mister Deane remarking that he was not disposed to give much credit to the Prussians the build of their vessels together with the unsatisfactory character of transactions in Dantzic beer inclining him to form rather a low view of Prussian pluck generally Rather beaten on this ground mister Tulliver proceeded to express his fears that the country could never again be what it used to be but mister Deane attached to a firm of which the returns were on the increase naturally took a more lively view of the present and had some details to give concerning the state of the imports especially in hides and spelter which soothed mister Tulliver s imagination by throwing into more distant perspective the period when the country would become utterly the prey of Papists and Radicals and there would be no more chance for honest men Uncle Pullet sat by and listened with twinkling eyes to these high matters He didn t understand politics himself thought they were a natural gift but by what he could make out this Duke of Wellington was no better than he should be Chapter VIII mister Tulliver Shows His Weaker Side Suppose sister Glegg should call her money in it ud be very awkward for you to have to raise five hundred pounds now said missus Tulliver to her husband that evening as she took a plaintive review of the day missus Tulliver had lived thirteen years with her husband yet she retained in all the freshness of her early married life a facility of saying things which drove him in the opposite direction to the one she desired Some minds are wonderful for keeping their bloom in this way as a patriarchal goldfish apparently retains to the last its youthful illusion that it can swim in a straight line beyond the encircling glass missus Tulliver was an amiable fish of this kind and after running her head against the same resisting medium for thirteen years would go at it again to day with undulled alacrity This observation of hers tended directly to convince mister Tulliver that it would not be at all awkward for him to raise five hundred pounds and when missus Tulliver became rather pressing to know how he would raise it without mortgaging the mill and the house which he had said he never would mortgage since nowadays people were none so ready to lend money without security mister Tulliver getting warm declared that missus Glegg might do as she liked about calling in her money he should pay it in whether or not He was not going to be beholden to his wife s sisters When a man had married into a family where there was a whole litter of women he might have plenty to put up with if he chose But mister Tulliver did not choose missus Tulliver cried a little in a trickling quiet way as she put on her nightcap but presently sank into a comfortable sleep lulled by the thought that she would talk everything over with her sister Pullet to morrow when she was to take the children to Garum Firs to tea Not that she looked forward to any distinct issue from that talk but it seemed impossible that past events should be so obstinate as to remain unmodified when they were complained against Her husband lay awake rather longer for he too was thinking of a visit he would pay on the morrow and his ideas on the subject were not of so vague and soothing a kind as those of his amiable partner mister Tulliver when under the influence of a strong feeling had a promptitude in action that may seem inconsistent with that painful sense of the complicated puzzling nature of human affairs under which his more dispassionate deliberations were conducted but it is really not improbable that there was a direct relation between these apparently contradictory phenomena since I have observed that for getting a strong impression that a skein is tangled there is nothing like snatching hastily at a single thread It was owing to this promptitude that mister Tulliver was on horseback soon after dinner the next day he was not dyspeptic on his way to Basset to see his sister Moss and her husband For having made up his mind irrevocably that he would pay missus Glegg her loan of five hundred pounds it naturally occurred to him that he had a promissory note for three hundred pounds lent to his brother in law Moss and if the said brother in law could manage to pay in the money within a given time it would go far to lessen the fallacious air of inconvenience which mister Tulliver s spirited step might have worn in the eyes of weak people who require to know precisely how a thing is to be done before they are strongly confident that it will be easy For mister Tulliver was in a position neither new nor striking but like other every day things sure to have a cumulative effect that will be felt in the long run he was held to be a much more substantial man than he really was And as we are all apt to believe what the world believes about us it was his habit to think of failure and ruin with the same sort of remote pity with which a spare long necked man hears that his plethoric short necked neighbor is stricken with apoplexy He had been always used to hear pleasant jokes about his advantages as a man who worked his own mill and owned a pretty bit of land and these jokes naturally kept up his sense that he was a man of considerable substance They gave a pleasant flavor to his glass on a market day and if it had not been for the recurrence of half yearly payments mister Tulliver would really have forgotten that there was a mortgage of two thousand pounds on his very desirable freehold That was not altogether his own fault since one of the thousand pounds was his sister s fortune which he had to pay on her marriage and a man who has neighbors that will go to law with him is not likely to pay off his mortgages especially if he enjoys the good opinion of acquaintances who want to borrow a hundred pounds on security too lofty to be represented by parchment Our friend mister Tulliver had a good natured fibre in him and did not like to give harsh refusals even to his sister who had not only come in to the world in that superfluous way characteristic of sisters creating a necessity for mortgages but had quite thrown herself away in marriage and had crowned her mistakes by having an eighth baby On this point mister Tulliver was conscious of being a little weak but he apologized to himself by saying that poor Gritty had been a good looking wench before she married Moss he would sometimes say this even with a slight tremulousness in his voice But this morning he was in a mood more becoming a man of business and in the course of his ride along the Basset lanes with their deep ruts lying so far away from a market town that the labor of drawing produce and manure was enough to take away the best part of the profits on such poor land as that parish was made of he got up a due amount of irritation against Moss as a man without capital who if murrain and blight were abroad was sure to have his share of them and who the more you tried to help him out of the mud would sink the further in It would do him good rather than harm now if he were obliged to raise this three hundred pounds it would make him look about him better and not act so foolishly about his wool this year as he did the last in fact mister Tulliver had been too easy with his brother in law and because he had let the interest run on for two years Moss was likely enough to think that he should never be troubled about the principal But mister Tulliver was determined not to encourage such shuffling people any longer and a ride along the Basset lanes was not likely to enervate a man s resolution by softening his temper The deep trodden hoof marks made in the muddiest days of winter gave him a shake now and then which suggested a rash but stimulating snarl at the father of lawyers who whether by means of his hoof or otherwise had doubtless something to do with this state of the roads and the abundance of foul land and neglected fences that met his eye though they made no part of his brother Moss s farm strongly contributed to his dissatisfaction with that unlucky agriculturist If this wasn t Moss s fallow it might have been Basset was all alike it was a beggarly parish in mister Tulliver s opinion and his opinion was certainly not groundless Basset had a poor soil poor roads a poor non resident landlord a poor non resident vicar and rather less than half a curate also poor If any one strongly impressed with the power of the human mind to triumph over circumstances will contend that the parishioners of Basset might nevertheless have been a very superior class of people I have nothing to urge against that abstract proposition I only know that in point of fact the Basset mind was in strict keeping with its circumstances The muddy lanes green or clayey that seemed to the unaccustomed eye to lead nowhere but into each other did really lead with patience to a distant high road but there were many feet in Basset which they led more frequently to a centre of dissipation spoken of formerly as the Markis o Granby but among intimates as Dickison s A large low room with a sanded floor a cold scent of tobacco modified by undetected beer dregs mister Dickison leaning against the door post with a melancholy pimpled face looking as irrelevant to the daylight as a last night s guttered candle all this may not seem a very seductive form of temptation but the majority of men in Basset found it fatally alluring when encountered on their road toward four o clock on a wintry afternoon and if any wife in Basset wished to indicate that her husband was not a pleasure seeking man she could hardly do it more emphatically than by saying that he didn t spend a shilling at Dickison s from one Whitsuntide to another missus Moss had said so of her husband more than once when her brother was in a mood to find fault with him as he certainly was to day And nothing could be less pacifying to mister Tulliver than the behavior of the farmyard gate which he no sooner attempted to push open with his riding stick than it acted as gates without the upper hinge are known to do to the peril of shins whether equine or human He was about to get down and lead his horse through the damp dirt of the hollow farmyard shadowed drearily by the large half timbered buildings up to the long line of tumble down dwelling houses standing on a raised causeway but the timely appearance of a cowboy saved him that frustration of a plan he had determined on namely not to get down from his horse during this visit If a man means to be hard let him keep in his saddle and speak from that height above the level of pleading eyes and with the command of a distant horizon missus Moss heard the sound of the horse s feet and when her brother rode up was already outside the kitchen door with a half weary smile on her face and a black eyed baby in her arms missus Moss s face bore a faded resemblance to her brother s baby s little fat hand pressed against her cheek seemed to show more strikingly that the cheek was faded Brother I m glad to see you she said in an affectionate tone I didn t look for you to day How do you do Oh pretty well missus Moss pretty well answered the brother with cool deliberation as if it were rather too forward of her to ask that question She knew at once that her brother was not in a good humor he never called her missus Moss except when he was angry and when they were in company But she thought it was in the order of nature that people who were poorly off should be snubbed missus Moss did not take her stand on the equality of the human race she was a patient prolific loving hearted woman Your husband isn t in the house I suppose added mister Tulliver after a grave pause during which four children had run out like chickens whose mother has been suddenly in eclipse behind the hen coop No said missus Moss but he s only in the potato field yonders Georgy run to the Far Close in a minute and tell father your uncle s come You ll get down brother won t you and take something No no I can t get down I must be going home again directly said mister Tulliver looking at the distance And how s missus Tulliver and the children said missus Moss humbly not daring to press her invitation Oh pretty well Tom s going to a new school at Midsummer a deal of expense to me It s bad work for me lying out o my money I wish you d be so good as let the children come and see their cousins some day My little uns want to see their cousin Maggie so as never was And me her godmother and so fond of her there s nobody ud make a bigger fuss with her according to what they ve got And I know she likes to come for she s a loving child and how quick and clever she is to be sure If missus Moss had been one of the most astute women in the world instead of being one of the simplest she could have thought of nothing more likely to propitiate her brother than this praise of Maggie He seldom found any one volunteering praise of the little wench it was usually left entirely to himself to insist on her merits But Maggie always appeared in the most amiable light at her aunt Moss s it was her Alsatia where she was out of the reach of law if she upset anything dirtied her shoes or tore her frock these things were matters of course at her aunt Moss s In spite of himself mister Tulliver s eyes got milder and he did not look away from his sister as he said Ay she s fonder o you than o the other aunts I think She takes after our family not a bit of her mother s in her Moss says she s just like what I used to be said missus Moss though I was never so quick and fond o the books But I think my Lizzy s like her she s sharp Come here Lizzy my dear and let your uncle see you he hardly knows you you grow so fast Lizzy a black eyed child of seven looked very shy when her mother drew her forward for the small Mosses were much in awe of their uncle from Dorlcote Mill She was inferior enough to Maggie in fire and strength of expression to make the resemblance between the two entirely flattering to mister Tulliver s fatherly love Ay they re a bit alike he said looking kindly at the little figure in the soiled pinafore They both take after our mother You ve got enough o gells Gritty he added in a tone half compassionate half reproachful Four of em bless em said missus Moss with a sigh stroking Lizzy s hair on each side of her forehead as many as there s boys They ve got a brother apiece Ah but they must turn out and fend for themselves said mister Tulliver feeling that his severity was relaxing and trying to brace it by throwing out a wholesome hint They mustn t look to hanging on their brothers No but I hope their brothers ull love the poor things and remember they came o one father and mother the lads ull never be the poorer for that said missus Moss flashing out with hurried timidity like a half smothered fire mister Tulliver gave his horse a little stroke on the flank then checked it and said angrily Stand still with you much to the astonishment of that innocent animal And the more there is of em the more they must love one another missus Moss went on looking at her children with a didactic purpose But she turned toward her brother again to say Not but what I hope your boy ull allays be good to his sister though there s but two of em like you and me brother The arrow went straight to mister Tulliver s heart He had not a rapid imagination but the thought of Maggie was very near to him and he was not long in seeing his relation to his own sister side by side with Tom s relation to Maggie Would the little wench ever be poorly off and Tom rather hard upon her Ay ay Gritty said the miller with a new softness in his tone but I ve allays done what I could for you he added as if vindicating himself from a reproach I m not denying that brother and I m noways ungrateful said poor missus Moss too fagged by toil and children to have strength left for any pride But here s the father What a while you ve been Moss While do you call it said mister Moss feeling out of breath and injured I ve been running all the way Won t you light mister Tulliver Well I ll just get down and have a bit o talk with you in the garden said mister Tulliver thinking that he should be more likely to show a due spirit of resolve if his sister were not present He got down and passed with mister Moss into the garden toward an old yew tree arbor while his sister stood tapping her baby on the back and looking wistfully after them Their entrance into the yew tree arbor surprised several fowls that were recreating themselves by scratching deep holes in the dusty ground and at once took flight with much pother and cackling mister Tulliver sat down on the bench and tapping the ground curiously here and there with his stick as if he suspected some hollowness opened the conversation by observing with something like a snarl in his tone Why you ve got wheat again in that Corner Close I see and never a bit o dressing on it You ll do no good with it this year mister Moss who when he married Miss Tulliver had been regarded as the buck of Basset now wore a beard nearly a week old and had the depressed unexpectant air of a machine horse He answered in a patient grumbling tone Why poor farmers like me must do as they can they must leave it to them as have got money to play with to put half as much into the ground as they mean to get out of it I don t know who should have money to play with if it isn t them as can borrow money without paying interest said mister Tulliver who wished to get into a slight quarrel it was the most natural and easy introduction to calling in money I know I m behind with the interest said mister Moss but I was so unlucky wi the wool last year and what with the Missis being laid up so things have gone awk arder nor usual Ay snarled mister Tulliver there s folks as things ull allays go awk ard with empty sacks ull never stand upright Well I don t know what fault you ve got to find wi me mister Tulliver said mister Moss deprecatingly I know there isn t a day laborer works harder What s the use o that said mister Tulliver sharply when a man marries and s got no capital to work his farm but his wife s bit o fortin I was against it from the first but you d neither of you listen to me And I can t lie out o my money any longer for I ve got to pay five hundred o missus Glegg s and there ll be Tom an expense to me I should find myself short even saying I d got back all as is my own You must look about and see how you can pay me the three hundred pound Well if that s what you mean said mister Moss looking blankly before him we d better be sold up and ha done with it I must part wi every head o stock I ve got to pay you and the landlord too Poor relations are undeniably irritating their existence is so entirely uncalled for on our part and they are almost always very faulty people mister Tulliver had succeeded in getting quite as much irritated with mister Moss as he had desired and he was able to say angrily rising from his seat Well you must do as you can I can t find money for everybody else as well as myself I must look to my own business and my own family I can t lie out o my money any longer You must raise it as quick as you can mister Tulliver walked abruptly out of the arbor as he uttered the last sentence and without looking round at mister Moss went on to the kitchen door where the eldest boy was holding his horse and his sister was waiting in a state of wondering alarm which was not without its alleviations for baby was making pleasant gurgling sounds and performing a great deal of finger practice on the faded face missus Moss had eight children but could never overcome her regret that the twins had not lived mister Moss thought their removal was not without its consolations Won t you come in brother she said looking anxiously at her husband who was walking slowly up while mister Tulliver had his foot already in the stirrup No no good by said he turning his horse s head and riding away No man could feel more resolute till he got outside the yard gate and a little way along the deep rutted lane but before he reached the next turning which would take him out of sight of the dilapidated farm buildings he appeared to be smitten by some sudden thought He checked his horse and made it stand still in the same spot for two or three minutes during which he turned his head from side to side in a melancholy way as if he were looking at some painful object on more sides than one Evidently after his fit of promptitude mister Tulliver was relapsing into the sense that this is a puzzling world He turned his horse and rode slowly back giving vent to the climax of feeling which had determined this movement by saying aloud as he struck his horse Poor little wench she ll have nobody but Tom belike when I m gone mister Tulliver s return into the yard was descried by several young Mosses who immediately ran in with the exciting news to their mother so that missus Moss was again on the door step when her brother rode up She had been crying but was rocking baby to sleep in her arms now and made no ostentatious show of sorrow as her brother looked at her but merely said The father s gone to the field again if you want him brother No Gritty no said mister Tulliver in a gentle tone Don t you fret that s all I ll make a shift without the money a bit only you must be as clever and contriving as you can missus Moss s tears came again at this unexpected kindness and she could say nothing Come come the little wench shall come and see you I ll bring her and Tom some day before he goes to school You mustn t fret I ll allays be a good brother to you Thank you for that word brother said missus Moss drying her tears then turning to Lizzy she said Run now and fetch the colored egg for cousin Maggie Lizzy ran in and quickly reappeared with a small paper parcel It s boiled hard brother and colored with thrums very pretty it was done o purpose for Maggie Will you please to carry it in your pocket Ay ay said mister Tulliver putting it carefully in his side pocket Good by And so the respectable miller returned along the Basset lanes rather more puzzled than before as to ways and means but still with the sense of a danger escaped It had come across his mind that if he were hard upon his sister it might somehow tend to make Tom hard upon Maggie at some distant day when her father was no longer there to take her part for simple people like our friend mister Tulliver are apt to clothe unimpeachable feelings in erroneous ideas and this was his confused way of explaining to himself that his love and anxiety for the little wench had given him a new sensibility toward his sister Chapter IX To Garum Firs While the possible troubles of Maggie s future were occupying her father s mind she herself was tasting only the bitterness of the present Childhood has no forebodings but then it is soothed by no memories of outlived sorrow The fact was the day had begun ill with Maggie The pleasure of having Lucy to look at and the prospect of the afternoon visit to Garum Firs where she would hear uncle Pullet s musical box had been marred as early as eleven o clock by the advent of the hair dresser from saint Ogg s who had spoken in the severest terms of the condition in which he had found her hair holding up one jagged lock after another and saying See here tut tut tut in a tone of mingled disgust and pity which to Maggie s imagination was equivalent to the strongest expression of public opinion mister Rappit the hair dresser with his well anointed coronal locks tending wavily upward like the simulated pyramid of flame on a monumental urn seemed to her at that moment the most formidable of her contemporaries into whose street at saint Ogg s she would carefully refrain from entering through the rest of her life Moreover the preparation for a visit being always a serious affair in the Dodson family Martha was enjoined to have missus Tulliver s room ready an hour earlier than usual that the laying out of the best clothes might not be deferred till the last moment as was sometimes the case in families of lax views where the ribbon strings were never rolled up where there was little or no wrapping in silver paper and where the sense that the Sunday clothes could be got at quite easily produced no shock to the mind Already at twelve o clock missus Tulliver had on her visiting costume with a protective apparatus of brown holland as if she had been a piece of satin furniture in danger of flies Maggie was frowning and twisting her shoulders that she might if possible shrink away from the prickliest of tuckers while her mother was remonstrating Don t Maggie my dear don t make yourself so ugly and Tom s cheeks were looking particularly brilliant as a relief to his best blue suit which he wore with becoming calmness having after a little wrangling effected what was always the one point of interest to him in his toilet he had transferred all the contents of his every day pockets to those actually in wear As for Lucy she was just as pretty and neat as she had been yesterday no accidents ever happened to her clothes and she was never uncomfortable in them so that she looked with wondering pity at Maggie pouting and writhing under the exasperating tucker Maggie would certainly have torn it off if she had not been checked by the remembrance of her recent humiliation about her hair as it was she confined herself to fretting and twisting and behaving peevishly about the card houses which they were allowed to build till dinner as a suitable amusement for boys and girls in their best clothes Tom could build perfect pyramids of houses but Maggie s would never bear the laying on the roof It was always so with the things that Maggie made and Tom had deduced the conclusion that no girls could ever make anything But it happened that Lucy proved wonderfully clever at building she handled the cards so lightly and moved so gently that Tom condescended to admire her houses as well as his own the more readily because she had asked him to teach her Maggie too would have admired Lucy s houses and would have given up her own unsuccessful building to contemplate them without ill temper if her tucker had not made her peevish and if Tom had not inconsiderately laughed when her houses fell and told her she was a stupid Don t laugh at me Tom she burst out angrily I m not a stupid I know a great many things you don t Oh I dare say Miss Spitfire I d never be such a cross thing as you making faces like that Lucy doesn t do so I like Lucy better than you I wish Lucy was my sister Then it s very wicked and cruel of you to wish so said Maggie starting up hurriedly from her place on the floor and upsetting Tom s wonderful pagoda She really did not mean it but the circumstantial evidence was against her and Tom turned white with anger but said nothing he would have struck her only he knew it was cowardly to strike a girl and Tom Tulliver was quite determined he would never do anything cowardly Maggie stood in dismay and terror while Tom got up from the floor and walked away pale from the scattered ruins of his pagoda and Lucy looked on mutely like a kitten pausing from its lapping Oh Tom said Maggie at last going half way toward him I didn t mean to knock it down indeed indeed I didn t Tom took no notice of her but took instead two or three hard peas out of his pocket and shot them with his thumbnail against the window vaguely at first but presently with the distinct aim of hitting a superannuated blue bottle which was exposing its imbecility in the spring sunshine clearly against the views of Nature who had provided Tom and the peas for the speedy destruction of this weak individual Thus the morning had been made heavy to Maggie and Tom s persistent coldness to her all through their walk spoiled the fresh air and sunshine for her He called Lucy to look at the half built bird s nest without caring to show it Maggie and peeled a willow switch for Lucy and himself without offering one to Maggie Lucy had said Maggie shouldn t you like one but Tom was deaf Still the sight of the peacock opportunely spreading his tail on the stackyard wall just as they reached Garum Firs was enough to divert the mind temporarily from personal grievances And this was only the beginning of beautiful sights at Garum Firs All the farmyard life was wonderful there bantams speckled and top knotted Friesland hens with their feathers all turned the wrong way Guinea fowls that flew and screamed and dropped their pretty spotted feathers pouter pigeons and a tame magpie nay a goat and a wonderful brindled dog half mastiff half bull dog as large as a lion Then there were white railings and white gates all about and glittering weathercocks of various design and garden walks paved with pebbles in beautiful patterns nothing was quite common at Garum Firs and Tom thought that the unusual size of the toads there was simply due to the general unusualness which characterized uncle Pullet s possessions as a gentleman farmer Toads who paid rent were naturally leaner As for the house it was not less remarkable it had a receding centre and two wings with battlemented turrets and was covered with glittering white stucco Uncle Pullet had seen the expected party approaching from the window and made haste to unbar and unchain the front door kept always in this fortified condition from fear of tramps who might be supposed to know of the glass case of stuffed birds in the hall and to contemplate rushing in and carrying it away on their heads Aunt Pullet too appeared at the doorway and as soon as her sister was within hearing said Stop the children for God s sake Bessy don t let em come up the door steps Sally s bringing the old mat and the duster to rub their shoes missus Pullet s front door mats were by no means intended to wipe shoes on the very scraper had a deputy to do its dirty work Tom rebelled particularly against this shoewiping which he always considered in the light of an indignity to his sex He felt it as the beginning of the disagreeables incident to a visit at aunt Pullet s where he had once been compelled to sit with towels wrapped round his boots a fact which may serve to correct the too hasty conclusion that a visit to Garum Firs must have been a great treat to a young gentleman fond of animals fond that is of throwing stones at them The next disagreeable was confined to his feminine companions it was the mounting of the polished oak stairs which had very handsome carpets rolled up and laid by in a spare bedroom so that the ascent of these glossy steps might have served in barbarous times as a trial by ordeal from which none but the most spotless virtue could have come off with unbroken limbs Sophy s weakness about these polished stairs was always a subject of bitter remonstrance on missus Glegg s part but missus Tulliver ventured on no comment only thinking to herself it was a mercy when she and the children were safe on the landing missus Gray has sent home my new bonnet Bessy said missus Pullet in a pathetic tone as missus Tulliver adjusted her cap Has she sister said missus Tulliver with an air of much interest And how do you like it It s apt to make a mess with clothes taking em out and putting em in again said missus Pullet drawing a bunch of keys from her pocket and looking at them earnestly but it ud be a pity for you to go away without seeing it There s no knowing what may happen missus Pullet shook her head slowly at this last serious consideration which determined her to single out a particular key I m afraid it ll be troublesome to you getting it out sister said missus Tulliver but I should like to see what sort of a crown she s made you missus Pullet rose with a melancholy air and unlocked one wing of a very bright wardrobe where you may have hastily supposed she would find a new bonnet Not at all Such a supposition could only have arisen from a too superficial acquaintance with the habits of the Dodson family In this wardrobe missus Pullet was seeking something small enough to be hidden among layers of linen it was a door key You must come with me into the best room said missus Pullet May the children come too sister inquired missus Tulliver who saw that Maggie and Lucy were looking rather eager Well said aunt Pullet reflectively it ll perhaps be safer for em to come they ll be touching something if we leave em behind So they went in procession along the bright and slippery corridor dimly lighted by the semi lunar top of the window which rose above the closed shutter it was really quite solemn Aunt Pullet paused and unlocked a door which opened on something still more solemn than the passage a darkened room in which the outer light entering feebly showed what looked like the corpses of furniture in white shrouds Everything that was not shrouded stood with its legs upward Lucy laid hold of Maggie s frock and Maggie s heart beat rapidly Aunt Pullet half opened the shutter and then unlocked the wardrobe with a melancholy deliberateness which was quite in keeping with the funereal solemnity of the scene The delicious scent of rose leaves that issued from the wardrobe made the process of taking out sheet after sheet of silver paper quite pleasant to assist at though the sight of the bonnet at last was an anticlimax to Maggie who would have preferred something more strikingly preternatural But few things could have been more impressive to missus Tulliver She looked all round it in silence for some moments and then said emphatically Well sister I ll never speak against the full crowns again It was a great concession and missus Pullet felt it she felt something was due to it You d like to see it on sister she said sadly I ll open the shutter a bit further Well if you don t mind taking off your cap sister said missus Tulliver missus Pullet took off her cap displaying the brown silk scalp with a jutting promontory of curls which was common to the more mature and judicious women of those times and placing the bonnet on her head turned slowly round like a draper s lay figure that missus Tulliver might miss no point of view I ve sometimes thought there s a loop too much o ribbon on this left side sister what do you think said missus Pullet missus Tulliver looked earnestly at the point indicated and turned her head on one side Well I think it s best as it is if you meddled with it sister you might repent That s true said aunt Pullet taking off the bonnet and looking at it contemplatively How much might she charge you for that bonnet sister said missus Tulliver whose mind was actively engaged on the possibility of getting a humble imitation of this chef d oeuvre made from a piece of silk she had at home missus Pullet screwed up her mouth and shook her head and then whispered Pullet pays for it he said I was to have the best bonnet at Garum Church let the next best be whose it would She began slowly to adjust the trimmings in preparation for returning it to its place in the wardrobe and her thoughts seemed to have taken a melancholy turn for she shook her head Ah she said at last I may never wear it twice sister who knows Don t talk o that sister answered missus Tulliver I hope you ll have your health this summer Ah but there may come a death in the family as there did soon after I had my green satin bonnet Cousin Abbott may go and we can t think o wearing crape less nor half a year for him That would be unlucky said missus Tulliver entering thoroughly into the possibility of an inopportune decease There s never so much pleasure i wearing a bonnet the second year especially when the crowns are so chancy never two summers alike Ah it s the way i this world said missus Pullet returning the bonnet to the wardrobe and locking it up She maintained a silence characterized by head shaking until they had all issued from the solemn chamber and were in her own room again Then beginning to cry she said Sister if you should never see that bonnet again till I m dead and gone you ll remember I showed it you this day missus Tulliver felt that she ought to be affected but she was a woman of sparse tears stout and healthy she couldn t cry so much as her sister Pullet did and had often felt her deficiency at funerals Her effort to bring tears into her eyes issued in an odd contraction of her face Maggie looking on attentively felt that there was some painful mystery about her aunt s bonnet which she was considered too young to understand indignantly conscious all the while that she could have understood that as well as everything else if she had been taken into confidence When they went down uncle Pullet observed with some acumen that he reckoned the missis had been showing her bonnet that was what had made them so long upstairs With Tom the interval had seemed still longer for he had been seated in irksome constraint on the edge of a sofa directly opposite his uncle Pullet who regarded him with twinkling gray eyes and occasionally addressed him as Young sir Well young sir what do you learn at school was a standing question with uncle Pullet whereupon Tom always looked sheepish rubbed his hands across his face and answered I don t know It was altogether so embarrassing to be seated tete a tete with uncle Pullet that Tom could not even look at the prints on the walls or the flycages or the wonderful flower pots he saw nothing but his uncle s gaiters Not that Tom was in awe of his uncle s mental superiority indeed he had made up his mind that he didn t want to be a gentleman farmer because he shouldn t like to be such a thin legged silly fellow as his uncle Pullet a molly coddle in fact A boy s sheepishness is by no means a sign of overmastering reverence and while you are making encouraging advances to him under the idea that he is overwhelmed by a sense of your age and wisdom ten to one he is thinking you extremely queer The only consolation I can suggest to you is that the Greek boys probably thought the same of Aristotle It is only when you have mastered a restive horse or thrashed a drayman or have got a gun in your hand that these shy juniors feel you to be a truly admirable and enviable character At least I am quite sure of Tom Tulliver s sentiments on these points In very tender years when he still wore a lace border under his outdoor cap he was often observed peeping through the bars of a gate and making minatory gestures with his small forefinger while he scolded the sheep with an inarticulate burr intended to strike terror into their astonished minds indicating thus early that desire for mastery over the inferior animals wild and domestic including cockchafers neighbors dogs and small sisters which in all ages has been an attribute of so much promise for the fortunes of our race Now mister Pullet never rode anything taller than a low pony and was the least predatory of men considering firearms dangerous as apt to go off of themselves by nobody s particular desire So that Tom was not without strong reasons when in confidential talk with a chum he had described uncle Pullet as a nincompoop taking care at the same time to observe that he was a very rich fellow The only alleviating circumstance in a tete a tete with uncle Pullet was that he kept a variety of lozenges and peppermint drops about his person and when at a loss for conversation he filled up the void by proposing a mutual solace of this kind Do you like peppermints young sir required only a tacit answer when it was accompanied by a presentation of the article in question The appearance of the little girls suggested to uncle Pullet the further solace of small sweet cakes of which he also kept a stock under lock and key for his own private eating on wet days but the three children had no sooner got the tempting delicacy between their fingers than aunt Pullet desired them to abstain from eating it till the tray and the plates came since with those crisp cakes they would make the floor all over crumbs Lucy didn t mind that much for the cake was so pretty she thought it was rather a pity to eat it but Tom watching his opportunity while the elders were talking hastily stowed it in his mouth at two bites and chewed it furtively As for Maggie becoming fascinated as usual by a print of Ulysses and Nausicaa which uncle Pullet had bought as a pretty Scripture thing she presently let fall her cake and in an unlucky movement crushed it beneath her foot a source of so much agitation to aunt Pullet and conscious disgrace to Maggie that she began to despair of hearing the musical snuff box to day till after some reflection it occurred to her that Lucy was in high favor enough to venture on asking for a tune So she whispered to Lucy and Lucy who always did what she was desired to do went up quietly to her uncle s knee and blush all over her neck while she fingered her necklace said Will you please play us a tune uncle Lucy thought it was by reason of some exceptional talent in uncle Pullet that the snuff box played such beautiful tunes and indeed the thing was viewed in that light by the majority of his neighbors in Garum mister Pullet had bought the box to begin with and he understood winding it up and knew which tune it was going to play beforehand altogether the possession of this unique piece of music was a proof that mister Pullet s character was not of that entire nullity which might otherwise have been attributed to it But uncle Pullet when entreated to exhibit his accomplishment never depreciated it by a too ready consent We ll see about it was the answer he always gave carefully abstaining from any sign of compliance till a suitable number of minutes had passed Uncle Pullet had a programme for all great social occasions and in this way fenced himself in from much painful confusion and perplexing freedom of will Perhaps the suspense did heighten Maggie s enjoyment when the fairy tune began for the first time she quite forgot that she had a load on her mind that Tom was angry with her and by the time Hush ye pretty warbling choir had been played her face wore that bright look of happiness while she sat immovable with her hands clasped which sometimes comforted her mother with the sense that Maggie could look pretty now and then in spite of her brown skin But when the magic music ceased she jumped up and running toward Tom put her arm round his neck and said Oh Tom isn t it pretty Lest you should think it showed a revolting insensibility in Tom that he felt any new anger toward Maggie for this uncalled for and to him inexplicable caress I must tell you that he had his glass of cowslip wine in his hand and that she jerked him so as to make him spill half of it He must have been an extreme milksop not to say angrily Look there now especially when his resentment was sanctioned as it was by general disapprobation of Maggie s behavior Why don t you sit still Maggie her mother said peevishly Little gells mustn t come to see me if they behave in that way said aunt Pullet Why you re too rough little miss said uncle Pullet Poor Maggie sat down again with the music all chased out of her soul and the seven small demons all in again missus Tulliver foreseeing nothing but misbehavior while the children remained indoors took an early opportunity of suggesting that now they were rested after their walk they might go and play out of doors and aunt Pullet gave permission only enjoining them not to go off the paved walks in the garden and if they wanted to see the poultry fed to view them from a distance on the horse block a restriction which had been imposed ever since Tom had been found guilty of running after the peacock with an illusory idea that fright would make one of its feathers drop off missus Tulliver s thoughts had been temporarily diverted from the quarrel with missus Glegg by millinery and maternal cares but now the great theme of the bonnet was thrown into perspective and the children were out of the way yesterday s anxieties recurred It weighs on my mind so as never was she said by way of opening the subject sister Glegg s leaving the house in that way I m sure I d no wish t offend a sister Ah said aunt Pullet there s no accounting for what Jane ull do I wouldn t speak of it out o the family if it wasn t to doctor Turnbull but it s my belief Jane lives too low I ve said so to Pullet often and often and he knows it Why you said so last Monday was a week when we came away from drinking tea with em said mister Pullet beginning to nurse his knee and shelter it with his pocket hand kerchief as was his way when the conversation took an interesting turn Very like I did said missus Pullet for you remember when I said things better than I can remember myself He s got a wonderful memory Pullet has she continued looking pathetically at her sister I should be poorly off if he was to have a stroke for he always remembers when I ve got to take my doctor s stuff and I m taking three sorts now There s the pills as before every other night and the new drops at eleven and four and the fervescing mixture when agreeable rehearsed mister Pullet with a punctuation determined by a lozenge on his tongue Ah perhaps it ud be better for sister Glegg if she d go to the doctor sometimes instead o chewing Turkey rhubarb whenever there s anything the matter with her said missus Tulliver who naturally saw the wide subject of medicine chiefly in relation to missus Glegg It s dreadful to think on said aunt Pullet raising her hands and letting them fall again people playing with their own insides in that way And it s flying i the face o Providence for what are the doctors for if we aren t to call em in And when folks have got the money to pay for a doctor it isn t respectable as I ve told Jane many a time I m ashamed of acquaintance knowing it Well we ve no call to be ashamed said mister Pullet for Doctor Turnbull hasn t got such another patient as you i this parish now old missus Sutton s gone Pullet keeps all my physic bottles did you know Bessy said missus Pullet He won t have one sold He says it s nothing but right folks should see em when I m gone They fill two o the long store room shelves a ready but she added beginning to cry a little it s well if they ever fill three I may go before I ve made up the dozen o these last sizes The pill boxes are in the closet in my room you ll remember that sister but there s nothing to show for the boluses if it isn t the bills Don t talk o your going sister said missus Tulliver I should have nobody to stand between me and sister Glegg if you was gone And there s nobody but you can get her to make it up with mister Tulliver for sister Deane s never o my side and if she was it s not to be looked for as she can speak like them as have got an independent fortin Well your husband is awk ard you know Bessy said missus Pullet good naturedly ready to use her deep depression on her sister s account as well as her own He s never behaved quite so pretty to our family as he should do and the children take after him the boy s very mischievous and runs away from his aunts and uncles and the gell s rude and brown It s your bad luck and I m sorry for you Bessy for you was allays my favorite sister and we allays liked the same patterns I know Tulliver s hasty and says odd things said missus Tulliver wiping away one small tear from the corner of her eye but I m sure he s never been the man since he married me to object to my making the friends o my side o the family welcome to the house I don t want to make the worst of you Bessy said missus Pullet compassionately for I doubt you ll have trouble enough without that and your husband s got that poor sister and her children hanging on him and so given to lawing they say I doubt he ll leave you poorly off when he dies Not as I d have it said out o the family This view of her position was naturally far from cheering to missus Tulliver Her imagination was not easily acted on but she could not help thinking that her case was a hard one since it appeared that other people thought it hard I m sure sister I can t help myself she said urged by the fear lest her anticipated misfortunes might be held retributive to take comprehensive review of her past conduct There s no woman strives more for her children and I m sure at scouring time this Lady day as I ve had all the bedhangings taken down I did as much as the two gells put together and there s the last elder flower wine I ve made beautiful I allays offer it along with the sherry though sister Glegg will have it I m so extravagant and as for liking to have my clothes tidy and not go a fright about the house there s nobody in the parish can say anything against me in respect o backbiting and making mischief for I don t wish anybody any harm and nobody loses by sending me a porkpie for my pies are fit to show with the best o my neighbors and the linen s so in order as if I was to die to morrow I shouldn t be ashamed A woman can do no more nor she can But it s all o no use you know Bessy said missus Pullet holding her head on one side and fixing her eyes pathetically on her sister if your husband makes away with his money Not but what if you was sold up and other folks bought your furniture it s a comfort to think as you ve kept it well rubbed And there s the linen with your maiden mark on might go all over the country It ud be a sad pity for our family missus Pullet shook her head slowly But what can I do sister said missus Tulliver mister Tulliver s not a man to be dictated to not if I was to go to the parson and get by heart what I should tell my husband for the best And I m sure I don t pretend to know anything about putting out money and all that I could never see into men s business as sister Glegg does Well you re like me in that Bessy said missus Pullet and I think it ud be a deal more becoming o Jane if she d have that pier glass rubbed oftener there was ever so many spots on it last week instead o dictating to folks as have more comings in than she ever had and telling em what they re to do with their money But Jane and me were allays contrairy she would have striped things and I like spots You like a spot too Bessy we allays hung together i that Yes Sophy said missus Tulliver I remember our having a blue ground with a white spot both alike I ve got a bit in a bed quilt now and if you would but go and see sister Glegg and persuade her to make it up with Tulliver I should take it very kind of you You was allays a good sister to me But the right thing ud be for Tulliver to go and make it up with her himself and say he was sorry for speaking so rash If he s borrowed money of her he shouldn t be above that said missus Pullet whose partiality did not blind her to principles she did not forget what was due to people of independent fortune It s no use talking o that said poor missus Tulliver almost peevishly If I was to go down on my bare knees on the gravel to Tulliver he d never humble himself Well you can t expect me to persuade Jane to beg pardon said missus Pullet Her temper s beyond everything it s well if it doesn t carry her off her mind though there never was any of our family went to a madhouse I m not thinking of her begging pardon said missus Tulliver But if she d just take no notice and not call her money in as it s not so much for one sister to ask of another time ud mend things and Tulliver ud forget all about it and they d be friends again missus Tulliver you perceive was not aware of her husband s irrevocable determination to pay in the five hundred pounds at least such a determination exceeded her powers of belief Well Bessy said missus Pullet mournfully I don t want to help you on to ruin I won t be behindhand i doing you a good turn if it is to be done And I don t like it said among acquaintance as we ve got quarrels in the family I shall tell Jane that and I don t mind driving to Jane s tomorrow if Pullet doesn t mind What do you say mister Pullet I ve no objections said mister Pullet who was perfectly contented with any course the quarrel might take so that mister Tulliver did not apply to him for money mister Pullet was nervous about his investments and did not see how a man could have any security for his money unless he turned it into land After a little further discussion as to whether it would not be better for missus Tulliver to accompany them on a visit to sister Glegg missus Pullet observing that it was tea time turned to reach from a drawer a delicate damask napkin which she pinned before her in the fashion of an apron The door did in fact soon open but instead of the tea tray Sally introduced an object so startling that both missus Pullet and missus Tulliver gave a scream causing uncle Pullet to swallow his lozenge for the fifth time in his life as he afterward noted Chapter X Maggie Behaves Worse Than She Expected The startling object which thus made an epoch for uncle Pullet was no other than little Lucy with one side of her person from her small foot to her bonnet crown wet and discolored with mud holding out two tiny blackened hands and making a very piteous face To account for this unprecedented apparition in aunt Pullet s parlor we must return to the moment when the three children went to play out of doors and the small demons who had taken possession of Maggie s soul at an early period of the day had returned in all the greater force after a temporary absence All the disagreeable recollections of the morning were thick upon her when Tom whose displeasure toward her had been considerably refreshed by her foolish trick of causing him to upset his cowslip wine said Here Lucy you come along with me and walked off to the area where the toads were as if there were no Maggie in existence Seeing this Maggie lingered at a distance looking like a small Medusa with her snakes cropped Lucy was naturally pleased that cousin Tom was so good to her and it was very amusing to see him tickling a fat toad with a piece of string when the toad was safe down the area with an iron grating over him Still Lucy wished Maggie to enjoy the spectacle also especially as she would doubtless find a name for the toad and say what had been his past history for Lucy had a delighted semibelief in Maggie s stories about the live things they came upon by accident how missus Earwig had a wash at home and one of her children had fallen into the hot copper for which reason she was running so fast to fetch the doctor Tom had a profound contempt for this nonsense of Maggie s smashing the earwig at once as a superfluous yet easy means of proving the entire unreality of such a story but Lucy for the life of her could not help fancying there was something in it and at all events thought it was very pretty make believe So now the desire to know the history of a very portly toad added to her habitual affectionateness made her run back to Maggie and say Oh there is such a big funny toad Maggie Do come and see Maggie said nothing but turned away from her with a deeper frown As long as Tom seemed to prefer Lucy to her Lucy made part of his unkindness Maggie would have thought a little while ago that she could never be cross with pretty little Lucy any more than she could be cruel to a little white mouse but then Tom had always been quite indifferent to Lucy before and it had been left to Maggie to pet and make much of her As it was she was actually beginning to think that she should like to make Lucy cry by slapping or pinching her especially as it might vex Tom whom it was of no use to slap even if she dared because he didn t mind it And if Lucy hadn t been there Maggie was sure he would have got friends with her sooner Tickling a fat toad who is not highly sensitive is an amusement that it is possible to exhaust and Tom by and by began to look round for some other mode of passing the time But in so prim a garden where they were not to go off the paved walks there was not a great choice of sport The only great pleasure such a restriction suggested was the pleasure of breaking it and Tom began to meditate an insurrectionary visit to the pond about a field s length beyond the garden I say Lucy he began nodding his head up and down with great significance as he coiled up his string again what do you think I mean to do What Tom said Lucy with curiosity I mean to go to the pond and look at the pike You may go with me if you like said the young sultan Oh Tom dare you said Lucy Aunt said we mustn t go out of the garden Oh I shall go out at the other end of the garden said Tom Nobody ull see us Besides I don t care if they do I ll run off home But I couldn t run said Lucy who had never before been exposed to such severe temptation Oh never mind they won t be cross with you said Tom You say I took you Tom walked along and Lucy trotted by his side timidly enjoying the rare treat of doing something naughty excited also by the mention of that celebrity the pike about which she was quite uncertain whether it was a fish or a fowl Maggie saw them leaving the garden and could not resist the impulse to follow Anger and jealousy can no more bear to lose sight of their objects than love and that Tom and Lucy should do or see anything of which she was ignorant would have been an intolerable idea to Maggie So she kept a few yards behind them unobserved by Tom who was presently absorbed in watching for the pike a highly interesting monster he was said to be so very old so very large and to have such a remarkable appetite The pike like other celebrities did not show when he was watched for but Tom caught sight of something in rapid movement in the water which attracted him to another spot on the brink of the pond Here Lucy he said in a loud whisper come here take care keep on the grass don t step where the cows have been he added pointing to a peninsula of dry grass with trodden mud on each side of it for Tom s contemptuous conception of a girl included the attribute of being unfit to walk in dirty places Lucy came carefully as she was bidden and bent down to look at what seemed a golden arrow head darting through the water It was a water snake Tom told her and Lucy at last could see the serpentine wave of its body very much wondering that a snake could swim Maggie had drawn nearer and nearer she must see it too though it was bitter to her like everything else since Tom did not care about her seeing it At last she was close by Lucy and Tom who had been aware of her approach but would not notice it till he was obliged turned round and said Now get away Maggie there s no room for you on the grass here Nobody asked you to come There were passions at war in Maggie at that moment to have made a tragedy if tragedies were made by passion only but the essential Greek text which was present in the passion was wanting to the action the utmost Maggie could do with a fierce thrust of her small brown arm was to push poor little pink and white Lucy into the cow trodden mud Then Tom could not restrain himself and gave Maggie two smart slaps on the arm as he ran to pick up Lucy who lay crying helplessly Maggie retreated to the roots of a tree a few yards off and looked on impenitently Usually her repentance came quickly after one rash deed but now Tom and Lucy had made her so miserable she was glad to spoil their happiness glad to make everybody uncomfortable Why should she be sorry Tom was very slow to forgive her however sorry she might have been I shall tell mother you know Miss Mag said Tom loudly and emphatically as soon as Lucy was up and ready to walk away It was not Tom s practice to tell but here justice clearly demanded that Maggie should be visited with the utmost punishment not that Tom had learned to put his views in that abstract form he never mentioned justice and had no idea that his desire to punish might be called by that fine name Lucy was too entirely absorbed by the evil that had befallen her the spoiling of her pretty best clothes and the discomfort of being wet and dirty to think much of the cause which was entirely mysterious to her She could never have guessed what she had done to make Maggie angry with her but she felt that Maggie was very unkind and disagreeable and made no magnanimous entreaties to Tom that he would not tell only running along by his side and crying piteously while Maggie sat on the roots of the tree and looked after them with her small Medusa face Sally said Tom when they reached the kitchen door and Sally looked at them in speechless amaze with a piece of bread and butter in her mouth and a toasting fork in her hand Sally tell mother it was Maggie pushed Lucy into the mud But Lors ha massy how did you get near such mud as that said Sally making a wry face as she stooped down and examined the corpus delicti Tom s imagination had not been rapid and capacious enough to include this question among the foreseen consequences but it was no sooner put than he foresaw whither it tended and that Maggie would not be considered the only culprit in the case He walked quietly away from the kitchen door leaving Sally to that pleasure of guessing which active minds notoriously prefer to ready made knowledge Sally as you are aware lost no time in presenting Lucy at the parlor door for to have so dirty an object introduced into the house at Garum Firs was too great a weight to be sustained by a single mind Goodness gracious aunt Pullet exclaimed after preluding by an inarticulate scream keep her at the door Sally Don t bring her off the oil cloth whatever you do Why she s tumbled into some nasty mud said missus Tulliver going up to Lucy to examine into the amount of damage to clothes for which she felt herself responsible to her sister Deane If you please um it was Miss Maggie as pushed her in said Sally Master Tom s been and said so and they must ha been to the pond for it s only there they could ha got into such dirt There it is Bessy it s what I ve been telling you said missus Pullet in a tone of prophetic sadness it s your children there s no knowing what they ll come to missus Tulliver was mute feeling herself a truly wretched mother As usual the thought pressed upon her that people would think she had done something wicked to deserve her maternal troubles while missus Pullet began to give elaborate directions to Sally how to guard the premises from serious injury in the course of removing the dirt Meantime tea was to be brought in by the cook and the two naughty children were to have theirs in an ignominious manner in the kitchen missus Tulliver went out to speak to these naughty children supposing them to be close at hand but it was not until after some search that she found Tom leaning with rather a hardened careless air against the white paling of the poultry yard and lowering his piece of string on the other side as a means of exasperating the turkey cock Tom you naughty boy where s your sister said missus Tulliver in a distressed voice I don t know said Tom his eagerness for justice on Maggie had diminished since he had seen clearly that it could hardly be brought about without the injustice of some blame on his own conduct Why where did you leave her said the mother looking round Sitting under the tree against the pond said Tom apparently indifferent to everything but the string and the turkey cock Then go and fetch her in this minute you naughty boy And how could you think o going to the pond and taking your sister where there was dirt You know she ll do mischief if there s mischief to be done It was missus Tulliver s way if she blamed Tom to refer his misdemeanor somehow or other to Maggie The idea of Maggie sitting alone by the pond roused an habitual fear in missus Tulliver s mind and she mounted the horse block to satisfy herself by a sight of that fatal child while Tom walked not very quickly on his way toward her They re such children for the water mine are she said aloud without reflecting that there was no one to hear her they ll be brought in dead and drownded some day I wish that river was far enough But when she not only failed to discern Maggie but presently saw Tom returning from the pool alone this hovering fear entered and took complete possession of her and she hurried to meet him Maggie s nowhere about the pond mother said Tom she s gone away You may conceive the terrified search for Maggie and the difficulty of convincing her mother that she was not in the pond missus Pullet observed that the child might come to a worse end if she lived there was no knowing and mister Pullet confused and overwhelmed by this revolutionary aspect of things the tea deferred and the poultry alarmed by the unusual running to and fro took up his spud as an instrument of search and reached down a key to unlock the goose pen as a likely place for Maggie to lie concealed in Tom after a while started the idea that Maggie was gone home without thinking it necessary to state that it was what he should have done himself under the circumstances and the suggestion was seized as a comfort by his mother Sister for goodness sake let em put the horse in the carriage and take me home we shall perhaps find her on the road Lucy can t walk in her dirty clothes she said looking at that innocent victim who was wrapped up in a shawl and sitting with naked feet on the sofa Aunt Pullet was quite willing to take the shortest means of restoring her premises to order and quiet and it was not long before missus Tulliver was in the chaise looking anxiously at the most distant point before her What the father would say if Maggie was lost was a question that predominated over every other Chapter XI Maggie Tries to Run away from Her Shadow 
2351-151965-0000	train-other-500	Maggie s intentions as usual were on a larger scale than Tom imagined The resolution that gathered in her mind after Tom and Lucy had walked away was not so simple as that of going home No
2351-151965-0001	train-other-500	she would run away and go to the gypsies and Tom should never see her any more That was by no means a new idea to Maggie she had been so often told she was like a gypsy and half wild
2351-151965-0002	train-other-500	that when she was miserable it seemed to her the only way of escaping opprobrium and being entirely in harmony with circumstances would be to live in a little brown tent on the commons the gypsies she considered would gladly receive her
2351-151965-0003	train-other-500	and pay her much respect on account of her superior knowledge She had once mentioned her views on this point to Tom and suggested that he should stain his face brown and they should run away together but Tom rejected the scheme with contempt
2351-151965-0004	train-other-500	observing that gypsies were thieves and hardly got anything to eat and had nothing to drive but a donkey To day however Maggie thought her misery had reached a pitch at which gypsydom was her refuge
2351-151965-0005	train-other-500	and she rose from her seat on the roots of the tree with the sense that this was a great crisis in her life she would run straight away till she came to Dunlow Common where there would certainly be gypsies and cruel Tom
2351-151965-0006	train-other-500	and the rest of her relations who found fault with her should never see her any more She thought of her father as she ran along but she reconciled herself to the idea of parting with him
2351-151965-0007	train-other-500	by determining that she would secretly send him a letter by a small gypsy who would run away without telling where she was and just let him know that she was well and happy and always loved him very much
none	none	 Maggie soon got out of breath with running but by the time Tom got to the pond again she was at the distance of three long fields and was on the edge of the lane leading to the highroad She stopped to pant a little 
2351-151965-0008	train-other-500	reflecting that running away was not a pleasant thing until one had got quite to the common where the gypsies were but her resolution had not abated she presently passed through the gate into the lane not knowing where it would lead her
2351-151965-0009	train-other-500	for it was not this way that they came from Dorlcote Mill to Garum Firs and she felt all the safer for that because there was no chance of her being overtaken But she was soon aware not without trembling
2351-151965-0010	train-other-500	that there were two men coming along the lane in front of her she had not thought of meeting strangers she had been too much occupied with the idea of her friends coming after her The formidable strangers were two shabby looking men with flushed faces
2351-151965-0011	train-other-500	one of them carrying a bundle on a stick over his shoulder but to her surprise while she was dreading their disapprobation as a runaway the man with the bundle stopped and in a half whining half coaxing tone
2351-151965-0012	train-other-500	asked her if she had a copper to give a poor man Maggie had a sixpence in her pocket her uncle Glegg s present which she immediately drew out and gave this poor man with a polite smile
none	none	 hoping he would feel very kindly toward her as a generous person 
2351-151965-0013	train-other-500	That s the only money I ve got she said apologetically Thank you little miss said the man in a less respectful and grateful tone than Maggie anticipated and she even observed that he smiled and winked at his companion
none	none	 She walked on hurriedly but was aware that the two men were standing still probably to look after her and she presently heard them laughing loudly Suddenly it occurred to her that they might think she was an idiot Tom had said that her cropped hair made her look like an idiot and it was too painful an idea to be readily forgotten Besides she had no sleeves on only a cape and bonnet 
2351-151965-0014	train-other-500	It was clear that she was not likely to make a favorable impression on passengers and she thought she would turn into the fields again but not on the same side of the lane as before lest they should still be uncle Pullet s fields
none	none	 She turned through the first gate that was not locked and felt a delightful sense of privacy in creeping along by the hedgerows after her recent humiliating encounter She was used to wandering about the fields by herself and was less timid there than on the highroad 
2351-151965-0015	train-other-500	Sometimes she had to climb over high gates but that was a small evil she was getting out of reach very fast and she should probably soon come within sight of Dunlow Common or at least of some other common
2351-151965-0016	train-other-500	for she had heard her father say that you couldn t go very far without coming to a common She hoped so for she was getting rather tired and hungry and until she reached the gypsies there was no definite prospect of bread and butter
none	none	 It was still broad daylight for aunt Pullet retaining the early habits of the Dodson family took tea at half past four by the sun and at five by the kitchen clock so though it was nearly an hour since Maggie started there was no gathering gloom on the fields to remind her that the night would come Still it seemed to her that she had been walking a very great distance indeed 
2351-151965-0017	train-other-500	and it was really surprising that the common did not come within sight Hitherto she had been in the rich parish of Garum where was a great deal of pasture land and she had only seen one laborer at a distance
2351-151965-0018	train-other-500	That was fortunate in some respects as laborers might be too ignorant to understand the propriety of her wanting to go to Dunlow Common yet it would have been better if she could have met some one who would tell her the way without wanting to know anything
2351-151965-0019	train-other-500	about her private business At last however the green fields came to an end and Maggie found herself looking through the bars of a gate into a lane with a wide margin of grass on each side of it
2351-151965-0020	train-other-500	She had never seen such a wide lane before and without her knowing why it gave her the impression that the common could not be far off perhaps it was because she saw a donkey with a log to his foot feeding on the grassy margin
none	none	 for she had seen a donkey with that pitiable encumbrance on Dunlow Common when she had been across it in her father s gig She crept through the bars of the gate and walked on with new spirit though not without haunting images of Apollyon and a highwayman with a pistol and a blinking dwarf in yellow with a mouth from ear to ear and other miscellaneous dangers For poor little Maggie had at once the timidity of an active imagination 
2351-151965-0021	train-other-500	and the daring that comes from overmastering impulse She had rushed into the adventure of seeking her unknown kindred the gypsies and now she was in this strange lane she hardly dared look on one side of her
2351-151965-0022	train-other-500	lest she should see the diabolical blacksmith in his leathern apron grinning at her with arms akimbo It was not without a leaping of the heart that she caught sight of a small pair of bare legs sticking up feet uppermost by the side of a hillock
none	none	 they seemed something hideously preternatural a diabolical kind of fungus for she was too much agitated at the first glance to see the ragged clothes and the dark shaggy head attached to them It was a boy 
2351-151965-0023	train-other-500	asleep and Maggie trotted along faster and more lightly lest she should wake him it did not occur to her that he was one of her friends the gypsies who in all probability would have very genial manners But the fact was so
2351-151965-0024	train-other-500	for at the next bend in the lane Maggie actually saw the little semicircular black tent with the blue smoke rising before it which was to be her refuge from all the blighting obloquy that had pursued her in civilized life
none	none	 She even saw a tall female figure by the column of smoke 
2351-151965-0025	train-other-500	doubtless the gypsy mother who provided the tea and other groceries it was astonishing to herself that she did not feel more delighted But it was startling to find the gypsies in a lane after all and not on a common indeed
none	none	 it was rather disappointing for a mysterious illimitable common where there were sand pits to hide in and one was out of everybody s reach had always made part of Maggie s picture of gypsy life She went on however and thought with some comfort that gypsies most likely knew nothing about idiots so there was no danger of their falling into the mistake of setting her down at the first glance as an idiot It was plain she had attracted attention for the tall figure who proved to be a young woman with a baby on her arm walked slowly to meet her Maggie looked up in the new face rather tremblingly as it approached and was reassured by the thought that her aunt Pullet and the rest were right when they called her a gypsy for this face with the bright dark eyes and the long hair was really something like what she used to see in the glass before she cut her hair off My little lady where are you going to the gypsy said in a tone of coaxing deference 
2351-151965-0026	train-other-500	It was delightful and just what Maggie expected the gypsies saw at once that she was a little lady and were prepared to treat her accordingly Not any farther said Maggie feeling as if she were saying what she had rehearsed in a dream
none	none	 I m come to stay with you please That s pretty come then Why what a nice little lady you are to be sure said the gypsy 
2351-151965-0027	train-other-500	taking her by the hand Maggie thought her very agreeable but wished she had not been so dirty There was quite a group round the fire when she reached it An old gypsy woman was seated on the ground nursing her knees
none	none	 and occasionally poking a skewer into the round kettle that sent forth an odorous steam two small shock headed children were lying prone and resting on their elbows something like small sphinxes and a placid donkey was bending his head over a tall girl 
2351-151965-0028	train-other-500	who lying on her back was scratching his nose
none	none	 and indulging him with a bite of excellent stolen hay 
2351-151965-0029	train-other-500	The slanting sunlight fell kindly upon them and the scene was really very pretty and comfortable Maggie thought only she hoped they would soon set out the tea cups Everything would be quite charming
2351-151965-0030	train-other-500	when she had taught the gypsies to use a washing basin and to feel an interest in books It was a little confusing though that the young woman began to speak to the old one in a language which Maggie did not understand while the tall girl who was feeding the donkey
2351-151965-0031	train-other-500	sat up and stared at her without offering any salutation At last the old woman said What my pretty lady are you come to stay with us Sit ye down and tell us where you come from It was just like a story
2351-151965-0032	train-other-500	Maggie liked to be called pretty lady and treated in this way She sat down and said
none	none	 I m come from home because I m unhappy and I mean to be a gypsy I ll live with you if you like and I can teach you a great many things Such a clever little lady said the woman with the baby sitting down by Maggie and allowing baby to crawl and such a pretty bonnet and frock she added taking off Maggie s bonnet and looking at it while she made an observation to the old woman in the unknown language The tall girl snatched the bonnet and put it on her own head hind foremost with a grin but Maggie was determined not to show any weakness on this subject as if she were susceptible about her bonnet I don t want to wear a bonnet she said I d rather wear a red handkerchief like yours looking at her friend by her side My hair was quite long till yesterday when I cut it off but I dare say it will grow again very soon she added apologetically thinking it probable the gypsies had a strong prejudice in favor of long hair And Maggie had forgotten even her hunger at that moment in the desire to conciliate gypsy opinion Oh what a nice little lady and rich I m sure said the old woman Didn t you live in a beautiful house at home Yes my home is pretty and I m very fond of the river where we go fishing but I m often very unhappy I should have liked to bring my books with me but I came away in a hurry you know But I can tell you almost everything there is in my books I ve read them so many times and that will amuse you And I can tell you something about Geography too that s about the world we live in very useful and interesting Did you ever hear about Columbus Maggie s eyes had begun to sparkle and her cheeks to flush she was really beginning to instruct the gypsies and gaining great influence over them The gypsies themselves were not without amazement at this talk though their attention was divided by the contents of Maggie s pocket which the friend at her right hand had by this time emptied without attracting her notice Is that where you live my little lady said the old woman at the mention of Columbus Oh no said Maggie with some pity Columbus was a very wonderful man who found out half the world and they put chains on him and treated him very badly you know it s in my Catechism of Geography but perhaps it s rather too long to tell before tea I want my tea so The last words burst from Maggie in spite of herself with a sudden drop from patronizing instruction to simple peevishness Why she s hungry poor little lady said the younger woman Give her some o the cold victual You ve been walking a good way I ll be bound my dear Where s your home It s Dorlcote Mill a good way off said Maggie My father is mister Tulliver but we mustn t let him know where I am else he ll fetch me home again Where does the queen of the gypsies live What do you want to go to her my little lady said the younger woman The tall girl meanwhile was constantly staring at Maggie and grinning Her manners were certainly not agreeable No said Maggie I m only thinking that if she isn t a very good queen you might be glad when she died and you could choose another If I was a queen I d be a very good queen and kind to everybody Here s a bit o nice victual then said the old woman handing to Maggie a lump of dry bread which she had taken from a bag of scraps and a piece of cold bacon Thank you said Maggie looking at the food without taking it but will you give me some bread and butter and tea instead I don t like bacon We ve got no tea nor butter said the old woman with something like a scowl as if she were getting tired of coaxing Oh a little bread and treacle would do said Maggie We han t got no treacle said the old woman crossly whereupon there followed a sharp dialogue between the two women in their unknown tongue and one of the small sphinxes snatched at the bread and bacon and began to eat it At this moment the tall girl who had gone a few yards off came back and said something which produced a strong effect The old woman seeming to forget Maggie s hunger poked the skewer into the pot with new vigor and the younger crept under the tent and reached out some platters and spoons Maggie trembled a little and was afraid the tears would come into her eyes Meanwhile the tall girl gave a shrill cry and presently came running up the boy whom Maggie had passed as he was sleeping a rough urchin about the age of Tom He stared at Maggie and there ensued much incomprehensible chattering She felt very lonely and was quite sure she should begin to cry before long the gypsies didn t seem to mind her at all and she felt quite weak among them But the springing tears were checked by new terror when two men came up whose approach had been the cause of the sudden excitement The elder of the two carried a bag which he flung down addressing the women in a loud and scolding tone which they answered by a shower of treble sauciness while a black cur ran barking up to Maggie and threw her into a tremor that only found a new cause in the curses with which the younger man called the dog off and gave him a rap with a great stick he held in his hand Maggie felt that it was impossible she should ever be queen of these people or ever communicate to them amusing and useful knowledge Both the men now seemed to be inquiring about Maggie for they looked at her and the tone of the conversation became of that pacific kind which implies curiosity on one side and the power of satisfying it on the other At last the younger woman said in her previous deferential coaxing tone This nice little lady s come to live with us aren t you glad Ay very glad said the younger man who was looking at Maggie s silver thimble and other small matters that had been taken from her pocket He returned them all except the thimble to the younger woman with some observation and she immediately restored them to Maggie s pocket while the men seated themselves and began to attack the contents of the kettle a stew of meat and potatoes which had been taken off the fire and turned out into a yellow platter Maggie began to think that Tom must be right about the gypsies they must certainly be thieves unless the man meant to return her thimble by and by She would willingly have given it to him for she was not at all attached to her thimble but the idea that she was among thieves prevented her from feeling any comfort in the revival of deference and attention toward her all thieves except Robin Hood were wicked people The women saw she was frightened We ve got nothing nice for a lady to eat said the old woman in her coaxing tone And she s so hungry sweet little lady Here my dear try if you can eat a bit o this said the younger woman handing some of the stew on a brown dish with an iron spoon to Maggie who remembering that the old woman had seemed angry with her for not liking the bread and bacon dared not refuse the stew though fear had chased away her appetite If her father would but come by in the gig and take her up Or even if Jack the Giantkiller or mister Greatheart or saint George who slew the dragon on the half pennies would happen to pass that way But Maggie thought with a sinking heart that these heroes were never seen in the neighborhood of saint Ogg s nothing very wonderful ever came there Maggie Tulliver you perceive was by no means that well trained well informed young person that a small female of eight or nine necessarily is in these days she had only been to school a year at saint Ogg s and had so few books that she sometimes read the dictionary so that in travelling over her small mind you would have found the most unexpected ignorance as well as unexpected knowledge She could have informed you that there was such a word as polygamy and being also acquainted with polysyllable she had deduced the conclusion that poly mean many but she had had no idea that gypsies were not well supplied with groceries and her thoughts generally were the oddest mixture of clear eyed acumen and blind dreams Her ideas about the gypsies had undergone a rapid modification in the last five minutes From having considered them very respectful companions amenable to instruction she had begun to think that they meant perhaps to kill her as soon as it was dark and cut up her body for gradual cooking the suspicion crossed her that the fierce eyed old man was in fact the Devil who might drop that transparent disguise at any moment and turn either into the grinning blacksmith or else a fiery eyed monster with dragon s wings It was no use trying to eat the stew and yet the thing she most dreaded was to offend the gypsies by betraying her extremely unfavorable opinion of them and she wondered with a keenness of interest that no theologian could have exceeded whether if the Devil were really present he would know her thoughts What you don t like the smell of it my dear said the young woman observing that Maggie did not even take a spoonful of the stew Try a bit come No thank you said Maggie summoning all her force for a desperate effort and trying to smile in a friendly way I haven t time I think it seems getting darker I think I must go home now and come again another day and then I can bring you a basket with some jam tarts and things Maggie rose from her seat as she threw out this illusory prospect devoutly hoping that Apollyon was gullible but her hope sank when the old gypsy woman said Stop a bit stop a bit little lady we ll take you home all safe when we ve done supper you shall ride home like a lady Maggie sat down again with little faith in this promise though she presently saw the tall girl putting a bridle on the donkey and throwing a couple of bags on his back Now then little missis said the younger man rising and leading the donkey forward tell us where you live what s the name o the place Dorlcote Mill is my home said Maggie eagerly My father is mister Tulliver he lives there What a big mill a little way this side o saint Ogg s Yes said Maggie Is it far off I think I should like to walk there if you please No no it ll be getting dark we must make haste And the donkey ll carry you as nice as can be you ll see He lifted Maggie as he spoke and set her on the donkey She felt relieved that it was not the old man who seemed to be going with her but she had only a trembling hope that she was really going home Here s your pretty bonnet said the younger woman putting that recently despised but now welcome article of costume on Maggie s head and you ll say we ve been very good to you won t you and what a nice little lady we said you was Oh yes thank you said Maggie I m very much obliged to you But I wish you d go with me too She thought anything was better than going with one of the dreadful men alone it would be more cheerful to be murdered by a larger party Ah you re fondest o me aren t you said the woman But I can t go you ll go too fast for me It now appeared that the man also was to be seated on the donkey holding Maggie before him and she was as incapable of remonstrating against this arrangement as the donkey himself though no nightmare had ever seemed to her more horrible When the woman had patted her on the back and said Good by the donkey at a strong hint from the man s stick set off at a rapid walk along the lane toward the point Maggie had come from an hour ago while the tall girl and the rough urchin also furnished with sticks obligingly escorted them for the first hundred yards with much screaming and thwacking Not Leonore in that preternatural midnight excursion with her phantom lover was more terrified than poor Maggie in this entirely natural ride on a short paced donkey with a gypsy behind her who considered that he was earning half a crown The red light of the setting sun seemed to have a portentous meaning with which the alarming bray of the second donkey with the log on its foot must surely have some connection Two low thatched cottages the only houses they passed in this lane seemed to add to its dreariness they had no windows to speak of and the doors were closed it was probable that they were inhabitated by witches and it was a relief to find that the donkey did not stop there At last oh sight of joy this lane the longest in the world was coming to an end was opening on a broad highroad where there was actually a coach passing And there was a finger post at the corner she had surely seen that finger post before To saint Ogg s two miles The gypsy really meant to take her home then he was probably a good man after all and might have been rather hurt at the thought that she didn t like coming with him alone This idea became stronger as she felt more and more certain that she knew the road quite well and she was considering how she might open a conversation with the injured gypsy and not only gratify his feelings but efface the impression of her cowardice when as they reached a cross road Maggie caught sight of some one coming on a white faced horse Oh stop stop she cried out There s my father Oh father father The sudden joy was almost painful and before her father reached her she was sobbing Great was mister Tulliver s wonder for he had made a round from Basset and had not yet been home Why what s the meaning o this he said checking his horse while Maggie slipped from the donkey and ran to her father s stirrup The little miss lost herself I reckon said the gypsy She d come to our tent at the far end o Dunlow Lane and I was bringing her where she said her home was It s a good way to come after being on the tramp all day Oh yes father he s been very good to bring me home said Maggie a very kind good man Here then my man said mister Tulliver taking out five shillings It s the best day s work you ever did I couldn t afford to lose the little wench here lift her up before me Why Maggie how s this how s this he said as they rode along while she laid her head against her father and sobbed How came you to be rambling about and lose yourself Oh father sobbed Maggie I ran away because I was so unhappy Tom was so angry with me I couldn t bear it Pooh pooh said mister Tulliver soothingly you mustn t think o running away from father What ud father do without his little wench Oh no I never will again father never mister Tulliver spoke his mind very strongly when he reached home that evening and the effect was seen in the remarkable fact that Maggie never heard one reproach from her mother or one taunt from Tom about this foolish business of her running away to the gypsies Maggie was rather awe stricken by this unusual treatment and sometimes thought that her conduct had been too wicked to be alluded to Chapter XII mister and missus Glegg at Home In order to see mister and missus Glegg at home we must enter the town of saint Ogg s that venerable town with the red fluted roofs and the broad warehouse gables where the black ships unlade themselves of their burthens from the far north and carry away in exchange the precious inland products the well crushed cheese and the soft fleeces which my refined readers have doubtless become acquainted with through the medium of the best classic pastorals It is one of those old old towns which impress one as a continuation and outgrowth of nature as much as the nests of the bower birds or the winding galleries of the white ants a town which carries the traces of its long growth and history like a millennial tree and has sprung up and developed in the same spot between the river and the low hill from the time when the Roman legions turned their backs on it from the camp on the hillside and the long haired sea kings came up the river and looked with fierce eager eyes at the fatness of the land It is a town familiar with forgotten years The shadow of the Saxon hero king still walks there fitfully reviewing the scenes of his youth and love time and is met by the gloomier shadow of the dreadful heathen Dane who was stabbed in the midst of his warriors by the sword of an invisible avenger and who rises on autumn evenings like a white mist from his tumulus on the hill and hovers in the court of the old hall by the river side the spot where he was thus miraculously slain in the days before the old hall was built It was the Normans who began to build that fine old hall which is like the town telling of the thoughts and hands of widely sundered generations but it is all so old that we look with loving pardon at its inconsistencies and are well content that they who built the stone oriel and they who built the Gothic facade and towers of finest small brickwork with the trefoil ornament and the windows and battlements defined with stone did not sacreligiously pull down the ancient half timbered body with its oak roofed banqueting hall But older even than this old hall is perhaps the bit of wall now built into the belfry of the parish church and said to be a remnant of the original chapel dedicated to saint Ogg the patron saint of this ancient town of whose history I possess several manuscript versions I incline to the briefest since if it should not be wholly true it is at least likely to contain the least falsehood Ogg the son of Beorl says my private hagiographer was a boatman who gained a scanty living by ferrying passengers across the river Floss And it came to pass one evening when the winds were high that there sat moaning by the brink of the river a woman with a child in her arms and she was clad in rags and had a worn and withered look and she craved to be rowed across the river And the men thereabout questioned her and said Wherefore dost thou desire to cross the river Tarry till the morning and take shelter here for the night so shalt thou be wise and not foolish Still she went on to mourn and crave But Ogg the son of Beorl came up and said I will ferry thee across it is enough that thy heart needs it And he ferried her across And it came to pass when she stepped ashore that her rags were turned into robes of flowing white and her face became bright with exceeding beauty and there was a glory around it so that she shed a light on the water like the moon in its brightness And she said Ogg the son of Beorl thou art blessed in that thou didst not question and wrangle with the heart s need but wast smitten with pity and didst straightway relieve the same And from henceforth whoso steps into thy boat shall be in no peril from the storm and whenever it puts forth to the rescue it shall save the lives both of men and beasts And when the floods came many were saved by reason of that blessing on the boat But when Ogg the son of Beorl died behold in the parting of his soul the boat loosed itself from its moorings and was floated with the ebbing tide in great swiftness to the ocean and was seen no more Yet it was witnessed in the floods of aftertime that at the coming on of eventide Ogg the son of Beorl was always seen with his boat upon the wide spreading waters and the Blessed Virgin sat in the prow shedding a light around as of the moon in its brightness so that the rowers in the gathering darkness took heart and pulled anew This legend one sees reflects from a far off time the visitation of the floods which even when they left human life untouched were widely fatal to the helpless cattle and swept as sudden death over all smaller living things But the town knew worse troubles even than the floods troubles of the civil wars when it was a continual fighting place where first Puritans thanked God for the blood of the Loyalists and then Loyalists thanked God for the blood of the Puritans Many honest citizens lost all their possessions for conscience sake in those times and went forth beggared from their native town Doubtless there are many houses standing now on which those honest citizens turned their backs in sorrow quaint gabled houses looking on the river jammed between newer warehouses and penetrated by surprising passages which turn and turn at sharp angles till they lead you out on a muddy strand overflowed continually by the rushing tide Everywhere the brick houses have a mellow look and in missus Glegg s day there was no incongruous new fashioned smartness no plate glass in shop windows no fresh stucco facing or other fallacious attempt to make fine old red saint Ogg s wear the air of a town that sprang up yesterday The shop windows were small and unpretending for the farmers wives and daughters who came to do their shopping on market days were not to be withdrawn from their regular well known shops and the tradesmen had no wares intended for customers who would go on their way and be seen no more Ah even missus Glegg s day seems far back in the past now separated from us by changes that widen the years War and the rumor of war had then died out from the minds of men and if they were ever thought of by the farmers in drab greatcoats who shook the grain out of their sample bags and buzzed over it in the full market place it was as a state of things that belonged to a past golden age when prices were high Surely the time was gone forever when the broad river could bring up unwelcome ships Russia was only the place where the linseed came from the more the better making grist for the great vertical millstones with their scythe like arms roaring and grinding and carefully sweeping as if an informing soul were in them The Catholics bad harvests and the mysterious fluctuations of trade were the three evils mankind had to fear even the floods had not been great of late years The mind of saint Ogg s did not look extensively before or after It inherited a long past without thinking of it and had no eyes for the spirits that walk the streets Since the centuries when saint Ogg with his boat and the Virgin Mother at the prow had been seen on the wide water so many memories had been left behind and had gradually vanished like the receding hilltops And the present time was like the level plain where men lose their belief in volcanoes and earthquakes thinking to morrow will be as yesterday and the giant forces that used to shake the earth are forever laid to sleep The days were gone when people could be greatly wrought upon by their faith still less change it the Catholics were formidable because they would lay hold of government and property and burn men alive not because any sane and honest parishioner of saint Ogg s could be brought to believe in the Pope One aged person remembered how a rude multitude had been swayed when John Wesley preached in the cattle market but for a long while it had not been expected of preachers that they should shake the souls of men An occasional burst of fervor in Dissenting pulpits on the subject of infant baptism was the only symptom of a zeal unsuited to sober times when men had done with change Protestantism sat at ease unmindful of schisms careless of proselytism Dissent was an inheritance along with a superior pew and a business connection and Churchmanship only wondered contemptuously at Dissent as a foolish habit that clung greatly to families in the grocery and chandlering lines though not incompatible with prosperous wholesale dealing But with the Catholic Question had come a slight wind of controversy to break the calm the elderly rector had become occasionally historical and argumentative and mister Spray the Independent minister had begun to preach political sermons in which he distinguished with much subtlety between his fervent belief in the right of the Catholics to the franchise and his fervent belief in their eternal perdition Most of mister Spray s hearers however were incapable of following his subtleties and many old fashioned Dissenters were much pained by his siding with the Catholics while others thought he had better let politics alone Public spirit was not held in high esteem at saint Ogg s and men who busied themselves with political questions were regarded with some suspicion as dangerous characters they were usually persons who had little or no business of their own to manage or if they had were likely enough to become insolvent This was the general aspect of things at saint Ogg s in missus Glegg s day and at that particular period in her family history when she had had her quarrel with mister Tulliver It was a time when ignorance was much more comfortable than at present and was received with all the honors in very good society without being obliged to dress itself in an elaborate costume of knowledge a time when cheap periodicals were not and when country surgeons never thought of asking their female patients if they were fond of reading but simply took it for granted that they preferred gossip a time when ladies in rich silk gowns wore large pockets in which they carried a mutton bone to secure them against cramp missus Glegg carried such a bone which she had inherited from her grandmother with a brocaded gown that would stand up empty like a suit of armor and a silver headed walking stick for the Dodson family had been respectable for many generations missus Glegg had both a front and a back parlor in her excellent house at saint Ogg s so that she had two points of view from which she could observe the weakness of her fellow beings and reinforce her thankfulness for her own exceptional strength of mind From her front window she could look down the Tofton Road leading out of saint Ogg s and note the growing tendency to gadding about in the wives of men not retired from business together with a practice of wearing woven cotton stockings which opened a dreary prospect for the coming generation and from her back windows she could look down the pleasant garden and orchard which stretched to the river and observe the folly of mister Glegg in spending his time among them flowers and vegetables For mister Glegg having retired from active business as a wool stapler for the purpose of enjoying himself through the rest of his life had found this last occupation so much more severe than his business that he had been driven into amateur hard labor as a dissipation and habitually relaxed by doing the work of two ordinary gardeners The economizing of a gardener s wages might perhaps have induced missus Glegg to wink at this folly if it were possible for a healthy female mind even to simulate respect for a husband s hobby But it is well known that this conjugal complacency belongs only to the weaker portion of the sex who are scarcely alive to the responsibilities of a wife as a constituted check on her husband s pleasures which are hardly ever of a rational or commendable kind mister Glegg on his side too had a double source of mental occupation which gave every promise of being inexhaustible On the one hand he surprised himself by his discoveries in natural history finding that his piece of garden ground contained wonderful caterpillars slugs and insects which so far as he had heard had never before attracted human observation and he noticed remarkable coincidences between these zoological phenomena and the great events of that time as for example that before the burning of York Minster there had been mysterious serpentine marks on the leaves of the rose trees together with an unusual prevalence of slugs which he had been puzzled to know the meaning of until it flashed upon him with this melancholy conflagration mister Glegg had an unusual amount of mental activity which when disengaged from the wool business naturally made itself a pathway in other directions And his second subject of meditation was the contrairiness of the female mind as typically exhibited in missus Glegg That a creature made in a genealogical sense out of a man s rib and in this particular case maintained in the highest respectability without any trouble of her own should be normally in a state of contradiction to the blandest propositions and even to the most accommodating concessions was a mystery in the scheme of things to which he had often in vain sought a clew in the early chapters of Genesis mister Glegg had chosen the eldest Miss Dodson as a handsome embodiment of female prudence and thrift and being himself of a money getting money keeping turn had calculated on much conjugal harmony But in that curious compound the feminine character it may easily happen that the flavor is unpleasant in spite of excellent ingredients and a fine systematic stinginess may be accompanied with a seasoning that quite spoils its relish Now good mister Glegg himself was stingy in the most amiable manner his neighbors called him near which always means that the person in question is a lovable skinflint If you expressed a preference for cheese parings mister Glegg would remember to save them for you with a good natured delight in gratifying your palate and he was given to pet all animals which required no appreciable keep There was no humbug or hypocrisy about mister Glegg his eyes would have watered with true feeling over the sale of a widow s furniture which a five pound note from his side pocket would have prevented but a donation of five pounds to a person in a small way of life would have seemed to him a mad kind of lavishness rather than charity which had always presented itself to him as a contribution of small aids not a neutralizing of misfortune And mister Glegg was just as fond of saving other people s money as his own he would have ridden as far round to avoid a turnpike when his expenses were to be paid for him as when they were to come out of his own pocket and was quite zealous in trying to induce indifferent acquaintances to adopt a cheap substitute for blacking This inalienable habit of saving as an end in itself belonged to the industrious men of business of a former generation who made their fortunes slowly almost as the tracking of the fox belongs to the harrier it constituted them a race which is nearly lost in these days of rapid money getting when lavishness comes close on the back of want In old fashioned times an independence was hardly ever made without a little miserliness as a condition and you would have found that quality in every provincial district combined with characters as various as the fruits from which we can extract acid The true Harpagons were always marked and exceptional characters not so the worthy tax payers who having once pinched from real necessity retained even in the midst of their comfortable retirement with their wallfruit and wine bins the habit of regarding life as an ingenious process of nibbling out one s livelihood without leaving any perceptible deficit and who would have been as immediately prompted to give up a newly taxed luxury when they had had their clear five hundred a year as when they had only five hundred pounds of capital mister Glegg was one of these men found so impracticable by chancellors of the exchequer and knowing this you will be the better able to understand why he had not swerved from the conviction that he had made an eligible marriage in spite of the too pungent seasoning that nature had given to the eldest Miss Dodson s virtues A man with an affectionate disposition who finds a wife to concur with his fundamental idea of life easily comes to persuade himself that no other woman would have suited him so well and does a little daily snapping and quarrelling without any sense of alienation mister Glegg being of a reflective turn and no longer occupied with wool had much wondering meditation on the peculiar constitution of the female mind as unfolded to him in his domestic life and yet he thought missus Glegg s household ways a model for her sex It struck him as a pitiable irregularity in other women if they did not roll up their table napkins with the same tightness and emphasis as missus Glegg did if their pastry had a less leathery consistence and their damson cheese a less venerable hardness than hers nay even the peculiar combination of grocery and druglike odors in missus Glegg s private cupboard impressed him as the only right thing in the way of cupboard smells I am not sure that he would not have longed for the quarrelling again if it had ceased for an entire week and it is certain that an acquiescent mild wife would have left his meditations comparatively jejune and barren of mystery mister Glegg s unmistakable kind heartedness was shown in this that it pained him more to see his wife at variance with others even with Dolly the servant than to be in a state of cavil with her himself and the quarrel between her and mister Tulliver vexed him so much that it quite nullified the pleasure he would otherwise have had in the state of his early cabbages as he walked in his garden before breakfast the next morning Still he went in to breakfast with some slight hope that now missus Glegg had slept upon it her anger might be subdued enough to give way to her usually strong sense of family decorum She had been used to boast that there had never been any of those deadly quarrels among the Dodsons which had disgraced other families that no Dodson had ever been cut off with a shilling and no cousin of the Dodsons disowned as indeed why should they be For they had no cousins who had not money out at use or some houses of their own at the very least There was one evening cloud which had always disappeared from missus Glegg s brow when she sat at the breakfast table It was her fuzzy front of curls for as she occupied herself in household matters in the morning it would have been a mere extravagance to put on anything so superfluous to the making of leathery pastry as a fuzzy curled front By half past ten decorum demanded the front until then missus Glegg could economize it and society would never be any the wiser But the absence of that cloud only left it more apparent that the cloud of severity remained and mister Glegg perceiving this as he sat down to his milkporridge which it was his old frugal habit to stem his morning hunger with prudently resolved to leave the first remark to missus Glegg lest to so delicate an article as a lady s temper the slightest touch should do mischief People who seem to enjoy their ill temper have a way of keeping it in fine condition by inflicting privations on themselves That was missus Glegg s way She made her tea weaker than usual this morning and declined butter It was a hard case that a vigorous mood for quarrelling so highly capable of using an opportunity should not meet with a single remark from mister Glegg on which to exercise itself But by and by it appeared that his silence would answer the purpose for he heard himself apostrophized at last in that tone peculiar to the wife of one s bosom Well mister Glegg it s a poor return I get for making you the wife I ve made you all these years If this is the way I m to be treated I d better ha known it before my poor father died and then when I d wanted a home I should ha gone elsewhere as the choice was offered me mister Glegg paused from his porridge and looked up not with any new amazement but simply with that quiet habitual wonder with which we regard constant mysteries Why missus G what have I done now Done now mister Glegg done now I m sorry for you Not seeing his way to any pertinent answer mister Glegg reverted to his porridge There s husbands in the world continued missus Glegg after a pause as ud have known how to do something different to siding with everybody else against their own wives Perhaps I m wrong and you can teach me better But I ve allays heard as it s the husband s place to stand by the wife instead o rejoicing and triumphing when folks insult her Now what call have you to say that said mister Glegg rather warmly for though a kind man he was not as meek as Moses When did I rejoice or triumph over you There s ways o doing things worse than speaking out plain mister Glegg I d sooner you d tell me to my face as you make light of me than try to make out as everybody s in the right but me and come to your breakfast in the morning as I ve hardly slept an hour this night and sulk at me as if I was the dirt under your feet Sulk at you said mister Glegg in a tone of angry facetiousness You re like a tipsy man as thinks everybody s had too much but himself Don t lower yourself with using coarse language to me mister Glegg It makes you look very small though you can t see yourself said missus Glegg in a tone of energetic compassion A man in your place should set an example and talk more sensible Yes but will you listen to sense retorted mister Glegg sharply The best sense I can talk to you is what I said last night as you re i the wrong to think o calling in your money when it s safe enough if you d let it alone all because of a bit of a tiff and I was in hopes you d ha altered your mind this morning But if you d like to call it in don t do it in a hurry now and breed more enmity in the family but wait till there s a pretty mortgage to be had without any trouble You d have to set the lawyer to work now to find an investment and make no end o expense missus Glegg felt there was really something in this but she tossed her head and emitted a guttural interjection to indicate that her silence was only an armistice not a peace And in fact hostilities soon broke out again I ll thank you for my cup o tea now missus G said mister Glegg seeing that she did not proceed to give it him as usual when he had finished his porridge She lifted the teapot with a slight toss of the head and said I m glad to hear you ll thank me mister Glegg It s little thanks I get for what I do for folks i this world Though there s never a woman o your side o the family mister Glegg as is fit to stand up with me and I d say it if I was on my dying bed Not but what I ve allays conducted myself civil to your kin and there isn t one of em can say the contrary though my equils they aren t and nobody shall make me say it You d better leave finding fault wi my kin till you ve left off quarrelling with you own missus G said mister Glegg with angry sarcasm I ll trouble you for the milk jug That s as false a word as ever you spoke mister Glegg said the lady pouring out the milk with unusual profuseness as much as to say if he wanted milk he should have it with a vengeance And you know it s false I m not the woman to quarrel with my own kin you may for I ve known you to do it Why what did you call it yesterday then leaving your sister s house in a tantrum I d no quarrel wi my sister mister Glegg and it s false to say it mister Tulliver s none o my blood and it was him quarrelled with me and drove me out o the house But perhaps you d have had me stay and be swore at mister Glegg perhaps you was vexed not to hear more abuse and foul language poured out upo your own wife But let me tell you it s your disgrace Did ever anybody hear the like i this parish said mister Glegg getting hot A woman with everything provided for her and allowed to keep her own money the same as if it was settled on her and with a gig new stuffed and lined at no end o expense and provided for when I die beyond anything she could expect to go on i this way biting and snapping like a mad dog It s beyond everything as God A mighty should ha made women so These last words were uttered in a tone of sorrowful agitation mister Glegg pushed his tea from him and tapped the table with both his hands Well mister Glegg if those are your feelings it s best they should be known said missus Glegg taking off her napkin and folding it in an excited manner But if you talk o my being provided for beyond what I could expect I beg leave to tell you as I d a right to expect a many things as I don t find And as to my being like a mad dog it s well if you re not cried shame on by the county for your treatment of me for it s what I can t bear and I won t bear Here missus Glegg s voice intimated that she was going to cry and breaking off from speech she rang the bell violently Sally she said rising from her chair and speaking in rather a choked voice light a fire up stairs and put the blinds down mister Glegg you ll please to order what you d like for dinner I shall have gruel missus Glegg walked across the room to the small book case and took down Baxter s Saints Everlasting Rest which she carried with her up stairs It was the book she was accustomed to lay open before her on special occasions on wet Sunday mornings or when she heard of a death in the family or when as in this case her quarrel with mister Glegg had been set an octave higher than usual But missus Glegg carried something else up stairs with her which together with the Saints Rest and the gruel may have had some influence in gradually calming her feelings and making it possible for her to endure existence on the ground floor shortly before tea time This was partly mister Glegg s suggestion that she would do well to let her five hundred lie still until a good investment turned up and further his parenthetic hint at his handsome provision for her in case of his death mister Glegg like all men of his stamp was extremely reticent about his will and missus Glegg in her gloomier moments had forebodings that like other husbands of whom she had heard he might cherish the mean project of heightening her grief at his death by leaving her poorly off in which case she was firmly resolved that she would have scarcely any weeper on her bonnet and would cry no more than if he had been a second husband But if he had really shown her any testamentary tenderness it would be affecting to think of him poor man when he was gone and even his foolish fuss about the flowers and garden stuff and his insistence on the subject of snails would be touching when it was once fairly at an end To survive mister Glegg and talk eulogistically of him as a man who might have his weaknesses but who had done the right thing by her not withstanding his numerous poor relations to have sums of interest coming in more frequently and secrete it in various corners baffling to the most ingenious of thieves for to missus Glegg s mind banks and strong boxes would have nullified the pleasure of property she might as well have taken her food in capsules finally to be looked up to by her own family and the neighborhood so as no woman can ever hope to be who has not the praeterite and present dignity comprised in being a widow well left all this made a flattering and conciliatory view of the future So that when good mister Glegg restored to good humor by much hoeing and moved by the sight of his wife s empty chair with her knitting rolled up in the corner went up stairs to her and observed that the bell had been tolling for poor mister Morton missus Glegg answered magnanimously quite as if she had been an uninjured woman Ah then there ll be a good business for somebody to take to Baxter had been open at least eight hours by this time for it was nearly five o clock and if people are to quarrel often it follows as a corollary that their quarrels cannot be protracted beyond certain limits mister and missus Glegg talked quite amicably about the Tullivers that evening mister Glegg went the length of admitting that Tulliver was a sad man for getting into hot water and was like enough to run through his property and missus Glegg meeting this acknowledgment half way declared that it was beneath her to take notice of such a man s conduct and that for her sister s sake she would let him keep the five hundred a while longer for when she put it out on a mortgage she should only get four per cent Chapter XIII mister Tulliver Further Entangles the Skein of Life Owing to this new adjustment of missus Glegg s thoughts missus Pullet found her task of mediation the next day surprisingly easy missus Glegg indeed checked her rather sharply for thinking it would be necessary to tell her elder sister what was the right mode of behavior in family matters missus Pullet s argument that it would look ill in the neighborhood if people should have it in their power to say that there was a quarrel in the family was particularly offensive If the family name never suffered except through missus Glegg missus Pullet might lay her head on her pillow in perfect confidence It s not to be expected I suppose observed missus Glegg by way of winding up the subject as I shall go to the mill again before Bessy comes to see me or as I shall go and fall down o my knees to mister Tulliver and ask his pardon for showing him favors but I shall bear no malice and when mister Tulliver speaks civil to me I ll speak civil to him Nobody has any call to tell me what s becoming Finding it unnecessary to plead for the Tullivers it was natural that aunt Pullet should relax a little in her anxiety for them and recur to the annoyance she had suffered yesterday from the offspring of that apparently ill fated house missus Glegg heard a circumstantial narrative to which mister Pullet s remarkable memory furnished some items and while aunt Pullet pitied poor Bessy s bad luck with her children and expressed a half formed project of paying for Maggie s being sent to a distant boarding school which would not prevent her being so brown but might tend to subdue some other vices in her aunt Glegg blamed Bessy for her weakness and appealed to all witnesses who should be living when the Tulliver children had turned out ill that she missus Glegg had always said how it would be from the very first observing that it was wonderful to herself how all her words came true Then I may call and tell Bessy you ll bear no malice and everything be as it was before missus Pullet said just before parting Yes you may Sophy said missus Glegg you may tell mister Tulliver and Bessy too as I m not going to behave ill because folks behave ill to me I know it s my place as the eldest to set an example in every respect and I do it Nobody can say different of me if they ll keep to the truth missus Glegg being in this state of satisfaction in her own lofty magnanimity I leave you to judge what effect was produced on her by the reception of a short letter from mister Tulliver that very evening after missus Pullet s departure informing her that she needn t trouble her mind about her five hundred pounds for it should be paid back to her in the course of the next month at farthest together with the interest due thereon until the time of payment And furthermore that mister Tulliver had no wish to behave uncivilly to missus Glegg and she was welcome to his house whenever she liked to come but he desired no favors from her either for himself or his children It was poor missus Tulliver who had hastened this catastrophe entirely through that irrepressible hopefulness of hers which led her to expect that similar causes may at any time produce different results It had very often occurred in her experience that mister Tulliver had done something because other people had said he was not able to do it or had pitied him for his supposed inability or in any other way piqued his pride still she thought to day if she told him when he came in to tea that sister Pullet was gone to try and make everything up with sister Glegg so that he needn t think about paying in the money it would give a cheerful effect to the meal mister Tulliver had never slackened in his resolve to raise the money but now he at once determined to write a letter to missus Glegg which should cut off all possibility of mistake missus Pullet gone to beg and pray for him indeed mister Tulliver did not willingly write a letter and found the relation between spoken and written language briefly known as spelling one of the most puzzling things in this puzzling world Nevertheless like all fervid writing the task was done in less time than usual and if the spelling differed from missus Glegg s why she belonged like himself to a generation with whom spelling was a matter of private judgment missus Glegg did not alter her will in consequence of this letter and cut off the Tulliver children from their sixth and seventh share in her thousand pounds for she had her principles No one must be able to say of her when she was dead that she had not divided her money with perfect fairness among her own kin In the matter of wills personal qualities were subordinate to the great fundamental fact of blood and to be determined in the distribution of your property by caprice and not make your legacies bear a direct ratio to degrees of kinship was a prospective disgrace that would have embittered her life This had always been a principle in the Dodson family it was one form if that sense of honor and rectitude which was a proud tradition in such families a tradition which has been the salt of our provincial society But though the letter could not shake missus Glegg s principles it made the family breach much more difficult to mend and as to the effect it produced on missus Glegg s opinion of mister Tulliver she begged to be understood from that time forth that she had nothing whatever to say about him his state of mind apparently was too corrupt for her to contemplate it for a moment It was not until the evening before Tom went to school at the beginning of August that missus Glegg paid a visit to her sister Tulliver sitting in her gig all the while and showing her displeasure by markedly abstaining from all advice and criticism for as she observed to her sister Deane Bessy must bear the consequence o having such a husband though I m sorry for her and missus Deane agreed that Bessy was pitiable That evening Tom observed to Maggie Oh my Maggie aunt Glegg s beginning to come again I m glad I m going to school You ll catch it all now Maggie was already so full of sorrow at the thought of Tom s going away from her that this playful exultation of his seemed very unkind and she cried herself to sleep that night mister Tulliver s prompt procedure entailed on him further promptitude in finding the convenient person who was desirous of lending five hundred pounds on bond It must be no client of Wakem s he said to himself and yet at the end of a fortnight it turned out to the contrary not because mister Tulliver s will was feeble but because external fact was stronger Wakem s client was the only convenient person to be found mister Tulliver had a destiny as well as Oedipus and in this case he might plead like Oedipus that his deed was inflicted on him rather than committed by him Book II School Time Chapter I Tom s First Half Tom Tulliver s sufferings during the first quarter he was at King s Lorton under the distinguished care of the reverend Walter Stelling were rather severe At mister Jacob s academy life had not presented itself to him as a difficult problem there were plenty of fellows to play with and Tom being good at all active games fighting especially had that precedence among them which appeared to him inseparable from the personality of Tom Tulliver mister Jacobs himself familiarly known as Old Goggles from his habit of wearing spectacles imposed no painful awe and if it was the property of snuffy old hypocrites like him to write like copperplate and surround their signatures with arabesques to spell without forethought and to spout my name is Norval without bungling Tom for his part was glad he was not in danger of those mean accomplishments He was not going to be a snuffy schoolmaster he but a substantial man like his father who used to go hunting when he was younger and rode a capital black mare as pretty a bit of horse flesh as ever you saw Tom had heard what her points were a hundred times He meant to go hunting too and to be generally respected When people were grown up he considered nobody inquired about their writing and spelling when he was a man he should be master of everything and do just as he liked It had been very difficult for him to reconcile himself to the idea that his school time was to be prolonged and that he was not to be brought up to his father s business which he had always thought extremely pleasant for it was nothing but riding about giving orders and going to market and he thought that a clergyman would give him a great many Scripture lessons and probably make him learn the Gospel and Epistle on a Sunday as well as the Collect But in the absence of specific information it was impossible for him to imagine that school and a schoolmaster would be something entirely different from the academy of mister Jacobs So not to be at a deficiency in case of his finding genial companions he had taken care to carry with him a small box of percussion caps not that there was anything particular to be done with them but they would serve to impress strange boys with a sense of his familiarity with guns Thus poor Tom though he saw very clearly through Maggie s illusions was not without illusions of his own which were to be cruelly dissipated by his enlarged experience at King s Lorton He had not been there a fortnight before it was evident to him that life complicated not only with the Latin grammar but with a new standard of English pronunciation was a very difficult business made all the more obscure by a thick mist of bashfulness Tom as you have observed was never an exception among boys for ease of address but the difficulty of enunciating a monosyllable in reply to mister or missus Stelling was so great that he even dreaded to be asked at table whether he would have more pudding As to the percussion caps he had almost resolved in the bitterness of his heart that he would throw them into a neighboring pond for not only was he the solitary pupil but he began even to have a certain scepticism about guns and a general sense that his theory of life was undermined For mister Stelling thought nothing of guns or horses either apparently and yet it was impossible for Tom to despise mister Stelling as he had despised Old Goggles If there were anything that was not thoroughly genuine about mister Stelling it lay quite beyond Tom s power to detect it it is only by a wide comparison of facts that the wisest full grown man can distinguish well rolled barrels from mere supernal thunder mister Stelling was a well sized broad chested man not yet thirty with flaxen hair standing erect and large lightish gray eyes which were always very wide open he had a sonorous bass voice and an air of defiant self confidence inclining to brazenness He had entered on his career with great vigor and intended to make a considerable impression on his fellowmen The reverend Walter Stelling was not a man who would remain among the inferior clergy all his life He had a true British determination to push his way in the world as a schoolmaster in the first place for there were capital masterships of grammar schools to be had and mister Stelling meant to have one of them but as a preacher also for he meant always to preach in a striking manner so as to have his congregation swelled by admirers from neighboring parishes and to produce a great sensation whenever he took occasional duty for a brother clergyman of minor gifts The style of preaching he had chosen was the extemporaneous which was held little short of the miraculous in rural parishes like King s Lorton Some passages of Massillon and Bourdaloue which he knew by heart were really very effective when rolled out in mister Stelling s deepest tones but as comparatively feeble appeals of his own were delivered in the same loud and impressive manner they were often thought quite as striking by his hearers mister Stelling s doctrine was of no particular school if anything it had a tinge of evangelicalism for that was the telling thing just then in the diocese to which King s Lorton belonged In short mister Stelling was a man who meant to rise in his profession and to rise by merit clearly since he had no interest beyond what might be promised by a problematic relationship to a great lawyer who had not yet become Lord Chancellor A clergyman who has such vigorous intentions naturally gets a little into debt at starting it is not to be expected that he will live in the meagre style of a man who means to be a poor curate all his life and if the few hundreds mister Timpson advanced toward his daughter s fortune did not suffice for the purchase of handsome furniture together with a stock of wine a grand piano and the laying out of a superior flower garden it followed in the most rigorous manner either that these things must be procured by some other means or else that the reverend mister Stelling must go without them which last alternative would be an absurd procrastination of the fruits of success where success was certain mister Stelling was so broad chested and resolute that he felt equal to anything he would become celebrated by shaking the consciences of his hearers and he would by and by edit a Greek play and invent several new readings He had not yet selected the play for having been married little more than two years his leisure time had been much occupied with attentions to missus Stelling but he had told that fine woman what he meant to do some day and she felt great confidence in her husband as a man who understood everything of that sort But the immediate step to future success was to bring on Tom Tulliver during this first half year for by a singular coincidence there had been some negotiation concerning another pupil from the same neighborhood and it might further a decision in mister Stelling s favor if it were understood that young Tulliver who mister Stelling observed in conjugal privacy was rather a rough cub had made prodigious progress in a short time It was on this ground that he was severe with Tom about his lessons he was clearly a boy whose powers would never be developed through the medium of the Latin grammar without the application of some sternness Not that mister Stelling was a harsh tempered or unkind man quite the contrary He was jocose with Tom at table and corrected his provincialisms and his deportment in the most playful manner but poor Tom was only the more cowed and confused by this double novelty for he had never been used to jokes at all like mister Stelling s and for the first time in his life he had a painful sense that he was all wrong somehow When mister Stelling said as the roast beef was being uncovered Now Tulliver which would you rather decline roast beef or the Latin for it Tom to whom in his coolest moments a pun would have been a hard nut was thrown into a state of embarrassed alarm that made everything dim to him except the feeling that he would rather not have anything to do with Latin of course he answered Roast beef whereupon there followed much laughter and some practical joking with the plates from which Tom gathered that he had in some mysterious way refused beef and in fact made himself appear a silly If he could have seen a fellow pupil undergo these painful operations and survive them in good spirits he might sooner have taken them as a matter of course But there are two expensive forms of education either of which a parent may procure for his son by sending him as solitary pupil to a clergyman one is the enjoyment of the reverend gentleman s undivided neglect the other is the endurance of the reverend gentleman s undivided attention It was the latter privilege for which mister Tulliver paid a high price in Tom s initiatory months at King s Lorton That respectable miller and maltster had left Tom behind and driven homeward in a state of great mental satisfaction He considered that it was a happy moment for him when he had thought of asking Riley s advice about a tutor for Tom mister Stelling s eyes were so wide open and he talked in such an off hand matter of fact way answering every difficult slow remark of mister Tulliver s with I see my good sir I see To be sure to be sure You want your son to be a man who will make his way in the world that mister Tulliver was delighted to find in him a clergyman whose knowledge was so applicable to the every day affairs of this life Except Counsellor Wylde whom he had heard at the last sessions mister Tulliver thought the reverend mister Stelling was the shrewdest fellow he had ever met with not unlike Wylde in fact he had the same way of sticking his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat mister Tulliver was not by any means an exception in mistaking brazenness for shrewdness most laymen thought Stelling shrewd and a man of remarkable powers generally it was chiefly by his clerical brethren that he was considered rather a full fellow But he told mister Tulliver several stories about Swing and incendiarism and asked his advice about feeding pigs in so thoroughly secular and judicious a manner with so much polished glibness of tongue that the miller thought here was the very thing he wanted for Tom He had no doubt this first rate man was acquainted with every branch of information and knew exactly what Tom must learn in order to become a match for the lawyers which poor mister Tulliver himself did not know and so was necessarily thrown for self direction on this wide kind of inference It is hardly fair to laugh at him for I have known much more highly instructed persons than he make inferences quite as wide and not at all wiser As for missus Tulliver finding that missus Stelling s views as to the airing of linen and the frequent recurrence of hunger in a growing boy entirely coincided with her own moreover that missus Stelling though so young a woman and only anticipating her second confinement had gone through very nearly the same experience as herself with regard to the behavior and fundamental character of the monthly nurse she expressed great contentment to her husband when they drove away at leaving Tom with a woman who in spite of her youth seemed quite sensible and motherly and asked advice as prettily as could be They must be very well off though said missus Tulliver for everything s as nice as can be all over the house and that watered silk she had on cost a pretty penny Sister Pullet has got one like it Ah said mister Tulliver he s got some income besides the curacy I reckon Perhaps her father allows em something There s Tom ull be another hundred to him and not much trouble either by his own account he says teaching comes natural to him That s wonderful now added mister Tulliver turning his head on one side and giving his horse a meditative tickling on the flank Perhaps it was because teaching came naturally to mister Stelling that he set about it with that uniformity of method and independence of circumstances which distinguish the actions of animals understood to be under the immediate teaching of nature mister Broderip s amiable beaver as that charming naturalist tells us busied himself as earnestly in constructing a dam in a room up three pair of stairs in London as if he had been laying his foundation in a stream or lake in Upper Canada It was Binny s function to build the absence of water or of possible progeny was an accident for which he was not accountable With the same unerring instinct mister Stelling set to work at his natural method of instilling the Eton Grammar and Euclid into the mind of Tom Tulliver This he considered was the only basis of solid instruction all other means of education were mere charlatanism and could produce nothing better than smatterers Fixed on this firm basis a man might observe the display of various or special knowledge made by irregularly educated people with a pitying smile all that sort of thing was very well but it was impossible these people could form sound opinions In holding this conviction mister Stelling was not biassed as some tutors have been by the excessive accuracy or extent of his own scholarship and as to his views about Euclid no opinion could have been freer from personal partiality mister Stelling was very far from being led astray by enthusiasm either religious or intellectual on the other hand he had no secret belief that everything was humbug He thought religion was a very excellent thing and Aristotle a great authority and deaneries and prebends useful institutions and Great Britain the providential bulwark of Protestantism and faith in the unseen a great support to afflicted minds he believed in all these things as a Swiss hotel keeper believes in the beauty of the scenery around him and in the pleasure it gives to artistic visitors And in the same way mister Stelling believed in his method of education he had no doubt that he was doing the very best thing for mister Tulliver s boy Of course when the miller talked of mapping and summing in a vague and diffident manner mister Stelling had set his mind at rest by an assurance that he understood what was wanted for how was it possible the good man could form any reasonable judgment about the matter mister Stelling s duty was to teach the lad in the only right way indeed he knew no other he had not wasted his time in the acquirement of anything abnormal He very soon set down poor Tom as a thoroughly stupid lad for though by hard labor he could get particular declensions into his brain anything so abstract as the relation between cases and terminations could by no means get such a lodgment there as to enable him to recognize a chance genitive or dative This struck mister Stelling as something more than natural stupidity he suspected obstinacy or at any rate indifference and lectured Tom severely on his want of thorough application You feel no interest in what you re doing sir mister Stelling would say and the reproach was painfully true Tom had never found any difficulty in discerning a pointer from a setter when once he had been told the distinction and his perceptive powers were not at all deficient I fancy they were quite as strong as those of the reverend mister Stelling for Tom could predict with accuracy what number of horses were cantering behind him he could throw a stone right into the centre of a given ripple he could guess to a fraction how many lengths of his stick it would take to reach across the playground and could draw almost perfect squares on his slate without any measurement But mister Stelling took no note of these things he only observed that Tom s faculties failed him before the abstractions hideously symbolized to him in the pages of the Eton Grammar and that he was in a state bordering on idiocy with regard to the demonstration that two given triangles must be equal though he could discern with great promptitude and certainty the fact that they were equal Whence mister Stelling concluded that Tom s brain being peculiarly impervious to etymology and demonstrations was peculiarly in need of being ploughed and harrowed by these patent implements it was his favorite metaphor that the classics and geometry constituted that culture of the mind which prepared it for the reception of any subsequent crop I say nothing against mister Stelling s theory if we are to have one regimen for all minds his seems to me as good as any other I only know it turned out as uncomfortably for Tom Tulliver as if he had been plied with cheese in order to remedy a gastric weakness which prevented him from digesting it It is astonishing what a different result one gets by changing the metaphor Once call the brain an intellectual stomach and one s ingenious conception of the classics and geometry as ploughs and harrows seems to settle nothing But then it is open to some one else to follow great authorities and call the mind a sheet of white paper or a mirror in which case one s knowledge of the digestive process becomes quite irrelevant It was doubtless an ingenious idea to call the camel the ship of the desert but it would hardly lead one far in training that useful beast O Aristotle if you had had the advantage of being the freshest modern instead of the greatest ancient would you not have mingled your praise of metaphorical speech as a sign of high intelligence with a lamentation that intelligence so rarely shows itself in speech without metaphor that we can so seldom declare what a thing is except by saying it is something else Tom Tulliver being abundant in no form of speech did not use any metaphor to declare his views as to the nature of Latin he never called it an instrument of torture and it was not until he had got on some way in the next half year and in the Delectus that he was advanced enough to call it a bore and beastly stuff At present in relation to this demand that he should learn Latin declensions and conjugations Tom was in a state of as blank unimaginativeness concerning the cause and tendency of his sufferings as if he had been an innocent shrewmouse imprisoned in the split trunk of an ash tree in order to cure lameness in cattle It is doubtless almost incredible to instructed minds of the present day that a boy of twelve not belonging strictly to the masses who are now understood to have the monopoly of mental darkness should have had no distinct idea how there came to be such a thing as Latin on this earth yet so it was with Tom It would have taken a long while to make conceivable to him that there ever existed a people who bought and sold sheep and oxen and transacted the every day affairs of life through the medium of this language and still longer to make him understand why he should be called upon to learn it when its connection with those affairs had become entirely latent So far as Tom had gained any acquaintance with the Romans at mister Jacob s academy his knowledge was strictly correct but it went no farther than the fact that they were in the New Testament and mister Stelling was not the man to enfeeble and emasculate his pupil s mind by simplifying and explaining or to reduce the tonic effect of etymology by mixing it with smattering extraneous information such as is given to girls Yet strange to say under this vigorous treatment Tom became more like a girl than he had ever been in his life before He had a large share of pride which had hitherto found itself very comfortable in the world despising Old Goggles and reposing in the sense of unquestioned rights but now this same pride met with nothing but bruises and crushings Tom was too clear sighted not to be aware that mister Stelling s standard of things was quite different was certainly something higher in the eyes of the world than that of the people he had been living amongst and that brought in contact with it he Tom Tulliver appeared uncouth and stupid he was by no means indifferent to this and his pride got into an uneasy condition which quite nullified his boyish self satisfaction and gave him something of the girl s susceptibility He was a very firm not to say obstinate disposition but there was no brute like rebellion and recklessness in his nature the human sensibilities predominated and if it had occurred to him that he could enable himself to show some quickness at his lessons and so acquire mister Stelling s approbation by standing on one leg for an inconvenient length of time or rapping his head moderately against the wall or any voluntary action of that sort he would certainly have tried it But no Tom had never heard that these measures would brighten the understanding or strengthen the verbal memory and he was not given to hypothesis and experiment It did occur to him that he could perhaps get some help by praying for it but as the prayers he said every evening were forms learned by heart he rather shrank from the novelty and irregularity of introducing an extempore passage on a topic of petition for which he was not aware of any precedent But one day when he had broken down for the fifth time in the supines of the third conjugation and mister Stelling convinced that this must be carelessness since it transcended the bounds of possible stupidity had lectured him very seriously pointing out that if he failed to seize the present golden opportunity of learning supines he would have to regret it when he became a man Tom more miserable than usual determined to try his sole resource and that evening after his usual form of prayer for his parents and little sister he had begun to pray for Maggie when she was a baby and that he might be able always to keep God s commandments he added in the same low whisper and please to make me always remember my Latin He paused a little to consider how he should pray about Euclid whether he should ask to see what it meant or whether there was any other mental state which would be more applicable to the case But at last he added And make mister Stelling say I sha n t do Euclid any more Amen The fact that he got through his supines without mistake the next day encouraged him to persevere in this appendix to his prayers and neutralized any scepticism that might have arisen from mister Stelling s continued demand for Euclid But his faith broke down under the apparent absence of all help when he got into the irregular verbs It seemed clear that Tom s despair under the caprices of the present tense did not constitute a nodus worthy of interference and since this was the climax of his difficulties where was the use of praying for help any longer He made up his mind to this conclusion in one of his dull lonely evenings which he spent in the study preparing his lessons for the morrow His eyes were apt to get dim over the page though he hated crying and was ashamed of it he couldn t help thinking with some affection even of Spouncer whom he used to fight and quarrel with he would have felt at home with Spouncer and in a condition of superiority And then the mill and the river and Yap pricking up his ears ready to obey the least sign when Tom said Hoigh would all come before him in a sort of calenture when his fingers played absently in his pocket with his great knife and his coil of whipcord and other relics of the past Tom as I said had never been so much like a girl in his life before and at that epoch of irregular verbs his spirit was further depressed by a new means of mental development which had been thought of for him out of school hours missus Stelling had lately had her second baby and as nothing could be more salutary for a boy than to feel himself useful missus Stelling considered she was doing Tom a service by setting him to watch the little cherub Laura while the nurse was occupied with the sickly baby It was quite a pretty employment for Tom to take little Laura out in the sunniest hour of the autumn day it would help to make him feel that Lorton Parsonage was a home for him and that he was one of the family The little cherub Laura not being an accomplished walker at present had a ribbon fastened round her waist by which Tom held her as if she had been a little dog during the minutes in which she chose to walk but as these were rare he was for the most part carrying this fine child round and round the garden within sight of missus Stelling s window according to orders If any one considers this unfair and even oppressive toward Tom I beg him to consider that there are feminine virtues which are with difficulty combined even if they are not incompatible When the wife of a poor curate contrives under all her disadvantages to dress extremely well and to have a style of coiffure which requires that her nurse shall occasionally officiate as lady s maid when moreover her dinner parties and her drawing room show that effort at elegance and completeness of appointment to which ordinary women might imagine a large income necessary it would be unreasonable to expect of her that she should employ a second nurse or even act as a nurse herself mister Stelling knew better he saw that his wife did wonders already and was proud of her It was certainly not the best thing in the world for young Tulliver s gait to carry a heavy child but he had plenty of exercise in long walks with himself and next half year mister Stelling would see about having a drilling master Among the many means whereby mister Stelling intended to be more fortunate than the bulk of his fellow men he had entirely given up that of having his own way in his own house What then He had married as kind a little soul as ever breathed according to mister Riley who had been acquainted with missus Stelling s blond ringlets and smiling demeanor throughout her maiden life and on the strength of that knowledge would have been ready any day to pronounce that whatever domestic differences might arise in her married life must be entirely mister Stelling s fault If Tom had had a worse disposition he would certainly have hated the little cherub Laura but he was too kind hearted a lad for that there was too much in him of the fibre that turns to true manliness and to protecting pity for the weak I am afraid he hated missus Stelling and contracted a lasting dislike to pale blond ringlets and broad plaits as directly associated with haughtiness of manner and a frequent reference to other people s duty But he couldn t help playing with little Laura and liking to amuse her he even sacrificed his percussion caps for her sake in despair of their ever serving a greater purpose thinking the small flash and bang would delight her and thereby drawing down on himself a rebuke from missus Stelling for teaching her child to play with fire Laura was a sort of playfellow and oh how Tom longed for playfellows In his secret heart he yearned to have Maggie with him and was almost ready to dote on her exasperating acts of forgetfulness though when he was at home he always represented it as a great favor on his part to let Maggie trot by his side on his pleasure excursions And before this dreary half year was ended Maggie actually came missus Stelling had given a general invitation for the little girl to come and stay with her brother so when mister Tulliver drove over to King s Lorton late in October Maggie came too with the sense that she was taking a great journey and beginning to see the world It was mister Tulliver s first visit to see Tom for the lad must learn not to think too much about home Well my lad he said to Tom when mister Stelling had left the room to announce the arrival to his wife and Maggie had begun to kiss Tom freely you look rarely School agrees with you Tom wished he had looked rather ill I don t think I am well father said Tom I wish you d ask mister Stelling not to let me do Euclid it brings on the toothache I think The toothache was the only malady to which Tom had ever been subject Euclid my lad why what s that said mister Tulliver Oh I don t know it s definitions and axioms and triangles and things It s a book I ve got to learn in there s no sense in it Go go said mister Tulliver reprovingly you mustn t say so You must learn what your master tells you He knows what it s right for you to learn I ll help you now Tom said Maggie with a little air of patronizing consolation I m come to stay ever so long if missus Stelling asks me I ve brought my box and my pinafores haven t I father You help me you silly little thing said Tom in such high spirits at this announcement that he quite enjoyed the idea of confounding Maggie by showing her a page of Euclid I should like to see you doing one of my lessons Why I learn Latin too Girls never learn such things They re too silly I know what Latin is very well said Maggie confidently Latin s a language There are Latin words in the Dictionary There s bonus a gift Now you re just wrong there Miss Maggie said Tom secretly astonished You think you re very wise But bonus means good as it happens bonus bona bonum Well that s no reason why it shouldn t mean gift said Maggie stoutly It may mean several things almost every word does There s lawn it means the grass plot as well as the stuff pocket handkerchiefs are made of Well done little un said mister Tulliver laughing while Tom felt rather disgusted with Maggie s knowingness though beyond measure cheerful at the thought that she was going to stay with him Her conceit would soon be overawed by the actual inspection of his books missus Stelling in her pressing invitation did not mention a longer time than a week for Maggie s stay but mister Stelling who took her between his knees and asked her where she stole her dark eyes from insisted that she must stay a fortnight Maggie thought mister Stelling was a charming man and mister Tulliver was quite proud to leave his little wench where she would have an opportunity of showing her cleverness to appreciating strangers So it was agreed that she should not be fetched home till the end of the fortnight Now then come with me into the study Maggie said Tom as their father drove away What do you shake and toss your head now for you silly he continued for though her hair was now under a new dispensation and was brushed smoothly behind her ears she seemed still in imagination to be tossing it out of her eyes It makes you look as if you were crazy Oh I can t help it said Maggie impatiently Don t tease me Tom Oh what books she exclaimed as she saw the bookcases in the study How I should like to have as many books as that Why you couldn t read one of em said Tom triumphantly They re all Latin No they aren t said Maggie I can read the back of this History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire Well what does that mean You don t know said Tom wagging his head But I could soon find out said Maggie scornfully Why how I should look inside and see what it was about You d better not Miss Maggie said Tom seeing her hand on the volume mister Stelling lets nobody touch his books without leave and I shall catch it if you take it out Oh very well Let me see all your books then said Maggie turning to throw her arms round Tom s neck and rub his cheek with her small round nose Tom in the gladness of his heart at having dear old Maggie to dispute with and crow over again seized her round the waist and began to jump with her round the large library table Away they jumped with more and more vigor till Maggie s hair flew from behind her ears and twirled about like an animated mop But the revolutions round the table became more and more irregular in their sweep till at last reaching mister Stelling s reading stand they sent it thundering down with its heavy lexicons to the floor Happily it was the ground floor and the study was a one storied wing to the house so that the downfall made no alarming resonance though Tom stood dizzy and aghast for a few minutes dreading the appearance of mister or missus Stelling Oh I say Maggie said Tom at last lifting up the stand we must keep quiet here you know If we break anything missus Stelling ll make us cry peccavi What s that said Maggie Oh it s the Latin for a good scolding said Tom not without some pride in his knowledge Is she a cross woman said Maggie I believe you said Tom with an emphatic nod I think all women are crosser than men said Maggie Aunt Glegg s a great deal crosser than uncle Glegg and mother scolds me more than father does Well you ll be a woman some day said Tom so you needn t talk But I shall be a clever woman said Maggie with a toss Oh I dare say and a nasty conceited thing Everybody ll hate you But you oughtn t to hate me Tom it ll be very wicked of you for I shall be your sister Yes but if you re a nasty disagreeable thing I shall hate you Oh but Tom you won t I sha n t be disagreeable I shall be very good to you and I shall be good to everybody You won t hate me really will you Tom Oh bother never mind Come it s time for me to learn my lessons See here what I ve got to do said Tom drawing Maggie toward him and showing her his theorem while she pushed her hair behind her ears and prepared herself to prove her capability of helping him in Euclid She began to read with full confidence in her own powers but presently becoming quite bewildered her face flushed with irritation It was unavoidable she must confess her incompetency and she was not fond of humiliation It s nonsense she said and very ugly stuff nobody need want to make it out Ah there now Miss Maggie said Tom drawing the book away and wagging his head at her You see you re not so clever as you thought you were Oh said Maggie pouting I dare say I could make it out if I d learned what goes before as you have But that s what you just couldn t Miss Wisdom said Tom For it s all the harder when you know what goes before for then you ve got to say what definition three is and what axiom V is But get along with you now I must go on with this Here s the Latin Grammar See what you can make of that Maggie found the Latin Grammar quite soothing after her mathematical mortification for she delighted in new words and quickly found that there was an English Key at the end which would make her very wise about Latin at slight expense She presently made up her mind to skip the rules in the Syntax the examples became so absorbing These mysterious sentences snatched from an unknown context like strange horns of beasts and leaves of unknown plants brought from some far off region gave boundless scope to her imagination and were all the more fascinating because they were in a peculiar tongue of their own which she could learn to interpret It was really very interesting the Latin Grammar that Tom had said no girls could learn and she was proud because she found it interesting The most fragmentary examples were her favourites Mors omnibus est communis would have been jejune only she liked to know the Latin but the fortunate gentleman whom every one congratulated because he had a son endowed with such a disposition afforded her a great deal of pleasant conjecture and she was quite lost in the thick grove penetrable by no star when Tom called out Now then Magsie give us the Grammar Oh Tom it s such a pretty book she said as she jumped out of the large arm chair to give it him it s much prettier than the Dictionary I could learn Latin very soon I don t think it s at all hard Oh I know what you ve been doing said Tom you ve been reading the English at the end Any donkey can do that Tom seized the book and opened it with a determined and business like air as much as to say that he had a lesson to learn which no donkeys would find themselves equal to Maggie rather piqued turned to the bookcases to amuse herself with puzzling out the titles Presently Tom called to her Here Magsie come and hear if I can say this Stand at that end of the table where mister Stelling sits when he hears me Maggie obeyed and took the open book Where do you begin Tom Oh I begin at Appellativa arborum because I say all over again what I ve been learning this week Tom sailed along pretty well for three lines and Maggie was beginning to forget her office of prompter in speculating as to what mas could mean which came twice over when he stuck fast at Sunt etiam volucrum Don t tell me Maggie Sunt etiam volucrum Sunt etiam volucrum ut ostrea cetus No said Maggie opening her mouth and shaking her head Sunt etiam volucrum said Tom very slowly as if the next words might be expected to come sooner when he gave them this strong hint that they were waited for C e u said Maggie getting impatient Oh I know hold your tongue said Tom Ceu passer hirundo Ferarum ferarum Tom took his pencil and made several hard dots with it on his book cover ferarum Oh dear oh dear Tom said Maggie what a time you are Ut Ut ostrea No no said Maggie ut tigris Oh yes now I can do said Tom it was tigris vulpes I d forgotten ut tigris volupes et Piscium With some further stammering and repetition Tom got through the next few lines Now then he said the next is what I ve just learned for to morrow Give me hold of the book a minute After some whispered gabbling assisted by the beating of his fist on the table Tom returned the book Mascula nomina in a he began No Tom said Maggie that doesn t come next It s Nomen non creskens genittivo Creskens genittivo exclaimed Tom with a derisive laugh for Tom had learned this omitted passage for his yesterday s lesson and a young gentleman does not require an intimate or extensive acquaintance with Latin before he can feel the pitiable absurdity of a false quantity Creskens genittivo What a little silly you are Maggie Well you needn t laugh Tom for you didn t remember it at all I m sure it s spelt so how was I to know Phee e e h I told you girls couldn t learn Latin It s Nomen non crescens genitivo Very well then said Maggie pouting I can say that as well as you can And you don t mind your stops For you ought to stop twice as long at a semicolon as you do at a comma and you make the longest stops where there ought to be no stop at all Oh well don t chatter Let me go on They were presently fetched to spend the rest of the evening in the drawing room and Maggie became so animated with mister Stelling who she felt sure admired her cleverness that Tom was rather amazed and alarmed at her audacity But she was suddenly subdued by mister Stelling s alluding to a little girl of whom he had heard that she once ran away to the gypsies What a very odd little girl that must be said missus Stelling meaning to be playful but a playfulness that turned on her supposed oddity was not at all to Maggie s taste She feared that mister Stelling after all did not think much of her and went to bed in rather low spirits missus Stelling she felt looked at her as if she thought her hair was very ugly because it hung down straight behind Nevertheless it was a very happy fortnight to Maggie this visit to Tom She was allowed to be in the study while he had his lessons and in her various readings got very deep into the examples in the Latin Grammar The astronomer who hated women generally caused her so much puzzling speculation that she one day asked mister Stelling if all astronomers hated women or whether it was only this particular astronomer But forestalling his answer she said I suppose it s all astronomers because you know they live up in high towers and if the women came there they might talk and hinder them from looking at the stars mister Stelling liked her prattle immensely and they were on the best terms She told Tom she should like to go to school to mister Stelling as he did and learn just the same things She knew she could do Euclid for she had looked into it again and she saw what A B C meant they were the names of the lines I m sure you couldn t do it now said Tom and I ll just ask mister Stelling if you could I don t mind said the little conceited minx I ll ask him myself mister Stelling she said that same evening when they were in the drawing room couldn t I do Euclid and all Tom s lessons if you were to teach me instead of him No you couldn t said Tom indignantly Girls can t do Euclid can they sir They can pick up a little of everything I dare say said mister Stelling They ve a great deal of superficial cleverness but they couldn t go far into anything They re quick and shallow Tom delighted with this verdict telegraphed his triumph by wagging his head at Maggie behind mister Stelling s chair As for Maggie she had hardly ever been so mortified She had been so proud to be called quick all her little life and now it appeared that this quickness was the brand of inferiority It would have been better to be slow like Tom Ha ha Miss Maggie said Tom when they were alone you see it s not such a fine thing to be quick You ll never go far into anything you know And Maggie was so oppressed by this dreadful destiny that she had no spirit for a retort But when this small apparatus of shallow quickness was fetched away in the gig by Luke and the study was once more quite lonely for Tom he missed her grievously He had really been brighter and had got through his lessons better since she had been there and she had asked mister Stelling so many questions about the Roman Empire and whether there really ever was a man who said in Latin I would not buy it for a farthing or a rotten nut or whether that had only been turned into Latin that Tom had actually come to a dim understanding of the fact that there had once been people upon the earth who were so fortunate as to know Latin without learning it through the medium of the Eton Grammar This luminous idea was a great addition to his historical acquirements during this half year which were otherwise confined to an epitomized history of the Jews But the dreary half year did come to an end How glad Tom was to see the last yellow leaves fluttering before the cold wind The dark afternoons and the first December snow seemed to him far livelier than the August sunshine and that he might make himself the surer about the flight of the days that were carrying him homeward he stuck twenty one sticks deep in a corner of the garden when he was three weeks from the holidays and pulled one up every day with a great wrench throwing it to a distance with a vigor of will which would have carried it to limbo if it had been in the nature of sticks to travel so far But it was worth purchasing even at the heavy price of the Latin Grammar the happiness of seeing the bright light in the parlor at home as the gig passed noiselessly over the snow covered bridge the happiness of passing from the cold air to the warmth and the kisses and the smiles of that familiar hearth where the pattern of the rug and the grate and the fire irons were first ideas that it was no more possible to criticise than the solidity and extension of matter There is no sense of ease like the ease we felt in those scenes where we were born where objects became dear to us before we had known the labor of choice and where the outer world seemed only an extension of our own personality we accepted and loved it as we accepted our own sense of existence and our own limbs Very commonplace even ugly that furniture of our early home might look if it were put up to auction an improved taste in upholstery scorns it and is not the striving after something better and better in our surroundings the grand characteristic that distinguishes man from the brute or to satisfy a scrupulous accuracy of definition that distinguishes the British man from the foreign brute But heaven knows where that striving might lead us if our affections had not a trick of twining round those old inferior things if the loves and sanctities of our life had no deep immovable roots in memory One s delight in an elderberry bush overhanging the confused leafage of a hedgerow bank as a more gladdening sight than the finest cistus or fuchsia spreading itself on the softest undulating turf is an entirely unjustifiable preference to a nursery gardener or to any of those regulated minds who are free from the weakness of any attachment that does not rest on a demonstrable superiority of qualities And there is no better reason for preferring this elderberry bush than that it stirs an early memory that it is no novelty in my life speaking to me merely through my present sensibilities to form and color but the long companion of my existence that wove itself into my joys when joys were vivid Chapter II The Christmas Holidays 
2351-151969-0000	train-other-500	Fine old Christmas with the snowy hair and ruddy face had done his duty that year in the noblest fashion and had set off his rich gifts of warmth and color with all the heightening contrast of frost and snow
none	none	 Snow lay on the croft and river bank in undulations softer than the limbs of infancy it lay with the neatliest finished border on every sloping roof making the dark red gables stand out with a new depth of color 
2351-151969-0001	train-other-500	it weighed heavily on the laurels and fir trees till it fell from them with a shuddering sound it clothed the rough turnip field with whiteness and made the sheep look like dark blotches
2351-151969-0002	train-other-500	the gates were all blocked up with the sloping drifts and here and there a disregarded four footed beast stood as if petrified in unrecumbent sadness there was no gleam no shadow
2351-151969-0003	train-other-500	for the heavens too were one still pale cloud no sound or motion in anything but the dark river that flowed and moaned like an unresting sorrow But old Christmas smiled as he laid this cruel seeming spell on the outdoor world
2351-151969-0004	train-other-500	for he meant to light up home with new brightness to deepen all the richness of indoor color and give a keener edge of delight to the warm fragrance of food he meant to prepare a sweet imprisonment that would strengthen the primitive fellowship of kindred
none	none	 and make the sunshine of familiar human faces as welcome as the hidden day star His kindness fell but hardly on the homeless fell but hardly on the homes where the hearth was not very warm and where the food had little fragrance where the human faces had had no sunshine in them but rather the leaden blank eyed gaze of unexpectant want But the fine old season meant well and if he has not learned the secret how to bless men impartially it is because his father Time 
2351-151969-0005	train-other-500	with ever unrelenting unrelenting purpose still hides that secret in his own mighty slow beating heart And yet this Christmas day in spite of Tom s fresh delight in home was not he thought somehow or other
2351-151969-0006	train-other-500	quite so happy as it had always been before The red berries were just as abundant on the holly and he and Maggie had dressed all the windows and mantlepieces and picture frames on Christmas eve with as much taste as ever
none	none	 wedding the thick set scarlet clusters with branches of the black berried ivy There had been singing under the windows after midnight supernatural singing Maggie always felt in spite of Tom s contemptuous insistence that the singers were old Patch the parish clerk and the rest of the church choir she trembled with awe 
2351-151969-0007	train-other-500	when their carolling broke in upon her dreams and the image of men in fustian clothes was always thrust away by the vision of angels resting on the parted cloud The midnight chant
2351-151969-0008	train-other-500	had helped as usual to lift the morning above the level of common days and then there were the smell
none	none	 of hot toast and ale

none	none	 were looking like so many reflectors of the bright parlor fire when the church goers came back stamping the snow from their feet The plum pudding was of the same handsome roundness as ever and came in with the symbolic blue flames around it 
2351-151969-0010	train-other-500	as if it had been heroically snatched from the nether fires into which it had been thrown by dyspeptic Puritans the dessert was as splendid as ever
2351-151969-0011	train-other-500	with its golden oranges brown nuts and the crystalline light and dark of apple jelly and damson cheese in all these things Christmas was as it had always been since Tom could remember it was only distinguished if by anything
2351-151969-0012	train-other-500	by superior sliding and snowballs Christmas was cheery but not so mister Tulliver He was irate and defiant and Tom though he espoused his father s quarrels and shared his father s sense of injury
2351-151969-0013	train-other-500	was not without some of the feeling that oppressed Maggie when mister Tulliver got louder and more angry in narration and assertion with the increased leisure of dessert The attention that Tom might have concentrated on his nuts and wine was distracted
none	none	 by a sense that there were rascally enemies in the world 
2351-151969-0014	train-other-500	and that the business of grown up life could hardly be conducted without a good deal of quarrelling Now Tom was not fond of quarrelling unless it could soon be put an end to by a fair stand up fight with an adversary whom he had every chance of thrashing
2351-151969-0015	train-other-500	and his father s irritable talk made him uncomfortable though he never accounted to himself for the feeling or conceived the notion that his father was faulty in this respect
none	none	 The particular embodiment of the evil principle now exciting mister Tulliver s determined resistance was mister Pivart who having lands higher up the Ripple was taking measures for their irrigation which either were or would be or were bound to be on the principle that water was water 
2351-151969-0016	train-other-500	an infringement on mister Tulliver s legitimate share of water power Dix who had a mill on the stream was a feeble auxiliary of Old Harry compared with Pivart Dix had been brought to his senses by arbitration
2351-151969-0017	train-other-500	and Wakem s advice had not carried him far No Dix mister Tulliver considered had been as good as nowhere in point of law and in the intensity of his indignation against Pivart his contempt for a baffled adversary like Dix
2351-151969-0018	train-other-500	began to wear the air of a friendly attachment He had no male audience to day except mister Moss who knew nothing as he said
none	none	 of the natur o mills 
2351-151969-0019	train-other-500	and could only assent to mister Tulliver s arguments on the a priori ground of family relationship and monetary obligation but mister Tulliver did not talk with the futile intention of convincing his audience
2351-151969-0020	train-other-500	he talked to relieve himself while good mister Moss made strong efforts to keep his eyes wide open in spite of the sleepiness which an unusually good dinner produced in his hard worked frame missus Moss more alive to the subject
2351-151969-0021	train-other-500	and interested in everything that affected her brother listened and put in a word as often as maternal preoccupations allowed Why Pivart s a new name hereabout brother isn t it she said
2351-151969-0022	train-other-500	he didn t own the land in father s time nor yours either before I was married New name Yes I should think it is a new name said mister Tulliver with angry emphasis Dorlcote Mill s been in our family a hundred year and better

none	none	 as know more o th ins and outs o the law else how came Wakem to lose Brumley s suit for him mister Tulliver was a strictly honest man and proud of being honest but he considered that in law the ends of justice could only be achieved by employing a stronger knave to frustrate a weaker Law was a sort of cock fight in which it was the business of injured honesty to get a game bird with the best pluck and the strongest spurs Gore s no fool you needn t tell me that he observed presently in a pugnacious tone as if poor Gritty had been urging that lawyer s capabilities but you see he isn t up to the law as Wakem is And water s a very particular thing you can t pick it up with a pitchfork That s why it s been nuts to Old Harry and the lawyers It s plain enough what s the rights and the wrongs of water 
2351-151969-0025	train-other-500	if you look at it straight forrard for a river s a river and if you ve got a mill you must have water to turn it
none	none	 and it s no use telling me Pivart s erigation and nonsense won t stop my wheel I know what belongs to water better than that Talk to me o what th engineers say I say it s common sense as Pivart s dikes must do me an injury 
2351-151969-0026	train-other-500	But if that s their engineering I ll put Tom to it by and by and he shall see if he can t find a bit more sense
none	none	 in th engineering business than what that comes to Tom looking round with some anxiety at this announcement of his prospects unthinkingly withdrew a small rattle he was amusing baby Moss with whereupon she being a baby that knew her own mind with remarkable clearness 
2351-151969-0027	train-other-500	instantaneously expressed her sentiments in a piercing yell and was not to be appeased even by the restoration of the rattle feeling apparently that the original wrong of having it taken from her remained in all its force
2351-151969-0028	train-other-500	missus Moss hurried away with her into another room and expressed to missus Tulliver who accompanied her the conviction that the dear child had good reasons for crying implying that if it was supposed to be the rattle that baby clamored for
2351-151969-0029	train-other-500	she was a misunderstood baby The thoroughly justifiable yell being quieted missus Moss looked at her sister in law and said I m sorry to see brother so put out about this water work
2351-151969-0030	train-other-500	It s your brother s way missus Moss I d never anything o that sort before I was married said missus Tulliver with a half implied reproach She always spoke of her husband as your brother to missus Moss

2351-151969-0033	train-other-500	besides being poorly off and inclined to hang on her brother had the good natured submissiveness of a large easy tempered untidy prolific woman with affection enough in her not only for her own husband and abundant children
2351-151969-0034	train-other-500	but for any number of collateral relations I hope and pray he won t go to law said missus Moss for there s never any knowing where that ll end And the right doesn t allays win This mister Pivart s a rich man by what I can make out
2351-151969-0035	train-other-500	and the rich mostly get things their own way As to that said missus Tulliver stroking her dress down I ve seen what riches are in my own family for my sisters have got husbands as can afford to do pretty much what they like
2351-151969-0036	train-other-500	But I think sometimes I shall be drove off my head
none	none	 with the talk about this law and erigation 
2351-151969-0037	train-other-500	and my sisters lay all the fault to me for they don t know what it is to marry a man like your brother how should they Sister Pullet has her own way from morning till night Well said missus Moss
2351-151969-0038	train-other-500	I don t think I should like my husband if he hadn t got any wits of his own and I had to find head piece for him It s a deal easier to do what pleases one s husband than to be puzzling what else one should do
2351-151969-0039	train-other-500	If people come to talk o doing what pleases their husbands said missus Tulliver with a faint imitation of her sister Glegg I m sure your brother might have waited a long while before he d have found a wife that ud have let him have his say in everything as I do
2351-151969-0040	train-other-500	It s nothing but law and erigation now from when we first get up in the morning till we go to bed at night and I never contradict him I only say Well mister Tulliver do as you like
none	none	 but whativer you do don t go to law missus Tulliver as we have seen was not without influence over her husband No woman is she can always incline him to do either what she wishes or the reverse and on the composite impulses that were threatening to hurry mister Tulliver into law missus Tulliver s monotonous pleading had doubtless its share of force it might even be comparable to that proverbial feather 
2351-151969-0041	train-other-500	which has the credit or discredit of breaking the camel s back though on a strictly impartial view the blame ought rather to lie with the previous weight of feathers which had already placed the back in such imminent peril
2351-151969-0042	train-other-500	that an otherwise innocent feather could not settle on it without mischief Not that missus Tulliver s feeble beseeching could have had this feather s weight in virtue of her single personality but whenever she departed from entire assent to her husband
2351-151969-0043	train-other-500	he saw in her the representative of the Dodson family and it was a guiding principle with mister Tulliver to let the Dodsons know that they were not to domineer over him or more specifically that a male Tulliver
2351-151969-0044	train-other-500	was far more than equal to four female Dodsons even though one of them was missus Glegg But not even a direct argument from that typical Dodson female herself against his going to law could have heightened his disposition
none	none	 toward it 
2351-151969-0045	train-other-500	so much as the mere thought of Wakem continually freshened by the sight of the too able attorney on market days
none	none	 Wakem 
2351-151969-0046	train-other-500	to his certain knowledge was metaphorically speaking at the bottom of Pivart s irrigation Wakem had tried to make Dix stand out and go to law about the dam it was unquestionably Wakem
none	none	 who had caused mister Tulliver to lose the suit about the right of road and the bridge that made a thoroughfare of his land for every vagabond who preferred an opportunity of damaging private property to walking like an honest man along the highroad 
2351-151969-0047	train-other-500	all lawyers were more or less rascals but Wakem s rascality was of that peculiarly aggravated kind which placed itself in opposition to that form of right embodied in mister Tulliver s interests and opinions
2351-151969-0048	train-other-500	And as an extra touch of bitterness the injured miller had recently in borrowing the five hundred pounds been obliged to carry a little business to Wakem s office on his own account A hook nosed glib fellow
none	none	 as cool as a cucumber 
2351-151969-0049	train-other-500	always looking so sure of his game And it was vexatious that Lawyer Gore was not more like him but was a bald round featured man with bland manners and fat hands a game cock
none	none	 that you would be rash to bet upon against Wakem Gore was a sly fellow His weakness did not lie on the side of scrupulosity but the largest amount of winking however significant is not equivalent to seeing through a stone wall 
2351-151969-0050	train-other-500	and confident as mister Tulliver was in his principle that water was water
none	none	 and in the direct inference that Pivart had not a leg to stand on in this affair of irrigation 
2351-151969-0051	train-other-500	he had an uncomfortable suspicion that Wakem had more law to show against this rationally irrefragable inference than Gore could show for it But then
2351-151969-0052	train-other-500	if they went to law there was a chance for mister Tulliver to employ Counsellor Wylde on his side instead of having that admirable bully against him
none	none	 and the prospect of seeing a witness of Wakem s 
2351-151969-0053	train-other-500	made to perspire and become confounded as mister Tulliver s witness had once been was alluring to the love of retributive justice
none	none	 Much rumination had mister Tulliver on these puzzling subjects during his rides on the gray horse much turning of the head from side to side as the scales dipped alternately but the probable result was still out of sight 
2351-151969-0054	train-other-500	only to be reached through much hot argument and iteration in domestic and social life That initial stage of the dispute which consisted in the narration of the case and the enforcement of mister Tulliver s views concerning it
2351-151969-0055	train-other-500	throughout the entire circle of his connections would necessarily take time and at the beginning of February when Tom was going to school again
none	none	 there were scarcely any new items to be detected in his father s statement of the case against Pivart 
2351-151969-0056	train-other-500	or any more specific indication of the measures he was bent on taking against that rash contravener of the principle
none	none	 that water was water 
2351-151969-0057	train-other-500	Iteration like friction is likely to generate heat instead of progress and mister Tulliver s heat
none	none	 was certainly more and more palpable 
2351-151969-0058	train-other-500	If there had been no new evidence on any other point
none	none	 there had been new evidence that Pivart 
2351-151969-0059	train-other-500	was as thick as mud with Wakem Father said Tom one evening near the end of the holidays uncle Glegg says Lawyer Wakem is going to send his son to mister Stelling It isn t true what they said about his going to be sent to France
2351-151969-0060	train-other-500	You won t like me to go to school with Wakem s son shall you It s no matter for that my boy said mister Tulliver don t you learn anything bad of him that s all The lad s a poor deformed creatur and takes after his mother in the face
none	none	 I think there isn t much of his father in him It s a sign Wakem thinks high o mister Sterling as he sends his son to him and Wakem knows meal from bran mister Tulliver in his heart was rather proud of the fact that his son was to have the same advantages as Wakem s but Tom was not at all easy on the point It would have been much clearer if the lawyer s son had not been deformed for then Tom would have had the prospect of pitching into him with all that freedom which is derived from a high moral sanction Chapter III The New Schoolfellow 
2351-151970-0000	train-other-500	It was a cold wet January day on which Tom went back to school a day quite in keeping with this severe phase of his destiny If he had not carried in his pocket a parcel of sugar candy and a small Dutch doll for little Laura
none	none	 there would have been no ray of expected pleasure to enliven the general gloom But he liked to think how Laura would put out her lips and her tiny hands for the bits of sugarcandy and to give the greater keenness to these pleasures of imagination 
2351-151970-0001	train-other-500	he took out the parcel made a small hole in the paper and bit off a crystal or two which had so solacing an effect under the confined prospect and damp odors of the gig umbrella
2351-151970-0002	train-other-500	that he repeated the process more than once on his way Well Tulliver we re glad to see you again said mister Stelling heartily Take off your wrappings and come into the study till dinner
2351-151970-0003	train-other-500	You ll find a bright fire there and a new companion Tom felt in an uncomfortable flutter as he took off his woollen comforter and other wrappings He had seen Philip Wakem at saint Ogg s
2351-151970-0004	train-other-500	but had always turned his eyes away from him as quickly as possible He would have disliked having a deformed boy for his companion even if Philip had not been the son of a bad man And Tom did not see how a bad man s son could be very good
2351-151970-0005	train-other-500	His own father was a good man and he would readily have fought any one who said the contrary He was in a state of mingled embarrassment and defiance as he followed mister Stelling to the study
2351-151970-0006	train-other-500	Here is a new companion for you to shake hands with Tulliver said that gentleman on entering the study Master Philip Wakem I shall leave you to make acquaintance by yourselves
none	none	 You already know something of each other I imagine for you are neighbors at home Tom looked confused and awkward while Philip rose and glanced at him timidly Tom did not like to go up and put out his hand 
2351-151970-0007	train-other-500	and he was not prepared to say How do you do on so short a notice mister Stelling wisely turned away and closed the door behind him boys shyness only wears off in the absence of their elders
2351-151970-0008	train-other-500	Philip was at once too proud and too timid to walk toward Tom He thought or rather felt that Tom had an aversion to looking at him every one almost disliked looking at him
none	none	 and his deformity was more conspicuous when he walked So they remained without shaking hands or even speaking while Tom went to the fire and warmed himself every now and then casting furtive glances at Philip who seemed to be drawing absently first one object and then another on a piece of paper he had before him He had seated himself again 
2351-151970-0009	train-other-500	and as he drew was thinking what he could say to Tom and trying to overcome his own repugnance to making the first advances Tom began to look oftener and longer at Philip s face
2351-151970-0010	train-other-500	for he could see it without noticing the hump and it was really not a disagreeable face very old looking Tom thought He wondered how much older Philip was than himself An anatomist even a mere physiognomist
2351-151970-0011	train-other-500	would have seen that the deformity of Philip s spine was not a congenital hump but the result of an accident in infancy but you do not expect from Tom any acquaintance with such distinctions
2351-151970-0012	train-other-500	to him Philip was simply a humpback He had a vague notion that the deformity of Wakem s son had some relation to the lawyer s rascality of which he had so often heard his father talk with hot emphasis
none	none	 and he felt too a half admitted fear of him as probably a spiteful fellow who not being able to fight you had cunning ways of doing you a mischief by the sly 
2351-151970-0013	train-other-500	There was a humpbacked tailor in the neighborhood of mister Jacobs s academy who was considered a very unamiable character and was much hooted after by public spirited boys
2351-151970-0014	train-other-500	solely on the ground of his unsatisfactory moral qualities so that Tom was not without a basis of fact to go upon Still no face could be more unlike that ugly tailor s than this melancholy boy s face
none	none	 the brown hair round it waved and curled at the ends like a girl s Tom thought that truly pitiable This Wakem was a pale puny fellow and it was quite clear he would not be able to play at anything worth speaking of 
2351-151970-0015	train-other-500	but he handled his pencil in an enviable manner and was apparently making one thing after another without any trouble What was he drawing Tom was quite warm now and wanted something new to be going forward It was certainly more agreeable
2351-151970-0016	train-other-500	to have an ill natured humpback as a companion than to stand looking out of the study window at the rain and kicking his foot against the washboard in solitude something would happen every day a quarrel or something and Tom thought he should rather like to show Philip
none	none	 that he had better not try his spiteful tricks on him 
2351-151970-0017	train-other-500	He suddenly walked across the hearth and looked over Philip s paper Why that s a donkey with panniers and a spaniel and partridges in the corn he exclaimed his tongue being completely loosed by surprise and admiration
2351-151970-0018	train-other-500	Oh my buttons I wish I could draw like that I m to learn drawing this half I wonder if I shall learn to make dogs and donkeys Oh you can do them without learning said Philip I never learned drawing
2351-151970-0019	train-other-500	Never learned said Tom in amazement Why when I make dogs and horses and those things the heads and the legs won t come right though I can see how they ought to be very well I can make houses and all sorts of chimneys
none	none	 chimneys going all down the wall 
2351-151970-0020	train-other-500	and windows in the roof and all that But I dare say I could do dogs and horses if I was to try more he added reflecting that Philip might falsely suppose that he was going to knock under if he were too frank about the imperfection of his accomplishments
2351-151970-0021	train-other-500	Oh yes said Philip it s very easy You ve only to look well at things and draw them over and over again What you do wrong once you can alter the next time
none	none	 But haven t you been taught any thing 
2351-151970-0022	train-other-500	said Tom beginning to have a puzzled suspicion that Philip s crooked back might be the source of remarkable faculties I thought you d been to school a long while Yes said Philip smiling
none	none	 I ve been taught Latin and Greek and mathematics and writing and such things Oh but I say you don t like Latin though do you said Tom lowering his voice confidentially Pretty well 
2351-151970-0023	train-other-500	I don t care much about it said Philip Ah but perhaps you haven t got into the Propria quae maribus said Tom nodding his head sideways as much as to say
none	none	 that was the test it was easy talking till you came to that Philip felt some bitter complacency in the promising stupidity of this well made 
2351-151970-0024	train-other-500	active looking boy but made polite by his own extreme sensitiveness as well as by his desire to conciliate he checked his inclination to laugh and said quietly I ve done with the grammar I don t learn that any more
2351-151970-0025	train-other-500	Then you won t have the same lessons as I shall said Tom with a sense of disappointment No but I dare say I can help you I shall be very glad to help you if I can Tom did not say Thank you
2351-151970-0026	train-other-500	for he was quite absorbed in the thought that Wakem s son did not seem so spiteful a fellow as might have been expected I say he said presently do you love your father Yes said Philip coloring deeply don t you love yours
2351-151970-0027	train-other-500	Oh yes I only wanted to know said Tom rather ashamed of himself now he saw Philip coloring and looking uncomfortable
none	none	 He found much difficulty in adjusting his attitude of mind toward the son of Lawyer Wakem 
2351-151970-0028	train-other-500	and it had occurred to him that if Philip disliked his father that fact might go some way toward clearing up his perplexity Shall you learn drawing now he said by way of changing the subject No said Philip
2351-151970-0029	train-other-500	My father wishes me to give all my time to other things now What Latin and Euclid and those things said Tom Yes said Philip who had left off using his pencil and was resting his head on one hand while Tom was learning forward on both elbows
2351-151970-0030	train-other-500	and looking with increasing admiration at the dog and the donkey And you don t mind that said Tom with strong curiosity No I like to know what everybody else knows I can study what I like by and by
2351-151970-0031	train-other-500	I can t think why anybody should learn Latin said Tom It s no good It s part of the education of a gentleman said Philip All gentlemen learn the same things What do you think Sir John Crake
none	none	 the master of the harriers knows Latin said Tom 
2351-151970-0032	train-other-500	who had often thought he should like to resemble Sir John Crake He learned it when he was a boy of course said Philip But I dare say he s forgotten it Oh well I can do that then said Tom not with any epigrammatic intention
2351-151970-0033	train-other-500	but with serious satisfaction at the idea that as far as Latin was concerned there was no hindrance to his resembling Sir John Crake Only you re obliged to remember it while you re at school else you ve got to learn ever so many lines of Speaker
2351-151970-0034	train-other-500	mister Stelling s very particular did you know
none	none	 He ll have you up ten times if you say nam for jam he won t let you go a letter wrong I can tell you 
2351-151970-0035	train-other-500	Oh I don t mind said Philip unable to choke a laugh I can remember things easily And there are some lessons I m very fond of I m very fond of Greek history and everything about the Greeks I should like to have been a Greek
2351-151970-0036	train-other-500	and fought the Persians and then have come home and have written tragedies or else have been listened to by everybody for my wisdom like Socrates and have died a grand death
none	none	 Philip you perceive was not without a wish to impress the well made barbarian with a sense of his mental superiority Why were the Greeks great fighters said Tom 
2351-151970-0037	train-other-500	who saw a vista in this direction Is there anything like David and Goliath and Samson in the Greek history Those are the only bits I like in the history of the Jews Oh there are very fine stories of that sort about the Greeks
none	none	 about the heroes of early times who killed the wild beasts as Samson did And in the Odyssey that s a beautiful poem there s a more wonderful giant than Goliath Polypheme who had only one eye in the middle of his forehead 
2351-151970-0038	train-other-500	and Ulysses a little fellow but very wise and cunning got a red hot pine tree and stuck it into this one eye and made him roar like a thousand bulls Oh what fun said Tom
none	none	 jumping away from the table and stamping first with one leg and then the other I say can you tell me all about those stories Because I sha n t learn Greek you know Shall I he added pausing in his stamping with a sudden alarm lest the contrary might be possible 
2351-151970-0039	train-other-500	Does every gentleman learn Greek Will mister Stelling make me begin with it do you think No I should think not very likely not said Philip But you may read those stories without knowing Greek I ve got them in English
none	none	 Oh but I don t like reading I d sooner have you tell them me But only the fighting ones you know My sister Maggie is always wanting to tell me stories but they re stupid things Girls stories always are Can you tell a good many fighting stories Oh yes said Philip lots of them besides the Greek stories I can tell you about Richard Coeur de Lion and Saladin 
2351-151970-0040	train-other-500	and about William Wallace and Robert Bruce and James Douglas I know no end You re older than I am aren t you said Tom Why how old are you I m fifteen
none	none	 I m only going in fourteen said Tom 
2351-151970-0041	train-other-500	But I thrashed all the fellows at Jacob s that s where I was before I came here And I beat em all at bandy and climbing And I wish mister Stelling would let us go fishing I could show you how to fish You could fish couldn t you
2351-151970-0042	train-other-500	It s only standing and sitting still you know Tom in his turn wished to make the balance dip in his favor This hunchback must not suppose that his acquaintance with fighting stories put him on a par with an actual fighting hero like Tom Tulliver
none	none	 Philip winced under this allusion to his unfitness for active sports and he answered almost peevishly I can t bear fishing I think people look like fools sitting watching a line hour after hour or else throwing and throwing and catching nothing Ah but you wouldn t say they looked like fools when they landed a big pike I can tell you said Tom who had never caught anything that was big in his life but whose imagination was on the stretch with indignant zeal for the honor of sport Wakem s son it was plain had his disagreeable points and must be kept in due check Happily for the harmony of this first interview they were now called to dinner and Philip was not allowed to develop farther his unsound views on the subject of fishing But Tom said to himself that was just what he should have expected from a hunchback Chapter IV The Young Idea The alterations of feeling in that first dialogue between Tom and Philip continued to make their intercourse even after many weeks of schoolboy intimacy Tom never quite lost the feeling that Philip being the son of a rascal was his natural enemy never thoroughly overcame his repulsion to Philip s deformity He was a boy who adhered tenaciously to impressions once received as with all minds in which mere perception predominates over thought and emotion the external remained to him rigidly what it was in the first instance But then it was impossible not to like Philip s company when he was in a good humor he could help one so well in one s Latin exercises which Tom regarded as a kind of puzzle that could only be found out by a lucky chance and he could tell such wonderful fighting stories about Hal of the Wynd for example and other heroes who were especial favorites with Tom because they laid about them with heavy strokes He had small opinion of Saladin whose cimeter could cut a cushion in two in an instant who wanted to cut cushions That was a stupid story and he didn t care to hear it again But when Robert Bruce on the black pony rose in his stirrups and lifting his good battle axe cracked at once the helmet and the skull of the too hasty knight at Bannockburn then Tom felt all the exaltation of sympathy and if he had had a cocoanut at hand he would have cracked it at once with the poker Philip in his happier moods indulged Tom to the top of his bent heightening the crash and bang and fury of every fight with all the artillery of epithets and similes at his command But he was not always in a good humor or happy mood The slight spurt of peevish susceptibility which had escaped him in their first interview was a symptom of a perpetually recurring mental ailment half of it nervous irritability half of it the heart bitterness produced by the sense of his deformity In these fits of susceptibility every glance seemed to him to be charged either with offensive pity or with ill repressed disgust at the very least it was an indifferent glance and Philip felt indifference as a child of the south feels the chill air of a northern spring Poor Tom s blundering patronage when they were out of doors together would sometimes make him turn upon the well meaning lad quite savagely and his eyes usually sad and quiet would flash with anything but playful lightning No wonder Tom retained his suspicions of the humpback But Philip s self taught skill in drawing was another link between them for Tom found to his disgust that his new drawing master gave him no dogs and donkeys to draw but brooks and rustic bridges and ruins all with a general softness of black lead surface indicating that nature if anything was rather satiny and as Tom s feeling for the picturesque in landscape was at present quite latent it is not surprising that mister Goodrich s productions seemed to him an uninteresting form of art mister Tulliver having a vague intention that Tom should be put to some business which included the drawing out of plans and maps had complained to mister Riley when he saw him at Mudport that Tom seemed to be learning nothing of that sort whereupon that obliging adviser had suggested that Tom should have drawing lessons mister Tulliver must not mind paying extra for drawing let Tom be made a good draughtsman and he would be able to turn his pencil to any purpose So it was ordered that Tom should have drawing lessons and whom should mister Stelling have selected as a master if not mister Goodrich who was considered quite at the head of his profession within a circuit of twelve miles round King s Lorton By which means Tom learned to make an extremely fine point to his pencil and to represent landscape with a broad generality which doubtless from a narrow tendency in his mind to details he thought extremely dull All this you remember happened in those dark ages when there were no schools of design before schoolmasters were invariably men of scrupulous integrity and before the clergy were all men of enlarged minds and varied culture In those less favored days it is no fable that there were other clergymen besides mister Stelling who had narrow intellects and large wants and whose income by a logical confusion to which Fortune being a female as well as blindfold is peculiarly liable was proportioned not to their wants but to their intellect with which income has clearly no inherent relation The problem these gentlemen had to solve was to readjust the proportion between their wants and their income and since wants are not easily starved to death the simpler method appeared to be to raise their income There was but one way of doing this any of those low callings in which men are obliged to do good work at a low price were forbidden to clergymen was it their fault if their only resource was to turn out very poor work at a high price Besides how should mister Stelling be expected to know that education was a delicate and difficult business any more than an animal endowed with a power of boring a hole through a rock should be expected to have wide views of excavation mister Stelling s faculties had been early trained to boring in a straight line and he had no faculty to spare But among Tom s contemporaries whose fathers cast their sons on clerical instruction to find them ignorant after many days there were many far less lucky than Tom Tulliver Education was almost entirely a matter of luck usually of ill luck in those distant days The state of mind in which you take a billiard cue or a dice box in your hand is one of sober certainty compared with that of old fashioned fathers like mister Tulliver when they selected a school or a tutor for their sons Excellent men who had been forced all their lives to spell on an impromptu phonetic system and having carried on a successful business in spite of this disadvantage had acquired money enough to give their sons a better start in life than they had had themselves must necessarily take their chance as to the conscience and the competence of the schoolmaster whose circular fell in their way and appeared to promise so much more than they would ever have thought of asking for including the return of linen fork and spoon It was happy for them if some ambitious draper of their acquaintance had not brought up his son to the Church and if that young gentleman at the age of four and twenty had not closed his college dissipations by an imprudent marriage otherwise these innocent fathers desirous of doing the best for their offspring could only escape the draper s son by happening to be on the foundation of a grammar school as yet unvisited by commissioners where two or three boys could have all to themselves the advantages of a large and lofty building together with a head master toothless dim eyed and deaf whose erudite indistinctness and inattention were engrossed by them at the rate of three hundred pounds a head a ripe scholar doubtless when first appointed but all ripeness beneath the sun has a further stage less esteemed in the market Tom Tulliver then compared with many other British youths of his time who have since had to scramble through life with some fragments of more or less relevant knowledge and a great deal of strictly relevant ignorance was not so very unlucky mister Stelling was a broad chested healthy man with the bearing of a gentleman a conviction that a growing boy required a sufficiency of beef and a certain hearty kindness in him that made him like to see Tom looking well and enjoying his dinner not a man of refined conscience or with any deep sense of the infinite issues belonging to every day duties not quite competent to his high offices but incompetent gentlemen must live and without private fortune it is difficult to see how they could all live genteelly if they had nothing to do with education or government Besides it was the fault of Tom s mental constitution that his faculties could not be nourished on the sort of knowledge mister Stelling had to communicate A boy born with a deficient power of apprehending signs and abstractions must suffer the penalty of his congenital deficiency just as if he had been born with one leg shorter than the other A method of education sanctioned by the long practice of our venerable ancestors was not to give way before the exceptional dulness of a boy who was merely living at the time then present And mister Stelling was convinced that a boy so stupid at signs and abstractions must be stupid at everything else even if that reverend gentleman could have taught him everything else It was the practice of our venerable ancestors to apply that ingenious instrument the thumb screw and to tighten and tighten it in order to elicit non existent facts they had a fixed opinion to begin with that the facts were existent and what had they to do but to tighten the thumb screw In like manner mister Stelling had a fixed opinion that all boys with any capacity could learn what it was the only regular thing to teach if they were slow the thumb screw must be tightened the exercises must be insisted on with increased severity and a page of Virgil be awarded as a penalty to encourage and stimulate a too languid inclination to Latin verse The thumb screw was a little relaxed however during this second half year Philip was so advanced in his studies and so apt that mister Stelling could obtain credit by his facility which required little help much more easily than by the troublesome process of overcoming Tom s dulness Gentlemen with broad chests and ambitious intentions do sometimes disappoint their friends by failing to carry the world before them Perhaps it is that high achievements demand some other unusual qualification besides an unusual desire for high prizes perhaps it is that these stalwart gentlemen are rather indolent their divinae particulum aurae being obstructed from soaring by a too hearty appetite Some reason or other there was why mister Stelling deferred the execution of many spirited projects why he did not begin the editing of his Greek play or any other work of scholarship in his leisure hours but after turning the key of his private study with much resolution sat down to one of Theodore Hook s novels Tom was gradually allowed to shuffle through his lessons with less rigor and having Philip to help him he was able to make some show of having applied his mind in a confused and blundering way without being cross examined into a betrayal that his mind had been entirely neutral in the matter He thought school much more bearable under this modification of circumstances and he went on contentedly enough picking up a promiscuous education chiefly from things that were not intended as education at all What was understood to be his education was simply the practice of reading writing and spelling carried on by an elaborate appliance of unintelligible ideas and by much failure in the effort to learn by rote Nevertheless there was a visible improvement in Tom under this training perhaps because he was not a boy in the abstract existing solely to illustrate the evils of a mistaken education but a boy made of flesh and blood with dispositions not entirely at the mercy of circumstances There was a great improvement in his bearing for example and some credit on this score was due to mister Poulter the village schoolmaster who being an old Peninsular soldier was employed to drill Tom a source of high mutual pleasure mister Poulter who was understood by the company at the Black Swan to have once struck terror into the hearts of the French was no longer personally formidable He had rather a shrunken appearance and was tremulous in the mornings not from age but from the extreme perversity of the King s Lorton boys which nothing but gin could enable him to sustain with any firmness Still he carried himself with martial erectness had his clothes scrupulously brushed and his trousers tightly strapped and on the Wednesday and Saturday afternoons when he came to Tom he was always inspired with gin and old memories which gave him an exceptionally spirited air as of a superannuated charger who hears the drum The drilling lessons were always protracted by episodes of warlike narrative much more interesting to Tom than Philip s stories out of the Iliad for there were no cannon in the Iliad and besides Tom had felt some disgust on learning that Hector and Achilles might possibly never have existed But the Duke of Wellington was really alive and Bony had not been long dead therefore mister Poulter s reminiscences of the Peninsular War were removed from all suspicion of being mythical mister Poulter it appeared had been a conspicuous figure at Talavera and had contributed not a little to the peculiar terror with which his regiment of infantry was regarded by the enemy On afternoons when his memory was more stimulated than usual he remembered that the Duke of Wellington had in strict privacy lest jealousies should be awakened expressed his esteem for that fine fellow Poulter The very surgeon who attended him in the hospital after he had received his gunshot wound had been profoundly impressed with the superiority of mister Poulter s flesh no other flesh would have healed in anything like the same time On less personal matters connected with the important warfare in which he had been engaged mister Poulter was more reticent only taking care not to give the weight of his authority to any loose notions concerning military history Any one who pretended to a knowledge of what occurred at the siege of Badajos was especially an object of silent pity to mister Poulter he wished that prating person had been run down and had the breath trampled out of him at the first go off as he himself had he might talk about the siege of Badajos then Tom did not escape irritating his drilling master occasionally by his curiosity concerning other military matters than mister Poulter s personal experience And General Wolfe mister Poulter wasn t he a wonderful fighter said Tom who held the notion that all the martial heroes commemorated on the public house signs were engaged in the war with Bony Not at all said mister Poulter contemptuously Nothing o the sort Heads up he added in a tone of stern command which delighted Tom and made him feel as if he were a regiment in his own person No no mister Poulter would continue on coming to a pause in his discipline they d better not talk to me about General Wolfe He did nothing but die of his wound that s a poor haction I consider Any other man ud have died o the wounds I ve had One of my sword cuts ud ha killed a fellow like General Wolfe mister Poulter Tom would say at any allusion to the sword I wish you d bring your sword and do the sword exercise For a long while mister Poulter only shook his head in a significant manner at this request and smiled patronizingly as Jupiter may have done when Semele urged her too ambitious request But one afternoon when a sudden shower of heavy rain had detained mister Poulter twenty minutes longer than usual at the Black Swan the sword was brought just for Tom to look at And this is the real sword you fought with in all the battles mister Poulter said Tom handling the hilt Has it ever cut a Frenchman s head off Head off Ah and would if he d had three heads But you had a gun and bayonet besides said Tom I should like the gun and bayonet best because you could shoot em first and spear em after Bang Ps s s s Tom gave the requisite pantomime to indicate the double enjoyment of pulling the trigger and thrusting the spear Ah but the sword s the thing when you come to close fighting said mister Poulter involuntarily falling in with Tom s enthusiasm and drawing the sword so suddenly that Tom leaped back with much agility Oh but mister Poulter if you re going to do the exercise said Tom a little conscious that he had not stood his ground as became an Englishman let me go and call Philip He ll like to see you you know What the humpbacked lad said mister Poulter contemptuously what s the use of his looking on Oh but he knows a great deal about fighting said Tom and how they used to fight with bows and arrows and battle axes Let him come then I ll show him something different from his bows and arrows said mister Poulter coughing and drawing himself up while he gave a little preliminary play to his wrist Tom ran in to Philip who was enjoying his afternoon s holiday at the piano in the drawing room picking out tunes for himself and singing them He was supremely happy perched like an amorphous bundle on the high stool with his head thrown back his eyes fixed on the opposite cornice and his lips wide open sending forth with all his might impromptu syllables to a tune of Arne s which had hit his fancy Come Philip said Tom bursting in don t stay roaring la la there come and see old Poulter do his sword exercise in the carriage house The jar of this interruption the discord of Tom s tones coming across the notes to which Philip was vibrating in soul and body would have been enough to unhinge his temper even if there had been no question of Poulter the drilling master and Tom in the hurry of seizing something to say to prevent mister Poulter from thinking he was afraid of the sword when he sprang away from it had alighted on this proposition to fetch Philip though he knew well enough that Philip hated to hear him mention his drilling lessons Tom would never have done so inconsiderate a thing except under the severe stress of his personal pride Philip shuddered visibly as he paused from his music Then turning red he said with violent passion Get away you lumbering idiot Don t come bellowing at me you re not fit to speak to anything but a cart horse It was not the first time Philip had been made angry by him but Tom had never before been assailed with verbal missiles that he understood so well I m fit to speak to something better than you you poor spirited imp said Tom lighting up immediately at Philip s fire You know I won t hit you because you re no better than a girl But I m an honest man s son and your father s a rogue everybody says so Tom flung out of the room and slammed the door after him made strangely heedless by his anger for to slam doors within the hearing of missus Stelling who was probably not far off was an offence only to be wiped out by twenty lines of Virgil In fact that lady did presently descend from her room in double wonder at the noise and the subsequent cessation of Philip s music She found him sitting in a heap on the hassock and crying bitterly What s the matter Wakem what was that noise about Who slammed the door Philip looked up and hastily dried his eyes It was Tulliver who came in to ask me to go out with him And what are you in trouble about said missus Stelling Philip was not her favorite of the two pupils he was less obliging than Tom who was made useful in many ways Still his father paid more than mister Tulliver did and she meant him to feel that she behaved exceedingly well to him Philip however met her advances toward a good understanding very much as a caressed mollusk meets an invitation to show himself out of his shell missus Stelling was not a loving tender hearted woman she was a woman whose skirt sat well who adjusted her waist and patted her curls with a preoccupied air when she inquired after your welfare These things doubtless represent a great social power but it is not the power of love and no other power could win Philip from his personal reserve He said in answer to her question My toothache came on and made me hysterical again This had been the fact once and Philip was glad of the recollection it was like an inspiration to enable him to excuse his crying He had to accept eau de Cologne and to refuse creosote in consequence but that was easy Meanwhile Tom who had for the first time sent a poisoned arrow into Philip s heart had returned to the carriage house where he found mister Poulter with a fixed and earnest eye wasting the perfections of his sword exercise on probably observant but inappreciative rats But mister Poulter was a host in himself that is to say he admired himself more than a whole army of spectators could have admired him He took no notice of Tom s return being too entirely absorbed in the cut and thrust the solemn one two three four and Tom not without a slight feeling of alarm at mister Poulter s fixed eye and hungry looking sword which seemed impatient for something else to cut besides the air admired the performance from as great a distance as possible It was not until mister Poulter paused and wiped the perspiration from his forehead that Tom felt the full charm of the sword exercise and wished it to be repeated mister Poulter said Tom when the sword was being finally sheathed I wish you d lend me your sword a little while to keep No no young gentleman said mister Poulter shaking his head decidedly you might do yourself some mischief with it No I m sure I wouldn t I m sure I d take care and not hurt myself I shouldn t take it out of the sheath much but I could ground arms with it and all that No no it won t do I tell you it won t do said mister Poulter preparing to depart What ud mister Stelling say to me Oh I say do mister Poulter I d give you my five shilling piece if you d let me keep the sword a week Look here said Tom reaching out the attractively large round of silver The young dog calculated the effect as well as if he had been a philosopher Well said mister Poulter with still deeper gravity you must keep it out of sight you know Oh yes I ll keep it under the bed said Tom eagerly or else at the bottom of my large box And let me see now whether you can draw it out of the sheath without hurting yourself That process having been gone through more than once mister Poulter felt that he had acted with scrupulous conscientiousness and said Well now Master Tulliver if I take the crown piece it is to make sure as you ll do no mischief with the sword Oh no indeed mister Poulter said Tom delightedly handing him the crown piece and grasping the sword which he thought might have been lighter with advantage But if mister Stelling catches you carrying it in said mister Poulter pocketing the crown piece provisionally while he raised this new doubt Oh he always keeps in his upstairs study on Saturday afternoon said Tom who disliked anything sneaking but was not disinclined to a little stratagem in a worthy cause So he carried off the sword in triumph mixed with dread dread that he might encounter mister or missus Stelling to his bedroom where after some consideration he hid it in the closet behind some hanging clothes That night he fell asleep in the thought that he would astonish Maggie with it when she came tie it round his waist with his red comforter and make her believe that the sword was his own and that he was going to be a soldier There was nobody but Maggie who would be silly enough to believe him or whom he dared allow to know he had a sword and Maggie was really coming next week to see Tom before she went to a boarding school with Lucy If you think a lad of thirteen would have been so childish you must be an exceptionally wise man who although you are devoted to a civil calling requiring you to look bland rather than formidable yet never since you had a beard threw yourself into a martial attitude and frowned before the looking glass It is doubtful whether our soldiers would be maintained if there were not pacific people at home who like to fancy themselves soldiers War like other dramatic spectacles might possibly cease for want of a public Chapter V Maggie s Second Visit This last breach between the two lads was not readily mended and for some time they spoke to each other no more than was necessary Their natural antipathy of temperament made resentment an easy passage to hatred and in Philip the transition seemed to have begun there was no malignity in his disposition but there was a susceptibility that made him peculiarly liable to a strong sense of repulsion The ox we may venture to assert it on the authority of a great classic is not given to use his teeth as an instrument of attack and Tom was an excellent bovine lad who ran at questionable objects in a truly ingenious bovine manner but he had blundered on Philip s tenderest point and had caused him as much acute pain as if he had studied the means with the nicest precision and the most envenomed spite Tom saw no reason why they should not make up this quarrel as they had done many others by behaving as if nothing had happened for though he had never before said to Philip that his father was a rogue this idea had so habitually made part of his feeling as to the relation between himself and his dubious schoolfellow who he could neither like nor dislike that the mere utterance did not make such an epoch to him as it did to Philip And he had a right to say so when Philip hectored over him and called him names But perceiving that his first advances toward amity were not met he relapsed into his least favorable disposition toward Philip and resolved never to appeal to him either about drawing or exercise again They were only so far civil to each other as was necessary to prevent their state of feud from being observed by mister Stelling who would have put down such nonsense with great vigor When Maggie came however she could not help looking with growing interest at the new schoolfellow although he was the son of that wicked Lawyer Wakem who made her father so angry She had arrived in the middle of school hours and had sat by while Philip went through his lessons with mister Stelling Tom some weeks ago had sent her word that Philip knew no end of stories not stupid stories like hers and she was convinced now from her own observation that he must be very clever she hoped he would think her rather clever too when she came to talk to him Maggie moreover had rather a tenderness for deformed things she preferred the wry necked lambs because it seemed to her that the lambs which were quite strong and well made wouldn t mind so much about being petted and she was especially fond of petting objects that would think it very delightful to be petted by her She loved Tom very dearly but she often wished that he cared more about her loving him I think Philip Wakem seems a nice boy Tom she said when they went out of the study together into the garden to pass the interval before dinner He couldn t choose his father you know and I ve read of very bad men who had good sons as well as good parents who had bad children And if Philip is good I think we ought to be the more sorry for him because his father is not a good man You like him don t you Oh he s a queer fellow said Tom curtly and he s as sulky as can be with me because I told him his father was a rogue And I d a right to tell him so for it was true and he began it with calling me names But you stop here by yourself a bit Maggie will you I ve got something I want to do upstairs Can t I go too said Maggie who in this first day of meeting again loved Tom s shadow No it s something I ll tell you about by and by not yet said Tom skipping away In the afternoon the boys were at their books in the study preparing the morrow s lesson s that they might have a holiday in the evening in honor of Maggie s arrival Tom was hanging over his Latin grammar moving his lips inaudibly like a strict but impatient Catholic repeating his tale of paternosters and Philip at the other end of the room was busy with two volumes with a look of contented diligence that excited Maggie s curiosity he did not look at all as if he were learning a lesson She sat on a low stool at nearly a right angle with the two boys watching first one and then the other and Philip looking off his book once toward the fire place caught the pair of questioning dark eyes fixed upon him He thought this sister of Tulliver s seemed a nice little thing quite unlike her brother he wished he had a little sister What was it he wondered that made Maggie s dark eyes remind him of the stories about princesses being turned into animals I think it was that her eyes were full of unsatisfied intelligence and unsatisfied beseeching affection I say Magsie said Tom at last shutting his books and putting them away with the energy and decision of a perfect master in the art of leaving off I ve done my lessons now Come upstairs with me What is it said Maggie when they were outside the door a slight suspicion crossing her mind as she remembered Tom s preliminary visit upstairs It isn t a trick you re going to play me now No no Maggie said Tom in his most coaxing tone It s something you ll like ever so He put his arm round her neck and she put hers round his waist and twined together in this way they went upstairs I say Magsie you must not tell anybody you know said Tom else I shall get fifty lines Is it alive said Maggie whose imagination had settled for the moment on the idea that Tom kept a ferret clandestinely Oh I sha n t tell you said he Now you go into that corner and hide your face while I reach it out he added as he locked the bedroom door behind them I ll tell you when to turn round You mustn t squeal out you know Oh but if you frighten me I shall said Maggie beginning to look rather serious You won t be frightened you silly thing said Tom Go and hide your face and mind you don t peep Of course I sha n t peep said Maggie disdainfully and she buried her face in the pillow like a person of strict honor But Tom looked round warily as he walked to the closet then he stepped into the narrow space and almost closed the door Maggie kept her face buried without the aid of principle for in that dream suggestive attitude she had soon forgotten where she was and her thoughts were busy with the poor deformed boy who was so clever when Tom called out Now then Magsie Nothing but long meditation and preconcerted arrangement of effects would have enabled Tom to present so striking a figure as he did to Maggie when she looked up Dissatisfied with the pacific aspect of a face which had no more than the faintest hint of flaxen eyebrow together with a pair of amiable blue gray eyes and round pink cheeks that refused to look formidable let him frown as he would before the looking glass Philip had once told him of a man who had a horseshoe frown and Tom had tried with all his frowning might to make a horseshoe on his forehead he had had recourse to that unfailing source of the terrible burnt cork and had made himself a pair of black eyebrows that met in a satisfactory manner over his nose and were matched by a less carefully adjusted blackness about the chin He had wound a red handkerchief round his cloth cap to give it the air of a turban and his red comforter across his breast as a scarf an amount of red which with the tremendous frown on his brow and the decision with which he grasped the sword as he held it with its point resting on the ground would suffice to convey an approximate idea of his fierce and bloodthirsty disposition Maggie looked bewildered for a moment and Tom enjoyed that moment keenly but in the next she laughed clapped her hands together and said Oh Tom you ve made yourself like Bluebeard at the show It was clear she had not been struck with the presence of the sword it was not unsheathed Her frivolous mind required a more direct appeal to its sense of the terrible and Tom prepared for his master stroke Frowning with a double amount of intention if not of corrugation he carefully drew the sword from its sheath and pointed it at Maggie Oh Tom please don t exclaimed Maggie in a tone of suppressed dread shrinking away from him into the opposite corner I shall scream I m sure I shall Oh don t I wish I d never come upstairs The corners of Tom s mouth showed an inclination to a smile of complacency that was immediately checked as inconsistent with the severity of a great warrior Slowly he let down the scabbard on the floor lest it should make too much noise and then said sternly I m the Duke of Wellington March stamping forward with the right leg a little bent and the sword still pointing toward Maggie who trembling and with tear filled eyes got upon the bed as the only means of widening the space between them Tom happy in this spectator of his military performances even though the spectator was only Maggie proceeded with the utmost exertion of his force to such an exhibition of the cut and thrust as would necessarily be expected of the Duke of Wellington Tom I will not bear it I will scream said Maggie at the first movement of the sword You ll hurt yourself you ll cut your head off One two said Tom resolutely though at two his wrist trembled a little Three came more slowly and with it the sword swung downward and Maggie gave a loud shriek The sword had fallen with its edge on Tom s foot and in a moment after he had fallen too Maggie leaped from the bed still shrieking and immediately there was a rush of footsteps toward the room mister Stelling from his upstairs study was the first to enter He found both the children on the floor Tom had fainted and Maggie was shaking him by the collar of his jacket screaming with wild eyes She thought he was dead poor child and yet she shook him as if that would bring him back to life In another minute she was sobbing with joy because Tom opened his eyes She couldn t sorrow yet that he had hurt his foot it seemed as if all happiness lay in his being alive Chapter VI A Love Scene Poor Tom bore his severe pain heroically and was resolute in not telling of mister Poulter more than was unavoidable the five shilling piece remained a secret even to Maggie But there was a terrible dread weighing on his mind so terrible that he dared not even ask the question which might bring the fatal yes he dared not ask the surgeon or mister Stelling Shall I be lame Sir He mastered himself so as not to cry out at the pain but when his foot had been dressed and he was left alone with Maggie seated by his bedside the children sobbed together with their heads laid on the same pillow Tom was thinking of himself walking about on crutches like the wheelwright s son and Maggie who did not guess what was in his mind sobbed for company It had not occurred to the surgeon or to mister Stelling to anticipate this dread in Tom s mind and to reassure him by hopeful words But Philip watched the surgeon out of the house and waylaid mister Stelling to ask the very question that Tom had not dared to ask for himself I beg your pardon sir but does mister Askern say Tulliver will be lame Oh no oh no said mister Stelling not permanently only for a little while Did he tell Tulliver so sir do you think No nothing was said to him on the subject Then may I go and tell him sir Yes to be sure now you mention it I dare say he may be troubling about that Go to his bedroom but be very quiet at present It had been Philip s first thought when he heard of the accident Will Tulliver be lame It will be very hard for him if he is and Tom s hitherto unforgiven offences were washed out by that pity Philip felt that they were no longer in a state of repulsion but were being drawn into a common current of suffering and sad privation His imagination did not dwell on the outward calamity and its future effect on Tom s life but it made vividly present to him the probable state of Tom s feeling Philip had only lived fourteen years but those years had most of them been steeped in the sense of a lot irremediably hard mister Askern says you ll soon be all right again Tulliver did you know he said rather timidly as he stepped gently up to Tom s bed I ve just been to ask mister Stelling and he says you ll walk as well as ever again by and day Tom looked up with that momentary stopping of the breath which comes with a sudden joy then he gave a long sigh and turned his blue gray eyes straight on Philip s face as he had not done for a fortnight or more As for Maggie this intimation of a possibility she had not thought of before affected her as a new trouble the bare idea of Tom s being always lame overpowered the assurance that such a misfortune was not likely to befall him and she clung to him and cried afresh Don t be a little silly Magsie said Tom tenderly feeling very brave now I shall soon get well Good by Tulliver said Philip putting out his small delicate hand which Tom clasped immediately with his more substantial fingers I say said Tom ask mister Stelling to let you come and sit with me sometimes till I get up again Wakem and tell me about Robert Bruce you know After that Philip spent all his time out of school hours with Tom and Maggie Tom liked to hear fighting stories as much as ever but he insisted strongly on the fact that those great fighters who did so many wonderful things and came off unhurt wore excellent armor from head to foot which made fighting easy work he considered He should not have hurt his foot if he had had an iron shoe on He listened with great interest to a new story of Philip s about a man who had a very bad wound in his foot and cried out so dreadfully with the pain that his friends could bear with him no longer but put him ashore on a desert island with nothing but some wonderful poisoned arrows to kill animals with for food I didn t roar out a bit you know Tom said and I dare say my foot was as bad as his It s cowardly to roar But Maggie would have it that when anything hurt you very much it was quite permissible to cry out and it was cruel of people not to bear it She wanted to know if Philoctetes had a sister and why she didn t go with him on the desert island and take care of him One day soon after Philip had told this story he and Maggie were in the study alone together while Tom s foot was being dressed Philip was at his books and Maggie after sauntering idly round the room not caring to do anything in particular because she would soon go to Tom again went and leaned on the table near Philip to see what he was doing for they were quite old friends now and perfectly at home with each other What are you reading about in Greek she said It s poetry I can see that because the lines are so short It s about Philoctetes the lame man I was telling you of yesterday he answered resting his head on his hand and looking at her as if he were not at all sorry to be interrupted Maggie in her absent way continued to lean forward resting on her arms and moving her feet about while her dark eyes got more and more fixed and vacant as if she had quite forgotten Philip and his book Maggie said Philip after a minute or two still leaning on his elbow and looking at her if you had had a brother like me do you think you should have loved him as well as Tom Maggie started a little on being roused from her reverie and said What Philip repeated his question Oh yes better she answered immediately No not better because I don t think I could love you better than Tom But I should be so sorry so sorry for you Philip colored he had meant to imply would she love him as well in spite of his deformity and yet when she alluded to it so plainly he winced under her pity Maggie young as she was felt her mistake Hitherto she had instinctively behaved as if she were quite unconscious of Philip s deformity her own keen sensitiveness and experience under family criticism sufficed to teach her this as well as if she had been directed by the most finished breeding But you are so very clever Philip and you can play and sing she added quickly I wish you were my brother I m very fond of you And you would stay at home with me when Tom went out and you would teach me everything wouldn t you Greek and everything But you ll go away soon and go to school Maggie said Philip and then you ll forget all about me and not care for me any more And then I shall see you when you re grown up and you ll hardly take any notice of me Oh no I sha n t forget you I m sure said Maggie shaking her head very seriously I never forget anything and I think about everybody when I m away from them I think about poor Yap he s got a lump in his throat and Luke says he ll die Only don t you tell Tom because it will vex him so You never saw Yap he s a queer little dog nobody cares about him but Tom and me Do you care as much about me as you do about Yap Maggie said Philip smiling rather sadly Oh yes I should think so said Maggie laughing I m very fond of you Maggie I shall never forget you said Philip and when I m very unhappy I shall always think of you and wish I had a sister with dark eyes just like yours Why do you like my eyes said Maggie well pleased She had never heard any one but her father speak of her eyes as if they had merit I don t know said Philip They re not like any other eyes They seem trying to speak trying to speak kindly I don t like other people to look at me much but I like you to look at me Maggie Why I think you re fonder of me than Tom is said Maggie rather sorrowfully Then wondering how she could convince Philip that she could like him just as well although he was crooked she said Should you like me to kiss you as I do Tom I will if you like Yes very much nobody kisses me Maggie put her arm round his neck and kissed him quite earnestly There now she said I shall always remember you and kiss you when I see you again if it s ever so long But I ll go now because I think mister Askern s done with Tom s foot When their father came the second time Maggie said to him Oh father Philip Wakem is so very good to Tom he is such a clever boy and I do love him And you love him too Tom don t you Say you love him she added entreatingly Tom colored a little as he looked at his father and said I sha n t be friends with him when I leave school father but we ve made it up now since my foot has been bad and he s taught me to play at draughts and I can beat him Well well said mister Tulliver if he s good to you try and make him amends and be good to him He s a poor crooked creature and takes after his dead mother But don t you be getting too thick with him he s got his father s blood in him too Ay ay the gray colt may chance to kick like his black sire The jarring natures of the two boys effected what mister Tulliver s admonition alone might have failed to effect in spite of Philip s new kindness and Tom s answering regard in this time of his trouble they never became close friends When Maggie was gone and when Tom by and by began to walk about as usual the friendly warmth that had been kindled by pity and gratitude died out by degrees and left them in their old relation to each other Philip was often peevish and contemptuous and Tom s more specific and kindly impressions gradually melted into the old background of suspicion and dislike toward him as a queer fellow a humpback and the son of a rogue If boys and men are to be welded together in the glow of transient feeling they must be made of metal that will mix else they inevitably fall asunder when the heat dies out Chapter VII The Golden Gates Are Passed So Tom went on even to the fifth half year till he was turned sixteen at King s Lorton while Maggie was growing with a rapidity which her aunts considered highly reprehensible at Miss Firniss s boarding school in the ancient town of Laceham on the Floss with cousin Lucy for her companion In her early letters to Tom she had always sent her love to Philip and asked many questions about him which were answered by brief sentences about Tom s toothache and a turf house which he was helping to build in the garden with other items of that kind She was pained to hear Tom say in the holidays that Philip was as queer as ever again and often cross They were no longer very good friends she perceived and when she reminded Tom that he ought always to love Philip for being so good to him when his foot was bad he answered Well it isn t my fault I don t do anything to him She hardly ever saw Philip during the remainder of their school life in the Midsummer holidays he was always away at the seaside and at Christmas she could only meet him at long intervals in the street of saint Ogg s When they did meet she remembered her promise to kiss him but as a young lady who had been at a boarding school she knew now that such a greeting was out of the question and Philip would not expect it The promise was void like so many other sweet illusory promises of our childhood void as promises made in Eden before the seasons were divided and when the starry blossoms grew side by side with the ripening peach impossible to be fulfilled when the golden gates had been passed But when their father was actually engaged in the long threatened lawsuit and Wakem as the agent at once of Pivart and Old Harry was acting against him even Maggie felt with some sadness that they were not likely ever to have any intimacy with Philip again the very name of Wakem made her father angry and she had once heard him say that if that crook backed son lived to inherit his father s ill gotten gains there would be a curse upon him Have as little to do with him at school as you can my lad he said to Tom and the command was obeyed the more easily because mister Sterling by this time had two additional pupils for though this gentleman s rise in the world was not of that meteor like rapidity which the admirers of his extemporaneous eloquence had expected for a preacher whose voice demanded so wide a sphere he had yet enough of growing prosperity to enable him to increase his expenditure in continued disproportion to his income As for Tom s school course it went on with mill like monotony his mind continuing to move with a slow half stifled pulse in a medium uninteresting or unintelligible ideas But each vacation he brought home larger and larger drawings with the satiny rendering of landscape and water colors in vivid greens together with manuscript books full of exercises and problems in which the handwriting was all the finer because he gave his whole mind to it Each vacation he brought home a new book or two indicating his progress through different stages of history Christian doctrine and Latin literature and that passage was not entirely without results besides the possession of the books Tom s ear and tongue had become accustomed to a great many words and phrases which are understood to be signs of an educated condition and though he had never really applied his mind to any one of his lessons the lessons had left a deposit of vague fragmentary ineffectual notions mister Tulliver seeing signs of acquirement beyond the reach of his own criticism thought it was probably all right with Tom s education he observed indeed that there were no maps and not enough summing but he made no formal complaint to mister Stelling It was a puzzling business this schooling and if he took Tom away where could he send him with better effect By the time Tom had reached his last quarter at King s Lorton the years had made striking changes in him since the day we saw him returning from mister Jacobs s academy He was a tall youth now carrying himself without the least awkwardness and speaking without more shyness than was a becoming symptom of blended diffidence and pride he wore his tail coat and his stand up collars and watched the down on his lip with eager impatience looking every day at his virgin razor with which he had provided himself in the last holidays Philip had already left at the autumn quarter that he might go to the south for the winter for the sake of his health and this change helped to give Tom the unsettled exultant feeling that usually belongs to the last months before leaving school This quarter too there was some hope of his father s lawsuit being decided that made the prospect of home more entirely pleasurable For Tom who had gathered his view of the case from his father s conversation had no doubt that Pivart would be beaten Tom had not heard anything from home for some weeks a fact which did not surprise him for his father and mother were not apt to manifest their affection in unnecessary letters when to his great surprise on the morning of a dark cold day near the end of November he was told soon after entering the study at nine o clock that his sister was in the drawing room It was missus Stelling who had come into the study to tell him and she left him to enter the drawing room alone Maggie too was tall now with braided and coiled hair she was almost as tall as Tom though she was only thirteen and she really looked older than he did at that moment She had thrown off her bonnet her heavy braids were pushed back from her forehead as if it would not bear that extra load and her young face had a strangely worn look as her eyes turned anxiously toward the door When Tom entered she did not speak but only went up to him put her arms round his neck and kissed him earnestly He was used to various moods of hers and felt no alarm at the unusual seriousness of her greeting Why how is it you re come so early this cold morning Maggie Did you come in the gig said Tom as she backed toward the sofa and drew him to her side No I came by the coach I ve walked from the turnpike But how is it you re not at school The holidays have not begun yet Father wanted me at home said Maggie with a slight trembling of the lip I came home three or four days ago Isn t my father well said Tom rather anxiously Not quite said Maggie He s very unhappy Tom The lawsuit is ended and I came to tell you because I thought it would be better for you to know it before you came home and I didn t like only to send you a letter My father hasn t lost said Tom hastily springing from the sofa and standing before Maggie with his hands suddenly thrust into his pockets Yes dear Tom said Maggie looking up at him with trembling Tom was silent a minute or two with his eyes fixed on the floor Then he said My father will have to pay a good deal of money then Yes said Maggie rather faintly Well it can t be helped said Tom bravely not translating the loss of a large sum of money into any tangible results But my father s very much vexed I dare say he added looking at Maggie and thinking that her agitated face was only part of her girlish way of taking things Yes said Maggie again faintly Then urged to fuller speech by Tom s freedom from apprehension she said loudly and rapidly as if the words would burst from her Oh Tom he will lose the mill and the land and everything he will have nothing left Tom s eyes flashed out one look of surprise at her before he turned pale and trembled visibly He said nothing but sat down on the sofa again looking vaguely out of the opposite window Anxiety about the future had never entered Tom s mind His father had always ridden a good horse kept a good house and had the cheerful confident air of a man who has plenty of property to fall back upon Tom had never dreamed that his father would fail that was a form of misfortune which he had always heard spoken of as a deep disgrace and disgrace was an idea that he could not associate with any of his relations least of all with his father A proud sense of family respectability was part of the very air Tom had been born and brought up in He knew there were people in saint Ogg s who made a show without money to support it and he had always heard such people spoken of by his own friends with contempt and reprobation He had a strong belief which was a lifelong habit and required no definite evidence to rest on that his father could spend a great deal of money if he chose and since his education at mister Stelling s had given him a more expensive view of life he had often thought that when he got older he would make a figure in the world with his horse and dogs and saddle and other accoutrements of a fine young man and show himself equal to any of his contemporaries at saint Ogg s who might consider themselves a grade above him in society because their fathers were professional men or had large oil mills As to the prognostics and headshaking of his aunts and uncles they had never produced the least effect on him except to make him think that aunts and uncles were disagreeable society he had heard them find fault in much the same way as long as he could remember His father knew better than they did The down had come on Tom s lip yet his thoughts and expectations had been hitherto only the reproduction in changed forms of the boyish dreams in which he had lived three years ago He was awakened now with a violent shock Maggie was frightened at Tom s pale trembling silence There was something else to tell him something worse She threw her arms round him at last and said with a half sob Oh Tom dear dear Tom don t fret too much try and bear it well Tom turned his cheek passively to meet her entreating kisses and there gathered a moisture in his eyes which he just rubbed away with his hand The action seemed to rouse him for he shook himself and said I shall go home with you Maggie Didn t my father say I was to go No Tom father didn t wish it said Maggie her anxiety about his feeling helping her to master her agitation What would he do when she told him all But mother wants you to come poor mother she cries so Oh Tom it s very dreadful at home Maggie s lips grew whiter and she began to tremble almost as Tom had done The two poor things clung closer to each other both trembling the one at an unshapen fear the other at the image of a terrible certainty When Maggie spoke it was hardly above a whisper And and poor father Maggie could not utter it But the suspense was intolerable to Tom A vague idea of going to prison as a consequence of debt was the shape his fears had begun to take Where s my father he said impatiently Tell me Maggie He s at home said Maggie finding it easier to reply to that question But she added after a pause not himself he fell off his horse He has known nobody but me ever since he seems to have lost his senses O father father With these last words Maggie s sobs burst forth with the more violence for the previous struggle against them Tom felt that pressure of the heart which forbids tears he had no distinct vision of their troubles as Maggie had who had been at home he only felt the crushing weight of what seemed unmitigated misfortune He tightened his arm almost convulsively round Maggie as she sobbed but his face looked rigid and tearless his eyes blank as if a black curtain of cloud had suddenly fallen on his path But Maggie soon checked herself abruptly a single thought had acted on her like a startling sound We must set out Tom we must not stay Father will miss me we must be at the turnpike at ten to meet the coach She said this with hasty decision rubbing her eyes and rising to seize her bonnet Tom at once felt the same impulse and rose too Wait a minute Maggie he said I must speak to mister Stelling and then we ll go He thought he must go to the study where the pupils were but on his way he met mister Stelling who had heard from his wife that Maggie appeared to be in trouble when she asked for her brother and now that he thought the brother and sister had been alone long enough was coming to inquire and offer his sympathy Please sir I must go home Tom said abruptly as he met mister Stelling in the passage I must go back with my sister directly My father s lost his lawsuit he s lost all his property and he s very ill mister Stelling felt like a kind hearted man he foresaw a probable money loss for himself but this had no appreciable share in his feeling while he looked with grave pity at the brother and sister for whom youth and sorrow had begun together When he knew how Maggie had come and how eager she was to get home again he hurried their departure only whispering something to missus Stelling who had followed him and who immediately left the room Tom and Maggie were standing on the door step ready to set out when missus Stelling came with a little basket which she hung on Maggie s arm saying Do remember to eat something on the way dear Maggie s heart went out toward this woman whom she had never liked and she kissed her silently It was the first sign within the poor child of that new sense which is the gift of sorrow that susceptibility to the bare offices of humanity which raises them into a bond of loving fellowship as to haggard men among the ice bergs the mere presence of an ordinary comrade stirs the deep fountains of affection mister Stelling put his hand on Tom s shoulder and said God bless you my boy let me know how you get on Then he pressed Maggie s hand but there were no audible good byes Tom had so often thought how joyful he should be the day he left school for good And now his school years seemed like a holiday that had come to an end The two slight youthful figures soon grew indistinct on the distant road were soon lost behind the projecting hedgerow They had gone forth together into their life of sorrow and they would never more see the sunshine undimmed by remembered cares They had entered the thorny wilderness and the golden gates of their childhood had forever closed behind them Book III The Downfall Chapter I What Had Happened at Home When mister Tulliver first knew the fact that the law suit was decided against him and that Pivart and Wakem were triumphant every one who happened to observe him at the time thought that for so confident and hot tempered a man he bore the blow remarkably well He thought so himself he thought he was going to show that if Wakem or anybody else considered him crushed they would find themselves mistaken He could not refuse to see that the costs of this protracted suit would take more than he possessed to pay them but he appeared to himself to be full of expedients by which he could ward off any results but such as were tolerable and could avoid the appearance of breaking down in the world All the obstinacy and defiance of his nature driven out of their old channel found a vent for themselves in the immediate formation of plans by which he would meet his difficulties and remain mister Tulliver of Dorlcote Mill in spite of them There was such a rush of projects in his brain that it was no wonder his face was flushed when he came away from his talk with his attorney mister Gore and mounted his horse to ride home from Lindum There was Furley who held the mortgage on the land a reasonable fellow who would see his own interest mister Tulliver was convinced and who would be glad not only to purchase the whole estate including the mill and homestead but would accept mister Tulliver as tenant and be willing to advance money to be repaid with high interest out of the profits of the business which would be made over to him mister Tulliver only taking enough barely to maintain himself and his family Who would neglect such a profitable investment Certainly not Furley for mister Tulliver had determined that Furley should meet his plans with the utmost alacrity and there are men whoses brains have not yet been dangerously heated by the loss of a lawsuit who are apt to see in their own interest or desires a motive for other men s actions There was no doubt in the miller s mind that Furley would do just what was desirable and if he did why things would not be so very much worse mister Tulliver and his family must live more meagrely and humbly but it would only be till the profits of the business had paid off Furley s advances and that might be while mister Tulliver had still a good many years of life before him It was clear that the costs of the suit could be paid without his being obliged to turn out of his old place and look like a ruined man It was certainly an awkward moment in his affairs There was that suretyship for poor Riley who had died suddenly last April and left his friend saddled with a debt of two hundred and fifty pounds a fact which had helped to make mister Tulliver s banking book less pleasant reading than a man might desire toward Christmas Well he had never been one of those poor spirited sneaks who would refuse to give a helping hand to a fellow traveller in this puzzling world The really vexatious business was the fact that some months ago the creditor who had lent him the five hundred pounds to repay missus Glegg had become uneasy about his money set on by Wakem of course and mister Tulliver still confident that he should gain his suit and finding it eminently inconvenient to raise the said sum until that desirable issue had taken place had rashly acceded to the demand that he should give a bill of sale on his household furniture and some other effects as security in lieu of the bond It was all one he had said to himself he should soon pay off the money and there was no harm in giving that security any more than another But now the consequences of this bill of sale occurred to him in a new light and he remembered that the time was close at hand when it would be enforced unless the money were repaid Two months ago he would have declared stoutly that he would never be beholden to his wife s friends but now he told himself as stoutly that it was nothing but right and natural that Bessy should go to the Pullets and explain the thing to them they would hardly let Bessy s furniture be sold and it might be security to Pullet if he advanced the money there would after all be no gift or favor in the matter mister Tulliver would never have asked for anything from so poor spirited a fellow for himself but Bessy might do so if she liked It is precisely the proudest and most obstinate men who are the most liable to shift their position and contradict themselves in this sudden manner everything is easier to them than to face the simple fact that they have been thoroughly defeated and must begin life anew And mister Tulliver you perceive though nothing more than a superior miller and maltster was as proud and obstinate as if he had been a very lofty personage in whom such dispositions might be a source of that conspicuous far echoing tragedy which sweeps the stage in regal robes and makes the dullest chronicler sublime The pride and obstinacy of millers and other insignificant people whom you pass unnoticingly on the road every day have their tragedy too but it is of that unwept hidden sort that goes on from generation to generation and leaves no record such tragedy perhaps as lies in the conflicts of young souls hungry for joy under a lot made suddenly hard to them under the dreariness of a home where the morning brings no promise with it and where the unexpectant discontent of worn and disappointed parents weighs on the children like a damp thick air in which all the functions of life are depressed or such tragedy as lies in the slow or sudden death that follows on a bruised passion though it may be a death that finds only a parish funeral There are certain animals to which tenacity of position is a law of life they can never flourish again after a single wrench and there are certain human beings to whom predominance is a law of life they can only sustain humiliation so long as they can refuse to believe in it and in their own conception predominate still mister Tulliver was still predominating in his own imagination as he approached saint Ogg s through which he had to pass on his way homeward But what was it that suggested to him as he saw the Laceham coach entering the town to follow it to the coach office and get the clerk there to write a letter requiring Maggie to come home the very next day mister Tulliver s own hand shook too much under his excitement for him to write himself and he wanted the letter to be given to the coachman to deliver at Miss Firniss s school in the morning There was a craving which he would not account for to himself to have Maggie near him without delay she must come back by the coach to morrow To missus Tulliver when he got home he would admit no difficulties and scolded down her burst of grief on hearing that the lawsuit was lost by angry assertions that there was nothing to grieve about He said nothing to her that night about the bill of sale and the application to missus Pullet for he had kept her in ignorance of the nature of that transaction and had explained the necessity for taking an inventory of the goods as a matter connected with his will The possession of a wife conspicuously one s inferior in intellect is like other high privileges attended with a few inconveniences and among the rest with the occasional necessity for using a little deception The next day mister Tulliver was again on horseback in the afternoon on his way to mister Gore s office at saint Ogg s Gore was to have seen Furley in the morning and to have sounded him in relation to mister Tulliver s affairs But he had not gone half way when he met a clerk from mister Gore s office who was bringing a letter to mister Tulliver mister Gore had been prevented by a sudden call of business from waiting at his office to see mister Tulliver according to appointment but would be at his office at eleven to morrow morning and meanwhile had sent some important information by letter Oh said mister Tulliver taking the letter but not opening it Then tell Gore I ll see him to morrow at eleven and he turned his horse The clerk struck with mister Tulliver s glistening excited glance looked after him for a few moments and then rode away The reading of a letter was not the affair of an instant to mister Tulliver he took in the sense of a statement very slowly through the medium of written or even printed characters so he had put the letter in his pocket thinking he would open it in his armchair at home But by and by it occurred to him that there might be something in the letter missus Tulliver must not know about and if so it would be better to keep it out of her sight altogether He stopped his horse took out the letter and read it It was only a short letter the substance was that mister Gore had ascertained on secret but sure authority that Furley had been lately much straitened for money and had parted with his securities among the rest the mortgage on mister Tulliver s property which he had transferred to Wakem In half an hour after this mister Tulliver s own wagoner found him lying by the roadside insensible with an open letter near him and his gray horse snuffing uneasily about him When Maggie reached home that evening in obedience to her father s call he was no longer insensible About an hour before he had become conscious and after vague vacant looks around him had muttered something about a letter which he presently repeated impatiently At the instance of mister Turnbull the medical man Gore s letter was brought and laid on the bed and the previous impatience seemed to be allayed The stricken man lay for some time with his eyes fixed on the letter as if he were trying to knit up his thoughts by its help But presently a new wave of memory seemed to have come and swept the other away he turned his eyes from the letter to the door and after looking uneasily as if striving to see something his eyes were too dim for he said The little wench He repeated the words impatiently from time to time appearing entirely unconscious of everything except this one importunate want and giving no sign of knowing his wife or any one else and poor missus Tulliver her feeble faculties almost paralyzed by this sudden accumulation of troubles went backward and forward to the gate to see if the Laceham coach were coming though it was not yet time But it came at last and set down the poor anxious girl no longer the little wench except to her father s fond memory Oh mother what is the matter Maggie said with pale lips as her mother came toward her crying She didn t think her father was ill because the letter had come at his dictation from the office at saint Ogg s But mister Turnbull came now to meet her a medical man is the good angel of the troubled house and Maggie ran toward the kind old friend whom she remembered as long as she could remember anything with a trembling questioning look Don t alarm yourself too much my dear he said taking her hand Your father has had a sudden attack and has not quite recovered his memory But he has been asking for you and it will do him good to see you Keep as quiet as you can take off your things and come upstairs with me Maggie obeyed with that terrible beating of the heart which makes existence seem simply a painful pulsation The very quietness with which mister Turnbull spoke had frightened her susceptible imagination Her father s eyes were still turned uneasily toward the door when she entered and met the strange yearning helpless look that had been seeking her in vain With a sudden flash and movement he raised himself in the bed she rushed toward him and clasped him with agonized kisses Poor child it was very early for her to know one of those supreme moments in life when all we have hoped or delighted in all we can dread or endure falls away from our regard as insignificant is lost like a trivial memory in that simple primitive love which knits us to the beings who have been nearest to us in their times of helplessness or of anguish But that flash of recognition had been too great a strain on the father s bruised enfeebled powers He sank back again in renewed insensibility and rigidity which lasted for many hours and was only broken by a flickering return of consciousness in which he took passively everything that was given to him and seemed to have a sort of infantine satisfaction in Maggie s near presence such satisfaction as a baby has when it is returned to the nurse s lap missus Tulliver sent for her sisters and there was much wailing and lifting up of hands below stairs Both uncles and aunts saw that the ruin of Bessy and her family was as complete as they had ever foreboded it and there was a general family sense that a judgment had fallen on mister Tulliver which it would be an impiety to counteract by too much kindness But Maggie heard little of this scarcely ever leaving her father s bedside where she sat opposite him with her hand on his missus Tulliver wanted to have Tom fetched home and seemed to be thinking more of her boy even than of her husband but the aunts and uncles opposed this Tom was better at school since mister Turnbull said there was no immediate danger he believed But at the end of the second day when Maggie had become more accustomed to her father s fits of insensibility and to the expectation that he would revive from them the thought of Tom had become urgent with her too and when her mother sate crying at night and saying My poor lad it s nothing but right he should come home Maggie said Let me go for him and tell him mother I ll go to morrow morning if father doesn t know me and want me It would be so hard for Tom to come home and not know anything about it beforehand And the next morning Maggie went as we have seen Sitting on the coach on their way home the brother and sister talked to each other in sad interrupted whispers They say mister Wakem has got a mortgage or something on the land Tom said Maggie It was the letter with that news in it that made father ill they think I believe that scoundrel s been planning all along to ruin my father said Tom leaping from the vaguest impressions to a definite conclusion I ll make him feel for it when I m a man Mind you never speak to Philip again Oh Tom said Maggie in a tone of sad remonstrance but she had no spirit to dispute anything then still less to vex Tom by opposing him Chapter II missus Tulliver s Teraphim or Household Gods When the coach set down Tom and Maggie it was five hours since she had started from home and she was thinking with some trembling that her father had perhaps missed her and asked for the little wench in vain She thought of no other change that might have happened She hurried along the gravel walk and entered the house before Tom but in the entrance she was startled by a strong smell of tobacco The parlor door was ajar that was where the smell came from It was very strange could any visitor be smoking at a time like this Was her mother there If so she must be told that Tom was come Maggie after this pause of surprise was only in the act of opening the door when Tom came up and they both looked into the parlor together There was a coarse dingy man of whose face Tom had some vague recollection sitting in his father s chair smoking with a jug and glass beside him The truth flashed on Tom s mind in an instant To have the bailiff in the house and to be sold up were phrases which he had been used to even as a little boy they were part of the disgrace and misery of failing of losing all one s money and being ruined sinking into the condition of poor working people It seemed only natural this should happen since his father had lost all his property and he thought of no more special cause for this particular form of misfortune than the loss of the lawsuit But the immediate presence of this disgrace was so much keener an experience to Tom than the worst form of apprehension that he felt at this moment as if his real trouble had only just begin it was a touch on the irritated nerve compared with its spontaneous dull aching How do you do sir said the man taking the pipe out of his mouth with rough embarrassed civility The two young startled faces made him a little uncomfortable But Tom turned away hastily without speaking the sight was too hateful Maggie had not understood the appearance of this stranger as Tom had She followed him whispering Who can it be Tom What is the matter Then with a sudden undefined dread lest this stranger might have something to do with a change in her father she rushed upstairs checking herself at the bedroom door to throw off her bonnet and enter on tiptoe All was silent there her father was lying heedless of everything around him with his eyes closed as when she had left him A servant was there but not her mother Where s my mother she whispered The servant did not know Maggie hastened out and said to Tom Father is lying quiet let us go and look for my mother I wonder where she is missus Tulliver was not downstairs not in any of the bedrooms There was but one room below the attic which Maggie had left unsearched it was the storeroom where her mother kept all her linen and all the precious best things that were only unwrapped and brought out on special occasions Tom preceding Maggie as they returned along the passage opened the door of this room and immediately said Mother missus Tulliver was seated there with all her laid up treasures One of the linen chests was open the silver teapot was unwrapped from its many folds of paper and the best china was laid out on the top of the closed linen chest spoons and skewers and ladles were spread in rows on the shelves and the poor woman was shaking her head and weeping with a bitter tension of the mouth over the mark Elizabeth Dodson on the corner of some tablecloths she held in her lap She dropped them and started up as Tom spoke Oh my boy my boy she said clasping him round the neck To think as I should live to see this day We re ruined everything s going to be sold up to think as your father should ha married me to bring me to this We ve got nothing we shall be beggars we must go to the workhouse She kissed him then seated herself again and took another tablecloth on her lap unfolding it a little way to look at the pattern while the children stood by in mute wretchedness their minds quite filled for the moment with the words beggars and workhouse To think o these cloths as I spun myself she went on lifting things out and turning them over with an excitement all the more strange and piteous because the stout blond woman was usually so passive if she had been ruffled before it was at the surface merely and Job Haxey wove em and brought the piece home on his back as I remember standing at the door and seeing him come before I ever thought o marrying your father And the pattern as I chose myself and bleached so beautiful and I marked em so as nobody ever saw such marking they must cut the cloth to get it out for it s a particular stitch And they re all to be sold and go into strange people s houses and perhaps be cut with the knives and wore out before I m dead You ll never have one of em my boy she said looking up at Tom with her eyes full of tears and I meant em for you I wanted you to have all o this pattern Maggie could have had the large check it never shows so well when the dishes are on it Tom was touched to the quick but there was an angry reaction immediately His face flushed as he said But will my aunts let them be sold mother Do they know about it They ll never let your linen go will they Haven t you sent to them Yes I sent Luke directly they d put the bailies in and your aunt Pullet s been and oh dear oh dear she cries so and says your father s disgraced my family and made it the talk o the country and she ll buy the spotted cloths for herself because she s never had so many as she wanted o that pattern and they sha n t go to strangers but she s got more checks a ready nor she can do with Here missus Tulliver began to lay back the tablecloths in the chest folding and stroking them automatically And your uncle Glegg s been too and he says things must be bought in for us to lie down on but he must talk to your aunt and they re all coming to consult But I know they ll none of em take my chany she added turning toward the cups and saucers for they all found fault with em when I bought em cause o the small gold sprig all over em between the flowers But there s none of em got better chany not even your aunt Pullet herself and I bought it wi my own money as I d saved ever since I was turned fifteen and the silver teapot too your father never paid for em And to think as he should ha married me and brought me to this missus Tulliver burst out crying afresh and she sobbed with her handkerchief at her eyes a few moments but then removing it she said in a deprecating way still half sobbing as if she were called upon to speak before she could command her voice And I did say to him times and times Whativer you do don t go to law and what more could I do I ve had to sit by while my own fortin s been spent and what should ha been my children s too You ll have niver a penny my boy but it isn t your poor mother s fault She put out one arm toward Tom looking up at him piteously with her helpless childish blue eyes The poor lad went to her and kissed her and she clung to him For the first time Tom thought of his father with some reproach His natural inclination to blame hitherto kept entirely in abeyance toward his father by the predisposition to think him always right simply on the ground that he was Tom Tulliver s father was turned into this new channel by his mother s plaints and with his indignation against Wakem there began to mingle some indignation of another sort Perhaps his father might have helped bringing them all down in the world and making people talk of them with contempt but no one should talk long of Tom Tulliver with contempt The natural strength and firmness of his nature was beginning to assert itself urged by the double stimulus of resentment against his aunts and the sense that he must behave like a man and take care of his mother Don t fret mother he said tenderly I shall soon be able to get money I ll get a situation of some sort Bless you my boy said missus Tulliver a little soothed Then looking round sadly But I shouldn t ha minded so much if we could ha kept the things wi my name on em Maggie had witnessed this scene with gathering anger The implied reproaches against her father her father who was lying there in a sort of living death neutralized all her pity for griefs about tablecloths and china and her anger on her father s account was heightened by some egoistic resentment at Tom s silent concurrence with her mother in shutting her out from the common calamity She had become almost indifferent to her mother s habitual depreciation of her but she was keenly alive to any sanction of it however passive that she might suspect in Tom Poor Maggie was by no means made up of unalloyed devotedness but put forth large claims for herself where she loved strongly She burst out at last in an agitated almost violent tone Mother how can you talk so as if you cared only for things with your name on and not for what has my father s name too and to care about anything but dear father himself when he s lying there and may never speak to us again Tom you ought to say so too you ought not to let any one find fault with my father Maggie almost choked with mingled grief and anger left the room and took her old place on her father s bed Her heart went out to him with a stronger movement than ever at the thought that people would blame him Maggie hated blame she had been blamed all her life and nothing had come of it but evil tempers Her father had always defended and excused her and her loving remembrance of his tenderness was a force within her that would enable her to do or bear anything for his sake Tom was a little shocked at Maggie s outburst telling him as well as his mother what it was right to do She ought to have learned better than have those hectoring assuming manners by this time But he presently went into his father s room and the sight there touched him in a way that effaced the slighter impressions of the previous hour When Maggie saw how he was moved she went to him and put her arm round his neck as he sat by the bed and the two children forgot everything else in the sense that they had one father and one sorrow Chapter III The Family Council It was at eleven o clock the next morning that the aunts and uncles came to hold their consultation The fire was lighted in the large parlor and poor missus Tulliver with a confused impression that it was a great occasion like a funeral unbagged the bell rope tassels and unpinned the curtains adjusting them in proper folds looking round and shaking her head sadly at the polished tops and legs of the tables which sister Pullet herself could not accuse of insufficient brightness mister Deane was not coming he was away on business but missus Deane appeared punctually in that handsome new gig with the head to it and the livery servant driving it which had thrown so clear a light on several traits in her character to some of her female friends in saint Ogg s mister Deane had been advancing in the world as rapidly as mister Tulliver had been going down in it and in missus Deane s house the Dodson linen and plate were beginning to hold quite a subordinate position as a mere supplement to the handsomer articles of the same kind purchased in recent years a change which had caused an occasional coolness in the sisterly intercourse between her and missus Glegg who felt that Susan was getting like the rest and there would soon be little of the true Dodson spirit surviving except in herself and it might be hoped in those nephews who supported the Dodson name on the family land far away in the Wolds People who live at a distance are naturally less faulty than those immediately under our own eyes and it seems superfluous when we consider the remote geographical position of the Ethiopians and how very little the Greeks had to do with them to inquire further why Homer calls them blameless missus Deane was the first to arrive and when she had taken her seat in the large parlor missus Tulliver came down to her with her comely face a little distorted nearly as it would have been if she had been crying She was not a woman who could shed abundant tears except in moments when the prospect of losing her furniture became unusually vivid but she felt how unfitting it was to be quite calm under present circumstances Oh sister what a world this is she exclaimed as she entered what trouble oh dear missus Deane was a thin lipped woman who made small well considered speeches on peculiar occasions repeating them afterward to her husband and asking him if she had not spoken very properly Yes sister she said deliberately this is a changing world and we don t know to day what may happen tomorrow But it s right to be prepared for all things and if trouble s sent to remember as it isn t sent without a cause I m very sorry for you as a sister and if the doctor orders jelly for mister Tulliver I hope you ll let me know I ll send it willingly for it is but right he should have proper attendance while he s ill Thank you Susan said missus Tulliver rather faintly withdrawing her fat hand from her sister s thin one But there s been no talk o jelly yet Then after a moment s pause she added There s a dozen o cut jelly glasses upstairs I shall never put jelly into em no more Her voice was rather agitated as she uttered the last words but the sound of wheels diverted her thoughts mister and missus Glegg were come and were almost immediately followed by mister and missus Pullet missus Pullet entered crying as a compendious mode at all times of expressing what were her views of life in general and what in brief were the opinions she held concerning the particular case before her missus Glegg had on her fuzziest front and garments which appeared to have had a recent resurrection from rather a creasy form of burial a costume selected with the high moral purpose of instilling perfect humility into Bessy and her children missus G won t you come nearer the fire said her husband unwilling to take the more comfortable seat without offering it to her You see I ve seated myself here mister Glegg returned this superior woman you can roast yourself if you like Well said mister Glegg seating himself good humoredly and how s the poor man upstairs doctor Turnbull thought him a deal better this morning said missus Tulliver he took more notice and spoke to me but he s never known Tom yet looks at the poor lad as if he was a stranger though he said something once about Tom and the pony The doctor says his memory s gone a long way back and he doesn t know Tom because he s thinking of him when he was little Eh dear eh dear I doubt it s the water got on his brain said aunt Pullet turning round from adjusting her cap in a melancholy way at the pier glass It s much if he ever gets up again and if he does he ll most like be childish as mister Carr was poor man They fed him with a spoon as if he d been a babby for three year He d quite lost the use of his limbs but then he d got a Bath chair and somebody to draw him and that s what you won t have I doubt Bessy Sister Pullet said missus Glegg severely if I understand right we ve come together this morning to advise and consult about what s to be done in this disgrace as has fallen upon the family and not to talk o people as don t belong to us mister Carr was none of our blood nor noways connected with us as I ve ever heared Sister Glegg said missus Pullet in a pleading tone drawing on her gloves again and stroking the fingers in an agitated manner if you ve got anything disrespectful to say o mister Carr I do beg of you as you won t say it to me I know what he was she added with a sigh his breath was short to that degree as you could hear him two rooms off Sophy said missus Glegg with indignant disgust you do talk o people s complaints till it s quite undecent But I say again as I said before I didn t come away from home to talk about acquaintances whether they d short breath or long If we aren t come together for one to hear what the other ull do to save a sister and her children from the parish I shall go back One can t act without the other I suppose it isn t to be expected as I should do everything Well Jane said missus Pullet I don t see as you ve been so very forrard at doing So far as I know this is the first time as here you ve been since it s been known as the bailiff s in the house and I was here yesterday and looked at all Bessy s linen and things and I told her I d buy in the spotted tablecloths I couldn t speak fairer for as for the teapot as she doesn t want to go out o the family it stands to sense I can t do with two silver teapots not if it hadn t a straight spout but the spotted damask I was allays fond on I wish it could be managed so as my teapot and chany and the best castors needn t be put up for sale said poor missus Tulliver beseechingly and the sugar tongs the first things ever I bought But that can t be helped you know said mister Glegg If one o the family chooses to buy em in they can but one thing must be bid for as well as another And it isn t to be looked for said uncle Pullet with unwonted independence of idea as your own family should pay more for things nor they ll fetch They may go for an old song by auction Oh dear oh dear said missus Tulliver to think o my chany being sold i that way and I bought it when I was married just as you did yours Jane and Sophy and I know you didn t like mine because o the sprig but I was fond of it and there s never been a bit broke for I ve washed it myself and there s the tulips on the cups and the roses as anybody might go and look at em for pleasure You wouldn t like your chany to go for an old song and be broke to pieces though yours has got no color in it Jane it s all white and fluted and didn t cost so much as mine And there s the castors sister Deane I can t think but you d like to have the castors for I ve heard you say they re pretty Well I ve no objection to buy some of the best things said missus Deane rather loftily we can do with extra things in our house Best things exclaimed missus Glegg with severity which had gathered intensity from her long silence It drives me past patience to hear you all talking o best things and buying in this that and the other such as silver and chany You must bring your mind to your circumstances Bessy and not be thinking o silver and chany but whether you shall get so much as a flock bed to lie on and a blanket to cover you and a stool to sit on You must remember if you get em it ll be because your friends have bought em for you for you re dependent upon them for everything for your husband lies there helpless and hasn t got a penny i the world to call his own And it s for your own good I say this for it s right you should feel what your state is and what disgrace your husband s brought on your own family as you ve got to look to for everything and be humble in your mind missus Glegg paused for speaking with much energy for the good of others is naturally exhausting missus Tulliver always borne down by the family predominance of sister Jane who had made her wear the yoke of a younger sister in very tender years said pleadingly I m sure sister I ve never asked anybody to do anything only buy things as it ud be a pleasure to em to have so as they mightn t go and be spoiled i strange houses I never asked anybody to buy the things in for me and my children though there s the linen I spun and I thought when Tom was born I thought one o the first things when he was lying i the cradle as all the things I d bought wi my own money and been so careful of ud go to him But I ve said nothing as I wanted my sisters to pay their money for me What my husband has done for his sister s unknown and we should ha been better off this day if it hadn t been as he s lent money and never asked for it again Come come said mister Glegg kindly don t let us make things too dark What s done can t be undone We shall make a shift among us to buy what s sufficient for you though as missus G says they must be useful plain things We mustn t be thinking o what s unnecessary A table and a chair or two and kitchen things and a good bed and such like Why I ve seen the day when I shouldn t ha known myself if I d lain on sacking i stead o the floor We get a deal o useless things about us only because we ve got the money to spend mister Glegg said missus G if you ll be kind enough to let me speak i stead o taking the words out o my mouth I was going to say Bessy as it s fine talking for you to say as you ve never asked us to buy anything for you let me tell you you ought to have asked us Pray how are you to be purvided for if your own family don t help you You must go to the parish if they didn t And you ought to know that and keep it in mind and ask us humble to do what we can for you i stead o saying and making a boast as you ve never asked us for anything You talked o the Mosses and what mister Tulliver s done for em said uncle Pullet who became unusually suggestive where advances of money were concerned Haven t they been anear you They ought to do something as well as other folks and if he s lent em money they ought to be made to pay it back Yes to be sure said missus Deane I ve been thinking so How is it mister and missus Moss aren t here to meet us It is but right they should do their share Oh dear said missus Tulliver I never sent em word about mister Tulliver and they live so back ard among the lanes at Basset they niver hear anything only when mister Moss comes to market But I niver gave em a thought I wonder Maggie didn t though for she was allays so fond of her aunt Moss Why don t your children come in Bessy said missus Pullet at the mention of Maggie They should hear what their aunts and uncles have got to say and Maggie when it s me as have paid for half her schooling she ought to think more of her aunt Pullet than of aunt Moss I may go off sudden when I get home to day there s no telling If I d had my way said missus Glegg the children ud ha been in the room from the first It s time they knew who they ve to look to and it s right as somebody should talk to em and let em know their condition i life and what they re come down to and make em feel as they ve got to suffer for their father s faults Well I ll go and fetch em sister said missus Tulliver resignedly She was quite crushed now and thought of the treasures in the storeroom with no other feeling than blank despair She went upstairs to fetch Tom and Maggie who were both in their father s room and was on her way down again when the sight of the storeroom door suggested a new thought to her She went toward it and left the children to go down by themselves The aunts and uncles appeared to have been in warm discussion when the brother and sister entered both with shrinking reluctance for though Tom with a practical sagacity which had been roused into activity by the strong stimulus of the new emotions he had undergone since yesterday had been turning over in his mind a plan which he meant to propose to one of his aunts or uncles he felt by no means amicably toward them and dreaded meeting them all at once as he would have dreaded a large dose of concentrated physic which was but just endurable in small draughts As for Maggie she was peculiarly depressed this morning she had been called up after brief rest at three o clock and had that strange dreamy weariness which comes from watching in a sick room through the chill hours of early twilight and breaking day in which the outside day light life seems to have no importance and to be a mere margin to the hours in the darkened chamber Their entrance interrupted the conversation The shaking of hands was a melancholy and silent ceremony till uncle Pullet observed as Tom approached him Well young sir we ve been talking as we should want your pen and ink you can write rarely now after all your schooling I should think Ay ay said uncle Glegg with admonition which he meant to be kind we must look to see the good of all this schooling as your father s sunk so much money in now When land is gone and money s spent Then learning is most excellent Now s the time Tom to let us see the good o your learning Let us see whether you can do better than I can as have made my fortin without it But I began wi doing with little you see I could live on a basin o porridge and a crust o bread and cheese But I doubt high living and high learning ull make it harder for you young man nor it was for me But he must do it interposed aunt Glegg energetically whether it s hard or no He hasn t got to consider what s hard he must consider as he isn t to trusten to his friends to keep him in idleness and luxury he s got to bear the fruits of his father s misconduct and bring his mind to fare hard and to work hard And he must be humble and grateful to his aunts and uncles for what they re doing for his mother and father as must be turned out into the streets and go to the workhouse if they didn t help em And his sister too continued missus Glegg looking severely at Maggie who had sat down on the sofa by her aunt Deane drawn to her by the sense that she was Lucy s mother she must make up her mind to be humble and work for there ll be no servants to wait on her any more she must remember that She must do the work o the house and she must respect and love her aunts as have done so much for her and saved their money to leave to their nepheys and nieces Tom was still standing before the table in the centre of the group There was a heightened color in his face and he was very far from looking humbled but he was preparing to say in a respectful tone something he had previously meditated when the door opened and his mother re entered Poor missus Tulliver had in her hands a small tray on which she had placed her silver teapot a specimen teacup and saucer the castors and sugar tongs See here sister she said looking at missus Deane as she set the tray on the table I thought perhaps if you looked at the teapot again it s a good while since you saw it you might like the pattern better it makes beautiful tea and there s a stand and everything you might use it for every day or else lay it by for Lucy when she goes to housekeeping I should be so loath for em to buy it at the Golden Lion said the poor woman her heart swelling and the tears coming my teapot as I bought when I was married and to think of its being scratched and set before the travellers and folks and my letters on it see here E D and everybody to see em Ah dear dear said aunt Pullet shaking her head with deep sadness it s very bad to think o the family initials going about everywhere it niver was so before you re a very unlucky sister Bessy But what s the use o buying the teapot when there s the linen and spoons and everything to go and some of em with your full name and when it s got that straight spout too As to disgrace o the family said missus Glegg that can t be helped wi buying teapots The disgrace is for one o the family to ha married a man as has brought her to beggary The disgrace is as they re to be sold up We can t hinder the country from knowing that Maggie had started up from the sofa at the allusion to her father but Tom saw her action and flushed face in time to prevent her from speaking Be quiet Maggie he said authoritatively pushing her aside It was a remarkable manifestation of self command and practical judgment in a lad of fifteen that when his aunt Glegg ceased he began to speak in a quiet and respectful manner though with a good deal of trembling in his voice for his mother s words had cut him to the quick Then aunt he said looking straight at missus Glegg if you think it s a disgrace to the family that we should be sold up wouldn t it be better to prevent it altogether And if you and aunt Pullet he continued looking at the latter think of leaving any money to me and Maggie wouldn t it be better to give it now and pay the debt we re going to be sold up for and save my mother from parting with her furniture There was silence for a few moments for every one including Maggie was astonished at Tom s sudden manliness of tone Uncle Glegg was the first to speak Ay ay young man come now You show some notion o things But there s the interest you must remember your aunts get five per cent on their money and they d lose that if they advanced it you haven t thought o that I could work and pay that every year said Tom promptly I d do anything to save my mother from parting with her things Well done said uncle Glegg admiringly He had been drawing Tom out rather than reflecting on the practicability of his proposal But he had produced the unfortunate result of irritating his wife Yes mister Glegg said that lady with angry sarcasm It s pleasant work for you to be giving my money away as you ve pretended to leave at my own disposal And my money as was my own father s gift and not yours mister Glegg and I ve saved it and added to it myself and had more to put out almost every year and it s to go and be sunk in other folks furniture and encourage em in luxury and extravagance as they ve no means of supporting and I m to alter my will or have a codicil made and leave two or three hundred less behind me when I die me as have allays done right and been careful and the eldest o the family and my money s to go and be squandered on them as have had the same chance as me only they ve been wicked and wasteful Sister Pullet you may do as you like and you may let your husband rob you back again o the money he s given you but that isn t my sperrit La Jane how fiery you are said missus Pullet I m sure you ll have the blood in your head and have to be cupped I m sorry for Bessy and her children I m sure I think of em o nights dreadful for I sleep very bad wi this new medicine but it s no use for me to think o doing anything if you won t meet me half way Why there s this to be considered said mister Glegg It s no use to pay off this debt and save the furniture when there s all the law debts behind as ud take every shilling and more than could be made out o land and stock for I ve made that out from Lawyer Gore We d need save our money to keep the poor man with instead o spending it on furniture as he can neither eat nor drink You will be so hasty Jane as if I didn t know what was reasonable Then speak accordingly mister Glegg said his wife with slow loud emphasis bending her head toward him significantly Tom s countenance had fallen during this conversation and his lip quivered but he was determined not to give way He would behave like a man Maggie on the contrary after her momentary delight in Tom s speech had relapsed into her state of trembling indignation Her mother had been standing close by Tom s side and had been clinging to his arm ever since he had last spoken Maggie suddenly started up and stood in front of them her eyes flashing like the eyes of a young lioness Why do you come then she burst out talking and interfering with us and scolding us if you don t mean to do anything to help my poor mother your own sister if you ve no feeling for her when she s in trouble and won t part with anything though you would never miss it to save her from pain Keep away from us then and don t come to find fault with my father he was better than any of you he was kind he would have helped you if you had been in trouble Tom and I don t ever want to have any of your money if you won t help my mother We d rather not have it We ll do without you Maggie having hurled her defiance at aunts and uncles in this way stood still with her large dark eyes glaring at them as if she were ready to await all consequences missus Tulliver was frightened there was something portentous in this mad outbreak she did not see how life could go on after it Tom was vexed it was no use to talk so The aunts were silent with surprise for some moments At length in a case of aberration such as this comment presented itself as more expedient than any answer You haven t seen the end o your trouble wi that child Bessy said missus Pullet she s beyond everything for boldness and unthankfulness It s dreadful I might ha let alone paying for her schooling for she s worse nor ever It s no more than what I ve allays said followed missus Glegg Other folks may be surprised but I m not I ve said over and over again years ago I ve said Mark my words that child ull come to no good there isn t a bit of our family in her And as for her having so much schooling I never thought well o that I d my reasons when I said I wouldn t pay anything toward it Come come said mister Glegg let s waste no more time in talking let s go to business Tom now get the pen and ink While mister Glegg was speaking a tall dark figure was seen hurrying past the window Why there s missus Moss said missus Tulliver The bad news must ha reached her then and she went out to open the door Maggie eagerly following her That s fortunate said missus Glegg She can agree to the list o things to be bought in It s but right she should do her share when it s her own brother missus Moss was in too much agitation to resist missus Tulliver s movement as she drew her into the parlor automatically without reflecting that it was hardly kind to take her among so many persons in the first painful moment of arrival The tall worn dark haired woman was a strong contrast to the Dodson sisters as she entered in her shabby dress with her shawl and bonnet looking as if they had been hastily huddled on and with that entire absence of self consciousness which belongs to keenly felt trouble Maggie was clinging to her arm and missus Moss seemed to notice no one else except Tom whom she went straight up to and took by the hand Oh my dear children she burst out you ve no call to think well o me I m a poor aunt to you for I m one o them as take all and give nothing How s my poor brother mister Turnbull thinks he ll get better said Maggie Sit down aunt Gritty Don t fret Oh my sweet child I feel torn i two said missus Moss allowing Maggie to lead her to the sofa but still not seeming to notice the presence of the rest We ve three hundred pounds o my brother s money and now he wants it and you all want it poor things and yet we must be sold up to pay it and there s my poor children eight of em and the little un of all can t speak plain And I feel as if I was a robber But I m sure I d no thought as my brother The poor woman was interrupted by a rising sob Three hundred pounds oh dear dear said missus Tulliver who when she had said that her husband had done unknown things for his sister had not had any particular sum in her mind and felt a wife s irritation at having been kept in the dark What madness to be sure said missus Glegg A man with a family He d no right to lend his money i that way and without security I ll be bound if the truth was known missus Glegg s voice had arrested missus Moss s attention and looking up she said Yes there was security my husband gave a note for it We re not that sort o people neither of us as ud rob my brother s children and we looked to paying back the money when the times got a bit better Well but now said mister Glegg gently hasn t your husband no way o raising this money Because it ud be a little fortin like for these folks if we can do without Tulliver s being made a bankrupt Your husband s got stock it is but right he should raise the money as it seems to me not but what I m sorry for you missus Moss Oh sir you don t know what bad luck my husband s had with his stock The farm s suffering so as never was for want o stock and we ve sold all the wheat and we re behind with our rent not but what we d like to do what s right and I d sit up and work half the night if it ud be any good but there s them poor children four of em such little uns Don t cry so aunt don t fret whispered Maggie who had kept hold of missus Moss s hand Did mister Tulliver let you have the money all at once said missus Tulliver still lost in the conception of things which had been going on without her knowledge No at twice said missus Moss rubbing her eyes and making an effort to restrain her tears The last was after my bad illness four years ago as everything went wrong and there was a new note made then What with illness and bad luck I ve been nothing but cumber all my life Yes missus Moss said missus Glegg with decision yours is a very unlucky family the more s the pity for my sister I set off in the cart as soon as ever I heard o what had happened said missus Moss looking at missus Tulliver I should never ha stayed away all this while if you d thought well to let me know And it isn t as I m thinking all about ourselves and nothing about my brother only the money was so on my mind I couldn t help speaking about it And my husband and me desire to do the right thing sir she added looking at mister Glegg and we ll make shift and pay the money come what will if that s all my brother s got to trust to We ve been used to trouble and don t look for much else It s only the thought o my poor children pulls me i two Why there s this to be thought on missus Moss said mister Glegg and it s right to warn you if Tulliver s made a bankrupt and he s got a note of hand of your husband s for three hundred pounds you ll be obliged to pay it th assignees ull come on you for it Oh dear oh dear said missus Tulliver thinking of the bankruptcy and not of missus Moss s concern in it Poor missus Moss herself listened in trembling submission while Maggie looked with bewildered distress at Tom to see if he showed any signs of understanding this trouble and caring about poor aunt Moss Tom was only looking thoughtful with his eyes on the tablecloth And if he isn t made bankrupt continued mister Glegg as I said before three hundred pounds ud be a little fortin for him poor man We don t know but what he may be partly helpless if he ever gets up again I m very sorry if it goes hard with you missus Moss but my opinion is looking at it one way it ll be right for you to raise the money and looking at it th other way you ll be obliged to pay it You won t think ill o me for speaking the truth Uncle said Tom looking up suddenly from his meditative view of the tablecloth I don t think it would be right for my aunt Moss to pay the money if it would be against my father s will for her to pay it would it mister Glegg looked surprised for a moment or two before he said Why no perhaps not Tom but then he d ha destroyed the note you know We must look for the note What makes you think it ud be against his will Why said Tom coloring but trying to speak firmly in spite of a boyish tremor I remember quite well before I went to school to mister Stelling my father said to me one night when we were sitting by the fire together and no one else was in the room Tom hesitated a little and then went on He said something to me about Maggie and then he said I ve always been good to my sister though she married against my will and I ve lent Moss money but I shall never think of distressing him to pay it I d rather lose it My children must not mind being the poorer for that And now my father s ill and not able to speak for himself I shouldn t like anything to be done contrary to what he said to me Well but then my boy said Uncle Glegg whose good feeling led him to enter into Tom s wish but who could not at once shake off his habitual abhorrence of such recklessness as destroying securities or alienating anything important enough to make an appreciable difference in a man s property we should have to make away wi the note you know if we re to guard against what may happen supposing your father s made bankrupt mister Glegg interrupted his wife severely mind what you re saying You re putting yourself very forrard in other folks s business If you speak rash don t say it was my fault That s such a thing as I never heared of before said uncle Pullet who had been making haste with his lozenge in order to express his amazement making away with a note I should think anybody could set the constable on you for it Well but said missus Tulliver if the note s worth all that money why can t we pay it away and save my things from going away We ve no call to meddle with your uncle and aunt Moss Tom if you think your father ud be angry when he gets well missus Tulliver had not studied the question of exchange and was straining her mind after original ideas on the subject Pooh pooh pooh you women don t understand these things said uncle Glegg There s no way o making it safe for mister and missus Moss but destroying the note Then I hope you ll help me do it uncle said Tom earnestly If my father shouldn t get well I should be very unhappy to think anything had been done against his will that I could hinder And I m sure he meant me to remember what he said that evening I ought to obey my father s wish about his property Even missus Glegg could not withhold her approval from Tom s words she felt that the Dodson blood was certainly speaking in him though if his father had been a Dodson there would never have been this wicked alienation of money Maggie would hardly have restrained herself from leaping on Tom s neck if her aunt Moss had not prevented her by herself rising and taking Tom s hand while she said with rather a choked voice You ll never be the poorer for this my dear boy if there s a God above and if the money s wanted for your father Moss and me ull pay it the same as if there was ever such security We ll do as we d be done by for if my children have got no other luck they ve got an honest father and mother Well said mister Glegg who had been meditating after Tom s words we shouldn t be doing any wrong by the creditors supposing your father was bankrupt I ve been thinking o that for I ve been a creditor myself and seen no end o cheating If he meant to give your aunt the money before ever he got into this sad work o lawing it s the same as if he d made away with the note himself for he d made up his mind to be that much poorer But there s a deal o things to be considered young man mister Glegg added looking admonishingly at Tom when you come to money business and you may be taking one man s dinner away to make another man s breakfast You don t understand that I doubt Yes I do said Tom decidedly I know if I owe money to one man I ve no right to give it to another But if my father had made up his mind to give my aunt the money before he was in debt he had a right to do it Well done young man I didn t think you d been so sharp said uncle Glegg with much candor But perhaps your father did make away with the note Let us go and see if we can find it in the chest It s in my father s room Let us go too aunt Gritty whispered Maggie Chapter IV A Vanishing Gleam mister Tulliver even between the fits of spasmodic rigidity which had recurred at intervals ever since he had been found fallen from his horse was usually in so apathetic a condition that the exits and entrances into his room were not felt to be of great importance He had lain so still with his eyes closed all this morning that Maggie told her aunt Moss she must not expect her father to take any notice of them They entered very quietly and missus Moss took her seat near the head of the bed while Maggie sat in her old place on the bed and put her hand on her father s without causing any change in his face mister Glegg and Tom had also entered treading softly and were busy selecting the key of the old oak chest from the bunch which Tom had brought from his father s bureau They succeeded in opening the chest which stood opposite the foot of mister Tulliver s bed and propping the lid with the iron holder without much noise There s a tin box whispered mister Glegg he d most like put a small thing like a note in there Lift it out Tom but I ll just lift up these deeds they re the deeds o the house and mill I suppose and see what there is under em mister Glegg had lifted out the parchments and had fortunately drawn back a little when the iron holder gave way and the heavy lid fell with a loud bang that resounded over the house Perhaps there was something in that sound more than the mere fact of the strong vibration that produced the instantaneous effect on the frame of the prostrate man and for the time completely shook off the obstruction of paralysis The chest had belonged to his father and his father s father and it had always been rather a solemn business to visit it All long known objects even a mere window fastening or a particular door latch have sounds which are a sort of recognized voice to us a voice that will thrill and awaken when it has been used to touch deep lying fibres In the same moment when all the eyes in the room were turned upon him he started up and looked at the chest the parchments in mister Glegg s hand and Tom holding the tin box with a glance of perfect consciousness and recognition What are you going to do with those deeds he said in his ordinary tone of sharp questioning whenever he was irritated Come here Tom What do you do going to my chest Tom obeyed with some trembling it was the first time his father had recognized him But instead of saying anything more to him his father continued to look with a growing distinctness of suspicion at mister Glegg and the deeds What s been happening then he said sharply What are you meddling with my deeds for Is Wakem laying hold of everything Why don t you tell me what you ve been a doing he added impatiently as mister Glegg advanced to the foot of the bed before speaking No no friend Tulliver said mister Glegg in a soothing tone Nobody s getting hold of anything as yet We only came to look and see what was in the chest You ve been ill you know and we ve had to look after things a bit But let s hope you ll soon be well enough to attend to everything yourself mister Tulliver looked around him meditatively at Tom at mister Glegg and at Maggie then suddenly appearing aware that some one was seated by his side at the head of the bed he turned sharply round and saw his sister Eh Gritty he said in the half sad affectionate tone in which he had been wont to speak to her What you re there are you How could you manage to leave the children Oh brother said good missus Moss too impulsive to be prudent I m thankful I m come now to see you yourself again I thought you d never know us any more What have I had a stroke said mister Tulliver anxiously looking at mister Glegg A fall from your horse shook you a bit that s all I think said mister Glegg But you ll soon get over it let s hope mister Tulliver fixed his eyes on the bed clothes and remained silent for two or three minutes A new shadow came over his face He looked up at Maggie first and said in a lower tone You got the letter then my wench Yes father she said kissing him with a full heart She felt as if her father were come back to her from the dead and her yearning to show him how she had always loved him could be fulfilled Where s your mother he said so preoccupied that he received the kiss as passively as some quiet animal might have received it She s downstairs with my aunts father Shall I fetch her Ay ay poor Bessy and his eyes turned toward Tom as Maggie left the room You ll have to take care of em both if I die you know Tom You ll be badly off I doubt But you must see and pay everybody And mind there s fifty pound o Luke s as I put into the business he gave me a bit at a time and he s got nothing to show for it You must pay him first thing Uncle Glegg involuntarily shook his head and looked more concerned than ever but Tom said firmly Yes father And haven t you a note from my uncle Moss for three hundred pounds We came to look for that What do you wish to be done about it father Ah I m glad you thought o that my lad said mister Tulliver I allays meant to be easy about that money because o your aunt You mustn t mind losing the money if they can t pay it and it s like enough they can t The note s in that box mind I allays meant to be good to you Gritty said mister Tulliver turning to his sister but you know you aggravated me when you would have Moss At this moment Maggie re entered with her mother who came in much agitated by the news that her husband was quite himself again Well Bessy he said as she kissed him you must forgive me if you re worse off than you ever expected to be But it s the fault o the law it s none o mine he added angrily It s the fault o raskills Tom you mind this if ever you ve got the chance you make Wakem smart If you don t you re a good for nothing son You might horse whip him but he d set the law on you the law s made to take care o raskills mister Tulliver was getting excited and an alarming flush was on his face mister Glegg wanted to say something soothing but he was prevented by mister Tulliver s speaking again to his wife They ll make a shift to pay everything Bessy he said and yet leave you your furniture and your sisters ll do something for you and Tom ll grow up though what he s to be I don t know I ve done what I could I ve given him a eddication and there s the little wench she ll get married but it s a poor tale The sanative effect of the strong vibration was exhausted and with the last words the poor man fell again rigid and insensible Though this was only a recurrence of what had happened before it struck all present as if it had been death not only from its contrast with the completeness of the revival but because his words had all had reference to the possibility that his death was near But with poor Tulliver death was not to be a leap it was to be a long descent under thickening shadows mister Turnbull was sent for but when he heard what had passed he said this complete restoration though only temporary was a hopeful sign proving that there was no permanent lesion to prevent ultimate recovery Among the threads of the past which the stricken man had gathered up he had omitted the bill of sale the flash of memory had only lit up prominent ideas and he sank into forgetfulness again with half his humiliation unlearned But Tom was clear upon two points that his uncle Moss s note must be destroyed and that Luke s money must be paid if in no other way out of his own and Maggie s money now in the savings bank There were subjects you perceive on which Tom was much quicker than on the niceties of classical construction or the relations of a mathematical demonstration Chapter V Tom Applies His Knife to the Oyster The next day at ten o clock Tom was on his way to saint Ogg s to see his uncle Deane who was to come home last night his aunt had said and Tom had made up his mind that his uncle Deane was the right person to ask for advice about getting some employment He was in a great way of business he had not the narrow notions of uncle Glegg and he had risen in the world on a scale of advancement which accorded with Tom s ambition It was a dark chill misty morning likely to end in rain one of those mornings when even happy people take refuge in their hopes And Tom was very unhappy he felt the humiliation as well as the prospective hardships of his lot with all the keenness of a proud nature and with all his resolute dutifulness toward his father there mingled an irrepressible indignation against him which gave misfortune the less endurable aspect of a wrong Since these were the consequences of going to law his father was really blamable as his aunts and uncles had always said he was and it was a significant indication of Tom s character that though he thought his aunts ought to do something more for his mother he felt nothing like Maggie s violent resentment against them for showing no eager tenderness and generosity There were no impulses in Tom that led him to expect what did not present itself to him as a right to be demanded Why should people give away their money plentifully to those who had not taken care of their own money Tom saw some justice in severity and all the more because he had confidence in himself that he should never deserve that just severity It was very hard upon him that he should be put at this disadvantage in life by his father s want of prudence but he was not going to complain and to find fault with people because they did not make everything easy for him He would ask no one to help him more than to give him work and pay him for it Poor Tom was not without his hopes to take refuge in under the chill damp imprisonment of the December fog which seemed only like a part of his home troubles At sixteen the mind that has the strongest affinity for fact cannot escape illusion and self flattery and Tom in sketching his future had no other guide in arranging his facts than the suggestions of his own brave self reliance Both mister Glegg and mister Deane he knew had been very poor once he did not want to save money slowly and retire on a moderate fortune like his uncle Glegg but he would be like his uncle Deane get a situation in some great house of business and rise fast He had scarcely seen anything of his uncle Deane for the last three years the two families had been getting wider apart but for this very reason Tom was the more hopeful about applying to him His uncle Glegg he felt sure would never encourage any spirited project but he had a vague imposing idea of the resources at his uncle Deane s command He had heard his father say long ago how Deane had made himself so valuable to Guest company that they were glad enough to offer him a share in the business that was what Tom resolved he would do It was intolerable to think of being poor and looked down upon all one s life He would provide for his mother and sister and make every one say that he was a man of high character He leaped over the years in this way and in the haste of strong purpose and strong desire did not see how they would be made up of slow days hours and minutes By the time he had crossed the stone bridge over the Floss and was entering saint Ogg s he was thinking that he would buy his father s mill and land again when he was rich enough and improve the house and live there he should prefer it to any smarter newer place and he could keep as many horses and dogs as he liked Walking along the street with a firm rapid step at this point in his reverie he was startled by some one who had crossed without his notice and who said to him in a rough familiar voice Why Master Tom how s your father this morning It was a publican of saint Ogg s one of his father s customers Tom disliked being spoken to just then but he said civilly He s still very ill thank you Ay it s been a sore chance for you young man hasn t it this lawsuit turning out against him said the publican with a confused beery idea of being good natured Tom reddened and passed on he would have felt it like the handling of a bruise even if there had been the most polite and delicate reference to his position That s Tulliver s son said the publican to a grocer standing on the adjacent door step Ah said the grocer I thought I knew his features He takes after his mother s family she was a Dodson He s a fine straight youth what s he been brought up to Oh to turn up his nose at his father s customers and be a fine gentleman not much else I think Tom roused from his dream of the future to a thorough consciousness of the present made all the greater haste to reach the warehouse offices of Guest company where he expected to find his uncle Deane But this was mister Deane s morning at the band a clerk told him and with some contempt for his ignorance mister Deane was not to be found in River Street on a Thursday morning At the bank Tom was admitted into the private room where his uncle was immediately after sending in his name mister Deane was auditing accounts but he looked up as Tom entered and putting out his hand said Well Tom nothing fresh the matter at home I hope How s your father Much the same thank you uncle said Tom feeling nervous But I want to speak to you please when you re at liberty Sit down sit down said mister Deane relapsing into his accounts in which he and the managing clerk remained so absorbed for the next half hour that Tom began to wonder whether he should have to sit in this way till the bank closed there seemed so little tendency toward a conclusion in the quiet monotonous procedure of these sleek prosperous men of business Would his uncle give him a place in the bank It would be very dull prosy work he thought writing there forever to the loud ticking of a timepiece He preferred some other way of getting rich But at last there was a change his uncle took a pen and wrote something with a flourish at the end You ll just step up to Torry s now mister Spence will you said mister Deane and the clock suddenly became less loud and deliberate in Tom s ears Well Tom said mister Deane when they were alone turning his substantial person a little in his chair and taking out his snuff box what s the business my boy what s the business mister Deane who had heard from his wife what had passed the day before thought Tom was come to appeal to him for some means of averting the sale I hope you ll excuse me for troubling you uncle said Tom coloring but speaking in a tone which though tremulous had a certain proud independence in it but I thought you were the best person to advise me what to do Ah said mister Deane reserving his pinch of snuff and looking at Tom with new attention let us hear I want to get a situation uncle so that I may earn some money said Tom who never fell into circumlocution A situation said mister Deane and then took his pinch of snuff with elaborate justice to each nostril Tom thought snuff taking a most provoking habit Why let me see how old are you said mister Deane as he threw himself backward again Sixteen I mean I am going in seventeen said Tom hoping his uncle noticed how much beard he had Let me see your father had some notion of making you an engineer I think But I don t think I could get any money at that for a long while could I That s true but people don t get much money at anything my boy when they re only sixteen You ve had a good deal of schooling however I suppose you re pretty well up in accounts eh You understand book keeping No said Tom rather falteringly I was in Practice But mister Stelling says I write a good hand uncle That s my writing added Tom laying on the table a copy of the list he had made yesterday Ah that s good that s good But you see the best hand in the world ll not get you a better place than a copying clerk s if you know nothing of book keeping nothing of accounts And a copying clerk s a cheap article But what have you been learning at school then mister Deane had not occupied himself with methods of education and had no precise conception of what went forward in expensive schools We learned Latin said Tom pausing a little between each item as if he were turning over the books in his school desk to assist his memory a good deal of Latin and the last year I did Themes one week in Latin and one in English and Greek and Roman history and Euclid and I began Algebra but I left it off again and we had one day every week for Arithmetic Then I used to have drawing lessons and there were several other books we either read or learned out of English Poetry and Horae Pauline and Blair s Rhetoric the last half mister Deane tapped his snuff box again and screwed up his mouth he felt in the position of many estimable persons when they had read the New Tariff and found how many commodities were imported of which they knew nothing like a cautious man of business he was not going to speak rashly of a raw material in which he had had no experience But the presumption was that if it had been good for anything so successful a man as himself would hardly have been ignorant of it About Latin he had an opinion and thought that in case of another war since people would no longer wear hair powder it would be well to put a tax upon Latin as a luxury much run upon by the higher classes and not telling at all on the ship owning department But for what he knew the Hore Pauline might be something less neutral On the whole this list of acquirements gave him a sort of repulsion toward poor Tom Well he said at last in rather a cold sardonic tone you ve had three years at these things you must be pretty strong in em Hadn t you better take up some line where they ll come in handy Tom colored and burst out with new energy I d rather not have any employment of that sort uncle I don t like Latin and those things I don t know what I could do with them unless I went as usher in a school and I don t know them well enough for that besides I would as soon carry a pair of panniers I don t want to be that sort of person I should like to enter into some business where I can get on a manly business where I should have to look after things and get credit for what I did And I shall want to keep my mother and sister Ah young gentleman said mister Deane with that tendency to repress youthful hopes which stout and successful men of fifty find one of their easiest duties that s sooner said than done sooner said than done But didn t you get on in that way uncle said Tom a little irritated that mister Deane did not enter more rapidly into his views I mean didn t you rise from one place to another through your abilities and good conduct Ay ay sir said mister Deane spreading himself in his chair a little and entering with great readiness into a retrospect of his own career But I ll tell you how I got on It wasn t by getting astride a stick and thinking it would turn into a horse if I sat on it long enough I kept my eyes and ears open sir and I wasn t too fond of my own back and I made my master s interest my own Why with only looking into what went on in the mill I found out how there was a waste of five hundred a year that might be hindered Why sir I hadn t more schooling to begin with than a charity boy but I saw pretty soon that I couldn t get on far enough without mastering accounts and I learned em between working hours after I d been unlading Look here mister Deane opened a book and pointed to the page I write a good hand enough and I ll match anybody at all sorts of reckoning by the head and I got it all by hard work and paid for it out of my own earnings often out of my own dinner and supper And I looked into the nature of all the things we had to do in the business and picked up knowledge as I went about my work and turned it over in my head Why I m no mechanic I never pretended to be but I ve thought of a thing or two that the mechanics never thought of and it s made a fine difference in our returns And there isn t an article shipped or unshipped at our wharf but I know the quality of it If I got places sir it was because I made myself fit for em If you want to slip into a round hole you must make a ball of yourself that s where it is mister Deane tapped his box again He had been led on by pure enthusiasm in his subject and had really forgotten what bearing this retrospective survey had on his listener He had found occasion for saying the same thing more than once before and was not distinctly aware that he had not his port wine before him Well uncle said Tom with a slight complaint in his tone that s what I should like to do Can t I get on in the same way In the same way said mister Deane eyeing Tom with quiet deliberation There go two or three questions to that Master Tom That depends on what sort of material you are to begin with and whether you ve been put into the right mill But I ll tell you what it is Your poor father went the wrong way to work in giving you an education It wasn t my business and I didn t interfere but it is as I thought it would be You ve had a sort of learning that s all very well for a young fellow like our mister Stephen Guest who ll have nothing to do but sign checks all his life and may as well have Latin inside his head as any other sort of stuffing But uncle said Tom earnestly I don t see why the Latin need hinder me from getting on in business I shall soon forget it all it makes no difference to me I had to do my lessons at school but I always thought they d never be of any use to me afterward I didn t care about them Ay ay that s all very well said mister Deane but it doesn t alter what I was going to say Your Latin and rigmarole may soon dry off you but you ll be but a bare stick after that Besides it s whitened your hands and taken the rough work out of you And what do you know Why you know nothing about book keeping to begin with and not so much of reckoning as a common shopman You ll have to begin at a low round of the ladder let me tell you if you mean to get on in life It s no use forgetting the education your father s been paying for if you don t give yourself a new un Tom bit his lips hard he felt as if the tears were rising and he would rather die than let them You want me to help you to a situation mister Deane went on well I ve no fault to find with that I m willing to do something for you But you youngsters nowadays think you re to begin with living well and working easy you ve no notion of running afoot before you get horseback Now you must remember what you are you re a lad of sixteen trained to nothing particular There s heaps of your sort like so many pebbles made to fit in nowhere Well you might be apprenticed to some business a chemist s and druggist s perhaps your Latin might come in a bit there Tom was going to speak but mister Deane put up his hand and said Stop hear what I ve got to say You don t want to be a prentice I know I know you want to make more haste and you don t want to stand behind a counter But if you re a copying clerk you ll have to stand behind a desk and stare at your ink and paper all day there isn t much out look there and you won t be much wiser at the end of the year than at the beginning The world isn t made of pen ink and paper and if you re to get on in the world young man you must know what the world s made of Now the best chance for you ud be to have a place on a wharf or in a warehouse where you d learn the smell of things but you wouldn t like that I ll be bound you d have to stand cold and wet and be shouldered about by rough fellows You re too fine a gentleman for that mister Deane paused and looked hard at Tom who certainly felt some inward struggle before he could reply I would rather do what will be best for me in the end sir I would put up with what was disagreeable That s well if you can carry it out But you must remember it isn t only laying hold of a rope you must go on pulling It s the mistake you lads make that have got nothing either in your brains or your pocket to think you ve got a better start in the world if you stick yourselves in a place where you can keep your coats clean and have the shopwenches take you for fine gentlemen That wasn t the way I started young man when I was sixteen my jacket smelt of tar and I wasn t afraid of handling cheeses That s the reason I can wear good broadcloth now and have my legs under the same table with the head of the best firms in saint Ogg s Uncle Deane tapped his box and seemed to expand a little under his waistcoat and gold chain as he squared his shoulders in the chair Is there any place at liberty that you know of now uncle that I should do for I should like to set to work at once said Tom with a slight tremor in his voice Stop a bit stop a bit we mustn t be in too great a hurry You must bear in mind if I put you in a place you re a bit young for because you happen to be my nephew I shall be responsible for you And there s no better reason you know than your being my nephew because it remains to be seen whether you re good for anything I hope I shall never do you any discredit uncle said Tom hurt as all boys are at the statement of the unpleasant truth that people feel no ground for trusting them I care about my own credit too much for that Well done Tom well done That s the right spirit and I never refuse to help anybody if they ve a mind to do themselves justice There s a young man of two and twenty I ve got my eye on now I shall do what I can for that young man he s got some pith in him But then you see he s made good use of his time a first rate calculator can tell you the cubic contents of anything in no time and put me up the other day to a new market for Swedish bark he s uncommonly knowing in manufactures that young fellow I d better set about learning book keeping hadn t I uncle said Tom anxious to prove his readiness to exert himself Yes yes you can t do amiss there But Ah Spence you re back again Well Tom there s nothing more to be said just now I think and I must go to business again Good by Remember me to your mother mister Deane put out his hand with an air of friendly dismissal and Tom had not courage to ask another question especially in the presence of mister Spence So he went out again into the cold damp air He had to call at his uncle Glegg s about the money in the Savings Bank and by the time he set out again the mist had thickened and he could not see very far before him but going along River Street again he was startled when he was within two yards of the projecting side of a shop window by the words Dorlcote Mill in large letters on a hand bill placed as if on purpose to stare at him It was the catalogue of the sale to take place the next week it was a reason for hurrying faster out of the town Poor Tom formed no visions of the distant future as he made his way homeward he only felt that the present was very hard It seemed a wrong toward him that his uncle Deane had no confidence in him did not see at once that he should acquit himself well which Tom himself was as certain of as of the daylight Apparently he Tom Tulliver was likely to be held of small account in the world and for the first time he felt a sinking of heart under the sense that he really was very ignorant and could do very little Who was that enviable young man that could tell the cubic contents of things in no time and make suggestions about Swedish bark Tom had been used to be so entirely satisfied with himself in spite of his breaking down in a demonstration and construing nunc illas promite vires as now promise those men but now he suddenly felt at a disadvantage because he knew less than some one else knew There must be a world of things connected with that Swedish bark which if he only knew them might have helped him to get on It would have been much easier to make a figure with a spirited horse and a new saddle Two hours ago as Tom was walking to saint Ogg s he saw the distant future before him as he might have seen a tempting stretch of smooth sandy beach beyond a belt of flinty shingles he was on the grassy bank then and thought the shingles might soon be passed But now his feet were on the sharp stones the belt of shingles had widened and the stretch of sand had dwindled into narrowness What did my Uncle Deane say Tom said Maggie putting her arm through Tom s as he was warming himself rather drearily by the kitchen fire Did he say he would give you a situation No he didn t say that He didn t quite promise me anything he seemed to think I couldn t have a very good situation I m too young But didn t he speak kindly Tom Kindly Pooh what s the use of talking about that I wouldn t care about his speaking kindly if I could get a situation But it s such a nuisance and bother I ve been at school all this while learning Latin and things not a bit of good to me and now my uncle says I must set about learning book keeping and calculation and those things He seems to make out I m good for nothing Tom s mouth twitched with a bitter expression as he looked at the fire Oh what a pity we haven t got Dominie Sampson said Maggie who couldn t help mingling some gayety with their sadness If he had taught me book keeping by double entry and after the Italian method as he did Lucy Bertram I could teach you Tom You teach Yes I dare say That s always the tone you take said Tom Dear Tom I was only joking said Maggie putting her cheek against his coat sleeve But it s always the same Maggie said Tom with the little frown he put on when he was about to be justifiably severe You re always setting yourself up above me and every one else and I ve wanted to tell you about it several times You ought not to have spoken as you did to my uncles and aunts you should leave it to me to take care of my mother and you and not put yourself forward You think you know better than any one but you re almost always wrong I can judge much better than you can Poor Tom he had just come from being lectured and made to feel his inferiority the reaction of his strong self asserting nature must take place somehow and here was a case in which he could justly show himself dominant Maggie s cheek flushed and her lip quivered with conflicting resentment and affection and a certain awe as well as admiration of Tom s firmer and more effective character She did not answer immediately very angry words rose to her lips but they were driven back again and she said at last You often think I m conceited Tom when I don t mean what I say at all in that way I don t mean to put myself above you I know you behaved better than I did yesterday But you are always so harsh to me Tom With the last words the resentment was rising again No I m not harsh said Tom with severe decision I m always kind to you and so I shall be I shall always take care of you But you must mind what I say Their mother came in now and Maggie rushed away that her burst of tears which she felt must come might not happen till she was safe upstairs They were very bitter tears everybody in the world seemed so hard and unkind to Maggie there was no indulgence no fondness such as she imagined when she fashioned the world afresh in her own thoughts In books there were people who were always agreeable or tender and delighted to do things that made one happy and who did not show their kindness by finding fault The world outside the books was not a happy one Maggie felt it seemed to be a world where people behaved the best to those they did not pretend to love and that did not belong to them And if life had no love in it what else was there for Maggie Nothing but poverty and the companionship of her mother s narrow griefs perhaps of her father s heart cutting childish dependence There is no hopelessness so sad as that of early youth when the soul is made up of wants and has no long memories no superadded life in the life of others though we who looked on think lightly of such premature despair as if our vision of the future lightened the blind sufferer s present Maggie in her brown frock with her eyes reddened and her heavy hair pushed back looking from the bed where her father lay to the dull walls of this sad chamber which was the centre of her world was a creature full of eager passionate longings for all that was beautiful and glad thirsty for all knowledge with an ear straining after dreamy music that died away and would not come near to her with a blind unconscious yearning for something that would link together the wonderful impressions of this mysterious life and give her soul a sense of home in it No wonder when there is this contrast between the outward and the inward that painful collisions come of it Chapter VI Tending to Refute the Popular Prejudice against the Present of a Pocket Knife In that dark time of December the sale of the household furniture lasted beyond the middle of the second day mister Tulliver who had begun in his intervals of consciousness to manifest an irritability which often appeared to have as a direct effect the recurrence of spasmodic rigidity and insensibility had lain in this living death throughout the critical hours when the noise of the sale came nearest to his chamber mister Turnbull had decided that it would be a less risk to let him remain where he was than to remove him to Luke s cottage a plan which the good Luke had proposed to missus Tulliver thinking it would be very bad if the master were to waken up at the noise of the sale and the wife and children had sat imprisoned in the silent chamber watching the large prostrate figure on the bed and trembling lest the blank face should suddenly show some response to the sounds which fell on their own ears with such obstinate painful repetition But it was over at last that time of importunate certainty and eye straining suspense The sharp sound of a voice almost as metallic as the rap that followed it had ceased the tramping of footsteps on the gravel had died out missus Tulliver s blond face seemed aged ten years by the last thirty hours the poor woman s mind had been busy divining when her favorite things were being knocked down by the terrible hammer her heart had been fluttering at the thought that first one thing and then another had gone to be identified as hers in the hateful publicity of the Golden Lion and all the while she had to sit and make no sign of this inward agitation Such things bring lines in well rounded faces and broaden the streaks of white among the hairs that once looked as if they had been dipped in pure sunshine Already at three o clock Kezia the good hearted bad tempered housemaid who regarded all people that came to the sale as her personal enemies the dirt on whose feet was of a peculiarly vile quality had begun to scrub and swill with an energy much assisted by a continual low muttering against folks as came to buy up other folk s things and made light of scrazing the tops of mahogany tables over which better folks than themselves had had to suffer a waste of tissue through evaporation She was not scrubbing indiscriminately for there would be further dirt of the same atrocious kind made by people who had still to fetch away their purchases but she was bent on bringing the parlor where that pipe smoking pig the bailiff had sat to such an appearance of scant comfort as could be given to it by cleanliness and the few articles of furniture bought in for the family Her mistress and the young folks should have their tea in it that night Kezia was determined It was between five and six o clock near the usual teatime when she came upstairs and said that Master Tom was wanted The person who wanted him was in the kitchen and in the first moments by the imperfect fire and candle light Tom had not even an indefinite sense of any acquaintance with the rather broad set but active figure perhaps two years older than himself that looked at him with a pair of blue eyes set in a disc of freckles and pulled some curly red locks with a strong intention of respect A low crowned oilskin covered hat and a certain shiny deposit of dirt on the rest of the costume as of tablets prepared for writing upon suggested a calling that had to do with boats but this did not help Tom s memory Sarvant Master Tom said he of the red locks with a smile which seemed to break through a self imposed air of melancholy You don t know me again I doubt he went on as Tom continued to look at him inquiringly but I d like to talk to you by yourself a bit please There s a fire i the parlor Master Tom said Kezia who objected to leaving the kitchen in the crisis of toasting Come this way then said Tom wondering if this young fellow belonged to Guest company s Wharf for his imagination ran continually toward that particular spot and uncle Deane might any time be sending for him to say that there was a situation at liberty The bright fire in the parlor was the only light that showed the few chairs the bureau the carpetless floor and the one table no not the one table there was a second table in a corner with a large Bible and a few other books upon it It was this new strange bareness that Tom felt first before he thought of looking again at the face which was also lit up by the fire and which stole a half shy questioning glance at him as the entirely strange voice said Why you don t remember Bob then as you general the pocket knife to mister Tom The rough handled pocket knife was taken out in the same moment and the largest blade opened by way of irresistible demonstration What Bob Jakin said Tom not with any cordial delight for he felt a little ashamed of that early intimacy symbolized by the pocket knife and was not at all sure that Bob s motives for recalling it were entirely admirable Ay ay Bob Jakin if Jakin it must be cause there s so many Bobs as you went arter the squerrils with that day as I plumped right down from the bough and bruised my shins a good un but I got the squerril tight for all that an a scratter it was An this littlish blade s broke you see but I wouldn t hev a new un put in cause they might be cheatin me an givin me another knife instid for there isn t such a blade i the country it s got used to my hand like An there was niver nobody else general me nothin but what I got by my own sharpness only you mister Tom if it wasn t Bill Fawks as general me the terrier pup istid o drowndin t it an I had to jaw him a good un afore he d give it me Bob spoke with a sharp and rather treble volubility and got through his long speech with surprising despatch giving the blade of his knife an affectionate rub on his sleeve when he had finished Well Bob said Tom with a slight air of patronage the foregoing reminscences having disposed him to be as friendly as was becoming though there was no part of his acquaintance with Bob that he remembered better than the cause of their parting quarrel is there anything I can do for you Why no mister Tom answered Bob shutting up his knife with a click and returning it to his pocket where he seemed to be feeling for something else I shouldn t ha come back upon you now ye re i trouble an folks say as the master as I used to frighten the birds for an he flogged me a bit for fun when he catched me eatin the turnip as they say he ll niver lift up his head no more I shouldn t ha come now to ax you to gi me another knife cause you general me one afore If a chap gives me one black eye that s enough for me I sha n t ax him for another afore I sarve him out an a good turn s worth as much as a bad un anyhow I shall niver grow down ards again mister Tom an you war the little chap as I liked the best when I war a little chap for all you leathered me and wouldn t look at me again There s Dick Brumby there I could leather him as much as I d a mind but lors you get tired o leatherin a chap when you can niver make him see what you want him to shy at I n seen chaps as ud stand starin at a bough till their eyes shot out afore they d see as a bird s tail warn t a leaf It s poor work goin wi such raff But you war allays a rare un at shying mister Tom an I could trusten to you for droppin down wi your stick in the nick o time at a runnin rat or a stoat or that when I war a beatin the bushes Bob had drawn out a dirty canvas bag and would perhaps not have paused just then if Maggie had not entered the room and darted a look of surprise and curiosity at him whereupon he pulled his red locks again with due respect But the next moment the sense of the altered room came upon Maggie with a force that overpowered the thought of Bob s presence Her eyes had immediately glanced from him to the place where the bookcase had hung there was nothing now but the oblong unfaded space on the wall and below it the small table with the Bible and the few other books Oh Tom she burst out clasping her hands where are the books I thought my uncle Glegg said he would buy them Didn t he Are those all they ve left us I suppose so said Tom with a sort of desperate indifference Why should they buy many books when they bought so little furniture Oh but Tom said Maggie her eyes filling with tears as she rushed up to the table to see what books had been rescued Our dear old Pilgrim s Progress that you colored with your little paints and that picture of Pilgrim with a mantle on looking just like a turtle oh dear Maggie went on half sobbing as she turned over the few books I thought we should never part with that while we lived everything is going away from us the end of our lives will have nothing in it like the beginning Maggie turned away from the table and threw herself into a chair with the big tears ready to roll down her cheeks quite blinded to the presence of Bob who was looking at her with the pursuant gaze of an intelligent dumb animal with perceptions more perfect than his comprehension Well Bob said Tom feeling that the subject of the books was unseasonable I suppose you just came to see me because we re in trouble That was very good natured of you I ll tell you how it is Master Tom said Bob beginning to untwist his canvas bag You see I n been with a barge this two ear that s how I n been gettin my livin if it wasn t when I was tentin the furnace between whiles at Torry s mill But a fortni t ago I d a rare bit o luck I allays thought I was a lucky chap for I niver set a trap but what I catched something but this wasn t trap it was a fire i Torry s mill an I doused it else it ud set th oil alight an the genelman general me ten suvreigns he general me em himself last week An he said first I was a sperrited chap but I knowed that afore but then he outs wi the ten suvreigns an that war summat new Here they are all but one Here Bob emptied the canvas bag on the table An when I d got em my head was all of a boil like a kettle o broth thinkin what sort o life I should take to for there war a many trades I d thought on for as for the barge I m clean tired out wi t for it pulls the days out till they re as long as pigs chitterlings An I thought first I d ha ferrets an dogs an be a rat catcher an then I thought as I should like a bigger way o life as I didn t know so well for I n seen to the bottom o rat catching an I thought an thought till at last I settled I d be a packman for they re knowin fellers the packmen are an I d carry the lightest things I could i my pack an there d be a use for a feller s tongue as is no use neither wi rats nor barges An I should go about the country far an wide an come round the women wi my tongue an get my dinner hot at the public lors it ud be a lovely life Bob paused and then said with defiant decision as if resolutely turning his back on that paradisaic picture But I don t mind about it not a chip An I n changed one o the suvreigns to buy my mother a goose for dinner an I n bought a blue plush wescoat an a sealskin cap for if I meant to be a packman I d do it respectable But I don t mind about it not a chip My yead isn t a turnip an I shall p r aps have a chance o dousing another fire afore long I m a lucky chap So I ll thank you to take the nine suvreigns mister Tom and set yoursen up with em somehow if it s true as the master s broke They mayn t go fur enough but they ll help Tom was touched keenly enough to forget his pride and suspicion You re a very kind fellow Bob he said coloring with that little diffident tremor in his voice which gave a certain charm even to Tom s pride and severity and I sha n t forget you again though I didn t know you this evening But I can t take the nine sovereigns I should be taking your little fortune from you and they wouldn t do me much good either Wouldn t they mister Tom said Bob regretfully Now don t say so cause you think I want em I aren t a poor chap My mother gets a good penn orth wi picking feathers an things an if she eats nothin but bread an water it runs to fat An I m such a lucky chap an I doubt you aren t quite so lucky mister Tom th old master isn t anyhow an so you might take a slice o my luck an no harm done Lors I found a leg o pork i the river one day it had tumbled out o one o them round sterned Dutchmen I ll be bound Come think better on it mister Tom for old quinetance sake else I shall think you bear me a grudge Bob pushed the sovereigns forward but before Tom could speak Maggie clasping her hands and looking penitently at Bob said Oh I m so sorry Bob I never thought you were so good Why I think you re the kindest person in the world Bob had not been aware of the injurious opinion for which Maggie was performing an inward act of penitence but he smiled with pleasure at this handsome eulogy especially from a young lass who as he informed his mother that evening had such uncommon eyes they looked somehow as they made him feel nohow No indeed Bob I can t take them said Tom but don t think I feel your kindness less because I say no I don t want to take anything from anybody but to work my own way And those sovereigns wouldn t help me much they wouldn t really if I were to take them Let me shake hands with you instead Tom put out his pink palm and Bob was not slow to place his hard grimy hand within it Let me put the sovereigns in the bag again

3196-151981-0000	train-other-500	The days passed and mister Tulliver showed at least to the eyes of the medical man stronger and stronger symptoms of a gradual return to his normal condition the paralytic obstruction was little by little losing its tenacity
3196-151981-0001	train-other-500	and the mind was rising from under it with fitful struggles like a living creature making its way from under a great snowdrift that slides and slides again and shuts up the newly made opening Time would have seemed to creep to the watchers by the bed
3196-151981-0002	train-other-500	if it had only been measured by the doubtful distant hope which kept count of the moments within the chamber but it was measured for them by a fast approaching dread which made the nights come too quickly
3196-151981-0003	train-other-500	While mister Tulliver was slowly becoming himself again his lot was hastening toward its moment of most palpable change The taxing masters had done their work like any respectable gunsmith conscientiously preparing the musket that duly pointed by a brave arm will spoil a life or two
3196-151981-0004	train-other-500	Allocaturs filing of bills in Chancery decrees of sale are legal chain shot or bomb shells that can never hit a solitary mark but must fall with widespread shattering So deeply inherent is it in this life of ours that men have to suffer for each other s sins
3196-151981-0005	train-other-500	so inevitably diffusive is human suffering that even justice makes its victims and we can conceive no retribution that does not spread beyond its mark in pulsations of unmerited pain By the beginning of the second week in January the bills were out advertising the sale
3196-151981-0006	train-other-500	under a decree of Chancery of mister Tulliver s farming and other stock to be followed by a sale of the mill and land held in the proper after dinner hour at the Golden Lion
3196-151981-0007	train-other-500	The miller himself unaware of the lapse of time fancied himself still in that first stage of his misfortunes when expedients might be thought of and often in his conscious hours talked in a feeble disjointed manner of plans he would carry out when he got well
3196-151981-0008	train-other-500	The wife and children were not without hope of an issue that would at least save mister Tulliver from leaving the old spot and seeking an entirely strange life For uncle Deane had been induced to interest himself in this stage of the business
none	none	 It would not he acknowledged be a bad speculation for Guest company to buy Dorlcote Mill and carry on the business which was a good one and might be increased by the addition of steam power in which case Tulliver might be retained as manager Still mister Deane would say nothing decided about the matter the fact that Wakem held the mortgage on the land might put it into his head to bid for the whole estate and further to outbid the cautious firm of Guest company who did not carry on business on sentimental grounds mister Deane was obliged to tell missus Tulliver something to that effect when he rode over to the mill to inspect the books in company with missus Glegg for she had observed that if Guest company would only think about it mister Tulliver s father and grandfather had been carrying on Dorlcote Mill 
3196-151981-0012	train-other-500	long before the oil mill of that firm had been so much as thought of mister Deane in reply doubted whether that was precisely the relation between the two mills which would determine their value as investments As for uncle Glegg the thing lay quite beyond his imagination
3196-151981-0013	train-other-500	the good natured man felt sincere pity for the Tulliver family but his money was all locked up in excellent mortgages and he could run no risk that would be unfair to his own relatives but he had made up his mind that Tulliver should have some new flannel waistcoats
none	none	 which he had himself renounced in favor of a more elastic commodity and that he would buy missus Tulliver a pound of tea now and then it would be a journey which his benevolence delighted in beforehand to carry the tea and see her pleasure on being assured it was the best black Still it was clear that mister Deane was kindly disposed toward the Tullivers 
3196-151981-0014	train-other-500	One day he had brought Lucy who was come home for the Christmas holidays and the little blond angel head had pressed itself against Maggie s darker cheek with many kisses and some tears These fair slim daughters keep up a tender spot in the heart of many a respectable partner in a respectable firm
3196-151981-0015	train-other-500	and perhaps Lucy s anxious pitying questions about her poor cousins helped to make uncle Deane more prompt in finding Tom a temporary place in the warehouse and in putting him in the way of getting evening lessons in book keeping and calculation
3196-151981-0016	train-other-500	That might have cheered the lad and fed his hopes a little if there had not come at the same time the much dreaded blow of finding that his father must be a bankrupt after all at least the creditors must be asked to take less than their due which to Tom s untechnical mind was the same thing as bankruptcy
3196-151981-0017	train-other-500	His father must not only be said to have lost his property but to have failed the word that carried the worst obloquy to Tom s mind For when the defendant s claim for costs had been satisfied there would remain the friendly bill of mister Gore and the deficiency at the bank as well as the other debts
3196-151981-0018	train-other-500	which would make the assets shrink into unequivocal disproportion not more than ten or twelve shillings in the pound predicted mister Deane in a decided tone tightening his lips and the words fell on Tom like a scalding liquied leaving a continual smart
3196-151981-0019	train-other-500	He was sadly in want of something to keep up his spirits a little in the unpleasant newness of his position
none	none	 suddenly transported from the easy carpeted ennui of study hours at mister Stelling s 
3196-151981-0020	train-other-500	and the busy idleness of castle building in a last half at school to the companionship of sacks and hides and bawling men thundering down heavy weights at his elbow The first step toward getting on in the world was a chill dusty noisy affair
3196-151981-0021	train-other-500	and implied going without one s tea in order to stay in saint Ogg s and have an evening lesson from a one armed elderly clerk in a room smelling strongly of bad tobacco Tom s young pink and white face had its colors very much deadened by the time he took off his hat at home
3196-151981-0022	train-other-500	and sat down with keen hunger to his supper No wonder he was a little cross if his mother or Maggie spoke to him But all this while missus Tulliver was brooding over a scheme by which she and no one else would avert the result most to be dreaded
3196-151981-0023	train-other-500	and prevent Wakem from entertaining the purpose of bidding for the mill Imagine a truly respectable and amiable hen by some portentous anomaly taking to reflection and inventing combinations by which she might prevail on Hodge not to wring her neck or send her and her chicks to market
3196-151981-0024	train-other-500	the result could hardly be other than much cackling and fluttering missus Tulliver seeing that everything had gone wrong had begun to think she had been too passive in life and that if she had applied her mind to business and taken a strong resolution now and then
none	none	 it would have been all the better for her and her family 
3196-151981-0025	train-other-500	Nobody it appeared had thought of going to speak to Wakem on this business of the mill and yet missus Tulliver reflected
none	none	 it would have been quite the shortest method of securing the right end It would have been of no use to be sure for mister Tulliver to go 
3196-151981-0026	train-other-500	even if he had been able and willing for he had been going to law against Wakem and abusing him for the last ten years
none	none	 Wakem was always likely to have a spite against him 
3196-151981-0027	train-other-500	And now that missus Tulliver had come to the conclusion that her husband was very much in the wrong to bring her into this trouble she was inclined to think that his opinion of Wakem was wrong too To be sure Wakem had put the bailies in the house and sold them up but she supposed he did that to please the man that lent mister Tulliver the money
3196-151981-0028	train-other-500	for a lawyer had more folks to please than one and he wasn t likely to put mister Tulliver who had gone to law with him above everybody else in the world
none	none	 The attorney might be a very reasonable man why not He had married a Miss Clint 
3196-151981-0029	train-other-500	and at the time missus Tulliver had heard of that marriage the summer when she wore her blue satin spencer and had not yet any thoughts of mister Tulliver she knew no harm of Wakem And certainly toward herself whom he knew to have been a Miss Dodson it was out of all possibility that he could entertain anything but good will
3196-151981-0030	train-other-500	when it was once brought home to his observation that she for her part had never wanted to go to law and indeed was at present disposed to take mister Wakem s view of all subjects rather than her husband s In fact if that attorney saw a respectable matron like herself disposed to give him good words
3196-151981-0031	train-other-500	why shouldn t he listen to her representations For she would put the matter clearly before him which had never been done yet And he would never go and bid for the mill on purpose to spite her an innocent woman who thought it likely enough that she had danced with him in their youth at Squire Darleigh s
3196-151981-0032	train-other-500	for at those big dances she had often and often danced with young men whose names she had forgotten missus Tulliver hid these reasonings in her own bosom for when she had thrown out a hint to mister Deane and mister Glegg that she wouldn t mind going to speak to Wakem herself they had said
3196-151981-0033	train-other-500	No no no and Pooh pooh and Let Wakem alone in the tone of men who were not likely to give a candid attention to a more definite exposition of her project still less dared she mention the plan to Tom and Maggie for the children were always so against everything their mother said and Tom she observed
3196-151981-0034	train-other-500	was almost as much set against Wakem as his father was But this unusual concentration of thought naturally gave missus Tulliver an unusual power of device and determination and a day or two before the sale to be held at the Golden Lion
3196-151981-0035	train-other-500	when there was no longer any time to be lost she carried out her plan by a stratagem There were pickles in question a large stock of pickles and ketchup which missus Tulliver possessed
none	none	 and which mister Hyndmarsh the grocer would certainly purchase if she could transact the business in a personal interview 
3196-151981-0036	train-other-500	so she would walk with Tom to saint Ogg s that morning and when Tom urged that she might let the pickles be at present he didn t like her to go about just yet she appeared so hurt at this conduct in her son contradicting her about pickles which she had made after the family receipts inherited from his own grandmother
3196-151981-0037	train-other-500	who had died when his mother was a little girl that he gave way and they walked together until she turned toward Danish Street where mister Hyndmarsh retailed his grocery not far from the offices of mister Wakem That gentleman was not yet come to his office
3196-151981-0038	train-other-500	would missus Tulliver sit down by the fire in his private room and wait for him She had not long to wait before the punctual attorney entered knitting his brow with an examining glance at the stout blond woman who rose curtsying deferentially
3196-151981-0039	train-other-500	a tallish man with an aquiline nose and abundant iron gray hair You have never seen mister Wakem before and are possibly wondering whether he was really as eminent a rascal and as crafty bitter an enemy of honest humanity in general and of mister Tulliver in particular
none	none	 as he is represented to be in that eidolon 
3196-151981-0040	train-other-500	or portrait of him which we have seen to exist in the miller s mind It is clear that the irascible miller was a man to interpret any chance shot that grazed him as an attempt on his own life and was liable to entanglements in this puzzling world which due consideration had to his own infallibility
3196-151981-0041	train-other-500	required the hypothesis of a very active diabolical agency to explain them It is still possible to believe that the attorney was not more guilty toward him than an ingenious machine which performs its work with much regularity is guilty toward the rash man who
3196-151981-0042	train-other-500	venturing too near it is caught up by some fly wheel or other and suddenly converted into unexpected mince meat But it is really impossible to decide this question by a glance at his person the lines and lights of the human countenance are like other symbols not always easy to read without a key
3196-151981-0043	train-other-500	On an a priori view of Wakem s aquiline nose which offended mister Tulliver there was not more rascality than in the shape of his stiff shirt collar though this too along with his nose might have become fraught with damnatory meaning when once the rascality was ascertained missus Tulliver I think said mister Wakem
3196-151981-0044	train-other-500	Yes sir Miss Elizabeth Dodson as was Pray be seated You have some business with me Well sir yes said missus Tulliver beginning to feel alarmed at her own courage now she was really in presence of the formidable man
3196-151981-0045	train-other-500	and reflecting that she had not settled with herself how she should begin mister Wakem felt in his waistcoat pockets and looked at her in silence I hope sir she began at last I hope sir you re not a thinking as I bear you any ill will because o my husband s losing his lawsuit
3196-151981-0046	train-other-500	and the bailies being put in and the linen being sold oh dear for I wasn t brought up in that way I m sure you remember my father sir for he was close friends with Squire Darleigh and we allays went to the dances there the Miss Dodsons
3196-151981-0047	train-other-500	nobody could be more looked on and justly for there was four of us and you re quite aware as missus Glegg and missus Deane are my sisters And as for going to law and losing money and having sales before you re dead I never saw anything o that before I was married nor for a long while after
none	none	 And I m not to be answerable for my bad luck i marrying out o my own family into one where the goings on was different And as for being drawn in t abuse you as other folks abuse you sir that I niver was and nobody can say it of me 
3196-151981-0048	train-other-500	missus Tulliver shook her head a little and looked at the hem of her pocket handkerchief I ve no doubt of what you say missus Tulliver said mister Wakem with cold politeness But you have some question to ask me
none	none	 Well sir yes But that s what I ve said to myself 
3196-151981-0049	train-other-500	I ve said you d had some nat ral feeling
none	none	 and as for my husband as hasn t been himself for this two months I m not a defending him in no way for being so hot about th erigation 
3196-151981-0050	train-other-500	not but what there s worse men for he never wronged nobody of a shilling nor a penny not willingly
none	none	 and as for his fieriness and lawing what could I do And him struck as if it was with death when he got the letter as said you d the hold upo the land 
3196-151981-0051	train-other-500	But I can t believe but what you ll behave as a gentleman What does all this mean missus Tulliver said mister Wakem rather sharply What do you want to ask me
none	none	 Why sir if you ll be so good said missus Tulliver starting a little and speaking more hurriedly 
3196-151981-0052	train-other-500	if you ll be so good not to buy the mill an the land
none	none	 the land wouldn t so much matter only my husband ull be like mad at your having it 
3196-151981-0053	train-other-500	Something like a new thought flashed across mister Wakem s face as he said Who told you I meant to buy it Why sir it s none o my inventing
none	none	 and I should never ha thought of it 
3196-151981-0054	train-other-500	for my husband as ought to know about the law he allays used to say as lawyers had never no call to buy anything either lands or houses
none	none	 for they allays got em into their hands other ways 
3196-151981-0055	train-other-500	An I should think that ud be the way with you sir and I niver said as you d be the man to do contrairy to that Ah well who was it that did say so said Wakem opening his desk and moving things about with the accompaniment of an almost inaudible whistle
none	none	 Why sir it was mister Glegg and mister Deane as have all the management and mister Deane thinks as Guest company ud buy the mill and let mister Tulliver work it for em if you didn t bid for it and raise the price And it ud be such a thing for my husband to stay where he is if he could get his living 
3196-151981-0056	train-other-500	for it was his father s before him the mill was and his grandfather built it though I wasn t fond o the noise of it when first I was married for there was no mills in our family not the Dodson s
none	none	 and if I d known as the mills had so much to do with the law it wouldn t have been me as ud have been the first Dodson to marry one 
3196-151981-0057	train-other-500	but I went into it blindfold that I did erigation and everything
none	none	 What Guest company would keep the mill in their own hands I suppose and pay your husband wages 
3196-151981-0058	train-other-500	Oh dear sir it s hard to think of said poor missus Tulliver a little tear making its way
none	none	 as my husband should take wage But it ud look more like what used to be to stay at the mill than to go anywhere else 
3196-151981-0059	train-other-500	and if you ll only think if you was to bid for the mill and buy it my husband might be struck worse than he was before and niver get better again as he s getting now Well but if I bought the mill and allowed your husband to act as my manager in the same way how then said mister Wakem
3196-151981-0060	train-other-500	Oh sir I doubt he could niver be got to do it not if the very mill stood still to beg and pray of him For your name s like poison to him it s so as never was and he looks upon it as you ve been the ruin of him all along ever since you set the law on him about the road through the meadow
none	none	 that s eight year ago and he s been going on ever since 
3196-151981-0061	train-other-500	as I ve allays told him he was wrong He s a pig headed foul mouthed fool burst out mister Wakem forgetting himself Oh dear sir said missus Tulliver frightened at a result so different from the one she had fixed her mind on
3196-151981-0062	train-other-500	I wouldn t wish to contradict you but it s like enough he s changed his mind with this illness he s forgot a many things he used to talk about
none	none	 And you wouldn t like to have a corpse on your mind if he was to die and they do say as it s allays unlucky when Dorlcote Mill changes hands 
3196-151981-0063	train-other-500	and the water might all run away and then not as I m wishing you any ill luck sir for I forgot to tell you as I remember your wedding as if it was yesterday missus Wakem was a Miss Clint I know that
none	none	 and my boy as there isn t a nicer handsomer straighter boy nowhere went to school with your son mister Wakem rose opened the door and called to one of his clerks 
3196-151981-0064	train-other-500	You must excuse me for interrupting you missus Tulliver I have business that must be attended to and I think there is nothing more necessary to be said But if you would bear it in mind sir said missus Tulliver rising and not run against me and my children and I m not denying mister Tulliver s been in the wrong
3196-151981-0065	train-other-500	but he s been punished enough and there s worse men for it s been giving to other folks has been his fault He s done nobody any harm but himself and his family the more s the pity
none	none	 and I go and look at the bare shelves every day and think where all my things used to stand 
3196-151981-0066	train-other-500	Yes yes I ll bear it in mind said mister Wakem hastily looking toward the open door And if you d please not to say as I ve been to speak to you for my son ud be very angry with me for demeaning myself I know he would and I ve trouble enough without being scolded by my children
3196-151981-0067	train-other-500	Poor missus Tulliver s voice trembled a little and she could make no answer to the attorney s good morning but curtsied and walked out in silence Which day is it that Dorlcote Mill is to be sold Where s the bill said mister Wakem to his clerk when they were alone
3196-151981-0068	train-other-500	Next Friday is the day Friday at six o clock Oh just run to Winship s the auctioneer and see if he s at home I have some business for him ask him to come up
none	none	 Although when mister Wakem entered his office that morning he had had no intention of purchasing Dorlcote Mill 
3196-151981-0069	train-other-500	his mind was already made up missus Tulliver had suggested to him several determining motives and his mental glance was very rapid he was one of those men who can be prompt without being rash because their motives run in fixed tracks and they have no need to reconcile conflicting aims
3196-151981-0070	train-other-500	To suppose that Wakem had the same sort of inveterate hatred toward Tulliver that Tulliver had toward him would be like supposing that a pike and a roach can look at each other from a similar point of view The roach necessarily abhors the mode in which the pike gets his living
3196-151981-0071	train-other-500	and the pike is likely to think nothing further even of the most indignant roach than that he is excellent good eating it could only be when the roach choked him that the pike could entertain a strong personal animosity
none	none	 If mister Tulliver had ever seriously injured or thwarted the attorney 
3196-151981-0072	train-other-500	Wakem would not have refused him the distinction of being a special object of his vindictiveness But when mister Tulliver called Wakem a rascal at the market dinner table
none	none	 the attorneys clients were not a whit inclined to withdraw their business from him and if when Wakem himself happened to be present some jocose cattle feeder 
3196-151981-0073	train-other-500	stimulated by opportunity and brandy made a thrust at him by alluding to old ladies wills
none	none	 he maintained perfect sang froid and knew quite well that the majority of substantial men then present were perfectly contented with the fact that Wakem was Wakem 
3196-151981-0074	train-other-500	that is to say a man who always knew the stepping stones that would carry him through very muddy bits of practice A man who had made a large fortune had a handsome house among the trees at Tofton and decidedly the finest stock of port wine in the neighborhood of saint Ogg s
none	none	 was likely to feel himself on a level with public opinion And I am not sure that even honest mister Tulliver himself with his general view of law as a cockpit might not under opposite circumstances have seen a fine appropriateness in the truth that Wakem was Wakem 
3196-151981-0075	train-other-500	since I have understood from persons versed in history that mankind is not disposed to look narrowly into the conduct of great victors when their victory is on the right side Tulliver then could be no obstruction to Wakem on the contrary he was a poor devil whom the lawyer had defeated several times
3196-151981-0076	train-other-500	a hot tempered fellow who would always give you a handle against him
none	none	 Wakem s conscience was not uneasy because he had used a few tricks against the miller why should he hate that unsuccessful plaintiff that pitiable furious bull entangled in the meshes of a net Still among the various excesses to which human nature is subject moralists have never numbered that of being too fond of the people who openly revile us 
3196-151981-0077	train-other-500	The successful Yellow candidate for the borough of Old Topping perhaps feels no pursuant meditative hatred toward the Blue editor who consoles his subscribers with vituperative rhetoric against Yellow men who sell their country and are the demons of private life but he might not be sorry if law and opportunity favored
3196-151981-0078	train-other-500	to kick that Blue editor to a deeper shade of his favorite color Prosperous men take a little vengeance now and then as they take a diversion when it comes easily in their way and is no hindrance to business and such small unimpassioned revenges have an enormous effect in life
3196-151981-0079	train-other-500	running through all degrees of pleasant infliction blocking the fit men out of places and blackening characters in unpremeditated talk Still more to see people who have been only insignificantly offensive to us reduced in life and humiliated without any special effort of ours
3196-151981-0080	train-other-500	is apt to have a soothing flattering influence Providence or some other prince of this world it appears has undertaken the task of retribution for us and really by an agreeable constitution of things our enemies somehow don t prosper
3196-151981-0081	train-other-500	Wakem was not without this parenthetic vindictiveness toward the uncomplimentary miller and now missus Tulliver had put the notion into his head it presented itself to him as a pleasure to do the very thing that would cause mister Tulliver the most deadly mortification and a pleasure of a complex kind
3196-151981-0082	train-other-500	not made up of crude malice but mingling with it the relish of self approbation To see an enemy humiliated gives a certain contentment but this is jejune compared with the highly blent satisfaction of seeing him humiliated by your benevolent action or concession on his behalf
3196-151981-0083	train-other-500	That is a sort of revenge which falls into the scale of virtue and Wakem was not without an intention of keeping that scale respectably filled He had once had the pleasure of putting an old enemy of his into one of the saint Ogg s alms houses to the rebuilding of which he had given a large subscription
none	none	 and here was an opportunity of providing for another by making him his own servant 
3196-151981-0084	train-other-500	Such things give a completeness to prosperity and contribute elements of agreeable consciousness that are not dreamed of by that short sighted overheated vindictiveness which goes out its way to wreak itself in direct injury
none	none	 And Tulliver with his rough tongue filed by a sense of obligation 
3196-151981-0085	train-other-500	would make a better servant than any chance fellow who was cap in hand for a situation Tulliver was known to be a man of proud honesty and Wakem was too acute not to believe in the existence of honesty He was given too observing individuals not to judging of them according to maxims
3196-151981-0086	train-other-500	and no one knew better than he that all men were not like himself Besides he intended to overlook the whole business of land and mill pretty closely
none	none	 he was fond of these practical rural matters But there were good reasons for purchasing Dorlcote Mill quite apart from any benevolent vengeance on the miller It was really a capital investment besides Guest company were going to bid for it mister Guest and mister Wakem were on friendly dining terms and the attorney liked to predominate over a ship owner and mill owner who was a little too loud in the town affairs 
3196-151981-0088	train-other-500	as well as in his table talk For Wakem was not a mere man of business he was considered a pleasant fellow in the upper circles of saint Ogg s chatted amusingly over his port wine
none	none	 did a little amateur farming and had certainly been an excellent husband and father at church when he went there he sat under the handsomest of mural monuments erected to the memory of his wife Most men would have married again under his circumstances but he was said to be more tender to his deformed son 
3196-151981-0089	train-other-500	than most men were to their best shapen offspring Not that mister Wakem had not other sons beside Philip
none	none	 but toward them he held only a chiaroscuro parentage 
3196-151981-0090	train-other-500	and provided for them in a grade of life duly beneath his own In this fact indeed there lay the clenching motive to the purchase of Dorlcote Mill
none	none	 While missus Tulliver was talking it had occurred to the rapid minded lawyer among all the other circumstances of the case 
3196-151981-0091	train-other-500	that this purchase would in a few years to come furnish a highly suitable position for a certain favorite lad whom he meant to bring on in the world These were the mental conditions on which missus Tulliver had undertaken to act persuasively and had failed
none	none	 a fact which may receive some illustration from the remark of a great philosopher that fly fishers fail in preparing their bait so as to make it alluring in the right quarter for want of a due acquaintance with the subjectivity of fishes Chapter VIII Daylight on the Wreck 
3196-151982-0000	train-other-500	It was a clear frosty January day on which mister Tulliver first came downstairs The bright sun on the chestnut boughs and the roofs opposite his window had made him impatiently declare that he would be caged up no longer he thought everywhere would be more cheery under this sunshine than his bedroom
3196-151982-0001	train-other-500	for he knew nothing of the bareness below which made the flood of sunshine importunate
none	none	 as if it had an unfeeling pleasure in showing the empty places and the marks where well known objects once had been The impression on his mind that it was but yesterday when he received the letter from mister Gore 
3196-151982-0002	train-other-500	was so continually implied in his talk and the attempts to convey to him the idea that many weeks had passed and much had happened since then had been so soon swept away by recurrent forgetfulness
none	none	 that even mister Turnbull had begun to despair of preparing him to meet the facts by previous knowledge The full sense of the present could only be imparted gradually by new experience not by mere words which must remain weaker than the impressions left by the old experience 
3196-151982-0003	train-other-500	This resolution to come downstairs was heard with trembling by the wife and children missus Tulliver said Tom must not go to saint Ogg s at the usual hour he must wait and see his father downstairs and Tom complied though with an intense inward shrinking from the painful scene
none	none	 The hearts of all three had been more deeply dejected than ever during the last few days For Guest company had not bought the mill both mill and land had been knocked down to Wakem 
3196-151982-0005	train-other-500	who had been over the premises and had laid before mister Deane and mister Glegg in missus Tulliver s presence his willingness to employ mister Tulliver in case of his recovery as a manager of the business This proposition had occasioned much family debating
none	none	 Uncles and aunts were almost unanimously of opinion 
3196-151982-0006	train-other-500	that such an offer ought not to be rejected when there was nothing in the way but a feeling in mister Tulliver s mind which as neither aunts nor uncles shared it was regarded as entirely unreasonable and childish
3196-151982-0007	train-other-500	indeed as a transferring toward Wakem of that indignation and hatred which mister Tulliver ought properly to have directed against himself for his general quarrelsomeness and his special exhibition of it in going to law Here was an opportunity for mister Tulliver to provide for his wife and daughter
3196-151982-0008	train-other-500	without any assistance from his wife s relations and without that too evident descent into pauperism which makes it annoying to respectable people to meet the degraded member of the family by the wayside mister Tulliver missus Glegg considered must be made to feel when he came to his right mind
3196-151982-0009	train-other-500	that he could never humble himself enough
none	none	 for that had come which she had always foreseen would come of his insolence in time past to them as were the best friends he d got to look to 
3196-151982-0010	train-other-500	mister Glegg and mister Deane were less stern in their views but they both of them thought Tulliver had done enough harm by his hot tempered crotchets and ought to put them out of the question when a livelihood was offered him Wakem showed a right feeling about the matter he had no grudge against Tulliver
3196-151982-0011	train-other-500	Tom had protested against entertaining the proposition He shouldn t like his father to be under Wakem he thought it would look mean spirited
none	none	 but his mother s main distress was the utter impossibility of ever turning mister Tulliver round about Wakem or getting him to hear reason no they would all have to go and live in a pigsty on purpose to spite Wakem 
3196-151982-0012	train-other-500	who spoke so as nobody could be fairer Indeed missus Tulliver s mind was reduced to such confusion by living in this strange medium of unaccountable sorrow against which she continually appealed by asking Oh dear what have I done to deserve worse than other women
none	none	 that Maggie began to suspect her poor mother s wits were quite going 
3196-151982-0013	train-other-500	Tom she said when they were out of their father s room together we must try to make father understand a little of what has happened before he goes downstairs But we must get my mother away She will say something that will do harm
none	none	 Ask Kezia to fetch her down and keep her engaged with something in the kitchen Kezia was equal to the task 
3196-151982-0014	train-other-500	Having declared her intention of staying till the master could get about again wage or no wage she had found a certain recompense in keeping a strong hand over her mistress scolding her for moithering herself and going about all day without changing her cap and looking as if she was mushed
none	none	 Altogether this time of trouble was rather a Saturnalian time to Kezia 
3196-151982-0015	train-other-500	she could scold her betters with unreproved freedom On this particular occasion there were drying clothes to be fetched in she wished to know if one pair of hands could do everything in doors and out and observed that she should have thought it would be good for missus Tulliver to put on her bonnet
3196-151982-0016	train-other-500	and get a breath of fresh air by doing that needful piece of work Poor missus Tulliver went submissively downstairs to be ordered about by a servant was the last remnant of her household dignities she would soon have no servant to scold her
3196-151982-0017	train-other-500	mister Tulliver was resting in his chair a little after the fatigue of dressing and Maggie and Tom were seated near him when Luke entered to ask if he should help master downstairs Ay ay Luke stop a bit sit down said mister Tulliver pointing his stick toward a chair
3196-151982-0018	train-other-500	and looking at him with that pursuant gaze which convalescent persons often have for those who have tended them reminding one of an infant gazing about after its nurse For Luke had been a constant night watcher by his master s bed How s the water now eh Luke said mister Tulliver
3196-151982-0019	train-other-500	Dix hasn t been choking you up again eh No sir it s all right Ay I thought not he won t be in a hurry at that again now Riley s been to settle him That was what I said to Riley yesterday I said
3196-151982-0020	train-other-500	mister Tulliver leaned forward resting his elbows on the armchair and looking on the ground as if in search of something striving after vanishing images like a man struggling against a doze Maggie looked at Tom in mute distress their father s mind was so far off the present
3196-151982-0021	train-other-500	which would by and by thrust itself on his wandering consciousness Tom was almost ready to rush away with that impatience of painful emotion which makes one of the differences between youth and maiden man and woman Father said Maggie laying her hand on his
3196-151982-0022	train-other-500	don t you remember that mister Riley is dead Dead said mister Tulliver sharply looking in her face with a strange examining glance Yes he died of apoplexy nearly a year ago I remember hearing you say you had to pay money for him
3196-151982-0023	train-other-500	and he left his daughters badly off one of them is under teacher at Miss Firniss s where I ve been to school you know Ah said her father doubtfully still looking in her face But as soon as Tom began to speak he turned to look at him with the same inquiring glances
none	none	 as if he were rather surprised at the presence of these two young people Whenever his mind was wandering in the far past he fell into this oblivion of their actual faces they were not those of the lad and the little wench who belonged to that past It s a long while since you had the dispute with Dix father said Tom I remember your talking about it three years ago before I went to school at mister Stelling s 
3196-151982-0024	train-other-500	I ve been at school there three years don t you remember mister Tulliver threw himself backward again losing the childlike outward glance under a rush of new ideas which diverted him from external impressions
none	none	 Ay ay he said after a minute or two I ve paid a deal o money 
3196-151982-0025	train-other-500	I was determined my son should have a good eddication I d none myself and I ve felt the miss of it And he ll want no other fortin that s what I say if Wakem was to get the better of me again The thought of Wakem roused new vibrations
3196-151982-0026	train-other-500	and after a moment s pause he began to look at the coat he had on and to feel in his side pocket
none	none	 Then he turned to Tom and said in his old sharp way Where have they put Gore s letter It was close at hand in a drawer for he had often asked for it before 
3196-151982-0027	train-other-500	You know what there is in the letter father said Tom as he gave it to him To be sure I do said mister Tulliver rather angrily What o that
none	none	 If Furley can t take to the property somebody else can there s plenty o people in the world besides Furley 
3196-151982-0028	train-other-500	But it s hindering my not being well
none	none	 go and tell em to get the horse in the gig Luke I can get down to saint Ogg s well enough 
3196-151982-0029	train-other-500	Gore s expecting me No dear father Maggie burst out entreatingly it s a very long while since all that you ve been ill a great many weeks more than two months everything is changed
none	none	 mister Tulliver looked at them all three alternately with a startled gaze the idea that much had happened of which he knew nothing had often transiently arrested him before 
3196-151982-0030	train-other-500	but it came upon him now with entire novelty Yes father said Tom in answer to the gaze You needn t trouble your mind about business until you are quite well everything is settled about that for the present about the mill and the land and the debts What s settled then said his father angrily
3196-151982-0031	train-other-500	Don t you take on too much bout it sir said Luke You d ha paid iverybody if you could that s what I said to Master Tom
none	none	 I said you d ha paid iverybody if you could 
3196-151982-0032	train-other-500	Good Luke felt after the manner of contented hard working men whose lives have been spent in servitude that sense of natural fitness in rank which made his master s downfall a tragedy to him He was urged in his slow way to say something that would express his share in the family sorrow
3196-151982-0033	train-other-500	and these words which he had used over and over again to Tom when he wanted to decline the full payment of his fifty pounds out of the children s money were the most ready to his tongue They were just the words to lay the most painful hold on his master s bewildered mind
3196-151982-0034	train-other-500	Paid everybody he said with vehement agitation his face flushing and his eye lighting up Why what have they made me a bankrupt Oh father dear father said Maggie who thought that terrible word really represented the fact
3196-151982-0035	train-other-500	bear it well because we love you your children will always love you Tom will pay them all he says he will when he s a man She felt her father beginning to tremble his voice trembled too as he said after a few moments Ay my little wench
3196-151982-0036	train-other-500	but I shall never live twice o er But perhaps you will live to see me pay everybody father said Tom speaking with a great effort Ah my lad said mister Tulliver shaking his head slowly but what s broke can never be whole again it ud be your doing not mine
3196-151982-0037	train-other-500	Then looking up at him You re only sixteen it s an up hill fight for you
none	none	 but you mustn t throw it at your father 
3196-151982-0038	train-other-500	the raskills have been too many for him I ve given you a good eddication that ll start you Something in his throat half choked the last words the flush which had alarmed his children because it had so often preceded a recurrence of paralysis had subsided and his face looked pale and tremulous
3196-151982-0039	train-other-500	Tom said nothing he was still struggling against his inclination to rush away His father remained quiet a minute or two but his mind did not seem to be wandering again Have they sold me up then he said more clamly as if he were possessed simply by the desire to know what had happened
3196-151982-0040	train-other-500	Everything is sold father but we don t know all about the mill and the land yet said Tom anxious to ward off any question leading to the fact that Wakem was the purchaser You must not be surprised to see the room look very bare downstairs father said Maggie but there s your chair and the bureau they re not gone
3196-151982-0041	train-other-500	Let us go help me down Luke I ll go and see everything said mister Tulliver leaning on his stick and stretching out his other hand toward Luke Ay sir said Luke as he gave his arm to his master you ll make up your mind to t a bit better when you ve seen iverything you ll get used to t
3196-151982-0042	train-other-500	That s what my mother says about her shortness o breath she says she s made friends wi t now though she fought again it sore when it just come on Maggie ran on before to see that all was right in the dreary parlor where the fire dulled by the frosty sunshine seemed part of the general shabbiness
3196-151982-0043	train-other-500	She turned her father s chair and pushed aside the table to make an easy way for him and then stood with a beating heart to see him enter and look round for the first time Tom advanced before him carrying the leg rest and stood beside Maggie on the hearth
none	none	 Of those two young hearts Tom s suffered the most unmixed pain for Maggie with all her keen susceptibility yet felt as if the sorrow made larger room for her love to flow in and gave breathing space to her passionate nature No true boy feels that 
3196-151982-0044	train-other-500	he would rather go and slay the Nemean lion or perform any round of heroic labors than endure perpetual appeals to his pity for evils over which he can make no conquest mister Tulliver paused just inside the door
3196-151982-0045	train-other-500	resting on Luke and looking round him at all the bare places which for him were filled with the shadows of departed objects the daily companions of his life His faculties seemed to be renewing their strength from getting a footing on this demonstration of the senses Ah
3196-151982-0046	train-other-500	he said slowly moving toward his chair they ve sold me up they ve sold me up Then seating himself and laying down his stick while Luke left the room he looked round again They ve left the big Bible he said It s got everything in when I was born and married
3196-151982-0047	train-other-500	bring it me Tom The quarto Bible was laid open before him at the fly leaf and while he was reading with slowly travelling eyes missus Tulliver entered the room but stood in mute surprise to find her husband down already and with the great Bible before him
3196-151982-0048	train-other-500	Ah he said looking at a spot where his finger rested my mother was Margaret Beaton she died when she was forty seven hers wasn t a long lived family
none	none	 we re our mother s children Gritty and me are we shall go to our last bed before long 
3196-151982-0049	train-other-500	He seemed to be pausing over the record of his sister s birth and marriage as if it were suggesting new thoughts to him then he suddenly looked up at Tom and said in a sharp tone of alarm They haven t come upo Moss for the money as I lent him have they No father said Tom the note was burnt
3196-151982-0050	train-other-500	mister Tulliver turned his eyes on the page again and presently said Ah Elizabeth Dodson it s eighteen year since I married her Come next Ladyday said missus Tulliver going up to his side and looking at the page Her husband fixed his eyes earnestly on her face
3196-151982-0051	train-other-500	Poor Bessy he said you was a pretty lass then everybody said so and I used to think you kept your good looks rarely But you re sorely aged don t you bear me ill will I meant to do well by you we promised one another for better or for worse
none	none	 But I never thought it ud be so for worse as this said poor missus Tulliver with the strange scared look that had come over her of late 
3196-151982-0052	train-other-500	and my poor father gave me away and to come on so all at once Oh mother said Maggie don t talk in that way No I know you won t let your poor mother speak that s been the way all my life your father never minded what I said
none	none	 it ud have been o no use for me to beg and pray and it ud be no use now not if I was to go down o my hands and knees 
3196-151982-0053	train-other-500	Don t say so Bessy said mister Tulliver whose pride in these first moments of humiliation was in abeyance to the sense of some justice in his wife s reproach It there s anything left as I could do to make you amends I wouldn t say you nay
none	none	 Then we might stay here and get a living and I might keep among my own sisters 
3196-151982-0054	train-other-500	and me been such a good wife to you and never crossed you from week s end to week s end and they all say so
none	none	 they say it ud be nothing but right only you re so turned against Wakem Mother said Tom severely this is not the time to talk about that Let her be said mister Tulliver Say what you mean Bessy Why now the mill and the land s all Wakem s and he s got everything in his hands what s the use o setting your face against him 
3196-151982-0055	train-other-500	when he says you may stay here and speaks as fair as can be and says you may manage the business and have thirty shillings a week and a horse to ride about to market
none	none	 And where have we got to put our heads We must go into one o the cottages in the village and me and my children brought down to that and all because you must set your mind against folks till there s no turning you 
3196-151982-0056	train-other-500	mister Tulliver had sunk back in his chair trembling You may do as you like wi me Bessy he said in a low voice I ve been the bringing of you to poverty this world s too many for me I m nought but a bankrupt it s no use standing up for anything now
none	none	 Father said Tom I don t agree with my mother or my uncles and I don t think you ought to submit to be under Wakem 
3196-151982-0057	train-other-500	I get a pound a week now and you can find something else to do when you get well Say no more Tom say no more I ve had enough for this day
none	none	 Give me a kiss Bessy and let us bear one another no ill will we shall never be young again this world s been too many for me Chapter IX An Item Added to the Family Register That first moment of renunciation and submission was followed by days of violent struggle in the miller s mind as the gradual access of bodily strength brought with it increasing ability to embrace in one view all the conflicting conditions under which he found himself Feeble limbs easily resign themselves to be tethered and when we are subdued by sickness it seems possible to us to fulfil pledges which the old vigor comes back and breaks There were times when poor Tulliver thought the fulfilment of his promise to Bessy was something quite too hard for human nature he had promised her without knowing what she was going to say she might as well have asked him to carry a ton weight on his back But again there were many feelings arguing on her side besides the sense that life had been made hard to her by having married him He saw a possibility by much pinching of saving money out of his salary toward paying a second dividend to his creditors and it would not be easy elsewhere to get a situation such as he could fill He had led an easy life ordering much and working little and had no aptitude for any new business He must perhaps take to day labor and his wife must have help from her sisters a prospect doubly bitter to him now they had let all Bessy s precious things be sold probably because they liked to set her against him by making her feel that he had brought her to that pass He listened to their admonitory talk when they came to urge on him what he was bound to do for poor Bessy s sake with averted eyes that every now and then flashed on them furtively when their backs were turned Nothing but the dread of needing their help could have made it an easier alternative to take their advice But the strongest influence of all was the love of the old premises where he had run about when he was a boy just as Tom had done after him The Tullivers had lived on this spot for generations and he had sat listening on a low stool on winter evenings while his father talked of the old half timbered mill that had been there before the last great floods which damaged it so that his grandfather pulled it down and built the new one It was when he got able to walk about and look at all the old objects that he felt the strain of his clinging affection for the old home as part of his life part of himself He couldn t bear to think of himself living on any other spot than this where he knew the sound of every gate door and felt that the shape and color of every roof and weather stain and broken hillock was good because his growing senses had been fed on them Our instructed vagrancy which was hardly time to linger by the hedgerows but runs away early to the tropics and is at home with palms and banyans which is nourished on books of travel and stretches the theatre of its imagination to the Zambesi can hardly get a dim notion of what an old fashioned man like Tulliver felt for this spot where all his memories centred and where life seemed like a familiar smooth handled tool that the fingers clutch with loving ease And just now he was living in that freshened memory of the far off time which comes to us in the passive hours of recovery from sickness Ay Luke he said one afternoon as he stood looking over the orchard gate I remember the day they planted those apple trees My father was a huge man for planting it was like a merry making to him to get a cart full o young trees and I used to stand i the cold with him and follow him about like a dog Then he turned round and leaning against the gate post looked at the opposite buildings The old mill ud miss me I think Luke There s a story as when the mill changes hands the river s angry I ve heard my father say it many a time There s no telling whether there mayn t be summat in the story for this is a puzzling world and Old Harry s got a finger in it it s been too many for me I know Ay sir said Luke with soothing sympathy what wi the rust on the wheat an the firin o the ricks an that as I ve seen i my time things often looks comical there s the bacon fat wi our last pig run away like butter it leaves nought but a scratchin It s just as if it was yesterday now mister Tulliver went on when my father began the malting I remember the day they finished the malt house I thought summat great was to come of it for we d a plum pudding that day and a bit of a feast and I said to my mother she was a fine dark eyed woman my mother was the little wench ull be as like her as two peas Here mister Tulliver put his stick between his legs and took out his snuff box for the greater enjoyment of this anecdote which dropped from him in fragments as if he every other moment lost narration in vision I was a little chap no higher much than my mother s knee she was sore fond of us children Gritty and me and so I said to her Mother I said shall we have plum pudding every day because o the malt house She used to tell me o that till her dying day She was but a young woman when she died my mother was But it s forty good year since they finished the malt house and it isn t many days out of em all as I haven t looked out into the yard there the first thing in the morning all weathers from year s end to year s end I should go off my head in a new place I should be like as if I d lost my way It s all hard whichever way I look at it the harness ull gall me but it ud be summat to draw along the old road instead of a new un Ay sir said Luke you d be a deal better here nor in some new place I can t abide new places mysen things is allays awk ard narrow wheeled waggins belike and the stiles all another sort an oat cake i some places tow rt th head o the Floss there It s poor work changing your country side But I doubt Luke they ll be for getting rid o Ben and making you do with a lad and I must help a bit wi the mill You ll have a worse place Ne er mind sir said Luke I sha n t plague mysen I n been wi you twenty year an you can t get twenty year wi whistlin for em no more nor you can make the trees grow you mun wait till God A mighty sends em I can t abide new victual nor new faces I can t you niver know but what they ll gripe you The walk was finished in silence after this for Luke had disburthened himself of thoughts to an extent that left his conversational resources quite barren and mister Tulliver had relapsed from his recollections into a painful meditation on the choice of hardships before him Maggie noticed that he was unusually absent that evening at tea and afterward he sat leaning forward in his chair looking at the ground moving his lips and shaking his head from time to time Then he looked hard at missus Tulliver who was knitting opposite him then at Maggie who as she bent over her sewing was intensely conscious of some drama going forward in her father s mind Suddenly he took up the poker and broke the large coal fiercely Dear heart mister Tulliver what can you be thinking of said his wife looking up in alarm it s very wasteful breaking the coal and we ve got hardly any large coal left and I don t know where the rest is to come from I don t think you re quite so well to night are you father said Maggie you seem uneasy Why how is it Tom doesn t come said mister Tulliver impatiently Dear heart is it time I must go and get his supper said missus Tulliver laying down her knitting and leaving the room It s nigh upon half past eight said mister Tulliver He ll be here soon Go go and get the big Bible and open it at the beginning where everything s set down And get the pen and ink Maggie obeyed wondering but her father gave no further orders and only sat listening for Tom s footfall on the gravel apparently irritated by the wind which had risen and was roaring so as to drown all other sounds There was a strange light in his eyes that rather frightened Maggie she began to wish that Tom would come too There he is then said mister Tulliver in an excited way when the knock came at last Maggie went to open the door but her mother came out of the kitchen hurriedly saying Stop a bit Maggie I ll open it missus Tulliver had begun to be a little frightened at her boy but she was jealous of every office others did for him Your supper s ready by the kitchen fire my boy she said as he took off his hat and coat You shall have it by yourself just as you like and I won t speak to you I think my father wants Tom mother said Maggie he must come into the parlor first Tom entered with his usual saddened evening face but his eyes fell immediately on the open Bible and the inkstand and he glanced with a look of anxious surprise at his father who was saying Come come you re late I want you Is there anything the matter father said Tom You sit down all of you said mister Tulliver peremptorily And Tom sit down here I ve got something for you to write i the Bible They all three sat down looking at him He began to speak slowly looking first at his wife I ve made up my mind Bessy and I ll be as good as my word to you There ll be the same grave made for us to lie down in and we mustn t be bearing one another ill will I ll stop in the old place and I ll serve under Wakem and I ll serve him like an honest man there s no Tulliver but what s honest mind that Tom here his voice rose they ll have it to throw up against me as I paid a dividend but it wasn t my fault it was because there s raskills in the world They ve been too many for me and I must give in I ll put my neck in harness for you ve a right to say as I ve brought you into trouble Bessy and I ll serve him as honest as if he was no raskill I m an honest man though I shall never hold my head up no more I m a tree as is broke a tree as is broke He paused and looked on the ground Then suddenly raising his head he said in a louder yet deeper tone But I won t forgive him I know what they say he never meant me any harm That s the way Old Harry props up the rascals He s been at the bottom of everything but he s a fine gentleman I know I know I shouldn t ha gone to law they say But who made it so as there was no arbitratin and no justice to be got It signifies nothing to him I know that he s one o them fine gentlemen as get money by doing business for poorer folks and when he s made beggars of em he ll give em charity I won t forgive him I wish he might be punished with shame till his own son ud like to forget him I wish he may do summat as they d make him work at the treadmill But he won t he s too big a raskill to let the law lay hold on him And you mind this Tom you never forgive him neither if you mean to be my son There ll maybe come a time when you may make him feel it ll never come to me I n got my head under the yoke Now write write it i the Bible Oh father what said Maggie sinking down by his knee pale and trembling It s wicked to curse and bear malice It isn t wicked I tell you said her father fiercely It s wicked as the raskills should prosper it s the Devil s doing Do as I tell you Tom Write What am I to write said Tom with gloomy submission Write as your father Edward Tulliver took service under John Wakem the man as had helped to ruin him because I d promised my wife to make her what amends I could for her

Thomas Tulliver Oh no father dear father said Maggie almost choked with fear You shouldn t make Tom write that Be quiet Maggie said Tom I shall write it Book IV The Valley of Humiliation Chapter I A Variation of Protestantism Unknown to Bossuet Journeying down the Rhone on a summer s day you have perhaps felt the sunshine made dreary by those ruined villages which stud the banks in certain parts of its course telling how the swift river once rose like an angry destroying god sweeping down the feeble generations whose breath is in their nostrils and making their dwellings a desolation Strange contrast you may have thought between the effect produced on us by these dismal remnants of commonplace houses which in their best days were but the sign of a sordid life belonging in all its details to our own vulgar era and the effect produced by those ruins on the castled Rhine which have crumbled and mellowed into such harmony with the green and rocky steeps that they seem to have a natural fitness like the mountain pine nay even in the day when they were built they must have had this fitness as if they had been raised by an earth born race who had inherited from their mighty parent a sublime instinct of form And that was a day of romance If those robber barons were somewhat grim and drunken ogres they had a certain grandeur of the wild beast in them they were forest boars with tusks tearing and rending not the ordinary domestic grunter they represented the demon forces forever in collision with beauty virtue and the gentle uses of life they made a fine contrast in the picture with the wandering minstrel the soft lipped princess the pious recluse and the timid Israelite That was a time of color when the sunlight fell on glancing steel and floating banners a time of adventure and fierce struggle nay of living religious art and religious enthusiasm for were not cathedrals built in those days and did not great emperors leave their Western palaces to die before the infidel strongholds in the sacred East Therefore it is that these Rhine castles thrill me with a sense of poetry they belong to the grand historic life of humanity and raise up for me the vision of an echo But these dead tinted hollow eyed angular skeletons of villages on the Rhone oppress me with the feeling that human life very much of it is a narrow ugly grovelling existence which even calamity does not elevate but rather tends to exhibit in all its bare vulgarity of conception and I have a cruel conviction that the lives these ruins are the traces of were part of a gross sum of obscure vitality that will be swept into the same oblivion with the generations of ants and beavers Perhaps something akin to this oppressive feeling may have weighed upon you in watching this old fashioned family life on the banks of the Floss which even sorrow hardly suffices to lift above the level of the tragi comic It is a sordid life you say this of the Tullivers and Dodsons irradiated by no sublime principles no romantic visions no active self renouncing faith moved by none of those wild uncontrollable passions which create the dark shadows of misery and crime without that primitive rough simplicity of wants that hard submissive ill paid toil that childlike spelling out of what nature has written which gives its poetry to peasant life Here one has conventional worldly notions and habits without instruction and without polish surely the most prosaic form of human life proud respectability in a gig of unfashionable build worldliness without side dishes Observing these people narrowly even when the iron hand of misfortune has shaken them from their unquestioning hold on the world one sees little trace of religion still less of a distinctively Christian creed Their belief in the Unseen so far as it manifests itself at all seems to be rather a pagan kind their moral notions though held with strong tenacity seem to have no standard beyond hereditary custom You could not live among such people you are stifled for want of an outlet toward something beautiful great or noble you are irritated with these dull men and women as a kind of population out of keeping with the earth on which they live with this rich plain where the great river flows forever onward and links the small pulse of the old English town with the beatings of the world s mighty heart A vigorous superstition that lashes its gods or lashes its own back seems to be more congruous with the mystery of the human lot than the mental condition of these emmet like Dodsons and Tullivers I share with you this sense of oppressive narrowness but it is necessary that we should feel it if we care to understand how it acted on the lives of Tom and Maggie how it has acted on young natures in many generations that in the onward tendency of human things have risen above the mental level of the generation before them to which they have been nevertheless tied by the strongest fibres of their hearts The suffering whether of martyr or victim which belongs to every historical advance of mankind is represented in this way in every town and by hundreds of obscure hearths and we need not shrink from this comparison of small things with great for does not science tell us that its highest striving is after the ascertainment of a unity which shall bind the smallest things with the greatest In natural science I have understood there is nothing petty to the mind that has a large vision of relations and to which every single object suggests a vast sum of conditions It is surely the same with the observation of human life Certainly the religious and moral ideas of the Dodsons and Tullivers were of too specific a kind to be arrived at deductively from the statement that they were part of the Protestant population of Great Britain Their theory of life had its core of soundness as all theories must have on which decent and prosperous families have been reared and have flourished but it had the very slightest tincture of theology If in the maiden days of the Dodson sisters their Bibles opened more easily at some parts than others it was because of dried tulip petals which had been distributed quite impartially without preference for the historical devotional or doctrinal Their religion was of a simple semi pagan kind but there was no heresy in it if heresy properly means choice for they didn t know there was any other religion except that of chapel goers which appeared to run in families like asthma How should they know The vicar of their pleasant rural parish was not a controversialist but a good hand at whist and one who had a joke always ready for a blooming female parishioner The religion of the Dodsons consisted in revering whatever was customary and respectable it was necessary to be baptized else one could not be buried in the church yard and to take the sacrament before death as a security against more dimly understood perils but it was of equal necessity to have the proper pall bearers and well cured hams at one s funeral and to leave an unimpeachable will A Dodson would not be taxed with the omission of anything that was becoming or that belonged to that eternal fitness of things which was plainly indicated in the practice of the most substantial parishioners and in the family traditions such as obedience to parents faithfulness to kindred industry rigid honesty thrift the thorough scouring of wooden and copper utensils the hoarding of coins likely to disappear from the currency the production of first rate commodities for the market and the general preference of whatever was home made The Dodsons were a very proud race and their pride lay in the utter frustration of all desire to tax them with a breach of traditional duty or propriety A wholesome pride in many respects since it identified honor with perfect integrity thoroughness of work and faithfulness to admitted rules and society owes some worthy qualities in many of her members to mothers of the Dodson class who made their butter and their fromenty well and would have felt disgraced to make it otherwise To be honest and poor was never a Dodson motto still less to seem rich though being poor rather the family badge was to be honest and rich and not only rich but richer than was supposed To live respected and have the proper bearers at your funeral was an achievement of the ends of existence that would be entirely nullified if on the reading of your will you sank in the opinion of your fellow men either by turning out to be poorer than they expected or by leaving your money in a capricious manner without strict regard to degrees of kin The right thing must always be done toward kindred The right thing was to correct them severely if they were other than a credit to the family but still not to alienate from them the smallest rightful share in the family shoebuckles and other property A conspicuous quality in the Dodson character was its genuineness its vices and virtues alike were phases of a proud honest egoism which had a hearty dislike to whatever made against its own credit and interest and would be frankly hard of speech to inconvenient kin but would never forsake or ignore them would not let them want bread but only require them to eat it with bitter herbs The same sort of traditional belief ran in the Tulliver veins but it was carried in richer blood having elements of generous imprudence warm affection and hot tempered rashness mister Tulliver s grandfather had been heard to say that he was descended from one Ralph Tulliver a wonderfully clever fellow who had ruined himself It is likely enough that the clever Ralph was a high liver rode spirited horses and was very decidedly of his own opinion On the other hand nobody had ever heard of a Dodson who had ruined himself it was not the way of that family If such were the views of life on which the Dodsons and Tullivers had been reared in the praiseworthy past of Pitt and high prices you will infer from what you already know concerning the state of society in saint Ogg s that there had been no highly modifying influence to act on them in their maturer life It was still possible even in that later time of anti Catholic preaching for people to hold many pagan ideas and believe themselves good church people notwithstanding so we need hardly feel any surprise at the fact that mister Tulliver though a regular church goer recorded his vindictiveness on the fly leaf of his Bible It was not that any harm could be said concerning the vicar of that charming rural parish to which Dorlcote Mill belonged he was a man of excellent family an irreproachable bachelor of elegant pursuits had taken honors and held a fellowship mister Tulliver regarded him with dutiful respect as he did everything else belonging to the church service but he considered that church was one thing and common sense another and he wanted nobody to tell him what commonsense was Certain seeds which are required to find a nidus for themselves under unfavorable circumstances have been supplied by nature with an apparatus of hooks so that they will get a hold on very unreceptive surfaces The spiritual seed which had been scattered over mister Tulliver had apparently been destitute of any corresponding provision and had slipped off to the winds again from a total absence of hooks Chapter II The Torn Nest Is Pierced by the Thorns There is something sustaining in the very agitation that accompanies the first shocks of trouble just as an acute pain is often a stimulus and produces an excitement which is transient strength It is in the slow changed life that follows in the time when sorrow has become stale and has no longer an emotive intensity that counteracts its pain in the time when day follows day in dull unexpectant sameness and trial is a dreary routine it is then that despair threatens it is then that the peremptory hunger of the soul is felt and eye and ear are strained after some unlearned secret of our existence which shall give to endurance the nature of satisfaction This time of utmost need was come to Maggie with her short span of thirteen years To the usual precocity of the girl she added that early experience of struggle of conflict between the inward impulse and outward fact which is the lot of every imaginative and passionate nature and the years since she hammered the nails into her wooden Fetish among the worm eaten shelves of the attic had been filled with so eager a life in the triple world of Reality Books and Waking Dreams that Maggie was strangely old for her years in everything except in her entire want of that prudence and self command which were the qualities that made Tom manly in the midst of his intellectual boyishness And now her lot was beginning to have a still sad monotony which threw her more than ever on her inward self Her father was able to attend to business again his affairs were settled and he was acting as Wakem s manager on the old spot Tom went to and fro every morning and evening and became more and more silent in the short intervals at home what was there to say One day was like another and Tom s interest in life driven back and crushed on every other side was concentrating itself into the one channel of ambitious resistance to misfortune The peculiarities of his father and mother were very irksome to him now they were laid bare of all the softening accompaniments of an easy prosperous home for Tom had very clear prosaic eyes not apt to be dimmed by mists of feeling or imagination Poor missus Tulliver it seemed would never recover her old self her placid household activity how could she The objects among which her mind had moved complacently were all gone all the little hopes and schemes and speculations all the pleasant little cares about her treasures which had made the world quite comprehensible to her for a quarter of a century since she had made her first purchase of the sugar tongs had been suddenly snatched away from her and she remained bewildered in this empty life Why that should have happened to her which had not happened to other women remained an insoluble question by which she expressed her perpetual ruminating comparison of the past with the present It was piteous to see the comely woman getting thinner and more worn under a bodily as well as mental restlessness which made her often wander about the empty house after her work was done until Maggie becoming alarmed about her would seek her and bring her down by telling her how it vexed Tom that she was injuring her health by never sitting down and resting herself Yet amidst this helpless imbecility there was a touching trait of humble self devoting maternity which made Maggie feel tenderly toward her poor mother amidst all the little wearing griefs caused by her mental feebleness She would let Maggie do none of the work that was heaviest and most soiling to the hands and was quite peevish when Maggie attempted to relieve her from her grate brushing and scouring Let it alone my dear your hands ull get as hard as hard she would say it s your mother s place to do that I can t do the sewing my eyes fail me And she would still brush and carefully tend Maggie s hair which she had become reconciled to in spite of its refusal to curl now it was so long and massy Maggie was not her pet child and in general would have been much better if she had been quite different yet the womanly heart so bruised in its small personal desires found a future to rest on in the life of this young thing and the mother pleased herself with wearing out her own hands to save the hands that had so much more life in them But the constant presence of her mother s regretful bewilderment was less painful to Maggie than that of her father s sullen incommunicative depression As long as the paralysis was upon him and it seemed as if he might always be in a childlike condition of dependence as long as he was still only half awakened to his trouble Maggie had felt the strong tide of pitying love almost as an inspiration a new power that would make the most difficult life easy for his sake but now instead of childlike dependence there had come a taciturn hard concentration of purpose in strange contrast with his old vehement communicativeness and high spirit and this lasted from day to day and from week to week the dull eye never brightening with any eagerness or any joy It is something cruelly incomprehensible to youthful natures this sombre sameness in middle aged and elderly people whose life has resulted in disappointment and discontent to whose faces a smile becomes so strange that the sad lines all about the lips and brow seem to take no notice of it and it hurries away again for want of a welcome Why will they not kindle up and be glad sometimes thinks young elasticity It would be so easy if they only liked to do it And these leaden clouds that never part are apt to create impatience even in the filial affection that streams forth in nothing but tenderness and pity in the time of more obvious affliction mister Tulliver lingered nowhere away from home he hurried away from market he refused all invitations to stay and chat as in old times in the houses where he called on business He could not be reconciled with his lot There was no attitude in which his pride did not feel its bruises and in all behavior toward him whether kind or cold he detected an allusion to the change in his circumstances Even the days on which Wakem came to ride round the land and inquire into the business were not so black to him as those market days on which he had met several creditors who had accepted a composition from him To save something toward the repayment of those creditors was the object toward which he was now bending all his thoughts and efforts and under the influence of this all compelling demand of his nature the somewhat profuse man who hated to be stinted or to stint any one else in his own house was gradually metamorphosed into the keen eyed grudger of morsels missus Tulliver could not economize enough to satisfy him in their food and firing and he would eat nothing himself but what was of the coarsest quality Tom though depressed and strongly repelled by his father s sullenness and the dreariness of home entered thoroughly into his father s feelings about paying the creditors and the poor lad brought his first quarter s money with a delicious sense of achievement and gave it to his father to put into the tin box which held the savings The little store of sovereigns in the tin box seemed to be the only sight that brought a faint beam of pleasure into the miller s eyes faint and transient for it was soon dispelled by the thought that the time would be long perhaps longer than his life before the narrow savings could remove the hateful incubus of debt A deficit of more than five hundred pounds with the accumulating interest seemed a deep pit to fill with the savings from thirty shillings a week even when Tom s probable savings were to be added On this one point there was entire community of feeling in the four widely differing beings who sat round the dying fire of sticks which made a cheap warmth for them on the verge of bedtime missus Tulliver carried the proud integrity of the Dodsons in her blood and had been brought up to think that to wrong people of their money which was another phrase for debt was a sort of moral pillory it would have been wickedness to her mind to have run counter to her husband s desire to do the right thing and retrieve his name She had a confused dreamy notion that if the creditors were all paid her plate and linen ought to come back to her but she had an inbred perception that while people owed money they were unable to pay they couldn t rightly call anything their own She murmured a little that mister Tulliver so peremptorily refused to receive anything in repayment from mister and missus Moss but to all his requirements of household economy she was submissive to the point of denying herself the cheapest indulgences of mere flavor her only rebellion was to smuggle into the kitchen something that would make rather a better supper than usual for Tom These narrow notions about debt held by the old fashioned Tullivers may perhaps excite a smile on the faces of many readers in these days of wide commercial views and wide philosophy according to which everything rights itself without any trouble of ours The fact that my tradesman is out of pocket by me is to be looked at through the serene certainty that somebody else s tradesman is in pocket by somebody else and since there must be bad debts in the world why it is mere egoism not to like that we in particular should make them instead of our fellow citizens I am telling the history of very simple people who had never had any illuminating doubts as to personal integrity and honor Under all this grim melancholy and narrowing concentration of desire mister Tulliver retained the feeling toward his little wench which made her presence a need to him though it would not suffice to cheer him She was still the desire of his eyes but the sweet spring of fatherly love was now mingled with bitterness like everything else When Maggie laid down her work at night it was her habit to get a low stool and sit by her father s knee leaning her cheek against it How she wished he would stroke her head or give some sign that he was soothed by the sense that he had a daughter who loved him But now she got no answer to her little caresses either from her father or from Tom the two idols of her life Tom was weary and abstracted in the short intervals when he was at home and her father was bitterly preoccupied with the thought that the girl was growing up was shooting up into a woman and how was she to do well in life She had a poor chance for marrying down in the world as they were And he hated the thought of her marrying poorly as her aunt Gritty had done that would be a thing to make him turn in his grave the little wench so pulled down by children and toil as her aunt Moss was When uncultured minds confined to a narrow range of personal experience are under the pressure of continued misfortune their inward life is apt to become a perpetually repeated round of sad and bitter thoughts the same words the same scenes are revolved over and over again the same mood accompanies them the end of the year finds them as much what they were at the beginning as if they were machines set to a recurrent series of movements The sameness of the days was broken by few visitors Uncles and aunts paid only short visits now of course they could not stay to meals and the constraint caused by mister Tulliver s savage silence which seemed to add to the hollow resonance of the bare uncarpeted room when the aunts were talking heightened the unpleasantness of these family visits on all sides and tended to make them rare As for other acquaintances there is a chill air surrounding those who are down in the world and people are glad to get away from them as from a cold room human beings mere men and women without furniture without anything to offer you who have ceased to count as anybody present an embarrassing negation of reasons for wishing to see them or of subjects on which to converse with them At that distant day there was a dreary isolation in the civilized Christian society of these realms for families that had dropped below their original level unless they belonged to a sectarian church which gets some warmth of brotherhood by walling in the sacred fire Chapter III A Voice from the Past One afternoon when the chestnuts were coming into flower Maggie had brought her chair outside the front door and was seated there with a book on her knees Her dark eyes had wandered from the book but they did not seem to be enjoying the sunshine which pierced the screen of jasmine on the projecting porch at her right and threw leafy shadows on her pale round cheek they seemed rather to be searching for something that was not disclosed by the sunshine It had been a more miserable day than usual her father after a visit of Wakem s had had a paroxysm of rage in which for some trifling fault he had beaten the boy who served in the mill Once before since his illness he had had a similar paroxysm in which he had beaten his horse and the scene had left a lasting terror in Maggie s mind The thought had risen that some time or other he might beat her mother if she happened to speak in her feeble way at the wrong moment The keenest of all dread with her was lest her father should add to his present misfortune the wretchedness of doing something irretrievably disgraceful The battered school book of Tom s which she held on her knees could give her no fortitude under the pressure of that dread and again and again her eyes had filled with tears as they wandered vaguely seeing neither the chestnut trees nor the distant horizon but only future scenes of home sorrow Suddenly she was roused by the sound of the opening gate and of footsteps on the gravel It was not Tom who was entering but a man in a sealskin cap and a blue plush waistcoat carrying a pack on his back and followed closely by a bullterrier of brindled coat and defiant aspect Oh Bob it s you said Maggie starting up with a smile of pleased recognition for there had been no abundance of kind acts to efface the recollection of Bob s generosity I m so glad to see you Thank you Miss said Bob lifting his cap and showing a delighted face but immediately relieving himself of some accompanying embarrassment by looking down at his dog and saying in a tone of disgust Get out wi you you thunderin sawney My brother is not at home yet Bob said Maggie he is always at saint Ogg s in the daytime Well Miss said Bob I should be glad to see mister Tom but that isn t just what I m come for look here Bob was in the act of depositing his pack on the door step and with it a row of small books fastened together with string Apparently however they were not the object to which he wished to call Maggie s attention but rather something which he had carried under his arm wrapped in a red handkerchief See here he said again laying the red parcel on the others and unfolding it you won t think I m a makin too free Miss I hope but I lighted on these books and I thought they might make up to you a bit for them as you ve lost for I heared you speak o picturs an as for picturs look here The opening of the red handkerchief had disclosed a superannuated Keepsake and six or seven numbers of a Portrait Gallery in royal octavo and the emphatic request to look referred to a portrait of George the Fourth in all the majesty of his depressed cranium and voluminous neckcloth There s all sorts o genelmen here Bob went on turning over the leaves with some excitement wi all sorts o nones an some bald an some wi wigs Parlament genelmen I reckon An here he added opening the Keepsake here s ladies for you some wi curly hair and some wi smooth an some a smiling wi their heads o one side an some as if they were goin to cry look here a sittin on the ground out o door dressed like the ladies I n seen get out o the carriages at the balls in th Old Hall there My eyes I wonder what the chaps wear as go a courtin em I sot up till the clock was gone twelve last night a lookin at em I did till they stared at me out o the picturs as if they d know when I spoke to em But lors I shouldn t know what to say to em They ll be more fittin company for you Miss and the man at the book stall he said they banged iverything for picturs he said they was a fust rate article And you ve bought them for me Bob said Maggie deeply touched by this simple kindness How very very good of you But I m afraid you gave a great deal of money for them Not me said Bob I d ha gev three times the money if they ll make up to you a bit for them as was sold away from you Miss For I n niver forgot how you looked when you fretted about the books bein gone it s stuck by me as if it was a pictur hingin before me An when I see d the book open upo the stall wi the lady lookin out of it wi eyes a bit like your n when you was frettin you ll excuse my takin the liberty Miss I thought I d make free to buy it for you an then I bought the books full o genelmen to match an then here Bob took up the small stringed packet of books I thought you might like a bit more print as well as the picturs an I got these for a sayso they re cram full o print an I thought they d do no harm comin along wi these bettermost books An I hope you won t say me nay an tell me as you won t have em like mister Tom did wi the suvreigns No indeed Bob said Maggie I m very thankful to you for thinking of me and being so good to me and Tom I don t think any one ever did such a kind thing for me before I haven t many friends who care for me Hev a dog Miss they re better friends nor any Christian said Bob laying down his pack again which he had taken up with the intention of hurrying away for he felt considerable shyness in talking to a young lass like Maggie though as he usually said of himself his tongue overrun him when he began to speak I can t give you Mumps cause he d break his heart to go away from me eh Mumps what do you say you riff raff Mumps declined to express himself more diffusely than by a single affirmative movement of his tail But I d get you a pup Miss an welcome No thank you Bob We have a yard dog and I mayn t keep a dog of my own Eh that s a pity else there s a pup if you didn t mind about it not being thoroughbred its mother acts in the Punch show an uncommon sensible bitch she means more sense wi her bark nor half the chaps can put into their talk from breakfast to sundown There s one chap carries pots a poor low trade as any on the road he says Why Toby s nought but a mongrel there s nought to look at in her But I says to him Why what are you yoursen but a mongrel There wasn t much pickin o your feyther an mother to look at you Not but I like a bit o breed myself but I can t abide to see one cur grinnin at another I wish you good evenin Miss said Bob abruptly taking up his pack again under the consciousness that his tongue was acting in an undisciplined manner Won t you come in the evening some time and see my brother Bob said Maggie Yes Miss thank you another time You ll give my duty to him if you please Eh he s a fine growed chap mister Tom is he took to growin i the legs an I didn t The pack was down again now the hook of the stick having somehow gone wrong You don t call Mumps a cur I suppose said Maggie divining that any interest she showed in Mumps would be gratifying to his master No Miss a fine way off that said Bob with pitying smile Mumps is as fine a cross as you ll see anywhere along the Floss an I n been up it wi the barge times enow Why the gentry stops to look at him but you won t catch Mumps a looking at the gentry much he minds his own business he does The expression of Mump s face which seemed to be tolerating the superfluous existence of objects in general was strongly confirmatory of this high praise He looks dreadfully surly said Maggie Would he let me pat him Ay that would he and thank you He knows his company Mumps does He isn t a dog as ull be caught wi gingerbread he d smell a thief a good deal stronger nor the gingerbread he would Lors I talk to him by th hour together when I m walking i lone places and if I n done a bit o mischief I allays tell him I n got no secrets but what Mumps knows em He knows about my big thumb he does Your big thumb what s that Bob said Maggie That s what it is Miss said Bob quickly exhibiting a singularly broad specimen of that difference between the man and the monkey It tells i measuring out the flannel you see I carry flannel cause it s light for my pack an it s dear stuff you see so a big thumb tells I clap my thumb at the end o the yard and cut o the hither side of it and the old women aren t up to t But Bob said Maggie looking serious that s cheating I don t like to hear you say that Don t you Miss said Bob regretfully Then I m sorry I said it But I m so used to talking to Mumps an he doesn t mind a bit o cheating when it s them skinflint women as haggle an haggle an ud like to get their flannel for nothing an ud niver ask theirselves how I got my dinner out on t I niver cheat anybody as doesn t want to cheat me Miss lors I m a honest chap I am only I must hev a bit o sport an now I don t go wi th ferrets I n got no varmint to come over but them haggling women I wish you good evening Miss Good by Bob Thank you very much for bringing me the books And come again to see Tom Yes Miss said Bob moving on a few steps then turning half round he said I ll leave off that trick wi my big thumb if you don t think well on me for it Miss but it ud be a pity it would I couldn t find another trick so good an what ud be the use o havin a big thumb It might as well ha been narrow Maggie thus exalted into Bob s exalting Madonna laughed in spite of herself at which her worshipper s blue eyes twinkled too and under these favoring auspices he touched his cap and walked away The days of chivalry are not gone notwithstanding Burke s grand dirge over them they live still in that far off worship paid by many a youth and man to the woman of whom he never dreams that he shall touch so much as her little finger or the hem of her robe Bob with the pack on his back had as respectful an adoration for this dark eyed maiden as if he had been a knight in armor calling aloud on her name as he pricked on to the fight That gleam of merriment soon died away from Maggie s face and perhaps only made the returning gloom deeper by contrast She was too dispirited even to like answering questions about Bob s present of books and she carried them away to her bedroom laying them down there and seating herself on her one stool without caring to look at them just yet She leaned her cheek against the window frame and thought that the light hearted Bob had a lot much happier than hers Maggie s sense of loneliness and utter privation of joy had deepened with the brightness of advancing spring All the favorite outdoor nooks about home which seemed to have done their part with her parents in nurturing and cherishing her were now mixed up with the home sadness and gathered no smile from the sunshine Every affection every delight the poor child had had was like an aching nerve to her There was no music for her any more no piano no harmonized voices no delicious stringed instruments with their passionate cries of imprisoned spirits sending a strange vibration through her frame And of all her school life there was nothing left her now but her little collection of school books which she turned over with a sickening sense that she knew them all and they were all barren of comfort Even at school she had often wished for books with more in them everything she learned there seemed like the ends of long threads that snapped immediately And now without the indirect charm of school emulation Telemaque was mere bran so were the hard dry questions on Christian Doctrine there was no flavor in them no strength Sometimes Maggie thought she could have been contented with absorbing fancies if she could have had all Scott s novels and all Byron s poems then perhaps she might have found happiness enough to dull her sensibility to her actual daily life And yet they were hardly what she wanted She could make dream worlds of her own but no dream world would satisfy her now She wanted some explanation of this hard real life the unhappy looking father seated at the dull breakfast table the childish bewildered mother the little sordid tasks that filled the hours or the more oppressive emptiness of weary joyless leisure the need of some tender demonstrative love the cruel sense that Tom didn t mind what she thought or felt and that they were no longer playfellows together the privation of all pleasant things that had come to her more than to others she wanted some key that would enable her to understand and in understanding to endure the heavy weight that had fallen on her young heart If she had been taught real learning and wisdom such as great men knew she thought she should have held the secrets of life if she had only books that she might learn for herself what wise men knew Saints and martyrs had never interested Maggie so much as sages and poets She knew little of saints and martyrs and had gathered as a general result of her teaching that they were a temporary provision against the spread of Catholicism and had all died at Smithfield In one of these meditations it occurred to her that she had forgotten Tom s school books which had been sent home in his trunk But she found the stock unaccountably shrunk down to the few old ones which had been well thumbed the Latin Dictionary and Grammar a Delectus a torn Eutropius the well worn Virgil Aldrich s Logic and the exasperating Euclid Still Latin Euclid and Logic would surely be a considerable step in masculine wisdom in that knowledge which made men contented and even glad to live Not that the yearning for effectual wisdom was quite unmixed a certain mirage would now and then rise on the desert of the future in which she seemed to see herself honored for her surprising attainments And so the poor child with her soul s hunger and her illusions of self flattery began to nibble at this thick rinded fruit of the tree of knowledge filling her vacant hours with Latin geometry and the forms of the syllogism and feeling a gleam of triumph now and then that her understanding was quite equal to these peculiarly masculine studies For a week or two she went on resolutely enough though with an occasional sinking of heart as if she had set out toward the Promised Land alone and found it a thirsty trackless uncertain journey In the severity of her early resolution she would take Aldrich out into the fields and then look off her book toward the sky where the lark was twinkling or to the reeds and bushes by the river from which the waterfowl rustled forth on its anxious awkward flight with a startled sense that the relation between Aldrich and this living world was extremely remote for her The discouragement deepened as the days went on and the eager heart gained faster and faster on the patient mind Somehow when she sat at the window with her book her eyes would fix themselves blankly on the outdoor sunshine then they would fill with tears and sometimes if her mother was not in the room the studies would all end in sobbing She rebelled against her lot she fainted under its loneliness and fits even of anger and hatred toward her father and mother who were so unlike what she would have them to be toward Tom who checked her and met her thought or feeling always by some thwarting difference would flow out over her affections and conscience like a lava stream and frighten her with a sense that it was not difficult for her to become a demon Then her brain would be busy with wild romances of a flight from home in search of something less sordid and dreary she would go to some great man Walter Scott perhaps and tell him how wretched and how clever she was and he would surely do something for her But in the middle of her vision her father would perhaps enter the room for the evening and surprised that she sat still without noticing him would say complainingly Come am I to fetch my slippers myself The voice pierced through Maggie like a sword there was another sadness besides her own and she had been thinking of turning her back on it and forsaking it This afternoon the sight of Bob s cheerful freckled face had given her discontent a new direction She thought it was part of the hardship of her life that there was laid upon her the burthen of larger wants than others seemed to feel that she had to endure this wide hopeless yearning for that something whatever it was that was greatest and best on this earth She wished she could have been like Bob with his easily satisfied ignorance or like Tom who had something to do on which he could fix his mind with a steady purpose and disregard everything else Poor child as she leaned her head against the window frame with her hands clasped tighter and tighter and her foot beating the ground she was as lonely in her trouble as if she had been the only girl in the civilized world of that day who had come out of her school life with a soul untrained for inevitable struggles with no other part of her inherited share in the hard won treasures of thought which generations of painful toil have laid up for the race of men than shreds and patches of feeble literature and false history with much futile information about Saxon and other kings of doubtful example but unhappily quite without that knowledge of the irreversible laws within and without her which governing the habits becomes morality and developing the feelings of submission and dependence becomes religion as lonely in her trouble as if every other girl besides herself had been cherished and watched over by elder minds not forgetful of their own early time when need was keen and impulse strong At last Maggie s eyes glanced down on the books that lay on the window shelf and she half forsook her reverie to turn over listlessly the leaves of the Portrait Gallery but she soon pushed this aside to examine the little row of books tied together with string Beauties of the Spectator Rasselas Economy of Human Life Gregory s Letters she knew the sort of matter that was inside all these the Christian Year that seemed to be a hymnbook and she laid it down again but Thomas a Kempis the name had come across her in her reading and she felt the satisfaction which every one knows of getting some ideas to attach to a name that strays solitary in the memory She took up the little old clumsy book with some curiosity it had the corners turned down in many places and some hand now forever quiet had made at certain passages strong pen and ink marks long since browned by time Maggie turned from leaf to leaf and read where the quiet hand pointed Know that the love of thyself doth hurt thee more than anything in the world If thou seekest this or that and wouldst be here or there to enjoy thy own will and pleasure thou shalt never be quiet nor free from care for in everything somewhat will be wanting and in every place there will be some that will cross thee Both above and below which way soever thou dost turn thee everywhere thou shalt find the Cross and everywhere of necessity thou must have patience if thou wilt have inward peace and enjoy an everlasting crown If thou desirest to mount unto this height thou must set out courageously and lay the axe to the root that thou mayest pluck up and destroy that hidden inordinate inclination to thyself and unto all private and earthly good On this sin that a man inordinately loveth himself almost all dependeth whatsoever is thoroughly to be overcome which evil being once overcome and subdued there will presently ensue great peace and tranquillity It is but little thou sufferest in comparison of them that have suffered so much were so strongly tempted so grievously afflicted so many ways tried and exercised Thou oughtest therefore to call to mind the more heavy sufferings of others that thou mayest the easier bear thy little adversities And if they seem not little unto thee beware lest thy impatience be the cause thereof Blessed are those ears that receive the whispers of the divine voice and listen not to the whisperings of the world Blessed are those ears which hearken not unto the voice which soundeth outwardly but unto the Truth which teacheth inwardly A strange thrill of awe passed through Maggie while she read as if she had been wakened in the night by a strain of solemn music telling of beings whose souls had been astir while hers was in stupor She went on from one brown mark to another where the quiet hand seemed to point hardly conscious that she was reading seeming rather to listen while a low voice said Why dost thou here gaze about since this is not the place of thy rest In heaven ought to be thy dwelling and all earthly things are to be looked on as they forward thy journey thither All things pass away and thou together with them Beware thou cleavest not unto them lest thou be entangled and perish If a man should give all his substance yet it is as nothing And if he should do great penances yet are they but little And if he should attain to all knowledge he is yet far off And if he should be of great virtue and very fervent devotion yet is there much wanting to wit one thing which is most necessary for him What is that That having left all he leave himself and go wholly out of himself and retain nothing of self love I have often said unto thee and now again I say the same Forsake thyself resign thyself and thou shalt enjoy much inward peace Then shall all vain imaginations evil perturbations and superfluous cares fly away then shall immoderate fear leave thee and inordinate love shall die Maggie drew a long breath and pushed her heavy hair back as if to see a sudden vision more clearly Here then was a secret of life that would enable her to renounce all other secrets here was a sublime height to be reached without the help of outward things here was insight and strength and conquest to be won by means entirely within her own soul where a supreme Teacher was waiting to be heard It flashed through her like the suddenly apprehended solution of a problem that all the miseries of her young life had come from fixing her heart on her own pleasure as if that were the central necessity of the universe and for the first time she saw the possibility of shifting the position from which she looked at the gratification of her own desires of taking her stand out of herself and looking at her own life as an insignificant part of a divinely guided whole She read on and on in the old book devouring eagerly the dialogues with the invisible Teacher the pattern of sorrow the source of all strength returning to it after she had been called away and reading till the sun went down behind the willows With all the hurry of an imagination that could never rest in the present she sat in the deepening twilight forming plans of self humiliation and entire devotedness and in the ardor of first discovery renunciation seemed to her the entrance into that satisfaction which she had so long been craving in vain She had not perceived how could she until she had lived longer the inmost truth of the old monk s out pourings that renunciation remains sorrow though a sorrow borne willingly Maggie was still panting for happiness and was in ecstasy because she had found the key to it She knew nothing of doctrines and systems of mysticism or quietism but this voice out of the far off middle ages was the direct communication of a human soul s belief and experience and came to Maggie as an unquestioned message I suppose that is the reason why the small old fashioned book for which you need only pay sixpence at a book stall works miracles to this day turning bitter waters into sweetness while expensive sermons and treatises newly issued leave all things as they were before It was written down by a hand that waited for the heart s prompting it is the chronicle of a solitary hidden anguish struggle trust and triumph not written on velvet cushions to teach endurance to those who are treading with bleeding feet on the stones And so it remains to all time a lasting record of human needs and human consolations the voice of a brother who ages ago felt and suffered and renounced in the cloister perhaps with serge gown and tonsured head with much chanting and long fasts and with a fashion of speech different from ours but under the same silent far off heavens and with the same passionate desires the same strivings the same failures the same weariness In writing the history of unfashionable families one is apt to fall into a tone of emphasis which is very far from being the tone of good society where principles and beliefs are not only of an extremely moderate kind but are always presupposed no subjects being eligible but such as can be touched with a light and graceful irony But then good society has its claret and its velvet carpets its dinner engagements six weeks deep its opera and its faery ball rooms rides off its ennui on thoroughbred horses lounges at the club has to keep clear of crinoline vortices gets its science done by Faraday and its religion by the superior clergy who are to be met in the best houses how should it have time or need for belief and emphasis But good society floated on gossamer wings of light irony is of very expensive production requiring nothing less than a wide and arduous national life condensed in unfragrant deafening factories cramping itself in mines sweating at furnaces grinding hammering weaving under more or less oppression of carbonic acid or else spread over sheepwalks and scattered in lonely houses and huts on the clayey or chalky corn lands where the rainy days look dreary This wide national life is based entirely on emphasis the emphasis of want which urges it into all the activities necessary for the maintenance of good society and light irony it spends its heavy years often in a chill uncarpeted fashion amidst family discord unsoftened by long corridors Under such circumstances there are many among its myriads of souls who have absolutely needed an emphatic belief life in this unpleasurable shape demanding some solution even to unspeculative minds just as you inquire into the stuffing of your couch when anything galls you there whereas eider down and perfect French springs excite no question Some have an emphatic belief in alcohol and seek their ekstasis or outside standing ground in gin but the rest require something that good society calls enthusiasm something that will present motives in an entire absence of high prizes something that will give patience and feed human love when the limbs ache with weariness and human looks are hard upon us something clearly that lies outside personal desires that includes resignation for ourselves and active love for what is not ourselves Now and then that sort of enthusiasm finds a far echoing voice that comes from an experience springing out of the deepest need and it was by being brought within the long lingering vibrations of such a voice that Maggie with her girl s face and unnoted sorrows found an effort and a hope that helped her through years of loneliness making out a faith for herself without the aid of established authorities and appointed guides for they were not at hand and her need was pressing From what you know of her you will not be surprised that she threw some exaggeration and wilfulness some pride and impetuosity even into her self renunciation her own life was still a drama for her in which she demanded of herself that her part should be played with intensity And so it came to pass that she often lost the spirit of humility by being excessive in the outward act she often strove after too high a flight and came down with her poor little half fledged wings dabbled in the mud For example she not only determined to work at plain sewing that she might contribute something toward the fund in the tin box but she went in the first instance in her zeal of self mortification to ask for it at a linen shop in saint Ogg s instead of getting it in a more quiet and indirect way and could see nothing but what was entirely wrong and unkind nay persecuting in Tom s reproof of her for this unnecessary act I don t like my sister to do such things said Tom I ll take care that the debts are paid without your lowering yourself in that way Surely there was some tenderness and bravery mingled with the worldliness and self assertion of that little speech but Maggie held it as dross overlooking the grains of gold and took Tom s rebuke as one of her outward crosses Tom was very hard to her she used to think in her long night watchings to her who had always loved him so and then she strove to be contented with that hardness and to require nothing That is the path we all like when we set out on our abandonment of egoism the path of martyrdom and endurance where the palm branches grow rather than the steep highway of tolerance just allowance and self blame where there are no leafy honors to be gathered and worn The old books Virgil Euclid and Aldrich that wrinkled fruit of the tree of knowledge had been all laid by for Maggie had turned her back on the vain ambition to share the thoughts of the wise In her first ardor she flung away the books with a sort of triumph that she had risen above the need of them and if they had been her own she would have burned them believing that she would never repent She read so eagerly and constantly in her three books the Bible Thomas a Kempis and the Christian Year no longer rejected as a hymn book that they filled her mind with a continual stream of rhythmic memories and she was too ardently learning to see all nature and life in the light of her new faith to need any other material for her mind to work on as she sat with her well plied needle making shirts and other complicated stitchings falsely called plain by no means plain to Maggie since wristband and sleeve and the like had a capability of being sewed in wrong side outward in moments of mental wandering Hanging diligently over her sewing Maggie was a sight any one might have been pleased to look at That new inward life of hers notwithstanding some volcanic upheavings of imprisoned passions yet shone out in her face with a tender soft light that mingled itself as added loveliness with the gradually enriched color and outline of her blossoming youth Her mother felt the change in her with a sort of puzzled wonder that Maggie should be growing up so good it was amazing that this once contrairy child was become so submissive so backward to assert her own will Maggie used to look up from her work and find her mother s eyes fixed upon her they were watching and waiting for the large young glance as if her elder frame got some needful warmth from it The mother was getting fond of her tall brown girl the only bit of furniture now on which she could bestow her anxiety and pride and Maggie in spite of her own ascetic wish to have no personal adornment was obliged to give way to her mother about her hair and submit to have the abundant black locks plaited into a coronet on the summit of her head after the pitiable fashion of those antiquated times Let your mother have that bit o pleasure my dear said missus Tulliver I d trouble enough with your hair once So Maggie glad of anything that would soothe her mother and cheer their long day together consented to the vain decoration and showed a queenly head above her old frocks steadily refusing however to look at herself in the glass missus Tulliver liked to call the father s attention to Maggie s hair and other unexpected virtues but he had a brusk reply to give I knew well enough what she d be before now it s nothing new to me But it s a pity she isn t made o commoner stuff she ll be thrown away I doubt there ll be nobody to marry her as is fit for her And Maggie s graces of mind and body fed his gloom He sat patiently enough while she read him a chapter or said something timidly when they were alone together about trouble being turned into a blessing He took it all as part of his daughter s goodness which made his misfortunes the sadder to him because they damaged her chance in life In a mind charged with an eager purpose and an unsatisfied vindictiveness there is no room for new feelings mister Tulliver did not want spiritual consolation he wanted to shake off the degradation of debt and to have his revenge Book V Wheat and Tares Chapter I In the Red Deeps The family sitting room was a long room with a window at each end one looking toward the croft and along the Ripple to the banks of the Floss the other into the mill yard Maggie was sitting with her work against the latter window when she saw mister Wakem entering the yard as usual on his fine black horse but not alone as usual Some one was with him a figure in a cloak on a handsome pony Maggie had hardly time to feel that it was Philip come back before they were in front of the window and he was raising his hat to her while his father catching the movement by a side glance looked sharply round at them both Maggie hurried away from the window and carried her work upstairs for mister Wakem sometimes came in and inspected the books and Maggie felt that the meeting with Philip would be robbed of all pleasure in the presence of the two fathers Some day perhaps she could see him when they could just shake hands and she could tell him that she remembered his goodness to Tom and the things he had said to her in the old days though they could never be friends any more It was not at all agitating to Maggie to see Philip again she retained her childish gratitude and pity toward him and remembered his cleverness and in the early weeks of her loneliness she had continually recalled the image of him among the people who had been kind to her in life often wishing she had him for a brother and a teacher as they had fancied it might have been in their talk together But that sort of wishing had been banished along with other dreams that savored of seeking her own will and she thought besides that Philip might be altered by his life abroad he might have become worldly and really not care about her saying anything to him now And yet his face was wonderfully little altered it was only a larger more manly copy of the pale small featured boy s face with the gray eyes and the boyish waving brown hair there was the old deformity to awaken the old pity and after all her meditations Maggie felt that she really should like to say a few words to him He might still be melancholy as he always used to be and like her to look at him kindly She wondered if he remembered how he used to like her eyes with that thought Maggie glanced toward the square looking glass which was condemned to hang with its face toward the wall and she half started from her seat to reach it down but she checked herself and snatched up her work trying to repress the rising wishes by forcing her memory to recall snatches of hymns until she saw Philip and his father returning along the road and she could go down again It was far on in June now and Maggie was inclined to lengthen the daily walk which was her one indulgence but this day and the following she was so busy with work which must be finished that she never went beyond the gate and satisfied her need of the open air by sitting out of doors One of her frequent walks when she was not obliged to go to saint Ogg s was to a spot that lay beyond what was called the Hill an insignificant rise of ground crowned by trees lying along the side of the road which ran by the gates of Dorlcote Mill Insignificant I call it because in height it was hardly more than a bank but there may come moments when Nature makes a mere bank a means toward a fateful result and that is why I ask you to imagine this high bank crowned with trees making an uneven wall for some quarter of a mile along the left side of Dorlcote Mill and the pleasant fields behind it bounded by the murmuring Ripple Just where this line of bank sloped down again to the level a by road turned off and led to the other side of the rise where it was broken into very capricious hollows and mounds by the working of an exhausted stone quarry so long exhausted that both mounds and hollows were now clothed with brambles and trees and here and there by a stretch of grass which a few sheep kept close nibbled In her childish days Maggie held this place called the Red Deeps in very great awe and needed all her confidence in Tom s bravery to reconcile her to an excursion thither visions of robbers and fierce animals haunting every hollow But now it had the charm for her which any broken ground any mimic rock and ravine have for the eyes that rest habitually on the level especially in summer when she could sit on a grassy hollow under the shadow of a branching ash stooping aslant from the steep above her and listen to the hum of insects like tiniest bells on the garment of Silence or see the sunlight piercing the distant boughs as if to chase and drive home the truant heavenly blue of the wild hyacinths In this June time too the dog roses were in their glory and that was an additional reason why Maggie should direct her walk to the Red Deeps rather than to any other spot on the first day she was free to wander at her will a pleasure she loved so well that sometimes in her ardors of renunciation she thought she ought to deny herself the frequent indulgence in it You may see her now as she walks down the favorite turning and enters the Deeps by a narrow path through a group of Scotch firs her tall figure and old lavender gown visible through an hereditary black silk shawl of some wide meshed net like material and now she is sure of being unseen she takes off her bonnet and ties it over her arm One would certainly suppose her to be farther on in life than her seventeenth year perhaps because of the slow resigned sadness of the glance from which all search and unrest seem to have departed perhaps because her broad chested figure has the mould of early womanhood Youth and health have withstood well the involuntary and voluntary hardships of her lot and the nights in which she has lain on the hard floor for a penance have left no obvious trace the eyes are liquid the brown cheek is firm and round the full lips are red With her dark coloring and jet crown surmounting her tall figure she seems to have a sort of kinship with the grand Scotch firs at which she is looking up as if she loved them well Yet one has a sense of uneasiness in looking at her a sense of opposing elements of which a fierce collision is imminent surely there is a hushed expression such as one often sees in older faces under borderless caps out of keeping with the resistant youth which one expects to flash out in a sudden passionate glance that will dissipate all the quietude like a damp fire leaping out again when all seemed safe But Maggie herself was not uneasy at this moment She was calmly enjoying the free air while she looked up at the old fir trees and thought that those broken ends of branches were the records of past storms which had only made the red stems soar higher But while her eyes were still turned upward she became conscious of a moving shadow cast by the evening sun on the grassy path before her and looked down with a startled gesture to see Philip Wakem who first raised his hat and then blushing deeply came forward to her and put out his hand Maggie too colored with surprise which soon gave way to pleasure She put out her hand and looked down at the deformed figure before her with frank eyes filled for the moment with nothing but the memory of her child s feelings a memory that was always strong in her She was the first to speak You startled me she said smiling faintly I never meet any one here How came you to be walking here Did you come to meet me It was impossible not to perceive that Maggie felt herself a child again Yes I did said Philip still embarrassed I wished to see you very much I watched a long while yesterday on the bank near your house to see if you would come out but you never came Then I watched again to day and when I saw the way you took I kept you in sight and came down the bank behind there I hope you will not be displeased with me No said Maggie with simple seriousness walking on as if she meant Philip to accompany her I m very glad you came for I wished very much to have an opportunity of speaking to you I ve never forgotten how good you were long ago to Tom and me too but I was not sure that you would remember us so well Tom and I have had a great deal of trouble since then and I think that makes one think more of what happened before the trouble came I can t believe that you have thought of me so much as I have thought of you said Philip timidly Do you know when I was away I made a picture of you as you looked that morning in the study when you said you would not forget me Philip drew a large miniature case from his pocket and opened it Maggie saw her old self leaning on a table with her black locks hanging down behind her ears looking into space with strange dreamy eyes It was a water color sketch of real merit as a portrait Oh dear said Maggie smiling and flushed with pleasure what a queer little girl I was I remember myself with my hair in that way in that pink frock I really was like a gypsy I dare say I am now she added after a little pause am I like what you expected me to be The words might have been those of a coquette but the full bright glance Maggie turned on Philip was not that of a coquette She really did hope he liked her face as it was now but it was simply the rising again of her innate delight in admiration and love Philip met her eyes and looked at her in silence for a long moment before he said quietly No Maggie The light died out a little from Maggie s face and there was a slight trembling of the lip Her eyelids fell lower but she did not turn away her head and Philip continued to look at her Then he said slowly You are very much more beautiful than I thought you would be Am I said Maggie the pleasure returning in a deeper flush She turned her face away from him and took some steps looking straight before her in silence as if she were adjusting her consciousness to this new idea Girls are so accustomed to think of dress as the main ground of vanity that in abstaining from the looking glass Maggie had thought more of abandoning all care for adornment than of renouncing the contemplation of her face Comparing herself with elegant wealthy young ladies it had not occurred to her that she could produce any effect with her person Philip seemed to like the silence well He walked by her side watching her face as if that sight left no room for any other wish They had passed from among the fir trees and had now come to a green hollow almost surrounded by an amphitheatre of the pale pink dog roses But as the light about them had brightened Maggie s face had lost its glow She stood still when they were in the hollows and looking at Philip again she said in a serious sad voice I wish we could have been friends I mean if it would have been good and right for us But that is the trial I have to bear in everything I may not keep anything I used to love when I was little The old books went and Tom is different and my father It is like death I must part with everything I cared for when I was a child And I must part with you we must never take any notice of each other again That was what I wanted to speak to you for I wanted to let you know that Tom and I can t do as we like about such things and that if I behave as if I had forgotten all about you it is not out of envy or pride or or any bad feeling Maggie spoke with more and more sorrowful gentleness as she went on and her eyes began to fill with tears The deepening expression of pain on Philip s face gave him a stronger resemblance to his boyish self and made the deformity appeal more strongly to her pity I know I see all that you mean he said in a voice that had become feebler from discouragement I know what there is to keep us apart on both sides But it is not right Maggie don t you be angry with me I am so used to call you Maggie in my thoughts it is not right to sacrifice everything to other people s unreasonable feelings I would give up a great deal for my father but I would not give up a friendship or or an attachment of any sort in obedience to any wish of his that I didn t recognize as right I don t know said Maggie musingly Often when I have been angry and discontented it has seemed to me that I was not bound to give up anything and I have gone on thinking till it has seemed to me that I could think away all my duty But no good has ever come of that it was an evil state of mind I m quite sure that whatever I might do I should wish in the end that I had gone without anything for myself rather than have made my father s life harder to him But would it make his life harder if we were to see each other sometimes said Philip He was going to say something else but checked himself Oh I m sure he wouldn t like it Don t ask me why or anything about it said Maggie in a distressed tone My father feels so strongly about some things He is not at all happy No more am I said Philip impetuously I am not happy Why said Maggie gently At least I ought not to ask but I m very very sorry Philip turned to walk on as if he had not patience to stand still any longer and they went out of the hollow winding amongst the trees and bushes in silence After that last word of Philip s Maggie could not bear to insist immediately on their parting I ve been a great deal happier she said at last timidly since I have given up thinking about what is easy and pleasant and being discontented because I couldn t have my own will Our life is determined for us and it makes the mind very free when we give up wishing and only think of bearing what is laid upon us and doing what is given us to do But I can t give up wishing said Philip impatiently It seems to me we can never give up longing and wishing while we are thoroughly alive There are certain things we feel to be beautiful and good and we must hunger after them How can we ever be satisfied without them until our feelings are deadened I delight in fine pictures I long to be able to paint such I strive and strive and can t produce what I want That is pain to me and always will be pain until my faculties lose their keenness like aged eyes Then there are many other things I long for here Philip hesitated a little and then said things that other men have and that will always be denied me My life will have nothing great or beautiful in it I would rather not have lived Oh Philip said Maggie I wish you didn t feel so But her heart began to beat with something of Philip s discontent Well then said he turning quickly round and fixing his gray eyes entreatingly on her face I should be contented to live if you would let me see you sometimes Then checked by a fear which her face suggested he looked away again and said more calmly I have no friend to whom I can tell everything no one who cares enough about me and if I could only see you now and then and you would let me talk to you a little and show me that you cared for me and that we may always be friends in heart and help each other then I might come to be glad of life But how can I see you Philip said Maggie falteringly Could she really do him good It would be very hard to say good by this day and not speak to him again Here was a new interest to vary the days it was so much easier to renounce the interest before it came If you would let me see you here sometimes walk with you here I would be contented if it were only once or twice in a month That could injure no one s happiness and it would sweeten my life Besides Philip went on with all the inventive astuteness of love at one and twenty if there is any enmity between those who belong to us we ought all the more to try and quench it by our friendship I mean that by our influence on both sides we might bring about a healing of the wounds that have been made in the past if I could know everything about them And I don t believe there is any enmity in my own father s mind I think he has proved the contrary Maggie shook her head slowly and was silent under conflicting thoughts It seemed to her inclination that to see Philip now and then and keep up the bond of friendship with him was something not only innocent but good perhaps she might really help him to find contentment as she had found it The voice that said this made sweet music to Maggie but athwart it there came an urgent monotonous warning from another voice which she had been learning to obey the warning that such interviews implied secrecy implied doing something she would dread to be discovered in something that if discovered must cause anger and pain and that the admission of anything so near doubleness would act as a spiritual blight Yet the music would swell out again like chimes borne onward by a recurrent breeze persuading her that the wrong lay all in the faults and weaknesses of others and that there was such a thing as futile sacrifice for one to the injury of another It was very cruel for Philip that he should be shrunk from because of an unjustifiable vindictiveness toward his father poor Philip whom some people would shrink from only because he was deformed The idea that he might become her lover or that her meeting him could cause disapproval in that light had not occurred to her and Philip saw the absence of this idea clearly enough saw it with a certain pang although it made her consent to his request the less unlikely There was bitterness to him in the perception that Maggie was almost as frank and unconstrained toward him as when she was a child I can t say either yes or no she said at last turning round and walking toward the way she come I must wait lest I should decide wrongly I must seek for guidance May I come again then to morrow or the next day or next week I think I had better write said Maggie faltering again I have to go to saint Ogg s sometimes and I can put the letter in the post Oh no said Philip eagerly that would not be so well My father might see the letter and he has not any enmity I believe but he views things differently from me he thinks a great deal about wealth and position Pray let me come here once more Tell me when it shall be or if you can t tell me I will come as often as I can till I do see you I think it must be so then said Maggie for I can t be quite certain of coming here any particular evening Maggie felt a great relief in adjourning the decision She was free now to enjoy the minutes of companionship she almost thought she might linger a little the next time they met she should have to pain Philip by telling him her determination I can t help thinking she said looking smilingly at him after a few moments of silence how strange it is that we should have met and talked to each other just as if it had been only yesterday when we parted at Lorton And yet we must both be very much altered in those five years I think it is five years How was it you seemed to have a sort of feeling that I was the same Maggie I was not quite so sure that you would be the same I know you are so clever and you must have seen and learnt so much to fill your mind I was not quite sure you would care about me now I have never had any doubt that you would be the same whenever I migh see you said Philip I mean the same in everything that made me like you better than any one else I don t want to explain that I don t think any of the strongest effects our natures are susceptible of can ever be explained We can neither detect the process by which they are arrived at nor the mode in which they act on us The greatest of painters only once painted a mysteriously divine child he couldn t have told how he did it and we can t tell why we feel it to be divine I think there are stores laid up in our human nature that our understandings can make no complete inventory of Certain strains of music affect me so strangely I can never hear them without their changing my whole attitude of mind for a time and if the effect would last I might be capable of heroisms Ah I know what you mean about music I feel so said Maggie clasping her hands with her old impetuosity At least she added in a saddened tone I used to feel so when I had any music I never have any now except the organ at church And you long for it Maggie said Philip looking at her with affectionate pity Ah you can have very little that is beautiful in your life Have you many books You were so fond of them when you were a little girl They were come back to the hollow round which the dog roses grew and they both paused under the charm of the faery evening light reflected from the pale pink clusters No I have given up books said Maggie quietly except a very very few Philip had already taken from his pocket a small volume and was looking at the back as he said Ah this is the second volume I see else you might have liked to take it home with you I put it in my pocket because I am studying a scene for a picture Maggie had looked at the back too and saw the title it revived an old impression with overmastering force The Pirate she said taking the book from Philip s hands Oh I began that once I read to where Minna is walking with Cleveland and I could never get to read the rest I went on with it in my own head and I made several endings but they were all unhappy I could never make a happy ending out of that beginning Poor Minna I wonder what is the real end For a long while I couldn t get my mind away from the Shetland Isles I used to feel the wind blowing on me from the rough sea Maggie spoke rapidly with glistening eyes Take that volume home with you Maggie said Philip watching her with delight I don t want it now I shall make a picture of you instead you among the Scotch firs and the slanting shadows Maggie had not heard a word he had said she was absorbed in a page at which she had opened But suddenly she closed the book and gave it back to Philip shaking her head with a backward movement as if to say avaunt to floating visions Do keep it Maggie said Philip entreatingly it will give you pleasure No thank you said Maggie putting it aside with her hand and walking on It would make me in love with this world again as I used to be it would make me long to see and know many things it would make me long for a full life But you will not always be shut up in your present lot why should you starve your mind in that way It is narrow asceticism I don t like to see you persisting in it Maggie Poetry and art and knowledge are sacred and pure But not for me not for me said Maggie walking more hurriedly because I should want too much I must wait this life will not last long Don t hurry away from me without saying good by Maggie said Philip as they reached the group of Scotch firs and she continued still to walk along without speaking I must not go any farther I think must I Oh no I forgot good by said Maggie pausing and putting out her hand to him The action brought her feeling back in a strong current to Philip and after they had stood looking at each other in silence for a few moments with their hands clasped she said withdrawing her hand I m very grateful to you for thinking of me all those years It is very sweet to have people love us What a wonderful beautiful thing it seems that God should have made your heart so that you could care about a queer little girl whom you only knew for a few weeks I remember saying to you that I thought you cared for me more than Tom did Ah Maggie said Philip almost fretfully you would never love me so well as you love your brother Perhaps not said Maggie simply but then you know the first thing I ever remember in my life is standing with Tom by the side of the Floss while he held my hand everything before that is dark to me But I shall never forget you though we must keep apart Don t say so Maggie said Philip If I kept that little girl in my mind for five years didn t I earn some part in her She ought not to take herself quite away from me Not if I were free said Maggie but I am not I must submit She hesitated a moment and then added And I wanted to say to you that you had better not take more notice of my brother than just bowing to him He once told me not to speak to you again and he doesn t change his mind Oh dear the sun is set I am too long away Good by She gave him her hand once more I shall come here as often as I can till I see you again Maggie Have some feeling for me as well as for others Yes yes I have said Maggie hurrying away and quickly disappearing behind the last fir tree though Philip s gaze after her remained immovable for minutes as if he saw her still Maggie went home with an inward conflict already begun Philip went home to do nothing but remember and hope You can hardly help blaming him severely He was four or five years older than Maggie and had a full consciousness of his feeling toward her to aid him in foreseeing the character his contemplated interviews with her would bear in the opinion of a third person But you must not suppose that he was capable of a gross selfishness or that he could have been satisfied without persuading himself that he was seeking to infuse some happiness into Maggie s life seeking this even more than any direct ends for himself He could give her sympathy he could give her help There was not the slightest promise of love toward him in her manner it was nothing more than the sweet girlish tenderness she had shown him when she was twelve Perhaps she would never love him perhaps no woman ever could love him Well then he would endure that he should at least have the happiness of seeing her of feeling some nearness to her And he clutched passionately the possibility that she might love him perhaps the feeling would grow if she could come to associate him with that watchful tenderness which her nature would be so keenly alive to If any woman could love him surely Maggie was that woman there was such wealth of love in her and there was no one to claim it all Then the pity of it that a mind like hers should be withering in its very youth like a young forest tree for want of the light and space it was formed to flourish in Could he not hinder that by persuading her out of her system of privation He would be her guardian angel he would do anything bear anything for her sake except not seeing her Chapter II Aunt Glegg Learns the Breadth of Bob s Thumb While Maggie s life struggles had lain almost entirely within her own soul one shadowy army fighting another and the slain shadows forever rising again Tom was engaged in a dustier noisier warfare grappling with more substantial obstacles and gaining more definite conquests So it has been since the days of Hecuba and of Hector Tamer of horses inside the gates the women with streaming hair and uplifted hands offering prayers watching the world s combat from afar filling their long empty days with memories and fears outside the men in fierce struggle with things divine and human quenching memory in the stronger light of purpose losing the sense of dread and even of wounds in the hurrying ardor of action From what you have seen of Tom I think he is not a youth of whom you would prophesy failure in anything he had thoroughly wished the wagers are likely to be on his side notwithstanding his small success in the classics For Tom had never desired success in this field of enterprise and for getting a fine flourishing growth of stupidity there is nothing like pouring out on a mind a good amount of subjects in which it feels no interest But now Tom s strong will bound together his integrity his pride his family regrets and his personal ambition and made them one force concentrating his efforts and surmounting discouragements His uncle Deane who watched him closely soon began to conceive hopes of him and to be rather proud that he had brought into the employment of the firm a nephew who appeared to be made of such good commercial stuff The real kindness of placing him in the warehouse first was soon evident to Tom in the hints his uncle began to throw out that after a time he might perhaps be trusted to travel at certain seasons and buy in for the firm various vulgar commodities with which I need not shock refined ears in this place and it was doubtless with a view to this result that mister Deane when he expected to take his wine alone would tell Tom to step in and sit with him an hour and would pass that hour in much lecturing and catechising concerning articles of export and import with an occasional excursus of more indirect utility on the relative advantages to the merchants of saint Ogg s of having goods brought in their own and in foreign bottoms a subject on which mister Deane as a ship owner naturally threw off a few sparks when he got warmed with talk and wine Already in the second year Tom s salary was raised but all except the price of his dinner and clothes went home into the tin box and he shunned comradeship lest it should lead him into expenses in spite of himself Not that Tom was moulded on the spoony type of the Industrious Apprentice he had a very strong appetite for pleasure would have liked to be a Tamer of horses and to make a distinguished figure in all neighboring eyes dispensing treats and benefits to others with well judged liberality and being pronounced one of the finest young fellows of those parts nay he determined to achieve these things sooner or later but his practical shrewdness told him that the means no such achievements could only lie for him in present abstinence and self denial there were certain milestones to be passed and one of the first was the payment of his father s debts Having made up his mind on that point he strode along without swerving contracting some rather saturnine sternness as a young man is likely to do who has a premature call upon him for self reliance Tom felt intensely that common cause with his father which springs from family pride and was bent on being irreproachable as a son but his growing experience caused him to pass much silent criticism on the rashness and imprudence of his father s past conduct their dispositions were not in sympathy and Tom s face showed little radiance during his few home hours Maggie had an awe of him against which she struggled as something unfair to her consciousness of wider thoughts and deeper motives but it was of no use to struggle A character at unity with itself that performs what it intends subdues every counteracting impulse and has no visions beyond the distinctly possible is strong by its very negations You may imagine that Tom s more and more obvious unlikeness to his father was well fitted to conciliate the maternal aunts and uncles and mister Deane s favorable reports and predictions to mister Glegg concerning Tom s qualifications for business began to be discussed amongst them with various acceptance He was likely it appeared to do the family credit without causing it any expense and trouble missus Pullet had always thought it strange if Tom s excellent complexion so entirely that of the Dodsons did not argue a certainty that he would turn out well his juvenile errors of running down the peacock and general disrespect to his aunts only indicating a tinge of Tulliver blood which he had doubtless outgrown mister Glegg who had contracted a cautious liking for Tom ever since his spirited and sensible behavior when the execution was in the house was now warming into a resolution to further his prospects actively some time when an opportunity offered of doing so in a prudent manner without ultimate loss but missus Glegg observed that she was not given to speak without book as some people were that those who said least were most likely to find their words made good and that when the right moment came it would be seen who could do something better than talk Uncle Pullet after silent meditation for a period of several lozenges came distinctly to the conclusion that when a young man was likely to do well it was better not to meddle with him Tom meanwhile had shown no disposition to rely on any one but himself though with a natural sensitiveness toward all indications of favorable opinion he was glad to see his uncle Glegg look in on him sometimes in a friendly way during business hours and glad to be invited to dine at his house though he usually preferred declining on the ground that he was not sure of being punctual But about a year ago something had occurred which induced Tom to test his uncle Glegg s friendly disposition Bob Jakin who rarely returned from one of his rounds without seeing Tom and Maggie awaited him on the bridge as he was coming home from saint Ogg s one evening that they might have a little private talk He took the liberty of asking if mister Tom had ever thought of making money by trading a bit on his own account Trading how Tom wished to know Why by sending out a bit of a cargo to foreign ports because Bob had a particular friend who had offered to do a little business for him in that way in Laceham goods and would be glad to serve mister Tom on the same footing Tom was interested at once and begged for full explanation wondering he had not thought of this plan before He was so well pleased with the prospect of a speculation that might change the slow process of addition into multiplication that he at once determined to mention the matter to his father and get his consent to appropriate some of the savings in the tin box to the purchase of a small cargo He would rather not have consulted his father but he had just paid his last quarter s money into the tin box and there was no other resource All the savings were there for mister Tulliver would not consent to put the money out at interest lest he should lose it Since he had speculated in the purchase of some corn and had lost by it he could not be easy without keeping the money under his eye Tom approached the subject carefully as he was seated on the hearth with his father that evening and mister Tulliver listened leaning forward in his arm chair and looking up in Tom s face with a sceptical glance His first impulse was to give a positive refusal but he was in some awe of Tom s wishes and since he had the sense of being an unlucky father he had lost some of his old peremptoriness and determination to be master He took the key of the bureau from his pocket got out the key of the large chest and fetched down the tin box slowly as if he were trying to defer the moment of a painful parting Then he seated himself against the table and opened the box with that little padlock key which he fingered in his waistcoat pocket in all vacant moments There they were the dingy bank notes and the bright sovereigns and he counted them out on the table only a hundred and sixteen pounds in two years after all the pinching How much do you want then he said speaking as if the words burnt his lips Suppose I begin with the thirty six pounds father said Tom mister Tulliver separated this sum from the rest and keeping his hand over it said It s as much as I can save out o my pay in a year Yes father it is such slow work saving out of the little money we get And in this way we might double our savings Ay my lad said the father keeping his hand on the money but you might lose it you might lose a year o my life and I haven t got many Tom was silent And you know I wouldn t pay a dividend with the first hundred because I wanted to see it all in a lump and when I see it I m sure on t If you trust to luck it s sure to be against me It s Old Harry s got the luck in his hands and if I lose one year I shall never pick it up again death ull o ertake me mister Tulliver s voice trembled and Tom was silent for a few minutes before he said I ll give it up father since you object to it so strongly But unwilling to abandon the scheme altogether he determined to ask his uncle Glegg to venture twenty pounds on condition of receiving five per cent of the profits That was really a very small thing to ask So when Bob called the next day at the wharf to know the decision Tom proposed that they should go together to his uncle Glegg s to open the business for his diffident pride clung to him and made him feel that Bobs tongue would relieve him from some embarrassment mister Glegg at the pleasant hour of four in the afternoon of a hot August day was naturally counting his wall fruit to assure himself that the sum total had not varied since yesterday To him entered Tom in what appeared to mister Glegg very questionable companionship that of a man with a pack on his back for Bob was equipped for a new journey and of a huge brindled bull terrier who walked with a slow swaying movement from side to side and glanced from under his eye lids with a surly indifference which might after all be a cover to the most offensive designs mister Glegg s spectacles which had been assisting him in counting the fruit made these suspicious details alarmingly evident to him Heigh heigh keep that dog back will you he shouted snatching up a stake and holding it before him as a shield when the visitors were within three yards of him Get out wi you Mumps said Bob with a kick He s as quiet as a lamb sir an observation which Mumps corroborated by a low growl as he retreated behind his master s legs Why what ever does this mean Tom said mister Glegg Have you brought information about the scoundrels as cut my trees If Bob came in the character of information mister Glegg saw reasons for tolerating some irregularity No sir said Tom I came to speak to you about a little matter of business of my own Ay well but what has this dog got to do with it said the old gentleman getting mild again It s my dog sir said the ready Bob An it s me as put mister Tom up to the bit o business for mister Tom s been a friend o mine iver since I was a little chap fust thing iver I did was frightenin the birds for th old master An if a bit o luck turns up I m allays thinkin if I can let mister Tom have a pull at it An it s a downright roarin shame as when he s got the chance o making a bit o money wi sending goods out ten or twelve per zent clear when freight an commission s paid as he shouldn t lay hold o the chance for want o money An when there s the Laceham goods lors they re made o purpose for folks as want to send out a little carguy light an take up no room you may pack twenty pound so as you can t see the passill an they re manifacturs as please fools so I reckon they aren t like to want a market An I d go to Laceham an buy in the goods for mister Tom along wi my own An there s the shupercargo o the bit of a vessel as is goin to take em out I know him partic lar he s a solid man an got a family i the town here Salt his name is an a briny chap he is too an if you don t believe me I can take you to him Uncle Glegg stood open mouthed with astonishment at this unembarrassed loquacity with which his understanding could hardly keep pace He looked at Bob first over his spectacles then through them then over them again while Tom doubtful of his uncle s impression began to wish he had not brought this singular Aaron or mouthpiece Bob s talk appeared less seemly now some one besides himself was listening to it You seem to be a knowing fellow said mister Glegg at last Ay sir you say true returned Bob nodding his head aside I think my head s all alive inside like an old cheese for I m so full o plans one knocks another over If I hadn t Mumps to talk to I should get top heavy an tumble in a fit I suppose it s because I niver went to school much That s what I jaw my old mother for I says You should ha sent me to school a bit more I says an then I could ha read i the books like fun an kep my head cool an empty Lors she s fine an comfor ble now my old mother is she ates her baked meat an taters as often as she likes For I m gettin so full o money I must hev a wife to spend it for me But it s botherin a wife is and Mumps mightn t like her Uncle Glegg who regarded himself as a jocose man since he had retired from business was beginning to find Bob amusing but he had still a disapproving observation to make which kept his face serious Ah he said I should think you re at a loss for ways o spending your money else you wouldn t keep that big dog to eat as much as two Christians It s shameful shameful But he spoke more in sorrow than in anger and quickly added But come now let s hear more about this business Tom I suppose you want a little sum to make a venture with But where s all your own money You don t spend it all eh No sir said Tom coloring but my father is unwilling to risk it and I don t like to press him If I could get twenty or thirty pounds to begin with I could pay five per cent for it and then I could gradually make a little capital of my own and do without a loan Ay ay said mister Glegg in an approving tone that s not a bad notion and I won t say as I wouldn t be your man But it ull be as well for me to see this Salt as you talk on And then here s this friend o yours offers to buy the goods for you Perhaps you ve got somebody to stand surety for you if the money s put into your hands added the cautious old gentleman looking over his spectacles at Bob I don t think that s necessary uncle said Tom At least I mean it would not be necessary for me because I know Bob well but perhaps it would be right for you to have some security You get your percentage out o the purchase I suppose said mister Glegg looking at Bob No sir said Bob rather indignantly I didn t offer to get a apple for mister Tom o purpose to hev a bite out of it myself When I play folks tricks there ll be more fun in em nor that Well but it s nothing but right you should have a small percentage said mister Glegg I ve no opinion o transactions where folks do things for nothing It allays looks bad Well then said Bob whose keenness saw at once what was implied I ll tell you what I get by t an it s money in my pocket in the end I make myself look big wi makin a bigger purchase That s what I m thinking on Lors I m a cute chap I am mister Glegg mister Glegg said a severe voice from the open parlor window pray are you coming in to tea or are you going to stand talking with packmen till you get murdered in the open daylight Murdered said mister Glegg what s the woman talking of Here s your nephey Tom come about a bit o business Murdered yes it isn t many sizes ago since a packman murdered a young woman in a lone place and stole her thimble and threw her body into a ditch Nay nay said mister Glegg soothingly you re thinking o the man wi no legs as drove a dog cart Well it s the same thing mister Glegg only you re fond o contradicting what I say and if my nephey s come about business it ud be more fitting if you d bring him into the house and let his aunt know about it instead o whispering in corners in that plotting underminding way Well well said mister Glegg we ll come in now You needn t stay here said the lady to Bob in a loud voice adapted to the moral not the physical distance between them We don t want anything I don t deal wi packmen Mind you shut the gate after you Stop a bit not so fast said mister Glegg I haven t done with this young man yet Come in Tom come in he added stepping in at the French window mister Glegg said missus G in a fatal tone if you re going to let that man and his dog in on my carpet before my very face be so good as to let me know A wife s got a right to ask that I hope Don t you be uneasy mum said Bob touching his cap He saw at once that missus Glegg was a bit of game worth running down and longed to be at the sport we ll stay out upo the gravel here Mumps and me will Mumps knows his company he does I might hish at him by th hour together before he d fly at a real gentlewoman like you It s wonderful how he knows which is the good looking ladies and s partic lar fond of em when they ve good shapes Lors added Bob laying down his pack on the gravel it s a thousand pities such a lady as you shouldn t deal with a packman i stead o goin into these newfangled shops where there s half a dozen fine gents wi their chins propped up wi a stiff stock a looking like bottles wi ornamental stoppers an all got to get their dinner out of a bit o calico it stan s to reason you must pay three times the price you pay a packman as is the nat ral way o gettin goods an pays no rent an isn t forced to throttle himself till the lies are squeezed out on him whether he will or no But lors mum you know what it is better nor I do you can see through them shopmen I ll be bound Yes I reckon I can and through the packmen too observed missus Glegg intending to imply that Bob s flattery had produced no effect on her while her husband standing behind her with his hands in his pockets and legs apart winked and smiled with conjugal delight at the probability of his wife s being circumvented Ay to be sure mum said Bob Why you must ha dealt wi no end o packmen when you war a young lass before the master here had the luck to set eyes on you I know where you lived I do seen th house many a time close upon Squire Darleigh s a stone house wi steps Ah that it had said missus Glegg pouring out the tea You know something o my family then Are you akin to that packman with a squint in his eye as used to bring th Irish linen Look you there now said Bob evasively Didn t I know as you d remember the best bargains you ve made in your life was made wi packmen Why you see even a squintin packman s better nor a shopman as can see straight Lors if I d had the luck to call at the stone house wi my pack as lies here stooping and thumping the bundle emphatically with his fist an th handsome young lasses all stannin out on the stone steps it ud ha been summat like openin a pack that would It s on y the poor houses now as a packman calls on if it isn t for the sake o the sarvant maids They re paltry times these are Why mum look at the printed cottons now an what they was when you wore em why you wouldn t put such a thing on now I can see It must be first rate quality the manifactur as you d buy summat as ud wear as well as your own faitures Yes better quality nor any you re like to carry you ve got nothing first rate but brazenness I ll be bound said missus Glegg with a triumphant sense of her insurmountable sagacity mister Glegg are you going ever to sit down to your tea Tom there s a cup for you You speak true there mum said Bob My pack isn t for ladies like you The time s gone by for that Bargains picked up dirt cheap A bit o damage here an there as can be cut out or else niver seen i the wearin but not fit to offer to rich folks as can pay for the look o things as nobody sees I m not the man as ud offer t open my pack to you mum no no I m a imperent chap as you say these times makes folks imperent but I m not up to the mark o that Why what goods do you carry in your pack said missus Glegg Fine colored things I suppose shawls an that All sorts mum all sorts said Bob thumping his bundle but let us say no more about that if you please I m here upo mister Tom s business an I m not the man to take up the time wi my own And pray what is this business as is to be kept from me said missus Glegg who solicited by a double curiosity was obliged to let the one half wait A little plan o nephey Tom s here said good natured mister Glegg and not altogether a bad un I think A little plan for making money that s the right sort o plan for young folks as have got their fortin to make eh Jane But I hope it isn t a plan where he expects iverything to be done for him by his friends that s what the young folks think of mostly nowadays And pray what has this packman got to do wi what goes on in our family Can t you speak for yourself Tom and let your aunt know things as a nephey should This is Bob Jakin aunt said Tom bridling the irritation that aunt Glegg s voice always produced I ve known him ever since we were little boys He s a very good fellow and always ready to do me a kindness And he has had some experience in sending goods out a small part of a cargo as a private speculation and he thinks if I could begin to do a little in the same way I might make some money A large interest is got in that way Large int rest said aunt Glegg with eagerness and what do you call large int rest Ten or twelve per cent Bob says after expenses are paid Then why wasn t I let to know o such things before mister Glegg said missus Glegg turning to her husband with a deep grating tone of reproach Haven t you allays told me as there was no getting more nor five per cent Pooh pooh nonsense my good woman said mister Glegg You couldn t go into trade could you You can t get more than five per cent with security But I can turn a bit o money for you an welcome mum said Bob if you d like to risk it not as there s any risk to speak on But if you d a mind to lend a bit o money to mister Tom he d pay you six or seven per zent an get a trifle for himself as well an a good natur d lady like you ud like the feel o the money better if your nephey took part on it What do you say missus G said mister Glegg I ve a notion when I ve made a bit more inquiry as I shall perhaps start Tom here with a bit of a nest egg he ll pay me int rest you know an if you ve got some little sums lyin idle twisted up in a stockin toe or that mister Glegg it s beyond iverything You ll go and give information to the tramps next as they may come and rob me Well well as I was sayin if you like to join me wi twenty pounds you can I ll make it fifty That ll be a pretty good nest egg eh Tom You re not counting on me mister Glegg I hope said his wife You could do fine things wi my money I don t doubt Very well said mister Glegg rather snappishly then we ll do without you I shall go with you to see this Salt he added turning to Bob And now I suppose you ll go all the other way mister Glegg said missus G and want to shut me out o my own nephey s business I never said I wouldn t put money into it I don t say as it shall be twenty pounds though you re so ready to say it for me but he ll see some day as his aunt s in the right not to risk the money she s saved for him till it s proved as it won t be lost Ay that s a pleasant sort o risk that is said mister Glegg indiscreetly winking at Tom who couldn t avoid smiling But Bob stemmed the injured lady s outburst Ay mum he said admiringly you know what s what you do An it s nothing but fair You see how the first bit of a job answers an then you ll come down handsome Lors it s a fine thing to hev good kin I got my bit of a nest egg as the master calls it all by my own sharpness ten suvreigns it was wi dousing the fire at Torry s mill an it s growed an growed by a bit an a bit till I n got a matter o thirty pound to lay out besides makin my mother comfor ble I should get more on y I m such a soft wi the women I can t help lettin em hev such good bargains There s this bundle now thumping it lustily any other chap ud make a pretty penny out on it But me lors I shall sell em for pretty near what I paid for em Have you got a bit of good net now said missus Glegg in a patronizing tone moving from the tea table and folding her napkin Eh mum not what you d think it worth your while to look at I d scorn to show it you It ud be an insult to you But let me see said missus Glegg still patronizing If they re damaged goods they re like enough to be a bit the better quality No mum I know my place said Bob lifting up his pack and shouldering it I m not going t expose the lowness o my trade to a lady like you Packs is come down i the world it ud cut you to th heart to see the difference I m at your sarvice sir when you ve a mind to go and see Salt All in good time said mister Glegg really unwilling to cut short the dialogue Are you wanted at the wharf Tom No sir I left Stowe in my place Come put down your pack and let me see said missus Glegg drawing a chair to the window and seating herself with much dignity Don t you ask it mum said Bob entreatingly Make no more words said missus Glegg severely but do as I tell you Eh mum I m loth that I am said Bob slowly depositing his pack on the step and beginning to untie it with unwilling fingers But what you order shall be done much fumbling in pauses between the sentences It s not as you ll buy a single thing on me I d be sorry for you to do it for think o them poor women up i the villages there as niver stir a hundred yards from home it ud be a pity for anybody to buy up their bargains Lors it s as good as a junketing to em when they see me wi my pack an I shall niver pick up such bargains for em again Least ways I ve no time now for I m off to Laceham See here now Bob went on becoming rapid again and holding up a scarlet woollen Kerchief with an embroidered wreath in the corner here s a thing to make a lass s mouth water an on y two shillin an why Why cause there s a bit of a moth hole i this plain end Lors I think the moths an the mildew was sent by Providence o purpose to cheapen the goods a bit for the good lookin women as han t got much money If it hadn t been for the moths now every hankicher on em ud ha gone to the rich handsome ladies like you mum at five shillin apiece not a farthin less but what does the moth do Why it nibbles off three shillin o the price i no time an then a packman like me can carry t to the poor lasses as live under the dark thack to make a bit of a blaze for em Lors it s as good as a fire to look at such a hankicher Bob held it at a distance for admiration but missus Glegg said sharply Yes but nobody wants a fire this time o year Put these colored things by let me look at your nets if you ve got em Eh mum I told you how it ud be said Bob flinging aside the colored things with an air of desperation I knowed it ud turn again you to look at such paltry articles as I carry Here s a piece o figured muslin now what s the use o you lookin at it You might as well look at poor folks s victual mum it ud on y take away your appetite There s a yard i the middle on t as the pattern s all missed lors why it s a muslin as the Princess Victoree might ha wore but added Bob flinging it behind him on to the turf as if to save missus Glegg s eyes it ll be bought up by the huckster s wife at Fibb s End that s where it ll go ten shillin for the whole lot ten yards countin the damaged un five an twenty shillin ud ha been the price not a penny less But I ll say no more mum it s nothing to you a piece o muslin like that you can afford to pay three times the money for a thing as isn t half so good It s nets you talked on well I ve got a piece as ull serve you to make fun on Bring me that muslin said missus Glegg It s a buff I m partial to buff Eh but a damaged thing said Bob in a tone of deprecating disgust You d do nothing with it mum you d give it to the cook I know you would an it ud be a pity she d look too much like a lady in it it s unbecoming for servants Fetch it and let me see you measure it said missus Glegg authoritatively Bob obeyed with ostentatious reluctance See what there is over measure he said holding forth the extra half yard while missus Glegg was busy examining the damaged yard and throwing her head back to see how far the fault would be lost on a distant view I ll give you six shilling for it she said throwing it down with the air of a person who mentions an ultimatum Didn t I tell you now mum as it ud hurt your feelings to look at my pack That damaged bit s turned your stomach now I see it has said Bob wrapping the muslin up with the utmost quickness and apparently about to fasten up his pack You re used to seein a different sort o article carried by packmen when you lived at the stone house Packs is come down i the world I told you that my goods are for common folks missus Pepper ull give me ten shillin for that muslin an be sorry as I didn t ask her more Such articles answer i the wearin they keep their color till the threads melt away i the wash tub an that won t be while I m a young un Well seven shilling said missus Glegg Put it out o your mind mum now do said Bob Here s a bit o net then for you to look at before I tie up my pack just for you to see what my trade s come to spotted and sprigged you see beautiful but yallow s been lyin by an got the wrong color I could niver ha bought such net if it hadn t been yallow Lors it s took me a deal o study to know the vally o such articles when I begun to carry a pack I was as ignirant as a pig net or calico was all the same to me I thought them things the most vally as was the thickest I was took in dreadful for I m a straightforrard chap up to no tricks mum I can only say my nose is my own for if I went beyond I should lose myself pretty quick An I gev five an eightpence for that piece o net if I was to tell y anything else I should be tellin you fibs an five an eightpence I shall ask of it not a penny more for it s a woman s article an I like to commodate the women Five an eightpence for six yards as cheap as if it was only the dirt on it as was paid for I don t mind having three yards of it said missus Glegg Why there s but six altogether said Bob No mum it isn t worth your while you can go to the shop to morrow an get the same pattern ready whitened It s on y three times the money what s that to a lady like you He gave an emphatic tie to his bundle Come lay me out that muslin said missus Glegg Here s eight shilling for it You will be jokin said Bob looking up with a laughing face I see d you was a pleasant lady when I fust come to the winder Well put it

everything s right and safe And if I do Tom concluded missus Glegg turning impressively to her nephew I hope you ll allays bear it in mind and be grateful for such an aunt I mean you to pay me interest you know I don t approve o giving we niver looked for that in my family Thank you aunt said Tom rather proudly I prefer having the money only lent to me Very well that s the Dodson sperrit said missus Glegg rising to get her knitting with the sense that any further remark after this would be bathos Salt that eminently briny chap having been discovered in a cloud of tobacco smoke at the Anchor Tavern mister Glegg commenced inquiries which turned out satisfactorily enough to warrant the advance of the nest egg to which aunt Glegg contributed twenty pounds and in this modest beginning you see the ground of a fact which might otherwise surprise you namely Tom s accumulation of a fund unknown to his father that promised in no very long time to meet the more tardy process of saving and quite cover the deficit When once his attention had been turned to this source of gain Tom determined to make the most of it and lost on opportunity of obtaining information and extending his small enterprises In not telling his father he was influenced by that strange mixture of opposite feelings which often gives equal truth to those who blame an action and those who admire it partly it was that disinclination to confidence which is seen between near kindred that family repulsion which spoils the most sacred relations of our lives partly it was the desire to surprise his father with a great joy He did not see that it would have been better to soothe the interval with a new hope and prevent the delirium of a too sudden elation At the time of Maggie s first meeting with Philip Tom had already nearly a hundred and fifty pounds of his own capital and while they were walking by the evening light in the Red Deeps he by the same evening light was riding into Laceham proud of being on his first journey on behalf of Guest company and revolving in his mind all the chances that by the end of another year he should have doubled his gains lifted off the obloquy of debt from his father s name and perhaps for he should be twenty one have got a new start for himself on a higher platform of employment Did he not desire it He was quite sure that he did Chapter III The Wavering Balance I said that Maggie went home that evening from the Red Deeps with a mental conflict already begun You have seen clearly enough in her interview with Philip what that conflict was Here suddenly was an opening in the rocky wall which shut in the narrow valley of humiliation where all her prospect was the remote unfathomed sky and some of the memory haunting earthly delights were no longer out of her reach She might have books converse affection she might hear tidings of the world from which her mind had not yet lost its sense of exile and it would be a kindness to Philip too who was pitiable clearly not happy And perhaps here was an opportunity indicated for making her mind more worthy of its highest service perhaps the noblest completest devoutness could hardly exist without some width of knowledge must she always live in this resigned imprisonment It was so blameless so good a thing that there should be friendship between her and Philip the motives that forbade it were so unreasonable so unchristian But the severe monotonous warning came again and again that she was losing the simplicity and clearness of her life by admitting a ground of concealment and that by forsaking the simple rule of renunciation she was throwing herself under the seductive guidance of illimitable wants She thought she had won strength to obey the warning before she allowed herself the next week to turn her steps in the evening to the Red Deeps But while she was resolved to say an affectionate farewell to Philip how she looked forward to that evening walk in the still fleckered shade of the hollows away from all that was harsh and unlovely to the affectionate admiring looks that would meet her to the sense of comradeship that childish memories would give to wiser older talk to the certainty that Philip would care to hear everything she said which no one else cared for It was a half hour that it would be very hard to turn her back upon with the sense that there would be no other like it Yet she said what she meant to say she looked firm as well as sad Philip I have made up my mind it is right that we should give each other up in everything but memory I could not see you without concealment stay I know what you are going to say it is other people s wrong feelings that make concealment necessary but concealment is bad however it may be caused I feel that it would be bad for me for us both And then if our secret were discovered there would be nothing but misery dreadful anger and then we must part after all and it would be harder when we were used to seeing each other Philip s face had flushed and there was a momentary eagerness of expression as if he had been about to resist this decision with all his might But he controlled himself and said with assumed calmness Well Maggie if we must part let us try and forget it for one half hour let us talk together a little while for the last time He took her hand and Maggie felt no reason to withdraw it his quietness made her all the more sure she had given him great pain and she wanted to show him how unwillingly she had given it They walked together hand in hand in silence Let us sit down in the hollow said Philip where we stood the last time See how the dog roses have strewed the ground and spread their opal petals over it They sat down at the roots of the slanting ash I ve begun my picture of you among the Scotch firs Maggie said Philip so you must let me study your face a little while you stay since I am not to see it again Please turn your head this way This was said in an entreating voice and it would have been very hard of Maggie to refuse The full lustrous face with the bright black coronet looked down like that of a divinity well pleased to be worshipped on the pale hued small featured face that was turned up to it I shall be sitting for my second portrait then she said smiling Will it be larger than the other Oh yes much larger It is an oil painting You will look like a tall Hamadryad dark and strong and noble just issued from one of the fir trees when the stems are casting their afternoon shadows on the grass You seem to think more of painting than of anything now Philip Perhaps I do said Philip rather sadly but I think of too many things sow all sorts of seeds and get no great harvest from any one of them I m cursed with susceptibility in every direction and effective faculty in none I care for painting and music I care for classic literature and mediaeval literature and modern literature I flutter all ways and fly in none But surely that is a happiness to have so many tastes to enjoy so many beautiful things when they are within your reach said Maggie musingly It always seemed to me a sort of clever stupidity only to have one sort of talent almost like a carrier pigeon It might be a happiness to have many tastes if I were like other men said Philip bitterly I might get some power and distinction by mere mediocrity as they do at least I should get those middling satisfactions which make men contented to do without great ones I might think society at saint Ogg s agreeable then But nothing could make life worth the purchase money of pain to me but some faculty that would lift me above the dead level of provincial existence Yes there is one thing a passion answers as well as a faculty Maggie did not hear the last words she was struggling against the consciousness that Philip s words had set her own discontent vibrating again as it used to do I understand what you mean she said though I know so much less than you do I used to think I could never bear life if it kept on being the same every day and I must always be doing things of no consequence and never know anything greater But dear Philip I think we are only like children that some one who is wiser is taking care of Is it not right to resign ourselves entirely whatever may be denied us I have found great peace in that for the last two or three years even joy in subduing my own will Yes Maggie said Philip vehemently and you are shutting yourself up in a narrow self delusive fanaticism which is only a way of escaping pain by starving into dulness all the highest powers of your nature Joy and peace are not resignation resignation is the willing endurance of a pain that is not allayed that you don t expect to be allayed Stupefaction is not resignation and it is stupefaction to remain in ignorance to shut up all the avenues by which the life of your fellow men might become known to you I am not resigned I am not sure that life is long enough to learn that lesson You are not resigned you are only trying to stupefy yourself Maggie s lips trembled she felt there was some truth in what Philip said and yet there was a deeper consciousness that for any immediate application it had to her conduct it was no better than falsity Her double impression corresponded to the double impulse of the speaker Philip seriously believed what he said but he said it with vehemence because it made an argument against the resolution that opposed his wishes But Maggie s face made more childlike by the gathering tears touched him with a tenderer less egotistic feeling He took her hand and said gently Don t let us think of such things in this short half hour Maggie Let us only care about being together We shall be friends in spite of separation We shall always think of each other I shall be glad to live as long as you are alive because I shall think there may always come a time when I can when you will let me help you in some way What a dear good brother you would have been Philip said Maggie smiling through the haze of tears I think you would have made as much fuss about me and been as pleased for me to love you as would have satisfied even me You would have loved me well enough to bear with me and forgive me everything That was what I always longed that Tom should do I was never satisfied with a little of anything That is why it is better for me to do without earthly happiness altogether I never felt that I had enough music I wanted more instruments playing together I wanted voices to be fuller and deeper Do you ever sing now Philip she added abruptly as if she had forgotten what went before Yes he said every day almost But my voice is only middling like everything else in me Oh sing me something just one song I may listen to that before I go something you used to sing at Lorton on a Saturday afternoon when we had the drawing room all to ourselves and I put my apron over my head to listen I know said Philip and Maggie buried her face in her hands while he sang sotto voce Love in her eyes sits playing and then said That s it isn t it Oh no I won t stay said Maggie starting up It will only haunt me Let us walk Philip I must go home She moved away so that he was obliged to rise and follow her Maggie he said in a tone of remonstrance don t persist in this wilful senseless privation It makes me wretched to see you benumbing and cramping your nature in this way You were so full of life when you were a child I thought you would be a brilliant woman all wit and bright imagination And it flashes out in your face still until you draw that veil of dull quiescence over it Why do you speak so bitterly to me Philip said Maggie Because I foresee it will not end well you can never carry on this self torture I shall have strength given me said Maggie tremulously No you will not Maggie no one has strength given to do what is unnatural It is mere cowardice to seek safety in negations No character becomes strong in that way You will be thrown into the world some day and then every rational satisfaction of your nature that you deny now will assault you like a savage appetite Maggie started and paused looking at Philip with alarm in her face Philip how dare you shake me in this way You are a tempter No I am not but love gives insight Maggie and insight often gives foreboding Listen to me let me supply you with books do let me see you sometimes be your brother and teacher as you said at Lorton It is less wrong that you should see me than that you should be committing this long suicide Maggie felt unable to speak She shook her head and walked on in silence till they came to the end of the Scotch firs and she put out her hand in sign of parting Do you banish me from this place forever then Maggie Surely I may come and walk in it sometimes If I meet you by chance there is no concealment in that It is the moment when our resolution seems about to become irrevocable when the fatal iron gates are about to close upon us that tests our strength Then after hours of clear reasoning and firm conviction we snatch at any sophistry that will nullify our long struggles and bring us the defeat that we love better than victory Maggie felt her heart leap at this subterfuge of Philip s and there passed over her face that almost imperceptible shock which accompanies any relief He saw it and they parted in silence Philip s sense of the situation was too complete for him not to be visited with glancing fears lest he had been intervening too presumptuously in the action of Maggie s conscience perhaps for a selfish end But no he persuaded himself his end was not selfish He had little hope that Maggie would ever return the strong feeling he had for her and it must be better for Maggie s future life when these petty family obstacles to her freedom had disappeared that the present should not be entirely sacrificed and that she should have some opportunity of culture some interchange with a mind above the vulgar level of those she was now condemned to live with If we only look far enough off for the consequence of our actions we can always find some point in the combination of results by which those actions can be justified by adopting the point of view of a Providence who arranges results or of a philosopher who traces them we shall find it possible to obtain perfect complacency in choosing to do what is most agreeable to us in the present moment And it was in this way that Philip justified his subtle efforts to overcome Maggie s true prompting against a concealment that would introduce doubleness into her own mind and might cause new misery to those who had the primary natural claim on her But there was a surplus of passion in him that made him half independent of justifying motives His longing to see Maggie and make an element in her life had in it some of that savage impulse to snatch an offered joy which springs from a life in which the mental and bodily constitution have made pain predominate He had not his full share in the common good of men he could not even pass muster with the insignificant but must be singled out for pity and excepted from what was a matter of course with others Even to Maggie he was an exception it was clear that the thought of his being her lover had never entered her mind Do not think too hardly of Philip Ugly and deformed people have great need of unusual virtues because they are likely to be extremely uncomfortable without them but the theory that unusual virtues spring by a direct consequence out of personal disadvantages as animals get thicker wool in severe climates is perhaps a little overstrained The temptations of beauty are much dwelt upon but I fancy they only bear the same relation to those of ugliness as the temptation to excess at a feast where the delights are varied for eye and ear as well as palate bears to the temptations that assail the desperation of hunger Does not the Hunger Tower stand as the type of the utmost trial to what is human in us Philip had never been soothed by that mother s love which flows out to us in the greater abundance because our need is greater which clings to us the more tenderly because we are the less likely to be winners in the game of life and the sense of his father s affection and indulgence toward him was marred by the keener perception of his father s faults Kept aloof from all practical life as Philip had been and by nature half feminine in sensitiveness he had some of the woman s intolerant repulsion toward worldliness and the deliberate pursuit of sensual enjoyment and this one strong natural tie in his life his relation as a son was like an aching limb to him Perhaps there is inevitably something morbid in a human being who is in any way unfavorably excepted from ordinary conditions until the good force has had time to triumph and it has rarely had time for that at two and twenty That force was present in Philip in much strength but the sun himself looks feeble through the morning mists Chapter IV Another Love Scene Early in the following April nearly a year after that dubious parting you have just witnessed you may if you like again see Maggie entering the Red Deeps through the group of Scotch firs But it is early afternoon and not evening and the edge of sharpness in the spring air makes her draw her large shawl close about her and trip along rather quickly though she looks round as usual that she may take in the sight of her beloved trees There is a more eager inquiring look in her eyes than there was last June and a smile is hovering about her lips as if some playful speech were awaiting the right hearer The hearer was not long in appearing Take back your Corinne said Maggie drawing a book from under her shawl You were right in telling me she would do me no good but you were wrong in thinking I should wish to be like her Wouldn t you really like to be a tenth Muse then Maggie said Philip looking up in her face as we look at a first parting in the clouds that promises us a bright heaven once more Not at all said Maggie laughing The Muses were uncomfortable goddesses I think obliged always to carry rolls and musical instruments about with them If I carried a harp in this climate you know I must have a green baize cover for it and I should be sure to leave it behind me by mistake You agree with me in not liking Corinne then I didn t finish the book said Maggie As soon as I came to the blond haired young lady reading in the park I shut it up and determined to read no further I foresaw that that light complexioned girl would win away all the love from Corinne and make her miserable I m determined to read no more books where the blond haired women carry away all the happiness I should begin to have a prejudice against them If you could give me some story now where the dark woman triumphs it would restore the balance I want to avenge Rebecca and Flora MacIvor and Minna and all the rest of the dark unhappy ones Since you are my tutor you ought to preserve my mind from prejudices you are always arguing against prejudices Well perhaps you will avenge the dark women in your own person and carry away all the love from your cousin Lucy She is sure to have some handsome young man of saint Ogg s at her feet now and you have only to shine upon him your fair little cousin will be quite quenched in your beams Philip that is not pretty of you to apply my nonsense to anything real said Maggie looking hurt As if I with my old gowns and want of all accomplishments could be a rival of dear little Lucy who knows and does all sorts of charming things and is ten times prettier than I am even if I were odious and base enough to wish to be her rival Besides I never go to aunt Deane s when any one is there it is only because dear Lucy is good and loves me that she comes to see me and will have me go to see her sometimes Maggie said Philip with surprise it is not like you to take playfulness literally You must have been in saint Ogg s this morning and brought away a slight infection of dulness Well said Maggie smiling if you meant that for a joke it was a poor one but I thought it was a very good reproof I thought you wanted to remind me that I am vain and wish every one to admire me most But it isn t for that that I m jealous for the dark women not because I m dark myself it s because I always care the most about the unhappy people If the blond girl were forsaken I should like her best I always take the side of the rejected lover in the stories Then you would never have the heart to reject one yourself should you Maggie said Philip flushing a little I don t know said Maggie hesitatingly Then with a bright smile I think perhaps I could if he were very conceited and yet if he got extremely humiliated afterward I should relent I ve often wondered Maggie Philip said with some effort whether you wouldn t really be more likely to love a man that other women were not likely to love That would depend on what they didn t like him for said Maggie laughing He might be very disagreeable He might look at me through an eye glass stuck in his eye making a hideous face as young Torry does I should think other women are not fond of that but I never felt any pity for young Torry I ve never any pity for conceited people because I think they carry their comfort about with them But suppose Maggie suppose it was a man who was not conceited who felt he had nothing to be conceited about who had been marked from childhood for a peculiar kind of suffering and to whom you were the day star of his life who loved you worshipped you so entirely that he felt it happiness enough for him if you would let him see you at rare moments Philip paused with a pang of dread lest his confession should cut short this very happiness a pang of the same dread that had kept his love mute through long months A rush of self consciousness told him that he was besotted to have said all this Maggie s manner this morning had been as unconstrained and indifferent as ever But she was not looking indifferent now Struck with the unusual emotion in Philip s tone she had turned quickly to look at him and as he went on speaking a great change came over her face a flush and slight spasm of the features such as we see in people who hear some news that will require them to readjust their conceptions of the past She was quite silent and walking on toward the trunk of a fallen tree she sat down as if she had no strength to spare for her muscles She was trembling Maggie said Philip getting more and more alarmed in every fresh moment of silence I was a fool to say it forget that I ve said it I shall be contented if things can be as they were The distress with which he spoke urged Maggie to say something I am so surprised Philip I had not thought of it And the effort to say this brought the tears down too Has it made you hate me Maggie said Philip impetuously Do you think I m a presumptuous fool Oh Philip said Maggie how can you think I have such feelings As if I were not grateful for any love But but I had never thought of your being my lover It seemed so far off like a dream only like one of the stories one imagines that I should ever have a lover Then can you bear to think of me as your lover Maggie said Philip seating himself by her and taking her hand in the elation of a sudden hope Do you love me Maggie turned rather pale this direct question seemed not easy to answer But her eyes met Philip s which were in this moment liquid and beautiful with beseeching love She spoke with hesitation yet with sweet simple girlish tenderness I think I could hardly love any one better there is nothing but what I love you for She paused a little while and then added But it will be better for us not to say any more about it won t it dear Philip You know we couldn t even be friends if our friendship were discovered I have never felt that I was right in giving way about seeing you though it has been so precious to me in some ways and now the fear comes upon me strongly again that it will lead to evil But no evil has come Maggie and if you had been guided by that fear before you would only have lived through another dreary benumbing year instead of reviving into your real self Maggie shook her head It has been very sweet I know all the talking together and the books and the feeling that I had the walk to look forward to when I could tell you the thoughts that had come into my head while I was away from you But it has made me restless it has made me think a great deal about the world and I have impatient thoughts again I get weary of my home and then it cuts me to the heart afterward that I should ever have felt weary of my father and mother I think what you call being benumbed was better better for me for then my selfish desires were benumbed Philip had risen again and was walking backward and forward impatiently No Maggie you have wrong ideas of self conquest as I ve often told you What you call self conquest binding and deafening yourself to all but one train of impressions is only the culture of monomania in a nature like yours He had spoken with some irritation but now he sat down by her again and took her hand Don t think of the past now Maggie think only of our love If you can really cling to me with all your heart every obstacle will be overcome in time we need only wait I can live on hope Look at me Maggie tell me again it is possible for you to love me Don t look away from me to that cloven tree it is a bad omen She turned her large dark glance upon him with a sad smile Come Maggie say one kind word or else you were better to me at Lorton You asked me if I should like you to kiss me don t you remember and you promised to kiss me when you met me again You never kept the promise The recollection of that childish time came as a sweet relief to Maggie It made the present moment less strange to her She kissed him almost as simply and quietly as she had done when she was twelve years old Philip s eyes flashed with delight but his next words were words of discontent You don t seem happy enough Maggie you are forcing yourself to say you love me out of pity No Philip said Maggie shaking her head in her old childish way I m telling you the truth It is all new and strange to me but I don t think I could love any one better than I love you I should like always to live with you to make you happy I have always been happy when I have been with you There is only one thing I will not do for your sake I will never do anything to wound my father You must never ask that from me No Maggie I will ask nothing I will bear everything I ll wait another year only for a kiss if you will only give me the first place in your heart No said Maggie smiling I won t make you wait so long as that But then looking serious again she added as she rose from her seat But what would your own father say Philip Oh it is quite impossible we can ever be more than friends brother and sister in secret as we have been Let us give up thinking of everything else No Maggie I can t give you up unless you are deceiving me unless you really only care for me as if I were your brother Tell me the truth Indeed I do Philip What happiness have I ever had so great as being with you since I was a little girl the days Tom was good to me And your mind is a sort of world to me you can tell me all I want to know I think I should never be tired of being with you They were walking hand in hand looking at each other Maggie indeed was hurrying along for she felt it time to be gone But the sense that their parting was near made her more anxious lest she should have unintentionally left some painful impression on Philip s mind It was one of those dangerous moments when speech is at once sincere and deceptive when feeling rising high above its average depth leaves floodmarks which are never reached again They stopped to part among the Scotch firs Then my life will be filled with hope Maggie and I shall be happier than other men in spite of all We do belong to each other for always whether we are apart or together Yes Philip I should like never to part I should like to make your life very happy I am waiting for something else I wonder whether it will come Maggie smiled with glistening tears and then stooped her tall head to kiss the pale face that was full of pleading timid love like a woman s She had a moment of real happiness then a moment of belief that if there were sacrifice in this love it was all the richer and more satisfying She turned away and hurried home feeling that in the hour since she had trodden this road before a new era had begun for her The tissue of vague dreams must now get narrower and narrower and all the threads of thought and emotion be gradually absorbed in the woof of her actual daily life Chapter V The Cloven Tree Secrets are rarely betrayed or discovered according to any programme our fear has sketched out Fear is almost always haunted by terrible dramatic scenes which recur in spite of the best argued probabilities against them and during a year that Maggie had had the burthen of concealment on her mind the possibility of discovery had continually presented itself under the form of a sudden meeting with her father or Tom when she was walking with Philip in the Red Deeps She was aware that this was not one of the most likely events but it was the scene that most completely symbolized her inward dread Those slight indirect suggestions which are dependent on apparently trivial coincidences and incalculable states of mind are the favorite machinery of Fact but are not the stuff in which Imagination is apt to work Certainly one of the persons about whom Maggie s fears were furthest from troubling themselves was her aunt Pullet on whom seeing that she did not live in saint Ogg s and was neither sharp eyed nor sharp tempered it would surely have been quite whimsical of them to fix rather than on aunt Glegg And yet the channel of fatality the pathway of the lightning was no other than aunt Pullet She did not live at saint Ogg s but the road from Garum Firs lay by the Red Deeps at the end opposite that by which Maggie entered The day after Maggie s last meeting with Philip being a Sunday on which mister Pullet was bound to appear in funeral hatband and scarf at saint Ogg s church missus Pullet made this the occasion of dining with sister Glegg and taking tea with poor sister Tulliver Sunday was the one day in the week on which Tom was at home in the afternoon and today the brighter spirits he had been in of late had flowed over in unusually cheerful open chat with his father and in the invitation Come Magsie you come too when he strolled out with his mother in the garden to see the advancing cherry blossoms He had been better pleased with Maggie since she had been less odd and ascetic he was even getting rather proud of her several persons had remarked in his hearing that his sister was a very fine girl To day there was a peculiar brightness in her face due in reality to an undercurrent of excitement which had as much doubt and pain as pleasure in it but it might pass for a sign of happiness You look very well my dear said aunt Pullet shaking her head sadly as they sat round the tea table I niver thought your girl ud be so good looking Bessy But you must wear pink my dear that blue thing as your aunt Glegg gave you turns you into a crowflower Jane never was tasty Why don t you wear that gown o mine It is so pretty and so smart aunt I think it s too showy for me at least for my other clothes that I must wear with it To be sure it ud be unbecoming if it wasn t well known you ve got them belonging to you as can afford to give you such things when they ve done with em themselves It stands to reason I must give my own niece clothes now and then such things as I buy every year and never wear anything out And as for Lucy there s no giving to her for she s got everything o the choicest sister Deane may well hold her head up though she looks dreadful yallow poor thing I doubt this liver complaint ull carry her off That s what this new vicar this doctor Kenn said in the funeral sermon to day Ah he s a wonderful preacher by all account isn t he Sophy said missus Tulliver Why Lucy had got a collar on this blessed day continued missus Pullet with her eyes fixed in a ruminating manner as I don t say I haven t got as good but I must look out my best to match it Miss Lucy s called the bell o saint Ogg s they say that s a cur ous word observed mister Pullet on whom the mysteries of etymology sometimes fell with an oppressive weight Pooh said mister Tulliver jealous for Maggie she s a small thing not much of a figure But fine feathers make fine birds I see nothing to admire so much in those diminutive women they look silly by the side o the men out o proportion When I chose my wife I chose her the right size neither too little nor too big The poor wife with her withered beauty smiled complacently But the men aren t all big said uncle Pullet not without some self reference a young fellow may be good looking and yet not be a six foot like Master Tom here Ah it s poor talking about littleness and bigness anybody may think it s a mercy they re straight said aunt Pullet There s that mismade son o Lawyer Wakem s I saw him at church to day Dear dear to think o the property he s like to have and they say he s very queer and lonely doesn t like much company I shouldn t wonder if he goes out of his mind for we never come along the road but he s a scrambling out o the trees and brambles at the Red Deeps This wide statement by which missus Pullet represented the fact that she had twice seen Philip at the spot indicated produced an effect on Maggie which was all the stronger because Tom sate opposite her and she was intensely anxious to look indifferent At Philip s name she had blushed and the blush deepened every instant from consciousness until the mention of the Red Deeps made her feel as if the whole secret were betrayed and she dared not even hold her tea spoon lest she should show how she trembled She sat with her hands clasped under the table not daring to look round Happily her father was seated on the same side with herself beyond her uncle Pullet and could not see her face without stooping forward Her mother s voice brought the first relief turning the conversation for missus Tulliver was always alarmed when the name of Wakem was mentioned in her husband s presence Gradually Maggie recovered composure enough to look up her eyes met Tom s but he turned away his head immediately and she went to bed that night wondering if he had gathered any suspicion from her confusion Perhaps not perhaps he would think it was only her alarm at her aunt s mention of Wakem before her father that was the interpretation her mother had put in it To her father Wakem was like a disfiguring disease of which he was obliged to endure the consciousness but was exasperated to have the existence recognized by others and no amount of sensitiveness in her about her father could be surprising Maggie thought But Tom was too keen sighted to rest satisfied with such an interpretation he had seen clearly enough that there was something distinct from anxiety about her father in Maggie s excessive confusion In trying to recall all the details that could give shape to his suspicions he remembered only lately hearing his mother scold Maggie for walking in the Red Deeps when the ground was wet and bringing home shoes clogged with red soil still Tom retaining all his old repulsion for Philip s deformity shrank from attributing to his sister the probability of feeling more than a friendly interest in such an unfortunate exception to the common run of men Tom s was a nature which had a sort of superstitious repugnance to everything exceptional A love for a deformed man would be odious in any woman in a sister intolerable But if she had been carrying on any kind of intercourse whatever with Philip a stop must be put to it at once she was disobeying her father s strongest feelings and her brother s express commands besides compromising herself by secret meetings He left home the next morning in that watchful state of mind which turns the most ordinary course of things into pregnant coincidences That afternoon about half past three o clock Tom was standing on the wharf talking with Bob Jakin about the probability of the good ship Adelaide coming in in a day or two with results highly important to both of them Eh said Bob parenthetically as he looked over the fields on the other side of the river there goes that crooked young Wakem I know him or his shadder as far off as I can see em I m allays lighting on him o that side the river A sudden thought seemed to have darted through Tom s mind I must go Bob he said I ve something to attend to hurrying off to the warehouse where he left notice for some one to take his place he was called away home on peremptory business The swiftest pace and the shortest road took him to the gate and he was pausing to open it deliberately that he might walk into the house with an appearance of perfect composure when Maggie came out at the front door in bonnet and shawl His conjecture was fulfilled and he waited for her at the gate She started violently when she saw him Tom how is it you are come home Is there anything the matter Maggie spoke in a low tremulous voice I m come to walk with you to the Red Deeps and meet Philip Wakem said Tom the central fold in his brow which had become habitual with him deepening as he spoke Maggie stood helpless pale and cold By some means then Tom knew everything At last she said I m not going and turned round Yes you are but I want to speak to you first Where is my father Out on horseback And my mother In the yard I think with the poultry I can go in then without her seeing me They walked in together and Tom entering the parlor said to Maggie Come in here She obeyed and he closed the door behind her Now Maggie tell me this instant everything that has passed between you and Philip Wakem Does my father know anything said Maggie still trembling No said Tom indignantly But he shall know if you attempt to use deceit toward me any further I don t wish to use deceit said Maggie flushing into resentment at hearing this word applied to her conduct Tell me the whole truth then Perhaps you know it Never mind whether I know it or not Tell me exactly what has happened or my father shall know everything I tell it for my father s sake then Yes it becomes you to profess affection for your father when you have despised his strongest feelings You never do wrong Tom said Maggie tauntingly Not if I know it answered Tom with proud sincerity But I have nothing to say to you beyond this tell me what has passed between you and Philip Wakem When did you first meet him in the Red Deeps A year ago said Maggie quietly Tom s severity gave her a certain fund of defiance and kept her sense of error in abeyance You need ask me no more questions We have been friendly a year We have met and walked together often He has lent me books Is that all said Tom looking straight at her with his frown Maggie paused a moment then determined to make an end of Tom s right to accuse her of deceit she said haughtily No not quite all On Saturday he told me that he loved me I didn t think of it before then I had only thought of him as an old friend And you encouraged him said Tom with an expression of disgust I told him that I loved him too Tom was silent a few moments looking on the ground and frowning with his hands in his pockets At last he looked up and said coldly Now then Maggie there are but two courses for you to take either you vow solemnly to me with your hand on my father s Bible that you will never have another meeting or speak another word in private with Philip Wakem or you refuse and I tell my father everything and this month when by my exertions he might be made happy once more you will cause him the blow of knowing that you are a disobedient deceitful daughter who throws away her own respectability by clandestine meetings with the son of a man that has helped to ruin her father Choose Tom ended with cold decision going up to the large Bible drawing it forward and opening it at the fly leaf where the writing was It was a crushing alternative to Maggie Tom she said urged out of pride into pleading don t ask me that I will promise you to give up all intercourse with Philip if you will let me see him once or even only write to him and explain everything to give it up as long as it would ever cause any pain to my father I feel something for Philip too He is not happy I don t wish to hear anything of your feelings I have said exactly what I mean Choose and quickly lest my mother should come in If I give you my word that will be as strong a bond to me as if I laid my hand on the Bible I don t require that to bind me Do what I require said Tom I can t trust you Maggie There is no consistency in you Put your hand on this Bible and say I renounce all private speech and intercourse with Philip Wakem from this time forth Else you will bring shame on us all and grief on my father and what is the use of my exerting myself and giving up everything else for the sake of paying my father s debts if you are to bring madness and vexation on him just when he might be easy and hold up his head once more Oh Tom will the debts be paid soon said Maggie clasping her hands with a sudden flash of joy across her wretchedness If things turn out as I expect said Tom But he added his voice trembling with indignation while I have been contriving and working that my father may have some peace of mind before he dies working for the respectability of our family you have done all you can to destroy both Maggie felt a deep movement of compunction for the moment her mind ceased to contend against what she felt to be cruel and unreasonable and in her self blame she justified her brother Tom she said in a low voice it was wrong of me but I was so lonely and I was sorry for Philip And I think enmity and hatred are wicked Nonsense said Tom Your duty was clear enough Say no more but promise in the words I told you I must speak to Philip once more You will go with me now and speak to him I give you my word not to meet him or write to him again without your knowledge That is the only thing I will say I will put my hand on the Bible if you like Say it then Maggie laid her hand on the page of manuscript and repeated the promise Tom closed the book and said Now let us go Not a word was spoken as they walked along Maggie was suffering in anticipation of what Philip was about to suffer and dreading the galling words that would fall on him from Tom s lips but she felt it was in vain to attempt anything but submission Tom had his terrible clutch on her conscience and her deepest dread she writhed under the demonstrable truth of the character he had given to her conduct and yet her whole soul rebelled against it as unfair from its incompleteness He meanwhile felt the impetus of his indignation diverted toward Philip He did not know how much of an old boyish repulsion and of mere personal pride and animosity was concerned in the bitter severity of the words by which he meant to do the duty of a son and a brother Tom was not given to inquire subtly into his own motives any more than into other matters of an intangible kind he was quite sure that his own motives as well as actions were good else he would have had nothing to do with them Maggie s only hope was that something might for the first time have prevented Philip from coming Then there would be delay then she might get Tom s permission to write to him Her heart beat with double violence when they got under the Scotch firs It was the last moment of suspense she thought Philip always met her soon after she got beyond them But they passed across the more open green space and entered the narrow bushy path by the mound Another turning and they came so close upon him that both Tom and Philip stopped suddenly within a yard of each other There was a moment s silence in which Philip darted a look of inquiry at Maggie s face He saw an answer there in the pale parted lips and the terrified tension of the large eyes Her imagination always rushing extravagantly beyond an immediate impression saw her tall strong brother grasping the feeble Philip bodily crushing him and trampling on him Do you call this acting the part of a man and a gentleman sir Tom said in a voice of harsh scorn as soon as Philip s eyes were turned on him again What do you mean answered Philip haughtily Mean Stand farther from me lest I should lay hands on you and I ll tell you what I mean I mean taking advantage of a young girl s foolishness and ignorance to get her to have secret meetings with you I mean daring to trifle with the respectability of a family that has a good and honest name to support I deny that interrupted Philip impetuously I could never trifle with anything that affected your sister s happiness She is dearer to me than she is to you I honor her more than you can ever honor her I would give up my life to her Don t talk high flown nonsense to me sir Do you mean to pretend that you didn t know it would be injurious to her to meet you here week after week Do you pretend you had any right to make professions of love to her even if you had been a fit husband for her when neither her father nor your father would ever consent to a marriage between you And you you to try and worm yourself into the affections of a handsome girl who is not eighteen and has been shut out from the world by her father s misfortunes That s your crooked notion of honor is it I call it base treachery I call it taking advantage of circumstances to win what s too good for you what you d never get by fair means It is manly of you to talk in this way to me said Philip bitterly his whole frame shaken by violent emotions Giants have an immemorial right to stupidity and insolent abuse You are incapable even of understanding what I feel for your sister I feel so much for her that I could even desire to be at friendship with you I should be very sorry to understand your feelings said Tom with scorching contempt What I wish is that you should understand me that I shall take care of my sister and that if you dare to make the least attempt to come near her or to write to her or to keep the slightest hold on her mind your puny miserable body that ought to have put some modesty into your mind shall not protect you I ll thrash you I ll hold you up to public scorn Who wouldn t laugh at the idea of your turning lover to a fine girl Tom and Maggie walked on in silence for some yards He burst out in a convulsed voice Stay Maggie said Philip making a strong effort to speak Then looking at Tom You have dragged your sister here I suppose that she may stand by while you threaten and insult me These naturally seemed to you the right means to influence me But you are mistaken Let your sister speak If she says she is bound to give me up I shall abide by her wishes to the slightest word It was for my father s sake Philip said Maggie imploringly Tom threatens to tell my father and he couldn t bear it I have promised I have vowed solemnly that we will not have any intercourse without my brother s knowledge It is enough Maggie I shall not change but I wish you to hold yourself entirely free But trust me remember that I can never seek for anything but good to what belongs to you Yes said Tom exasperated by this attitude of Philip s you can talk of seeking good for her and what belongs to her now did you seek her good before I did at some risk perhaps But I wished her to have a friend for life who would cherish her who would do her more justice than a coarse and narrow minded brother that she has always lavished her affections on Yes my way of befriending her is different from yours and I ll tell you what is my way I ll save her from disobeying and disgracing her father I ll save her from throwing herself away on you from making herself a laughing stock from being flouted by a man like your father because she s not good enough for his son You know well enough what sort of justice and cherishing you were preparing for her I m not to be imposed upon by fine words I can see what actions mean Come away Maggie He seized Maggie s right wrist as he spoke and she put out her left hand Philip clasped it an instant with one eager look and then hurried away Tom and Maggie walked on in silence for some yards He was still holding her wrist tightly as if he were compelling a culprit from the scene of action At last Maggie with a violent snatch drew her hand away and her pent up long gathered irritation burst into utterance Don t suppose that I think you are right Tom or that I bow to your will I despise the feelings you have shown in speaking to Philip I detest your insulting unmanly allusions to his deformity You have been reproaching other people all your life you have been always sure you yourself are right It is because you have not a mind large enough to see that there is anything better than your own conduct and your own petty aims Certainly said Tom coolly I don t see that your conduct is better or your aims either If your conduct and Philip Wakem s conduct has been right why are you ashamed of its being known Answer me that I know what I have aimed at in my conduct and I ve succeeded pray what good has your conduct brought to you or any one else I don t want to defend myself said Maggie still with vehemence I know I ve been wrong often continually But yet sometimes when I have done wrong it has been because I have feelings that you would be the better for if you had them If you were in fault ever if you had done anything very wrong I should be sorry for the pain it brought you I should not want punishment to be heaped on you But you have always enjoyed punishing me you have always been hard and cruel to me even when I was a little girl and always loved you better than any one else in the world you would let me go crying to bed without forgiving me You have no pity you have no sense of your own imperfection and your own sins It is a sin to be hard it is not fitting for a mortal for a Christian You are nothing but a Pharisee You thank God for nothing but your own virtues you think they are great enough to win you everything else You have not even a vision of feelings by the side of which your shining virtues are mere darkness Well said Tom with cold scorn if your feelings are so much better than mine let me see you show them in some other way than by conduct that s likely to disgrace us all than by ridiculous flights first into one extreme and then into another Pray how have you shown your love that you talk of either to me or my father By disobeying and deceiving us I have a different way of showing my affection Because you are a man Tom and have power and can do something in the world Then if you can do nothing submit to those that can So I will submit to what I acknowledge and feel to be right I will submit even to what is unreasonable from my father but I will not submit to it from you You boast of your virtues as if they purchased you a right to be cruel and unmanly as you ve been to day Don t suppose I would give up Philip Wakem in obedience to you The deformity you insult would make me cling to him and care for him the more Very well that is your view of things said Tom more coldly than ever you need say no more to show me what a wide distance there is between us Let us remember that in future and be silent Tom went back to saint Ogg s to fulfill an appointment with his uncle Deane and receive directions about a journey on which he was to set out the next morning Maggie went up to her own room to pour out all that indignant remonstrance against which Tom s mind was close barred in bitter tears Then when the first burst of unsatisfied anger was gone by came the recollection of that quiet time before the pleasure which had ended in to day s misery had perturbed the clearness and simplicity of her life She used to think in that time that she had made great conquests and won a lasting stand on serene heights above worldly temptations and conflict And here she was down again in the thick of a hot strife with her own and others passions Life was not so short then and perfect rest was not so near as she had dreamed when she was two years younger There was more struggle for her and perhaps more falling If she had felt that she was entirely wrong and that Tom had been entirely right she could sooner have recovered more inward harmony but now her penitence and submission were constantly obstructed by resentment that would present itself to her no otherwise than as a just indignation Her heart bled for Philip she went on recalling the insults that had been flung at him with so vivid a conception of what he had felt under them that it was almost like a sharp bodily pain to her making her beat the floor with her foot and tighten her fingers on her palm And yet how was it that she was now and then conscious of a certain dim background of relief in the forced separation from Philip Surely it was only because the sense of a deliverance from concealment was welcome at any cost Chapter VI The Hard Won Triumph 
2485-151992-0000	train-other-500	Three weeks later when Dorlcote Mill was at its prettiest moment in all the year the great chestnuts in blossom and the grass all deep and daisied
none	none	 Tom Tulliver came home to it earlier than usual in the evening and as he passed over the bridge he looked with the old deep rooted affection at the respectable red brick house which always seemed cheerful and inviting outside 
2485-151992-0001	train-other-500	let the rooms be as bare and the hearts as sad as they might inside There is a very pleasant light in Tom s blue gray eyes as he glances at the house windows that fold in his brow never disappears but it is not unbecoming
2485-151992-0002	train-other-500	it seems to imply a strength of will that may possibly be without harshness when the eyes and mouth have their gentlest expression His firm step becomes quicker and the corners of his mouth rebel against the compression which is meant to forbid a smile
2485-151992-0003	train-other-500	The eyes in the parlor were not turned toward the bridge just then and the group there was sitting in unexpectant silence mister Tulliver in his arm chair tired with a long ride and ruminating with a worn look fixed chiefly on Maggie
2485-151992-0004	train-other-500	who was bending over her sewing while her mother was making the tea They all looked up with surprise when they heard the well known foot Why what s up now Tom said his father You re a bit earlier than usual Oh there was nothing more for me to do so I came away
none	none	 Well mother Tom went up to his mother and kissed her a sign of unusual good humor with him Hardly a word or look had passed between him and Maggie in all the three weeks but his usual incommunicativeness at home prevented this from being noticeable to their parents 
2485-151992-0005	train-other-500	Father said Tom when they had finished tea do you know exactly how much money there is in the tin box Only a hundred and ninety three pound said mister Tulliver You ve brought less o late but young fellows like to have their own way with their money
2485-151992-0006	train-other-500	Though I didn t do as I liked before I was of age He spoke with rather timid discontent Are you quite sure that s the sum father said Tom I wish you would take the trouble to fetch the tin box down
2485-151992-0007	train-other-500	I think you have perhaps made a mistake How should I make a mistake said his father sharply I ve counted it often enough but I can fetch it if you won t believe me It was always an incident mister Tulliver liked in his gloomy life to fetch the tin box and count the money
2485-151992-0008	train-other-500	Don t go out of the room mother said Tom as he saw her moving when his father was gone upstairs And isn t Maggie to go said missus Tulliver because somebody must take away the things Just as she likes said Tom indifferently
2485-151992-0009	train-other-500	That was a cutting word to Maggie Her heart had leaped with the sudden conviction that Tom was going to tell their father the debts could be paid and Tom would have let her be absent when that news was told But she carried away the tray and came back immediately
none	none	 The feeling of injury on her own behalf could not predominate at that moment Tom drew to the corner of the table near his father when the tin box was set down and opened and the red evening light falling on them made conspicuous the worn sour gloom of the dark eyed father and the suppressed joy in the face of the fair complexioned son 
2485-151992-0010	train-other-500	The mother and Maggie sat at the other end of the table the one in blank patience the other in palpitating expectation mister Tulliver counted out the money setting it in order on the table and then said glancing sharply at Tom There now
2485-151992-0011	train-other-500	you see I was right enough He paused looking at the money with bitter despondency There s more nor three hundred wanting it ll be a fine while before I can save that Losing that forty two pound wi the corn was a sore job
2485-151992-0012	train-other-500	This world s been too many for me It s took four year to lay this by it s much if I m above ground for another four year I must trusten to you to pay em he went on with a trembling voice
none	none	 if you keep i the same mind now you re coming o age 
2485-151992-0013	train-other-500	But you re like enough to bury me first He looked up in Tom s face with a querulous desire for some assurance No father said Tom speaking with energetic decision though there was tremor discernible in his voice too
2485-151992-0014	train-other-500	you will live to see the debts all paid You shall pay them with your own hand His tone implied something more than mere hopefulness or resolution A slight electric shock seemed to pass through mister Tulliver
2485-151992-0015	train-other-500	and he kept his eyes fixed on Tom with a look of eager inquiry while Maggie unable to restrain herself rushed to her father s side and knelt down by him Tom was silent a little while before he went on
2485-151992-0016	train-other-500	A good while ago my uncle Glegg lent me a little money to trade with and that has answered I have three hundred and twenty pounds in the bank His mother s arms were round his neck as soon as the last words were uttered and she said half crying
none	none	 Oh my boy I knew you d make iverything right again when you got a man 
2485-151992-0017	train-other-500	But his father was silent the flood of emotion hemmed in all power of speech Both Tom and Maggie were struck with fear lest the shock of joy might even be fatal But the blessed relief of tears came The broad chest heaved the muscles of the face gave way
2485-151992-0018	train-other-500	and the gray haired man burst into loud sobs The fit of weeping gradually subsided and he sat quiet recovering the regularity of his breathing At last he looked up at his wife and said in a gentle tone Bessy you must come and kiss me now
none	none	 the lad has made you amends You ll see a bit o comfort again belike When she had kissed him and he had held her hand a minute his thoughts went back to the money I wish you d brought me the money to look at Tom he said fingering the sovereigns on the table I should ha felt surer 
2485-151992-0019	train-other-500	You shall see it to morrow father said Tom
none	none	 My uncle Deane has appointed the creditors to meet to morrow at the Golden Lion 
2485-151992-0020	train-other-500	and he has ordered a dinner for them at two o clock My uncle Glegg and he will both be there It was advertised in the Messenger on Saturday Then Wakem knows on t said mister Tulliver his eye kindling with triumphant fire
2485-151992-0021	train-other-500	Ah he went on with a long drawn guttural enunciation taking out his snuff box the only luxury he had left himself and tapping it with something of his old air of defiance I ll get from under his thumb now though I must leave the old mill
none	none	 I thought I could ha held out to die here but I can t we ve got a glass o nothing in the house have we Bessy Yes said missus Tulliver drawing out her much reduced bunch of keys there s some brandy sister Deane brought me when I was ill Get it me then get it me I feel a bit weak Tom my lad he said in a stronger voice when he had taken some brandy and water you shall make a speech to em I ll tell em it s you as got the best part o the money They ll see I m honest at last and ha got an honest son Ah Wakem ud be fine and glad to have a son like mine a fine straight fellow i stead o that poor crooked creatur You ll prosper i the world my lad you ll maybe see the day when Wakem and his son ull be a round or two below you You ll like enough be ta en into partnership as your uncle Deane was before you you re in the right way for t 
2485-151992-0023	train-other-500	and then there s nothing to hinder your getting rich And if ever you re rich enough mind this
none	none	 try and get th old mill again 
2485-151992-0024	train-other-500	mister Tulliver threw himself back in his chair his mind which had so long been the home of nothing but bitter discontent and foreboding suddenly filled by the magic of joy with visions of good fortune
2485-151992-0025	train-other-500	But some subtle influence prevented him from foreseeing the good fortune as happening to himself Shake hands wi me my lad he said suddenly putting out his hand It s a great thing when a man can be proud as he s got a good son I ve had that luck
2485-151992-0026	train-other-500	Tom never lived to taste another moment so delicious as that and Maggie couldn t help forgetting her own grievances Tom was good and in the sweet humility that springs in us all in moments of true admiration and gratitude
2485-151992-0027	train-other-500	she felt that the faults he had to pardon in her had never been redeemed as his faults were She felt no jealousy this evening that for the first time she seemed to be thrown into the background in her father s mind There was much more talk before bedtime
none	none	 mister Tulliver naturally wanted to hear all the particulars of Tom s trading adventures and he listened with growing excitement and delight He was curious to know what had been said on every occasion if possible what had been thought 
2485-151992-0028	train-other-500	and Bob Jakin s part in the business threw him into peculiar outbursts of sympathy with the triumphant knowingness of that remarkable packman Bob s juvenile history so far as it had come under mister Tulliver s knowledge
2485-151992-0029	train-other-500	was recalled with that sense of astonishing promise it displayed which is observable in all reminiscences of the childhood of great men
2485-151992-0030	train-other-500	It was well that there was this interest of narrative to keep under the vague but fierce sense of triumph over Wakem which would otherwise have been the channel his joy would have rushed into with dangerous force Even as it was
2485-151992-0031	train-other-500	that feeling from time to time gave threats of its ultimate mastery in sudden bursts of irrelevant exclamation It was long before mister Tulliver got to sleep that night and the sleep when it came was filled with vivid dreams At half past five o clock in the morning
2485-151992-0032	train-other-500	when missus Tulliver was already rising he alarmed her by starting up with a sort of smothered shout and looking round in a bewildered way at the walls of the bedroom What s the matter mister Tulliver said his wife He looked at her still with a puzzled expression
none	none	 and said at last Ah I was dreaming did I make a noise I thought I d got hold of him Chapter VII A Day of Reckoning 
2485-151993-0000	train-other-500	mister Tulliver was an essentially sober man able to take his glass and not averse to it but never exceeding the bounds of moderation He had naturally an active Hotspur temperament which did not crave liquid fire to set it aglow
2485-151993-0001	train-other-500	his impetuosity was usually equal to an exciting occasion without any such reinforcements and his desire for the brandy and water implied that the too sudden joy had fallen with a dangerous shock on a frame depressed by four years of gloom and unaccustomed hard fare
2485-151993-0002	train-other-500	But that first doubtful tottering moment passed he seemed to gather strength with his gathering excitement and the next day when he was seated at table with his creditors
2485-151993-0003	train-other-500	his eye kindling and his cheek flushed with the consciousness that he was about to make an honorable figure once more he looked more like the proud confident warm hearted and warm tempered Tulliver of old times than might have seemed possible to any one who had met him a week before
2485-151993-0004	train-other-500	riding along as had been his wont for the last four years since the sense of failure and debt had been upon him with his head hanging down casting brief unwilling looks on those who forced themselves on his notice He made his speech
none	none	 asserting his honest principles with his old confident eagerness alluding to the rascals and the luck that had been against him but that he had triumphed over to some extent by hard efforts and the aid of a good son and winding up with the story of how Tom had got the best part of the needful money 
2485-151993-0005	train-other-500	But the streak of irritation and hostile triumph seemed to melt for a little while into purer fatherly pride and pleasure when Tom s health having been proposed
2485-151993-0006	train-other-500	and uncle Deane having taken occasion to say a few words of eulogy on his general character and conduct Tom himself got up and made the single speech of his life It could hardly have been briefer He thanked the gentlemen for the honor they had done him
2485-151993-0007	train-other-500	He was glad that he had been able to help his father in proving his integrity and regaining his honest name and for his own part he hoped he should never undo that work and disgrace that name But the applause that followed was so great
2485-151993-0008	train-other-500	and Tom looked so gentlemanly as well as tall and straight that mister Tulliver remarked in an explanatory manner to his friends on his right and left that he had spent a deal of money on his son s education
2485-151993-0009	train-other-500	The party broke up in very sober fashion at five o clock Tom remained in saint Ogg s to attend to some business and mister Tulliver mounted his horse to go home and describe the memorable things that had been said and done
none	none	 to poor Bessy and the little wench The air of excitement that hung about him was but faintly due to good cheer or any stimulus but the potent wine of triumphant joy He did not choose any back street to day but rode slowly with uplifted head and free glances along the principal street all the way to the bridge Why did he not happen to meet Wakem The want of that coincidence vexed him 
2485-151993-0010	train-other-500	and set his mind at work in an irritating way Perhaps Wakem was gone out of town to day on purpose to avoid seeing or hearing anything of an honorable action which might well cause him some unpleasant twinges If Wakem were to meet him then
2485-151993-0011	train-other-500	mister Tulliver would look straight at him and the rascal would perhaps be forsaken a little by his cool domineering impudence He would know by and by that an honest man was not going to serve him any longer
none	none	 and lend his honesty to fill a pocket already over full of dishonest gains Perhaps the luck was beginning to turn perhaps the Devil didn t always hold the best cards in this world Simmering in this way mister Tulliver approached the yardgates of Dorlcote Mill 
2485-151993-0012	train-other-500	near enough to see a well known figure coming out of them on a fine black horse They met about fifty yards from the gates
none	none	 between the great chestnuts and elms and the high bank Tulliver said Wakem abruptly in a haughtier tone than usual what a fool s trick you did spreading those hard lumps on that Far Close I told you how it would be but you men never learn to farm with any method 
2485-151993-0013	train-other-500	Oh said Tulliver suddenly boiling up get somebody else to farm for you then as ll ask you to teach him You have been drinking I suppose said Wakem
2485-151993-0014	train-other-500	really believing that this was the meaning of Tulliver s flushed face and sparkling eyes No I ve not been drinking said Tulliver I want no drinking to help me make up my mind as I ll serve no longer under a scoundrel Very well
2485-151993-0015	train-other-500	you may leave my premises to morrow then hold your insolent tongue and let me pass Tulliver was backing his horse across the road to hem Wakem in No I sha n t let you pass said Tulliver getting fiercer I shall tell you what I think of you first
none	none	 You re too big a raskill to get hanged you re Let me pass you ignorant brute or I ll ride over you mister Tulliver spurring his horse and raising his whip made a rush forward and Wakem s horse rearing and staggering backward threw his rider from the saddle and sent him sideways on the ground 
2485-151993-0016	train-other-500	Wakem had had the presence of mind to loose the bridle at once and as the horse only staggered a few paces and then stood still he might have risen and remounted without more inconvenience than a bruise and a shake But before he could rise Tulliver was off his horse too
2485-151993-0017	train-other-500	The sight of the long hated predominant man down and in his power threw him into a frenzy of triumphant vengeance which seemed to give him preternatural agility and strength
none	none	 He rushed on Wakem 
2485-151993-0018	train-other-500	who was in the act of trying to recover his feet grasped him by the left arm so as to press Wakem s whole weight on the right arm which rested on the ground and flogged him fiercely across the back with his riding whip Wakem shouted for help but no help came
none	none	 until a woman s scream was heard and the cry of Father father 
2485-151993-0019	train-other-500	Suddenly Wakem felt something had arrested mister Tulliver s arm for the flogging ceased and the grasp on his own arm was relaxed Get away with you go said Tulliver angrily But it was not to Wakem that he spoke
none	none	 Slowly the lawyer rose and as he turned his head saw that Tulliver s arms were being held by a girl rather by the fear of hurting the girl that clung to him with all her young might Oh Luke mother come and help mister Wakem Maggie cried as she heard the longed for footsteps Help me on to that low horse said Wakem to Luke then I shall perhaps manage though confound it I think this arm is sprained With some difficulty Wakem was heaved on to Tulliver s horse 
2485-151993-0020	train-other-500	Then he turned toward the miller and said with white rage You ll suffer for this sir Your daughter is a witness that you ve assaulted me I don t care said mister Tulliver in a thick fierce voice go and show your back and tell em I thrashed you
none	none	 Tell em I ve made things a bit more even i the world 
2485-151993-0021	train-other-500	Ride my horse home with me said Wakem to Luke By the Tofton Ferry not through the town Father come in said Maggie imploringly Then seeing that Wakem had ridden off and that no further violence was possible
2485-151993-0022	train-other-500	she slackened her hold and burst into hysteric sobs while poor missus Tulliver stood by in silence quivering with fear But Maggie became conscious that as she was slackening her hold her father was beginning to grasp her and lean on her
none	none	 The surprise checked her sobs I feel ill faintish he said Help me in Bessy I m giddy I ve a pain i the head He walked in slowly propped by his wife and daughter and tottered into his arm chair The almost purple flush had given way to paleness and his hand was cold Hadn t we better send for the doctor said missus Tulliver He seemed to be too faint and suffering to hear her but presently when she said to Maggie 
2485-151993-0024	train-other-500	Go and seek for somebody to fetch the doctor he looked up at her with full comprehension and said Doctor No no doctor It s my head that s all Help me to bed
2485-151993-0025	train-other-500	Sad ending to the day that had risen on them all like a beginning of better times But mingled seed must bear a mingled crop In half an hour after his father had lain down Tom came home
2485-151993-0026	train-other-500	Bob Jakin was with him come to congratulate the old master not without some excusable pride that he had had his share in bringing about mister Tom s good luck and Tom had thought his father would like nothing better as a finish to the day than a talk with Bob
2485-151993-0027	train-other-500	But now Tom could only spend the evening in gloomy expectation of the unpleasant consequences that must follow on this mad outbreak of his father s long smothered hate After the painful news had been told he sat in silence
none	none	 he had not spirit or inclination to tell his mother and sister anything about the dinner they hardly cared to ask it Apparently the mingled thread in the web of their life was so curiously twisted together that there could be no joy without a sorrow coming close upon it 
2485-151993-0028	train-other-500	Tom was dejected by the thought that his exemplary effort must always be baffled by the wrong doing of others Maggie was living through over and over again
none	none	 the agony of the moment in which she had rushed to throw herself on her father s arm 
2485-151993-0029	train-other-500	with a vague shuddering foreboding of wretched scenes to come Not one of the three felt any particular alarm about mister Tulliver s health the symptoms did not recall his former dangerous attack
none	none	 and it seemed only a necessary consequence that his violent passion and effort of strength after many hours of unusual excitement should have made him feel ill Rest would probably cure him Tom 
2485-151993-0030	train-other-500	tired out by his active day fell asleep soon and slept soundly it seemed to him as if he had only just come to bed when he waked to see his mother standing by him in the gray light of early morning My boy you must get up this minute
2485-151993-0031	train-other-500	I ve sent for the doctor and your father wants you and Maggie to come to him Is he worse mother He s been very ill all night with his head
none	none	 but he doesn t say it s worse 
2485-151993-0032	train-other-500	he only said suddenly Bessy fetch the boy and girl Tell em to make haste Maggie and Tom threw on their clothes hastily in the chill gray light and reached their father s room almost at the same moment
2485-151993-0033	train-other-500	He was watching for them with an expression of pain on his brow but with sharpened anxious consciousness in his eyes missus Tulliver stood at the foot of the bed frightened and trembling looking worn and aged from disturbed rest
2485-151993-0034	train-other-500	Maggie was at the bedside first but her father s glance was toward Tom who came and stood next to her Tom my lad it s come upon me as I sha n t get up again This world s been too many for me my lad
2485-151993-0035	train-other-500	but you ve done what you could to make things a bit even Shake hands wi me again my lad before I go away from you The father and son clasped hands
none	none	 and looked at each other an instant 
2485-151993-0036	train-other-500	Then Tom said trying to speak firmly Have you any wish father that I can fulfil when Ay my lad you ll try and get the old mill back Yes father And there s your mother
2485-151993-0037	train-other-500	you ll try and make her amends all you can for my bad luck and there s the little wench The father turned his eyes on Maggie with a still more eager look while she with a bursting heart
2485-151993-0038	train-other-500	sank on her knees to be closer to the dear time worn face which had been present with her through long years as the sign of her deepest love and hardest trial You must take care of her Tom don t you fret my wench
2485-151993-0039	train-other-500	there ll come somebody as ll love you and take your part and you must be good to her my lad I was good to my sister Kiss me Maggie Come Bessy You ll manage to pay for a brick grave Tom so as your mother and me can lie together
2485-151993-0040	train-other-500	He looked away from them all when he had said this and lay silent for some minutes
none	none	 while they stood watching him not daring to move 
2485-151993-0041	train-other-500	The morning light was growing clearer for them and they could see the heaviness gathering in his face and the dulness in his eyes But at last he looked toward Tom and said I had my turn I beat him That was nothing but fair
2485-151993-0042	train-other-500	I never wanted anything but what was fair But father dear father said Maggie an unspeakable anxiety predominating over her grief you forgive him you forgive every one now
2485-151993-0043	train-other-500	He did not move his eyes to look at her but he said No my wench I don t forgive him What s forgiving to do I can t love a raskill His voice had become thicker
none	none	 but he wanted to say more and moved his lips again and again struggling in vain to speak At length the words forced their way Does God forgive raskills but if He does He won t be hard wi me 
2485-151993-0044	train-other-500	His hands moved uneasily as if he wanted them to remove some obstruction that weighed upon him Two or three times there fell from him some broken words This world s too many honest man puzzling
2485-151993-0045	train-other-500	Soon they merged into mere mutterings the eyes had ceased to discern and then came the final silence But not of death For an hour or more the chest heaved the loud hard breathing continued
2485-151993-0046	train-other-500	getting gradually slower as the cold dews gathered on the brow At last there was total stillness and poor Tulliver s dimly lighted soul had forever ceased to be vexed with the painful riddle of this world Help was come now
2485-151993-0047	train-other-500	Luke and his wife were there and mister Turnbull had arrived too late for everything but to say This is death Tom and Maggie went downstairs together into the room where their father s place was empty Their eyes turned to the same spot
2485-151993-0048	train-other-500	and Maggie spoke Tom forgive me let us always love each other
none	none	 and they clung and wept together Book VI The Great Temptation Chapter I A Duet in Paradise The well furnished drawing room with the open grand piano and the pleasant outlook down a sloping garden to a boat house by the side of the Floss is mister Deane s The neat little lady in mourning whose light brown ringlets are falling over the colored embroidery with which her fingers are busy is of course Lucy Deane and the fine young man who is leaning down from his chair to snap the scissors in the extremely abbreviated face of the King Charles lying on the young lady s feet is no other than mister Stephen Guest whose diamond ring attar of roses and air of nonchalant leisure at twelve o clock in the day are the graceful and odoriferous result of the largest oil mill and the most extensive wharf in saint Ogg s There is an apparent triviality in the action with the scissors but your discernment perceives at once that there is a design in it which makes it eminently worthy of a large headed long limbed young man for you see that Lucy wants the scissors and is compelled reluctant as she may be to shake her ringlets back raise her soft hazel eyes smile playfully down on the face that is so very nearly on a level with her knee and holding out her little shell pink palm to say My scissors please if you can renounce the great pleasure of persecuting my poor Minny The foolish scissors have slipped too far over the knuckles it seems and Hercules holds out his entrapped fingers hopelessly Confound the scissors The oval lies the wrong way Please draw them off for me Draw them off with your other hand says Miss Lucy roguishly Oh but that s my left hand I m not left handed Lucy laughs and the scissors are drawn off with gentle touches from tiny tips which naturally dispose mister Stephen for a repetition da capo Accordingly he watches for the release of the scissors that he may get them into his possession again No no said Lucy sticking them in her band you shall not have my scissors again you have strained them already Now don t set Minny growling again Sit up and behave properly and then I will tell you some news What is that said Stephen throwing himself back and hanging his right arm over the corner of his chair He might have been sitting for his portrait which would have represented a rather striking young man of five and twenty with a square forehead short dark brown hair standing erect with a slight wave at the end like a thick crop of corn and a half ardent half sarcastic glance from under his well marked horizontal eyebrows Is it very important news Yes very Guess You are going to change Minny s diet and give him three ratafias soaked in a dessert spoonful of cream daily Quite wrong Well then doctor Kenn has been preaching against buckram and you ladies have all been sending him a roundrobin saying This is a hard doctrine who can bear it For shame said Lucy adjusting her little mouth gravely It is rather dull of you not to guess my news because it is about something I mentioned to you not very long ago But you have mentioned many things to me not long ago Does your feminine tyranny require that when you say the thing you mean is one of several things I should know it immediately by that mark Yes I know you think I am silly I think you are perfectly charming And my silliness is part of my charm I didn t say that But I know you like women to be rather insipid Philip Wakem betrayed you he said so one day when you were not here Oh I know Phil is fierce on that point he makes it quite a personal matter I think he must be love sick for some unknown lady some exalted Beatrice whom he met abroad By the by said Lucy pausing in her work it has just occurred to me that I never found out whether my cousin Maggie will object to see Philip as her brother does Tom will not enter a room where Philip is if he knows it perhaps Maggie may be the same and then we sha n t be able to sing our glees shall we What is your cousin coming to stay with you said Stephen with a look of slight annoyance Yes that was my news which you have forgotten She s going to leave her situation where she has been nearly two years poor thing ever since her father s death and she will stay with me a month or two many months I hope And am I bound to be pleased at that news Oh no not at all said Lucy with a little air of pique I am pleased but that of course is no reason why you should be pleased There is no girl in the world I love so well as my cousin Maggie And you will be inseparable I suppose when she comes There will be no possibility of a tete a tete with you any more unless you can find an admirer for her who will pair off with her occasionally What is the ground of dislike to Philip He might have been a resource It is a family quarrel with Philip s father There were very painful circumstances I believe I never quite understood them or knew them all My uncle Tulliver was unfortunate and lost all his property and I think he considered mister Wakem was somehow the cause of it mister Wakem bought Dorlcote Mill my uncle s old place where he always lived You must remember my uncle Tulliver don t you No said Stephen with rather supercilious indifference I ve always known the name and I dare say I knew the man by sight apart from his name I know half the names and faces in the neighborhood in that detached disjointed way He was a very hot tempered man I remember when I was a little girl and used to go to see my cousins he often frightened me by talking as if he were angry Papa told me there was a dreadful quarrel the very day before my uncle s death between him and mister Wakem but it was hushed up That was when you were in London Papa says my uncle was quite mistaken in many ways his mind had become embittered But Tom and Maggie must naturally feel it very painful to be reminded of these things They have had so much so very much trouble Maggie was at school with me six years ago when she was fetched away because of her father s misfortunes and she has hardly had any pleasure since I think She has been in a dreary situation in a school since uncle s death because she is determined to be independent and not live with aunt Pullet and I could hardly wish her to come to me then because dear mamma was ill and everything was so sad That is why I want her to come to me now and have a long long holiday Very sweet and angelic of you said Stephen looking at her with an admiring smile and all the more so if she has the conversational qualities of her mother Poor aunty You are cruel to ridicule her She is very valuable to me I know She manages the house beautifully much better than any stranger would and she was a great comfort to me in mamma s illness Yes but in point of companionship one would prefer that she should be represented by her brandy cherries and cream cakes I think with a shudder that her daughter will always be present in person and have no agreeable proxies of that kind a fat blond girl with round blue eyes who will stare at us silently Oh yes exclaimed Lucy laughing wickedly and clapping her hands that is just my cousin Maggie You must have seen her No indeed I m only guessing what missus Tulliver s daughter must be and then if she is to banish Philip our only apology for a tenor that will be an additional bore But I hope that may not be I think I will ask you to call on Philip and tell him Maggie is coming to morrow He is quite aware of Tom s feeling and always keeps out of his way so he will understand if you tell him that I asked you to warn him not to come until I write to ask him I think you had better write a pretty note for me to take Phil is so sensitive you know the least thing might frighten him off coming at all and we had hard work to get him I can never induce him to come to the park he doesn t like my sisters I think It is only your faery touch that can lay his ruffled feathers Stephen mastered the little hand that was straying toward the table and touched it lightly with his lips Little Lucy felt very proud and happy She and Stephen were in that stage of courtship which makes the most exquisite moment of youth the freshest blossom time of passion when each is sure of the other s love but no formal declaration has been made and all is mutual divination exalting the most trivial word the lightest gesture into thrills delicate and delicious as wafted jasmine scent The explicitness of an engagement wears off this finest edge of susceptibility it is jasmine gathered and presented in a large bouquet But it is really odd that you should have hit so exactly on Maggie s appearance and manners said the cunning Lucy moving to reach her desk because she might have been like her brother you know and Tom has not round eyes and he is as far as possible from staring at people Oh I suppose he is like the father he seems to be as proud as Lucifer Not a brilliant companion though I should think I like Tom He gave me my Minny when I lost Lolo and papa is very fond of him he says Tom has excellent principles It was through him that his father was able to pay all his debts before he died Oh ah I ve heard about that I heard your father and mine talking about it a little while ago after dinner in one of their interminable discussions about business They think of doing something for young Tulliver he saved them from a considerable loss by riding home in some marvellous way like Turpin to bring them news about the stoppage of a bank or something of that sort But I was rather drowsy at the time Stephen rose from his seat and sauntered to the piano humming in falsetto Graceful Consort as he turned over the volume of The Creation which stood open on the desk Come and sing this he said when he saw Lucy rising What Graceful Consort I don t think it suits your voice Never mind it exactly suits my feeling which Philip will have it is the grand element of good singing I notice men with indifferent voices are usually of that opinion Philip burst into one of his invectives against The Creation the other day said Lucy seating herself at the piano He says it has a sort of sugared complacency and flattering make believe in it as if it were written for the birthday fete of a German Grand Duke Oh pooh He is the fallen Adam with a soured temper We are Adam and Eve unfallen in Paradise Now then the recitative for the sake of the moral You will sing the whole duty of woman And from obedience grows my pride and happiness Oh no I shall not respect an Adam who drags the tempo as you will said Lucy beginning to play the duet Surely the only courtship unshaken by doubts and fears must be that in which the lovers can sing together The sense of mutual fitness that springs from the two deep notes fulfilling expectation just at the right moment between the notes of the silvery soprano from the perfect accord of descending thirds and fifths from the preconcerted loving chase of a fugue is likely enough to supersede any immediate demand for less impassioned forms of agreement The contralto will not care to catechise the bass the tenor will foresee no embarrassing dearth of remark in evenings spent with the lovely soprano In the provinces too where music was so scarce in that remote time how could the musical people avoid falling in love with each other Even political principle must have been in danger of relaxation under such circumstances and the violin faithful to rotten boroughs must have been tempted to fraternize in a demoralizing way with a reforming violoncello In that case the linnet throated soprano and the full toned bass singing With thee delight is ever new With thee is life incessant bliss believed what they sang all the more because they sang it Now for Raphael s great song said Lucy when they had finished the duet You do the heavy beasts to perfection That sounds complimentary said Stephen looking at his watch By Jove it s nearly half past one Well I can just sing this Stephen delivered with admirable ease the deep notes representing the tread of the heavy beasts but when a singer has an audience of two there is room for divided sentiments Minny s mistress was charmed but Minny who had intrenched himself trembling in his basket as soon as the music began found this thunder so little to his taste that he leaped out and scampered under the remotest chiffonnier as the most eligible place in which a small dog could await the crack of doom Adieu graceful consort said Stephen buttoning his coat across when he had done singing and smiling down from his tall height with the air of rather a patronizing lover at the little lady on the music stool My bliss is not incessant for I must gallop home I promised to be there at lunch You will not be able to call on Philip then It is of no consequence I have said everything in my note You will be engaged with your cousin to morrow I suppose Yes we are going to have a little family party My cousin Tom will dine with us and poor aunty will have her two children together for the first time It will be very pretty I think a great deal about it But I may come the next day Oh yes Come and be introduced to my cousin Maggie though you can hardly be said not to have seen her you have described her so well Good bye then And there was that slight pressure of the hands and momentary meeting of the eyes which will often leave a little lady with a slight flush and smile on her face that do not subside immediately when the door is closed and with an inclination to walk up and down the room rather than to seat herself quietly at her embroidery or other rational and improving occupation At least this was the effect on Lucy and you will not I hope consider it an indication of vanity predominating over more tender impulses that she just glanced in the chimney glass as her walk brought her near it The desire to know that one has not looked an absolute fright during a few hours of conversation may be construed as lying within the bounds of a laudable benevolent consideration for others And Lucy had so much of this benevolence in her nature that I am inclined to think her small egoisms were impregnated with it just as there are people not altogether unknown to you whose small benevolences have a predominant and somewhat rank odor of egoism Even now that she is walking up and down with a little triumphant flutter of her girlish heart at the sense that she is loved by the person of chief consequence in her small world you may see in her hazel eyes an ever present sunny benignity in which the momentary harmless flashes of personal vanity are quite lost and if she is happy in thinking of her lover it is because the thought of him mingles readily with all the gentle affections and good natured offices with which she fills her peaceful days Even now her mind with that instantaneous alternation which makes two currents of feeling or imagination seem simultaneous is glancing continually from Stephen to the preparations she has only half finished in Maggie s room Cousin Maggie should be treated as well as the grandest lady visitor nay better for she should have Lucy s best prints and drawings in her bedroom and the very finest bouquet of spring flowers on her table Maggie would enjoy all that she was so found of pretty things And there was poor aunt Tulliver that no one made any account of she was to be surprised with the present of a cap of superlative quality and to have her health drunk in a gratifying manner for which Lucy was going to lay a plot with her father this evening Clearly she had not time to indulge in long reveries about her own happy love affairs With this thought she walked toward the door but paused there What s the matter then Minny she said stooping in answer to some whimpering of that small quadruped and lifting his glossy head against her pink cheek Did you think I was going without you Come then let us go and see Sinbad Sinbad was Lucy s chestnut horse that she always fed with her own hand when he was turned out in the paddock She was fond of feeding dependent creatures and knew the private tastes of all the animals about the house delighting in the little rippling sounds of her canaries when their beaks were busy with fresh seed and in the small nibbling pleasures of certain animals which lest she should appear too trivial I will here call the more familiar rodents Was not Stephen Guest right in his decided opinion that this slim maiden of eighteen was quite the sort of wife a man would not be likely to repent of marrying a woman who was loving and thoughtful for other women not giving them Judas kisses with eyes askance on their welcome defects but with real care and vision for their half hidden pains and mortifications with long ruminating enjoyment of little pleasures prepared for them Perhaps the emphasis of his admiration did not fall precisely on this rarest quality in her perhaps he approved his own choice of her chiefly because she did not strike him as a remarkable rarity A man likes his wife to be pretty well Lucy was pretty but not to a maddening extent A man likes his wife to be accomplished gentle affectionate and not stupid and Lucy had all these qualifications Stephen was not surprised to find himself in love with her and was conscious of excellent judgment in preferring her to Miss Leyburn the daughter of the county member although Lucy was only the daughter of his father s subordinate partner besides he had had to defy and overcome a slight unwillingness and disappointment in his father and sisters a circumstance which gives a young man an agreeable consciousness of his own dignity Stephen was aware that he had sense and independence enough to choose the wife who was likely to make him happy unbiassed by any indirect considerations He meant to choose Lucy she was a little darling and exactly the sort of woman he had always admired Chapter II First Impressions He is very clever Maggie 
2975-151995-0000	train-other-500	said Lucy She was kneeling on a footstool at Maggie s feet after placing that dark lady in the large crimson velvet chair I feel sure you will like him I hope you will I shall be very difficult to please said Maggie smiling
2975-151995-0001	train-other-500	and holding up one of Lucy s long curls that the sunlight might shine through it A gentleman who thinks he is good enough for Lucy must expect to be sharply criticised Indeed he s a great deal too good for me And sometimes when he is away
none	none	 I almost think it can t really be that he loves me 
2975-151995-0002	train-other-500	But I can never doubt it when he is with me though I couldn t bear any one but you to know that I feel in that way Maggie Oh then if I disapprove of him you can give him up
none	none	 since you are not engaged 
2975-151995-0003	train-other-500	said Maggie with playful gravity I would rather not be engaged When people are engaged they begin to think of being married soon said Lucy too thoroughly preoccupied to notice Maggie s joke
2975-151995-0004	train-other-500	and I should like everything to go on for a long while just as it is
none	none	 Sometimes I am quite frightened lest Stephen should say that he has spoken to papa 
2975-151995-0005	train-other-500	and from something that fell from papa the other day I feel sure he and mister Guest are expecting that And Stephen s sisters are very civil to me now
none	none	 At first I think they didn t like his paying me attention 
2975-151995-0006	train-other-500	and that was natural It does seem out of keeping that I should ever live in a great place like the Park House such a little insignificant thing as I am
2975-151995-0007	train-other-500	But people are not expected to be large in proportion to the houses they live in like snails said Maggie laughing Pray are mister Guest s sisters giantesses Oh no
none	none	 and not handsome that is not very said Lucy half penitent at this uncharitable remark But he is at least he is generally considered very handsome 
2975-151995-0008	train-other-500	Though you are unable to share that opinion
none	none	 Oh I don t know 
2975-151995-0009	train-other-500	said Lucy blushing pink over brow and neck It is a bad plan to raise expectation you will perhaps be disappointed But I have prepared a charming surprise for him I shall have a glorious laugh against him
2975-151995-0010	train-other-500	I shall not tell you what it is though Lucy rose from her knees and went to a little distance holding her pretty head on one side as if she had been arranging Maggie for a portrait and wished to judge of the general effect Stand up a moment Maggie
2975-151995-0011	train-other-500	What is your pleasure now said Maggie smiling languidly as she rose from her chair and looked down on her slight aerial cousin whose figure was quite subordinate to her faultless drapery of silk and crape
2975-151995-0012	train-other-500	Lucy kept her contemplative attitude a moment or two in silence and then said I can t think what witchery it is in you Maggie that makes you look best in shabby clothes though you really must have a new dress now But do you know
2975-151995-0013	train-other-500	last night I was trying to fancy you in a handsome fashionable dress and do what I would that old limp merino would come back as the only right thing for you I wonder if Marie Antoinette looked all the grander when her gown was darned at the elbows
none	none	 Now if I were to put anything shabby on I should be quite unnoticeable 
2975-151995-0014	train-other-500	I should be a mere rag Oh quite said Maggie with mock gravity You would be liable to be swept out of the room with the cobwebs and carpet dust and to find yourself under the grate like Cinderella Mayn t I sit down now
2975-151995-0015	train-other-500	Yes now you may said Lucy laughing Then with an air of serious reflection unfastening her large jet brooch But you must change brooches Maggie that little butterfly looks silly on you
2975-151995-0016	train-other-500	But won t that mar the charming effect of my consistent shabbiness said Maggie seating herself submissively while Lucy knelt again and unfastened the contemptible butterfly I wish my mother were of your opinion
none	none	 for she was fretting last night because this is my best frock 
2975-151995-0017	train-other-500	I ve been saving my money to pay for some lessons I shall never get a better situation without more accomplishments Maggie gave a little sigh Now don t put on that sad look again said Lucy
2975-151995-0018	train-other-500	pinning the large brooch below Maggie s fine throat You re forgetting that you ve left that dreary schoolroom behind you and have no little girls clothes to mend Yes said Maggie
2975-151995-0019	train-other-500	It is with me as I used to think it would be with the poor uneasy white bear I saw at the show I thought he must have got so stupid with the habit of turning backward and forward in that narrow space
2975-151995-0020	train-other-500	that he would keep doing it if they set him free One gets a bad habit of being unhappy
none	none	 But I shall put you under a discipline of pleasure that will make you lose that bad habit 
2975-151995-0021	train-other-500	said Lucy sticking the black butterfly absently in her own collar while her eyes met Maggie s affectionately
none	none	 You 
2975-151995-0022	train-other-500	dear tiny thing said Maggie in one of her bursts of loving admiration you enjoy other people s happiness so much I believe you would do without any of your own
none	none	 I wish I were like you 
2975-151995-0023	train-other-500	I ve never been tried in that way said Lucy I ve always been so happy I don t know whether I could bear much trouble I never had any but poor mamma s death You have been tried Maggie
2975-151995-0024	train-other-500	and I m sure you feel for other people quite as much as I do No Lucy said Maggie shaking her head slowly I don t enjoy their happiness as you do else I should be more contented I do feel for them when they are in trouble
2975-151995-0025	train-other-500	I don t think I could ever bear to make any one un happy and yet I often hate myself
none	none	 because I get angry sometimes at the sight of happy people 
2975-151995-0026	train-other-500	I think I get worse as I get older more selfish
none	none	 That seems very dreadful 
2975-151995-0027	train-other-500	Now Maggie said Lucy in a tone of remonstrance I don t believe a word of that It is all a gloomy fancy
none	none	 just because you are depressed by a dull wearisome life 
2975-151995-0028	train-other-500	Well perhaps it is said Maggie resolutely clearing away the clouds from her face with a bright smile and throwing herself backward in her chair Perhaps it comes from the school diet
2975-151995-0029	train-other-500	watery rice pudding spiced with Pinnock Let us hope it will give way before my mother s custards and this charming Geoffrey Crayon Maggie took up the Sketch Book which lay by her on the table
2975-151995-0030	train-other-500	Do I look fit to be seen with this little brooch said Lucy going to survey the effect in the chimney glass Oh no mister Guest will be obliged to go out of the room again if he sees you in it Pray make haste and put another on
2975-151995-0031	train-other-500	Lucy hurried out of the room but Maggie did not take the opportunity of opening her book she let it fall on her knees while her eyes wandered to the window where she could see the sunshine falling on the rich clumps of spring flowers and on the long hedge of laurels
2975-151995-0032	train-other-500	and beyond the silvery breadth of the dear old Floss that at this distance seemed to be sleeping in a morning holiday The sweet fresh garden scent came through the open window and the birds were busy flitting and alighting
2975-151995-0033	train-other-500	gurgling and singing Yet Maggie s eyes began to fill with tears The sight of the old scenes had made the rush of memories so painful that even yesterday she had only been able to rejoice in her mother s restored comfort and Tom s brotherly friendliness
2975-151995-0034	train-other-500	as we rejoice in good news of friends at a distance rather than in the presence of a happiness which we share Memory and imagination urged upon her a sense of privation too keen to let her taste what was offered in the transient present
2975-151995-0035	train-other-500	Her future she thought was likely to be worse than her past for after her years of contented renunciation she had slipped back into desire and longing she found joyless days of distasteful occupation harder and harder
2975-151995-0036	train-other-500	she found the image of the intense and varied life she yearned for and despaired of becoming more and more importunate The sound of the opening door roused her and hastily wiping away her tears she began to turn over the leaves of her book
2975-151995-0037	train-other-500	There is one pleasure I know Maggie that your deepest dismalness will never resist said Lucy beginning to speak as soon as she entered the room That is music
none	none	 and I mean you to have quite a riotous feast of it 
2975-151995-0038	train-other-500	I mean you to get up your playing again which used to be so much better than mine when we were at Laceham
none	none	 You would have laughed to see me playing the little girls tunes over and over to them 
2975-151995-0039	train-other-500	when I took them to practise said Maggie just for the sake of fingering the dear keys again But I don t know whether I could play anything more difficult now than Begone dull care
2975-151995-0040	train-other-500	I know what a wild state of joy you used to be in when the glee men came round said Lucy taking up her embroidery and we might have all those old glees that you used to love so if I were certain that you
none	none	 don t feel exactly as Tom does about 
2975-151995-0041	train-other-500	some things I should have thought there was nothing you might be more certain of said Maggie smiling
none	none	 I ought rather to have said 
2975-151995-0042	train-other-500	one particular thing Because if you feel just as he does about that we shall want our third voice saint Ogg s is so miserably provided with musical gentlemen There are really only Stephen
none	none	 and Philip Wakem 
2975-151995-0043	train-other-500	who have any knowledge of music so as to be able to sing a part Lucy had looked up from her work as she uttered the last sentence and saw that there was a change in Maggie s face Does it hurt you to hear the name mentioned Maggie
2975-151995-0044	train-other-500	If it does I will not speak of him again I know Tom will not see him if he can avoid it I don t feel at all as Tom does on that subject said Maggie rising and going to the window as if she wanted to see more of the landscape
2975-151995-0045	train-other-500	I ve always liked Philip Wakem ever since I was a little girl and saw him at Lorton He was so good when Tom hurt his foot Oh I m so glad said Lucy Then you won t mind his coming sometimes
2975-151995-0046	train-other-500	and we can have much more music than we could without him I m very fond of poor Philip only I wish he were not so morbid about his deformity I suppose it is his deformity that makes him so sad and sometimes bitter
2975-151995-0047	train-other-500	It is certainly very piteous to see his poor little crooked body and pale face among great strong people But
none	none	 Lucy 
2975-151995-0048	train-other-500	said Maggie trying to arrest the prattling stream Ah there is the door bell That must be Stephen Lucy went on not noticing Maggie s faint effort to speak One of the things I most admire in Stephen is that he makes a greater friend of Philip than any one
none	none	 It was too late for Maggie to speak now the drawingroom door was opening and Minny was already growling in a small way at the entrance of a tall gentleman who went up to Lucy and took her hand with a half polite half tender glance and tone of inquiry which seemed to indicate that he was unconscious of any other presence Let me introduce you to my cousin Miss Tulliver said Lucy turning with wicked enjoyment toward Maggie who now approached from the farther window 
2975-151995-0049	train-other-500	This is mister Stephen Guest For one instant Stephen could not conceal his astonishment at the sight of this tall dark eyed nymph with her jet black coronet of hair the next Maggie felt herself
2975-151995-0050	train-other-500	for the first time in her life receiving the tribute of a very deep blush and a very deep bow
none	none	 from a person toward whom she herself was conscious of timidity 
2975-151995-0051	train-other-500	This new experience was very agreeable to her so agreeable that it almost effaced her previous emotion about Philip There was a new brightness in her eyes and a very becoming flush on her cheek as she seated herself
2975-151995-0052	train-other-500	I hope you perceive what a striking likeness you drew the day before yesterday said Lucy with a pretty laugh of triumph She enjoyed her lover s confusion the advantage was usually on his side
2975-151995-0053	train-other-500	This designing cousin of yours quite deceived me Miss Tulliver said Stephen seating himself by Lucy and stooping to play with Minny only looking at Maggie furtively She said you had light hair and blue eyes
2975-151995-0054	train-other-500	Nay it was you who said so remonstrated Lucy I only refrained from destroying your confidence in your own second sight I wish I could always err in the same way said Stephen
2975-151995-0055	train-other-500	and find reality so much more beautiful than my preconceptions Now you have proved yourself equal to the occasion said Maggie and said what it was incumbent on you to say under the circumstances
none	none	 She flashed a slightly defiant look at him 
2975-151995-0056	train-other-500	it was clear to her that he had been drawing a satirical portrait of her beforehand Lucy had said he was inclined to be satirical and Maggie had mentally supplied the addition and rather conceited An alarming amount of devil there
2975-151995-0057	train-other-500	was Stephen s first thought The second when she had bent over her work was I wish she would look at me again The next was to answer I suppose all phrases of mere compliment have their turn to be true
2975-151995-0058	train-other-500	A man is occasionally grateful when he says Thank you It s rather hard upon him that he must use the same words with which all the world declines a disagreeable invitation don t you think so Miss Tulliver No said Maggie
2975-151995-0059	train-other-500	looking at him with her direct glance if we use common words on a great occasion they are the more striking because they are felt at once to have a particular meaning like old banners or every day clothes hung up in a sacred place
2975-151995-0060	train-other-500	Then my compliment ought to be eloquent said Stephen really not quite knowing what he said while Maggie looked at him seeing that the words were so far beneath the occasion No compliment can be eloquent
2975-151995-0061	train-other-500	except as an expression of indifference said Maggie flushing a little Lucy was rather alarmed she thought Stephen and Maggie were not going to like each other She had always feared lest Maggie should appear
2975-151995-0062	train-other-500	too old and clever to please that critical gentleman Why dear Maggie she interposed you have always pretended that you are too fond of being admired and now I think you are angry because some one ventures to admire you
2975-151995-0063	train-other-500	Not at all said Maggie I like too well to feel that I am admired but compliments never make me feel that I will never pay you a compliment again Miss Tulliver said Stephen Thank you that will be a proof of respect
2975-151995-0064	train-other-500	Poor Maggie She was so unused to society that she could take nothing as a matter of course
none	none	 and had never in her life spoken from the lips merely so that she must necessarily appear absurd to more experienced ladies 
2975-151995-0065	train-other-500	from the excessive feeling she was apt to throw into very trivial incidents But she was even conscious herself of a little absurdity in this instance
none	none	 It was true she had a theoretic objection to compliments 
2975-151995-0066	train-other-500	and had once said impatiently to Philip that she didn t see why women were to be told with a simper that they were beautiful any more than old men were to be told that they were venerable still
none	none	 to be so irritated by a common practice in the case of a stranger like mister Stephen Guest 
2975-151995-0067	train-other-500	and to care about his having spoken slightingly of her before he had seen her was certainly unreasonable and as soon as she was silent she began to be ashamed of herself It did not occur to her that her irritation
2975-151995-0068	train-other-500	was due to the pleasanter emotion which preceded it just as when we are satisfied with a sense of glowing warmth
none	none	 an innocent drop of cold water may fall upon us as a sudden smart 
2975-151995-0069	train-other-500	Stephen was too well bred not to seem unaware that the previous conversation could have been felt embarrassing and at once began to talk of impersonal matters asking Lucy if she knew when the bazaar was at length to take place
2975-151995-0070	train-other-500	so that there might be some hope of seeing her rain the influence of her eyes
none	none	 on objects more grateful than those worsted flowers that were growing under her fingers 
2975-151995-0071	train-other-500	Some day next month I believe said Lucy
none	none	 But your sisters are doing more for it than I am they are to have the largest stall Ah yes 
2975-151995-0072	train-other-500	but they carry on their manufactures in their own sitting room where I don t intrude on them I see you are not addicted to the fashionable vice of fancy work Miss Tulliver said Stephen looking at Maggie s plain hemming No said Maggie
2975-151995-0073	train-other-500	I can do nothing more difficult or more elegant than shirt making And your plain sewing is so beautiful Maggie said Lucy that I think I shall beg a few specimens of you to show as fancy work Your exquisite sewing
none	none	 is quite a mystery to me 
2975-151995-0074	train-other-500	you used to dislike that sort of work so much in old days It is a mystery easily explained dear said Maggie looking up quietly Plain sewing was the only thing I could get money by so I was obliged to try and do it well
2975-151995-0075	train-other-500	Lucy good and simple as she was could not help blushing a little She did not quite like that Stephen should know that Maggie need not have mentioned it Perhaps there was some pride in the confession the pride of poverty
2975-151995-0076	train-other-500	that will not be ashamed of itself But if Maggie had been the queen of coquettes she could hardly have invented a means of giving greater piquancy to her beauty in Stephen s eyes
none	none	 I am not sure that the quiet admission of plain sewing and poverty would have done alone 
2975-151995-0077	train-other-500	but assisted by the beauty they made Maggie more unlike other women
none	none	 even than she had seemed at first 
2975-151995-0078	train-other-500	But I can knit Lucy Maggie went on if that will be of any use for your bazaar Oh yes of infinite use I shall set you to work with scarlet wool to morrow But your sister is the most enviable person
2975-151995-0079	train-other-500	continued Lucy turning to Stephen to have the talent of modelling She is doing a wonderful bust of doctor Kenn entirely from memory Why if she can remember to put the eyes very near together and the corners of the mouth very far apart
none	none	 the likeness can hardly fail to be striking in saint Ogg s 
2975-151995-0080	train-other-500	Now that is very wicked of you said Lucy looking rather hurt I didn t think you would speak disrespectfully of doctor Kenn I say anything disrespectful of doctor Kenn Heaven forbid
none	none	 But I am not bound to respect a libellous bust of him I think Kenn one of the finest fellows in the world 
2975-151995-0081	train-other-500	I don t care much about the tall candlesticks he has put on the communion table and I shouldn t like to spoil my temper by getting up to early prayers every morning But he s the only man I ever knew personally
2975-151995-0082	train-other-500	who seems to me to have anything of the real apostle in him a man who has eight hundred a year and is contented with deal furniture and boiled beef
none	none	 because he gives away two thirds of his income 
2975-151995-0083	train-other-500	That was a very fine thing of him taking into his house that poor lad Grattan who shot his mother by accident He sacrifices more time than a less busy man could spare
none	none	 to save the poor fellow from getting into a morbid state of mind about it He takes the lad out with him constantly I see 
2975-151995-0084	train-other-500	That is beautiful said Maggie who had let her work fall and was listening with keen interest I never knew any one who did such things And one admires that sort of action in Kenn all the more
2975-151995-0085	train-other-500	said Stephen because his manners in general are rather cold and severe There s nothing sugary and maudlin about him Oh I think he s a perfect character said Lucy with pretty enthusiasm No
2975-151995-0086	train-other-500	there I can t agree with you said Stephen shaking his head with sarcastic gravity
none	none	 Now what fault can you point out in him He s an Anglican 
2975-151995-0087	train-other-500	Well those are the right views I think said Lucy gravely That settles the question in the abstract said Stephen
none	none	 but not from a parliamentary point of view 
2975-151995-0088	train-other-500	He has set the Dissenters and the Church people by the ears and a rising senator like myself of whose services the country is very much in need
none	none	 will find it inconvenient when he puts up for the honor of representing saint Ogg s in Parliament 
2975-151995-0089	train-other-500	Do you really think of that said Lucy her eyes brightening with a proud pleasure that made her neglect the argumentative interests of Anglicanism Decidedly
2975-151995-0090	train-other-500	whenever old mister Leyburn s public spirit and gout induce him to give way My father s heart is set on it and gifts like mine you know
none	none	 here Stephen drew himself up 
2975-151995-0091	train-other-500	and rubbed his large white hands over his hair with playful self admiration
none	none	 gifts like mine involve great responsibilities 
2975-151995-0092	train-other-500	Don t you think so Miss Tulliver Yes said Maggie smiling but not looking up so much fluency and self possession should not be wasted entirely on private occasions Ah I see how much penetration you have said Stephen
none	none	 You have discovered already that I am talkative and impudent 
2975-151995-0093	train-other-500	Now superficial people never discern that owing to my manner I suppose She doesn t look at me when I talk of myself he thought
none	none	 while his listeners were laughing 
2975-151995-0094	train-other-500	I must try other subjects Did Lucy intend to be present at the meeting of the Book Club next week was the next question Then followed the recommendation to choose Southey s Life of Cowper unless she were inclined to be philosophical
2975-151995-0095	train-other-500	and startle the ladies of saint Ogg s by voting for one of the Bridgewater Treatises Of course Lucy wished to know what these alarmingly learned books were and as it is always pleasant to improve the minds of ladies
2975-151995-0096	train-other-500	by talking to them at ease on subjects of which they know nothing Stephen became quite brilliant in an account of Buckland s Treatise which he had just been reading
none	none	 He was rewarded by seeing Maggie let her work fall 
2975-151995-0097	train-other-500	and gradually get so absorbed in his wonderful geological story that she sat looking at him
none	none	 leaning forward with crossed arms and with an entire absence of self consciousness as if he had been the snuffiest of old professors 
2975-151995-0098	train-other-500	and she a downy lipped alumna He was so fascinated by the clear large gaze that at last he forgot to look away from it occasionally toward Lucy but she sweet child was only rejoicing that Stephen was proving to Maggie how clever he was
2975-151995-0099	train-other-500	and that they would certainly be good friends after all I will bring you the book shall I Miss Tulliver said Stephen when he found the stream of his recollections running rather shallow There are many illustrations in it that you will like to see Oh thank you said Maggie
2975-151995-0100	train-other-500	blushing with returning self consciousness at this direct address and taking up her work again No no Lucy interposed I must forbid your plunging Maggie in books I shall never get her away from them and I want her to have delicious do nothing days
2975-151995-0101	train-other-500	filled with boating and chatting and riding and driving that is the holiday she needs Apropos said Stephen looking at his watch Shall we go out for a row on the river now The tide will suit for us to the Tofton way
none	none	 and we can walk back That was a delightful proposition to Maggie 
2975-151995-0102	train-other-500	for it was years since she had been on the river
none	none	 When she was gone to put on her bonnet 
2975-151995-0103	train-other-500	Lucy lingered to give an order to the servant and took the opportunity of telling Stephen that Maggie had no objection to seeing Philip so that it was a pity she had sent that note the day before yesterday But she would write another to morrow and invite him
2975-151995-0104	train-other-500	I ll call and beat him up to morrow said Stephen and bring him with me in the evening shall I
none	none	 My sisters will want to call on you when I tell them your cousin is with you 
2975-151995-0105	train-other-500	I must leave the field clear for them in the morning Oh yes pray bring him said Lucy And you will like Maggie sha n t you she added in a beseeching tone Isn t she a dear noble looking creature Too tall
2975-151995-0106	train-other-500	said Stephen smiling down upon her and a little too fiery
none	none	 She is not my type of woman you know 
2975-151995-0107	train-other-500	Gentlemen you are aware are apt to impart these imprudent confidences to ladies concerning their unfavorable opinion of sister fair ones That is why so many women
2975-151995-0108	train-other-500	have the advantage of knowing that they are secretly repulsive to men who have self denyingly made ardent love to them
none	none	 And hardly anything could be more distinctively characteristic of Lucy 
2975-151995-0109	train-other-500	than that she both implicitly believed what Stephen said and was determined that Maggie should not know it But you who have a higher logic than the verbal to guide you have already foreseen as the direct sequence to that unfavorable opinion of Stephen s
2975-151995-0110	train-other-500	that he walked down to the boathouse calculating by the aid of a vivid imagination that Maggie must give him her hand at least twice in consequence of this pleasant boating plan and that a gentleman who wishes ladies to look at him
2975-151995-0111	train-other-500	is advantageously situated when he is rowing them in a boat What then Had he fallen in love with this surprising daughter of missus Tulliver at first sight Certainly not Such passions are never heard of in real life Besides
2975-151995-0112	train-other-500	he was in love already and half engaged to the dearest little creature in the world and he was not a man to make a fool of himself in any way But when one is five and twenty one has not chalk stones at one s finger ends
2975-151995-0113	train-other-500	that the touch of a handsome girl should be entirely indifferent It was perfectly natural and safe
none	none	 to admire beauty and enjoy looking at it at least under such circumstances as the present 
2975-151995-0114	train-other-500	And there was really something very interesting about this girl with her poverty and troubles it was gratifying to see the friendship between the two cousins Generally Stephen admitted he was not fond of women who had any peculiarity of character
2975-151995-0115	train-other-500	but here the peculiarity seemed really of a superior kind and provided one is not obliged to marry such women why they certainly make a variety in social intercourse Maggie did not fulfil Stephen s hope
2975-151995-0116	train-other-500	by looking at him during the first quarter of an hour her eyes were too full of the old banks that she knew so well She felt lonely cut off from Philip the only person who had ever seemed to love her devotedly
none	none	 as she had always longed to be loved 
2975-151995-0117	train-other-500	But presently the rhythmic movement of the oars attracted her
none	none	 and she thought she should like to learn how to row 
2975-151995-0118	train-other-500	This roused her from her reverie and she asked if she might take an oar It appeared that she required much teaching and she became ambitious The exercise brought the warm blood into her cheeks and made her inclined to take her lesson merrily
2975-151995-0119	train-other-500	I shall not be satisfied until I can manage both oars and row you and Lucy she said looking very bright as she stepped out of the boat Maggie we know
none	none	 was apt to forget the thing she was doing 
2975-151995-0120	train-other-500	and she had chosen an inopportune moment for her remark her foot slipped but happily mister Stephen Guest held her hand and kept her up with a firm grasp You have not hurt yourself at all I hope he said bending to look in her face with anxiety
2975-151995-0121	train-other-500	It was very charming to be taken care of in that kind graceful manner by some one taller and stronger than one s self Maggie had never felt just in the same way before
2975-151995-0122	train-other-500	When they reached home again they found uncle and aunt Pullet seated with missus Tulliver in the drawing room and Stephen hurried away asking leave to come again in the evening And pray bring with you the volume of Purcell that you took away said Lucy
2975-151995-0123	train-other-500	I want Maggie to hear your best songs Aunt Pullet under the certainty that Maggie would be invited to go out with Lucy probably to Park House was much shocked at the shabbiness of her clothes which when witnessed by the higher society of saint Ogg s
none	none	 would be a discredit to the family 
2975-151995-0124	train-other-500	that demanded a strong and prompt remedy and the consultation as to what would be most suitable to this end from among the superfluities of missus Pullet s wardrobe was one that Lucy as well as missus Tulliver entered into with some zeal
2975-151995-0125	train-other-500	Maggie must really have an evening dress as soon as possible and she was about the same height as aunt Pullet But she s so much broader across the shoulders than I am it s very ill convenient said missus Pullet else she might wear that
none	none	 beautiful black brocade o mine 
2975-151995-0126	train-other-500	without any alteration and her arms are beyond everything added missus Pullet sorrowfully as she lifted Maggie s large round arm
none	none	 She d never get my sleeves on 
2975-151995-0127	train-other-500	Oh never mind that aunt send us the dress said Lucy I don t mean Maggie to have long sleeves
none	none	 and I have abundance of black lace for trimming Her arms will look beautiful Maggie s arms are a pretty shape 
2975-151995-0128	train-other-500	said missus Tulliver They re like mine used to be only mine was never brown
none	none	 I wish she d had our family skin 
2975-151995-0129	train-other-500	Nonsense aunty said Lucy patting her aunt Tulliver s shoulder you don t understand those things A painter would think Maggie s complexion beautiful Maybe my dear said missus Tulliver submissively
2975-151995-0130	train-other-500	You know better than I do Only when I was young a brown skin wasn t thought well on among respectable folks
none	none	 No 
2975-151995-0131	train-other-500	said uncle Pullet who took intense interest in the ladies conversation as he sucked his lozenges Though there was a song about the Nut brown Maid too
none	none	 I think she was crazy crazy Kate but I can t justly remember Oh dear dear said Maggie laughing but impatient I think that will be the end of my brown skin if it is always to be talked about so much Chapter III Confidential Moments When Maggie went up to her bedroom that night it appeared that she was not at all inclined to undress She set down her candle on the first table that presented itself and began to walk up and down her room which was a large one with a firm regular and rather rapid step which showed that the exercise was the instinctive vent of strong excitement Her eyes and cheeks had an almost feverish brilliancy her head was thrown backward and her hands were clasped with the palms outward and with that tension of the arms which is apt to accompany mental absorption Had anything remarkable happened Nothing that you are not likely to consider in the highest degree unimportant She had been hearing some fine music sung by a fine bass voice but then it was sung in a provincial amateur fashion such as would have left a critical ear much to desire And she was conscious of having been looked at a great deal in rather a furtive manner from beneath a pair of well marked horizontal eyebrows with a glance that seemed somehow to have caught the vibratory influence of the voice Such things could have had no perceptible effect on a thoroughly well educated young lady with a perfectly balanced mind who had had all the advantages of fortune training and refined society But if Maggie had been that young lady you would probably have known nothing about her her life would have had so few vicissitudes that it could hardly have been written for the happiest women like the happiest nations have no history In poor Maggie s highly strung hungry nature just come away from a third rate schoolroom with all its jarring sounds and petty round of tasks these apparently trivial causes had the effect of rousing and exalting her imagination in a way that was mysterious to herself It was not that she thought distinctly of mister Stephen Guest or dwelt on the indications that he looked at her with admiration it was rather that she felt the half remote presence of a world of love and beauty and delight made up of vague mingled images from all the poetry and romance she had ever read or had ever woven in her dreamy reveries Her mind glanced back once or twice to the time when she had courted privation when she had thought all longing all impatience was subdued but that condition seemed irrecoverably gone and she recoiled from the remembrance of it No prayer no striving now would bring back that negative peace the battle of her life it seemed was not to be decided in that short and easy way by perfect renunciation at the very threshold of her youth The music was vibrating in her still Purcell s music with its wild passion and fancy and she could not stay in the recollection of that bare lonely past She was in her brighter aerial world again when a little tap came at the door of course it was her cousin who entered in ample white dressing gown Why Maggie you naughty child haven t you begun to undress said Lucy in astonishment I promised not to come and talk to you because I thought you must be tired But here you are looking as if you were ready to dress for a ball Come come get on your dressing gown and unplait your hair Well you are not very forward retorted Maggie hastily reaching her own pink cotton gown and looking at Lucy s light brown hair brushed back in curly disorder Oh I have not much to do I shall sit down and talk to you till I see you are really on the way to bed While Maggie stood and unplaited her long black hair over her pink drapery Lucy sat down near the toilette table watching her with affectionate eyes and head a little aside like a pretty spaniel If it appears to you at all incredible that young ladies should be led on to talk confidentially in a situation of this kind I will beg you to remember that human life furnishes many exceptional cases You really have enjoyed the music to night haven t you Maggie Oh yes that is what prevented me from feeling sleepy I think I should have no other mortal wants if I could always have plenty of music It seems to infuse strength into my limbs and ideas into my brain Life seems to go on without effort when I am filled with music At other times one is conscious of carrying a weight And Stephen has a splendid voice hasn t he Well perhaps we are neither of us judges of that said Maggie laughing as she seated herself and tossed her long hair back You are not impartial and I think any barrel organ splendid But tell me what you think of him now Tell me exactly good and bad too Oh I think you should humiliate him a little A lover should not be so much at ease and so self confident He ought to tremble more Nonsense Maggie As if any one could tremble at me You think he is conceited I see that But you don t dislike him do you Dislike him No Am I in the habit of seeing such charming people that I should be very difficult to please Besides how could I dislike any one that promised to make you happy my dear thing Maggie pinched Lucy s dimpled chin We shall have more music to morrow evening said Lucy looking happy already for Stephen will bring Philip Wakem with him Oh Lucy I can t see him said Maggie turning pale At least I could not see him without Tom s leave Is Tom such a tyrant as that said Lucy surprised I ll take the responsibility then tell him it was my fault But dear said Maggie falteringly I promised Tom very solemnly before my father s death I promised him I would not speak to Philip without his knowledge and consent And I have a great dread of opening the subject with Tom of getting into a quarrel with him again But I never heard of anything so strange and unreasonable What harm can poor Philip have done May I speak to Tom about it Oh no pray don t dear said Maggie I ll go to him myself to morrow and tell him that you wish Philip to come I ve thought before of asking him to absolve me from my promise but I ve not had the courage to determine on it They were both silent for some moments and then Lucy said Maggie you have secrets from me and I have none from you Maggie looked meditatively away from Lucy Then she turned to her and said I should like to tell you about Philip But Lucy you must not betray that you know it to any one least of all to Philip himself or to mister Stephen Guest The narrative lasted long for Maggie had never before known the relief of such an outpouring she had never before told Lucy anything of her inmost life and the sweet face bent toward her with sympathetic interest and the little hand pressing hers encouraged her to speak on On two points only she was not expansive She did not betray fully what still rankled in her mind as Tom s great offence the insults he had heaped on Philip Angry as the remembrance still made her she could not bear that any one else should know it at all both for Tom s sake and Philip s And she could not bear to tell Lucy of the last scene between her father and Wakem though it was this scene which she had ever since felt to be a new barrier between herself and Philip She merely said she saw now that Tom was on the whole right in regarding any prospect of love and marriage between her and Philip as put out of the question by the relation of the two families Of course Philip s father would never consent There Lucy you have had my story said Maggie smiling with the tears in her eyes You see I am like Sir Andrew Aguecheek I was adored once Ah now I see how it is you know Shakespeare and everything and have learned so much since you left school which always seemed to me witchcraft before part of your general uncanniness said Lucy She mused a little with her eyes downward and then added looking at Maggie It is very beautiful that you should love Philip I never thought such a happiness would befall him And in my opinion you ought not to give him up There are obstacles now but they may be done away with in time Maggie shook her head Yes yes persisted Lucy I can t help being hopeful about it There is something romantic in it out of the common way just what everything that happens to you ought to be And Philip will adore you like a husband in a fairy tale Oh I shall puzzle my small brain to contrive some plot that will bring everybody into the right mind so that you may marry Philip when I marry somebody else Wouldn t that be a pretty ending to all my poor poor Maggie s troubles Maggie tried to smile but shivered as if she felt a sudden chill Ah dear you are cold said Lucy You must go to bed and so must I I dare not think what time it is They kissed each other and Lucy went away possessed of a confidence which had a strong influence over her subsequent impressions Maggie had been thoroughly sincere her nature had never found it easy to be otherwise But confidences are sometimes blinding even when they are sincere Chapter IV Brother and Sister Maggie was obliged to go to Tom s lodgings in the middle of the day when he would be coming in to dinner else she would not have found him at home He was not lodging with entire strangers Our friend Bob Jakin had with Mumps s tacit consent taken not only a wife about eight months ago but also one of those queer old houses pierced with surprising passages by the water side where as he observed his wife and mother could keep themselves out of mischief by letting out two pleasure boats in which he had invested some of his savings and by taking in a lodger for the parlor and spare bedroom Under these circumstances what could be better for the interests of all parties sanitary considerations apart than that the lodger should be mister Tom It was Bob s wife who opened the door to Maggie She was a tiny woman with the general physiognomy of a Dutch doll looking in comparison with Bob s mother who filled up the passage in the rear very much like one of those human figures which the artist finds conveniently standing near a colossal statue to show the proportions The tiny woman curtsied and looked up at Maggie with some awe as soon as she had opened the door but the words Is my brother at home which Maggie uttered smilingly made her turn round with sudden excitement and say Eh mother mother tell Bob it s Miss Maggie Come in Miss for goodness do she went on opening a side door and endeavoring to flatten her person against the wall to make the utmost space for the visitor Sad recollections crowded on Maggie as she entered the small parlor which was now all that poor Tom had to call by the name of home that name which had once so many years ago meant for both of them the same sum of dear familiar objects But everything was not strange to her in this new room the first thing her eyes dwelt on was the large old Bible and the sight was not likely to disperse the old memories She stood without speaking If you please to take the privilege o sitting down Miss said missus Jakin rubbing her apron over a perfectly clean chair and then lifting up the corner of that garment and holding it to her face with an air of embarrassment as she looked wonderingly at Maggie Bob is at home then said Maggie recovering herself and smiling at the bashful Dutch doll Yes Miss but I think he must be washing and dressing himself I ll go and see said missus Jakin disappearing But she presently came back walking with new courage a little way behind her husband who showed the brilliancy of his blue eyes and regular white teeth in the doorway bowing respectfully How do you do Bob said Maggie coming forward and putting out her hand to him I always meant to pay your wife a visit and I shall come another day on purpose for that if she will let me But I was obliged to come to day to speak to my brother He ll be in before long Miss He s doin finely mister Tom is he ll be one o the first men hereabouts you ll see that Well Bob I m sure he ll be indebted to you whatever he becomes he said so himself only the other night when he was talking of you Eh Miss that s his way o takin it But I think the more on t when he says a thing because his tongue doesn t overshoot him as mine does Lors I m no better nor a tilted bottle I ar n t I can t stop mysen when once I begin But you look rarely Miss it does me good to see you What do you say now Prissy here Bob turned to his wife Isn t it all come true as I said Though there isn t many sorts o goods as I can t over praise when I set my tongue to t missus Bob s small nose seemed to be following the example of her eyes in turning up reverentially toward Maggie but she was able now to smile and curtsey and say I d looked forrard like aenything to seein you Miss for my husband s tongue s been runnin on you like as if he was light headed iver since first he come a courtin on me Well well said Bob looking rather silly Go an see after the taters else mister Tom ull have to wait for em I hope Mumps is friendly with missus Jakin Bob said Maggie smiling I remember you used to say he wouldn t like your marrying Eh Miss said Bob he made up his mind to t when he see d what a little un she was He pretends not to see her mostly or else to think as she isn t full growed But about mister Tom Miss said Bob speaking lower and looking serious he s as close as a iron biler he is but I m a cutish chap an when I ve left off carrying my pack an am at a loose end I ve got more brains nor I know what to do wi an I m forced to busy myself wi other folks s insides An it worrets me as mister Tom ll sit by himself so glumpish a knittin his brow an a lookin at the fire of a night He should be a bit livelier now a fine young fellow like him My wife says when she goes in sometimes an he takes no notice of her he sits lookin into the fire and frownin as if he was watchin folks at work in it He thinks so much about business said Maggie Ay said Bob speaking lower but do you think it s nothin else Miss He s close mister Tom is but I m a cute chap I am an I thought tow rt last Christmas as I d found out a soft place in him It was about a little black spaniel a rare bit o breed as he made a fuss to get But since then summat s come over him as he s set his teeth again things more nor iver for all he s had such good luck An I wanted to tell you Miss cause I thought you might work it out of him a bit now you re come He s a deal too lonely and doesn t go into company enough I m afraid I have very little power over him Bob said Maggie a good deal moved by Bob s suggestion It was a totally new idea to her mind that Tom could have his love troubles Poor fellow and in love with Lucy too But it was perhaps a mere fancy of Bob s too officious brain The present of the dog meant nothing more than cousinship and gratitude But Bob had already said Here s mister Tom and the outer door was opening There is no time to spare Tom said Maggie as soon as Bob left the room I must tell you at once what I came about else I shall be hindering you from taking your dinner Tom stood with his back against the chimney piece and Maggie was seated opposite the light He noticed that she was tremulous and he had a presentiment of the subject she was going to speak about The presentiment made his voice colder and harder as he said What is it This tone roused a spirit of resistance in Maggie and she put her request in quite a different form from the one she had predetermined on She rose from her seat and looking straight at Tom said I want you to absolve me from my promise about Philip Wakem Or rather I promised you not to see him without telling you I am come to tell you that I wish to see him Very well said Tom still more coldly But Maggie had hardly finished speaking in that chill defiant manner before she repented and felt the dread of alienation from her brother Not for myself dear Tom Don t be angry I shouldn t have asked it only that Philip you know is a friend of Lucy s and she wishes him to come has invited him to come this evening and I told her I couldn t see him without telling you I shall only see him in the presence of other people There will never be anything secret between us again Tom looked away from Maggie knitting his brow more strongly for a little while Then he turned to her and said slowly and emphatically You know what is my feeling on that subject Maggie There is no need for my repeating anything I said a year ago While my father was living I felt bound to use the utmost power over you to prevent you from disgracing him as well as yourself and all of us But now I must leave you to your own choice You wish to be independent you told me so after my father s death My opinion is not changed If you think of Philip Wakem as a lover again you must give up me I don t wish it dear Tom at least as things are I see that it would lead to misery But I shall soon go away to another situation and I should like to be friends with him again while I am here Lucy wishes it The severity of Tom s face relaxed a little I shouldn t mind your seeing him occasionally at my uncle s I don t want you to make a fuss on the subject But I have no confidence in you Maggie You would be led away to do anything That was a cruel word Maggie s lip began to tremble Why will you say that Tom It is very hard of you Have I not done and borne everything as well as I could And I kept my word to you when when My life has not been a happy one any more than yours She was obliged to be childish the tears would come When Maggie was not angry she was as dependent on kind or cold words as a daisy on the sunshine or the cloud the need of being loved would always subdue her as in old days it subdued her in the worm eaten attic The brother s goodness came uppermost at this appeal but it could only show itself in Tom s fashion He put his hand gently on her arm and said in the tone of a kind pedagogue Now listen to me Maggie I ll tell you what I mean You re always in extremes you have no judgment and self command and yet you think you know best and will not submit to be guided You know I didn t wish you to take a situation My aunt Pullet was willing to give you a good home and you might have lived respectably amongst your relations until I could have provided a home for you with my mother And that is what I should like to do I wished my sister to be a lady and I always have taken care of you as my father desired until you were well married But your ideas and mine never accord and you will not give way Yet you might have sense enough to see that a brother who goes out into the world and mixes with men necessarily knows better what is right and respectable for his sister than she can know herself You think I am not kind but my kindness can only be directed by what I believe to be good for you Yes I know dear Tom said Maggie still half sobbing but trying to control her tears I know you would do a great deal for me I know how you work and don t spare yourself I am grateful to you But indeed you can t quite judge for me our natures are very different You don t know how differently things affect me from what they do you Yes I do know I know it too well I know how differently you must feel about all that affects our family and your own dignity as a young woman before you could think of receiving secret addresses from Philip Wakem If it was not disgusting to me in every other way I should object to my sister s name being associated for a moment with that of a young man whose father must hate the very thought of us all and would spurn you With any one but you I should think it quite certain that what you witnessed just before my father s death would secure you from ever thinking again of Philip Wakem as a lover But I don t feel certain of it with you I never feel certain about anything with you At one time you take pleasure in a sort of perverse self denial and at another you have not resolution to resist a thing that you know to be wrong There was a terrible cutting truth in Tom s words that hard rind of truth which is discerned by unimaginative unsympathetic minds Maggie always writhed under this judgment of Tom s she rebelled and was humiliated in the same moment it seemed as if he held a glass before her to show her her own folly and weakness as if he were a prophetic voice predicting her future fallings and yet all the while she judged him in return she said inwardly that he was narrow and unjust that he was below feeling those mental needs which were often the source of the wrong doing or absurdity that made her life a planless riddle to him She did not answer directly her heart was too full and she sat down leaning her arm on the table It was no use trying to make Tom feel that she was near to him He always repelled her Her feeling under his words was complicated by the allusion to the last scene between her father and Wakem and at length that painful solemn memory surmounted the immediate grievance No She did not think of such things with frivolous indifference and Tom must not accuse her of that She looked up at him with a grave earnest gaze and said I can t make you think better of me Tom by anything I can say But I am not so shut out from all your feelings as you believe me to be I see as well as you do that from our position with regard to Philip s father not on other grounds it would be unreasonable it would be wrong for us to entertain the idea of marriage and I have given up thinking of him as a lover I am telling you the truth and you have no right to disbelieve me I have kept my word to you and you have never detected me in a falsehood I should not only not encourage I should carefully avoid any intercourse with Philip on any other footing than of quiet friendship You may think that I am unable to keep my resolutions but at least you ought not to treat me with hard contempt on the ground of faults that I have not committed yet Well Maggie said Tom softening under this appeal I don t want to overstrain matters I think all things considered it will be best for you to see Philip Wakem if Lucy wishes him to come to the house I believe what you say at least you believe it yourself I know I can only warn you I wish to be as good a brother to you as you will let me There was a little tremor in Tom s voice as he uttered the last words and Maggie s ready affection came back with as sudden a glow as when they were children and bit their cake together as a sacrament of conciliation She rose and laid her hand on Tom s shoulder Dear Tom I know you mean to be good I know you have had a great deal to bear and have done a great deal I should like to be a comfort to you not to vex you You don t think I m altogether naughty now do you Tom smiled at the eager face his smiles were very pleasant to see when they did come for the gray eyes could be tender underneath the frown No Maggie I may turn out better than you expect I hope you will And may I come some day and make tea for you and see this extremely small wife of Bob s again Yes but trot away now for I ve no more time to spare said Tom looking at his watch Not to give me a kiss Tom bent to kiss her cheek and then said There Be a good girl I ve got a great deal to think of to day I m going to have a long consultation with my uncle Deane this afternoon You ll come to aunt Glegg s to morrow We re going all to dine early that we may go there to tea You must come Lucy told me to say so Oh pooh I ve plenty else to do said Tom pulling his bell violently and bringing down the small bell rope I m frightened I shall run away said Maggie making a laughing retreat while Tom with masculine philosophy flung the bell rope to the farther end of the room not very far either a touch of human experience which I flatter myself will come home to the bosoms of not a few substantial or distinguished men who were once at an early stage of their rise in the world and were cherishing very large hopes in very small lodgings Chapter V Showing That Tom Had Opened the Oyster And now we ve settled this Newcastle business Tom said mister Deane that same afternoon as they were seated in the private room at the Bank together there s another matter I want to talk to you about Since you re likely to have rather a smoky unpleasant time of it at Newcastle for the next few weeks you ll want a good prospect of some sort to keep up your spirits Tom waited less nervously than he had done on a former occasion in this apartment while his uncle took out his snuff box and gratified each nostril with deliberate impartiality You see Tom said mister Deane at last throwing himself backward the world goes on at a smarter pace now than it did when I was a young fellow Why sir forty years ago when I was much such a strapping youngster as you a man expected to pull between the shafts the best part of his life before he got the whip in his hand The looms went slowish and fashions didn t alter quite so fast I d a best suit that lasted me six years Everything was on a lower scale sir in point of expenditure I mean It s this steam you see that has made the difference it drives on every wheel double pace and the wheel of fortune along with em as our mister Stephen Guest said at the anniversary dinner he hits these things off wonderfully considering he s seen nothing of business I don t find fault with the change as some people do Trade sir opens a man s eyes and if the population is to get thicker upon the ground as it s doing the world must use its wits at inventions of one sort or other I know I ve done my share as an ordinary man of business Somebody has said it s a fine thing to make two ears of corn grow where only one grew before but sir it s a fine thing too to further the exchange of commodities and bring the grains of corn to the mouths that are hungry And that s our line of business and I consider it as honorable a position as a man can hold to be connected with it Tom knew that the affair his uncle had to speak of was not urgent mister Deane was too shrewd and practical a man to allow either his reminiscences or his snuff to impede the progress of trade Indeed for the last month or two there had been hints thrown out to Tom which enabled him to guess that he was going to hear some proposition for his own benefit With the beginning of the last speech he had stretched out his legs thrust his hands in his pockets and prepared himself for some introductory diffuseness tending to show that mister Deane had succeeded by his own merit and that what he had to say to young men in general was that if they didn t succeed too it was because of their own demerit He was rather surprised then when his uncle put a direct question to him Let me see it s going on for seven years now since you applied to me for a situation eh Tom Yes sir I m three and twenty now said Tom Ah it s as well not to say that though for you d pass for a good deal older and age tells well in business I remember your coming very well I remember I saw there was some pluck in you and that was what made me give you encouragement And I m happy to say I was right I m not often deceived I was naturally a little shy at pushing my nephew but I m happy to say you ve done me credit sir and if I d had a son o my own I shouldn t have been sorry to see him like you mister Deane tapped his box and opened it again repeating in a tone of some feeling No I shouldn t have been sorry to see him like you I m very glad I ve given you satisfaction sir I ve done my best said Tom in his proud independent way Yes Tom you ve given me satisfaction I don t speak of your conduct as a son though that weighs with me in my opinion of you But what I have to do with as a partner in our firm is the qualities you ve shown as a man o business Ours is a fine business a splendid concern sir and there s no reason why it shouldn t go on growing there s a growing capital and growing outlets for it but there s another thing that s wanted for the prosperity of every concern large or small and that s men to conduct it men of the right habits none o your flashy fellows but such as are to be depended on Now this is what mister Guest and I see clear enough Three years ago we took Gell into the concern we gave him a share in the oil mill And why Why because Gell was a fellow whose services were worth a premium So it will always be sir So it was with me And though Gell is pretty near ten years older than you there are other points in your favor Tom was getting a little nervous as mister Deane went on speaking he was conscious of something he had in his mind to say which might not be agreeable to his uncle simply because it was a new suggestion rather than an acceptance of the proposition he foresaw It stands to reason mister Deane went on when he had finished his new pinch that your being my nephew weighs in your favor but I don t deny that if you d been no relation of mine at all your conduct in that affair of Pelley s bank would have led mister Guest and myself to make some acknowledgment of the service you ve been to us and backed by your general conduct and business ability it has made us determine on giving you a share in the business a share which we shall be glad to increase as the years go on We think that ll be better on all grounds than raising your salary It ll give you more importance and prepare you better for taking some of the anxiety off my shoulders by and by I m equal to a good deal o work at present thank God but I m getting older there s no denying that I told mister Guest I would open the subject to you and when you come back from this northern business we can go into particulars This is a great stride for a young fellow of three and twenty but I m bound to say you ve deserved it I m very grateful to mister Guest and you sir of course I feel the most indebted to you who first took me into the business and have taken a good deal of pains with me since Tom spoke with a slight tremor and paused after he had said this Yes yes said mister Deane I don t spare pains when I see they ll be of any use I gave myself some trouble with Gell else he wouldn t have been what he is But there s one thing I should like to mention to you uncle I ve never spoken to you of it before If you remember at the time my father s property was sold there was some thought of your firm buying the Mill I know you thought it would be a very good investment especially if steam were applied To be sure to be sure But Wakem outbid us he d made up his mind to that He s rather fond of carrying everything over other people s heads Perhaps it s of no use my mentioning it at present Tom went on but I wish you to know what I have in my mind about the Mill I ve a strong feeling about it It was my father s dying wish that I should try and get it back again whenever I could it was in his family for five generations I promised my father and besides that I m attached to the place I shall never like any other so well And if it should ever suit your views to buy it for the firm I should have a better chance of fulfilling my father s wish I shouldn t have liked to mention the thing to you only you ve been kind enough to say my services have been of some value And I d give up a much greater chance in life for the sake of having the Mill again I mean having it in my own hands and gradually working off the price mister Deane had listened attentively and now looked thoughtful I see I see he said after a while the thing would be possible if there were any chance of Wakem s parting with the property But that I don t see He s put that young Jetsome in the place and he had his reasons when he bought it I ll be bound He s a loose fish that young Jetsome said Tom He s taking to drinking and they say he s letting the business go down Luke told me about it our old miller He says he sha n t stay unless there s an alteration I was thinking if things went on that way Wakem might be more willing to part with the Mill Luke says he s getting very sour about the way things are going on Well I ll turn it over Tom I must inquire into the matter and go into it with mister Guest But you see it s rather striking out a new branch and putting you to that instead of keeping you where you are which was what we d wanted I should be able to manage more than the Mill when things were once set properly going sir I want to have plenty of work There s nothing else I care about much There was something rather sad in that speech from a young man of three and twenty even in uncle Deane s business loving ears Pooh pooh you ll be having a wife to care about one of these days if you get on at this pace in the world But as to this Mill we mustn t reckon on our chickens too early However I promise you to bear it in mind and when you come back we ll talk of it again I am going to dinner now Come and breakfast with us to morrow morning and say good bye to your mother and sister before you start Chapter VI Illustrating the Laws of Attraction It is evident to you now that Maggie had arrived at a moment in her life which must be considered by all prudent persons as a great opportunity for a young woman Launched into the higher society of saint Ogg s with a striking person which had the advantage of being quite unfamiliar to the majority of beholders and with such moderate assistance of costume as you have seen foreshadowed in Lucy s anxious colloquy with aunt Pullet Maggie was certainly at a new starting point in life At Lucy s first evening party young Torry fatigued his facial muscles more than usual in order that the dark eyed girl there in the corner might see him in all the additional style conferred by his eyeglass and several young ladies went home intending to have short sleeves with black lace and to plait their hair in a broad coronet at the back of their head That cousin of Miss Deane s looked so very well In fact poor Maggie with all her inward consciousness of a painful past and her presentiment of a troublous future was on the way to become an object of some envy a topic of discussion in the newly established billiard room and between fair friends who had no secrets from each other on the subject of trimmings The Miss Guests who associated chiefly on terms of condescension with the families of saint Ogg s and were the glass of fashion there took some exception to Maggie s manners She had a way of not assenting at once to the observations current in good society and of saying that she didn t know whether those observations were true or not which gave her an air of gaucherie and impeded the even flow of conversation but it is a fact capable of an amiable interpretation that ladies are not the worst disposed toward a new acquaintance of their own sex because she has points of inferiority And Maggie was so entirely without those pretty airs of coquetry which have the traditional reputation of driving gentlemen to despair that she won some feminine pity for being so ineffective in spite of her beauty She had not had many advantages poor thing and it must be admitted there was no pretension about her her abruptness and unevenness of manner were plainly the result of her secluded and lowly circumstances It was only a wonder that there was no tinge of vulgarity about her considering what the rest of poor Lucy s relations were an allusion which always made the Miss Guests shudder a little It was not agreeable to think of any connection by marriage with such people as the Gleggs and the Pullets but it was of no use to contradict Stephen when once he had set his mind on anything and certainly there was no possible objection to Lucy in herself no one could help liking her She would naturally desire that the Miss Guests should behave kindly to this cousin of whom she was so fond and Stephen would make a great fuss if they were deficient in civility Under these circumstances the invitations to Park House were not wanting and elsewhere also Miss Deane was too popular and too distinguished a member of society in saint Ogg s for any attention toward her to be neglected Thus Maggie was introduced for the first time to the young lady s life and knew what it was to get up in the morning without any imperative reason for doing one thing more than another This new sense of leisure and unchecked enjoyment amidst the soft breathing airs and garden scents of advancing spring amidst the new abundance of music and lingering strolls in the sunshine and the delicious dreaminess of gliding on the river could hardly be without some intoxicating effect on her after her years of privation and even in the first week Maggie began to be less haunted by her sad memories and anticipations Life was certainly very pleasant just now it was becoming very pleasant to dress in the evening and to feel that she was one of the beautiful things of this spring time And there were admiring eyes always awaiting her now she was no longer an unheeded person liable to be chid from whom attention was continually claimed and on whom no one felt bound to confer any It was pleasant too when Stephen and Lucy were gone out riding to sit down at the piano alone and find that the old fitness between her fingers and the keys remained and revived like a sympathetic kinship not to be worn out by separation to get the tunes she had heard the evening before and repeat them again and again until she had found out a way of producing them so as to make them a more pregnant passionate language to her The mere concord of octaves was a delight to Maggie and she would often take up a book of studies rather than any melody that she might taste more keenly by abstraction the more primitive sensation of intervals Not that her enjoyment of music was of the kind that indicates a great specific talent it was rather that her sensibility to the supreme excitement of music was only one form of that passionate sensibility which belonged to her whole nature and made her faults and virtues all merge in each other made her affections sometimes an impatient demand but also prevented her vanity from taking the form of mere feminine coquetry and device and gave it the poetry of ambition But you have known Maggie a long while and need to be told not her characteristics but her history which is a thing hardly to be predicted even from the completest knowledge of characteristics For the tragedy of our lives is not created entirely from within Character says Novalis in one of his questionable aphorisms character is destiny But not the whole of our destiny Hamlet Prince of Denmark was speculative and irresolute and we have a great tragedy in consequence But if his father had lived to a good old age and his uncle had died an early death we can conceive Hamlet s having married Ophelia and got through life with a reputation of sanity notwithstanding many soliloquies and some moody sarcasms toward the fair daughter of Polonius to say nothing of the frankest incivility to his father in law Maggie s destiny then is at present hidden and we must wait for it to reveal itself like the course of an unmapped river we only know that the river is full and rapid and that for all rivers there is the same final home Under the charm of her new pleasures Maggie herself was ceasing to think with her eager prefiguring imagination of her future lot and her anxiety about her first interview with Philip was losing its predominance perhaps unconsciously to herself she was not sorry that the interview had been deferred For Philip had not come the evening he was expected and mister Stephen Guest brought word that he was gone to the coast probably he thought on a sketching expedition but it was not certain when he would return It was just like Philip to go off in that way without telling any one It was not until the twelfth day that he returned to find both Lucy s notes awaiting him he had left before he knew of Maggie s arrival Perhaps one had need be nineteen again to be quite convinced of the feelings that were crowded for Maggie into those twelve days of the length to which they were stretched for her by the novelty of her experience in them and the varying attitudes of her mind The early days of an acquaintance almost always have this importance for us and fill up a larger space in our memory than longer subsequent periods which have been less filled with discovery and new impressions There were not many hours in those ten days in which mister Stephen Guest was not seated by Lucy s side or standing near her at the piano or accompanying her on some outdoor excursion his attentions were clearly becoming more assiduous and that was what every one had expected Lucy was very happy all the happier because Stephen s society seemed to have become much more interesting and amusing since Maggie had been there Playful discussions sometimes serious ones were going forward in which both Stephen and Maggie revealed themselves to the admiration of the gentle unobtrusive Lucy and it more than once crossed her mind what a charming quartet they should have through life when Maggie married Philip Is it an inexplicable thing that a girl should enjoy her lover s society the more for the presence of a third person and be without the slightest spasm of jealousy that the third person had the conversation habitually directed to her Not when that girl is as tranquil hearted as Lucy thoroughly possessed with a belief that she knows the state of her companions affections and not prone to the feelings which shake such a belief in the absence of positive evidence against it Besides it was Lucy by whom Stephen sat to whom he gave his arm to whom he appealed as the person sure to agree with him and every day there was the same tender politeness toward her the same consciousness of her wants and care to supply them Was there really the same It seemed to Lucy that there was more and it was no wonder that the real significance of the change escaped her It was a subtle act of conscience in Stephen that even he himself was not aware of His personal attentions to Maggie were comparatively slight and there had even sprung up an apparent distance between them that prevented the renewal of that faint resemblance to gallantry into which he had fallen the first day in the boat If Stephen came in when Lucy was out of the room if Lucy left them together they never spoke to each other Stephen perhaps seemed to be examining books or music and Maggie bent her head assiduously over her work Each was oppressively conscious of the other s presence even to the finger ends Yet each looked and longed for the same thing to happen the next day Neither of them had begun to reflect on the matter or silently to ask To what does all this tend Maggie only felt that life was revealing something quite new to her and she was absorbed in the direct immediate experience without any energy left for taking account of it and reasoning about it Stephen wilfully abstained from self questioning and would not admit to himself that he felt an influence which was to have any determining effect on his conduct And when Lucy came into the room again they were once more unconstrained Maggie could contradict Stephen and laugh at him and he could recommend to her consideration the example of that most charming heroine Miss Sophia Western who had a great respect for the understandings of men Maggie could look at Stephen which for some reason or other she always avoided when they were alone and he could even ask her to play his accompaniment for him since Lucy s fingers were so busy with that bazaar work and lecture her on hurrying the tempo which was certainly Maggie s weak point One day it was the day of Philip s return Lucy had formed a sudden engagement to spend the evening with missus Kenn whose delicate state of health threatening to become confirmed illness through an attack of bronchitis obliged her to resign her functions at the coming bazaar into the hands of other ladies of whom she wished Lucy to be one The engagement had been formed in Stephen s presence and he had heard Lucy promise to dine early and call at six o clock for Miss Torry who brought missus Kenn s request Here is another of the moral results of this idiotic bazaar Stephen burst forth as soon as Miss Torry had left the room taking young ladies from the duties of the domestic hearth into scenes of dissipation among urn rugs and embroidered reticules I should like to know what is the proper function of women if it is not to make reasons for husbands to stay at home and still stronger reasons for bachelors to go out If this goes on much longer the bonds of society will be dissolved Well it will not go on much longer said Lucy laughing for the bazaar is to take place on Monday week Thank Heaven said Stephen Kenn himself said the other day that he didn t like this plan of making vanity do the work of charity but just as the British public is not reasonable enough to bear direct taxation so saint Ogg s has not got force of motive enough to build and endow schools without calling in the force of folly Did he say so said little Lucy her hazel eyes opening wide with anxiety I never heard him say anything of that kind I thought he approved of what we were doing I m sure he approves you said Stephen smiling at her affectionately your conduct in going out to night looks vicious I own but I know there is benevolence at the bottom of it Oh you think too well of me said Lucy shaking her head with a pretty blush and there the subject ended But it was tacitly understood that Stephen would not come in the evening and on the strength of that tacit understanding he made his morning visit the longer not saying good bye until after four Maggie was seated in the drawing room alone shortly after dinner with Minny on her lap having left her uncle to his wine and his nap and her mother to the compromise between knitting and nodding which when there was no company she always carried on in the dining room till tea time Maggie was stooping to caress the tiny silken pet and comforting him for his mistress s absence when the sound of a footstep on the gravel made her look up and she saw mister Stephen Guest walking up the garden as if he had come straight from the river It was very unusual to see him so soon after dinner He often complained that their dinner hour was late at Park House Nevertheless there he was in his black dress he had evidently been home and must have come again by the river Maggie felt her cheeks glowing and her heart beating it was natural she should be nervous for she was not accustomed to receive visitors alone He had seen her look up through the open window and raised his hat as he walked toward it to enter that way instead of by the door He blushed too and certainly looked as foolish as a young man of some wit and self possession can be expected to look as he walked in with a roll of music in his hand and said with an air of hesitating improvisation You are surprised to see me again Miss Tulliver I ought to apologize for coming upon you by surprise but I wanted to come into the town and I got our man to row me so I thought I would bring these things from the Maid of Artois for your cousin I forgot them this morning Will you give them to her Yes said Maggie who had risen confusedly with Minny in her arms and now not quite knowing what else to do sat down again Stephen laid down his hat with the music which rolled on the floor and sat down in the chair close by her He had never done so before and both he and Maggie were quite aware that it was an entirely new position Well you pampered minion said Stephen leaning to pull the long curly ears that drooped over Maggie s arm It was not a suggestive remark and as the speaker did not follow it up by further development it naturally left the conversation at a standstill It seemed to Stephen like some action in a dream that he was obliged to do and wonder at himself all the while to go on stroking Minny s head Yet it was very pleasant he only wished he dared look at Maggie and that she would look at him let him have one long look into those deep strange eyes of hers and then he would be satisfied and quite reasonable after that He thought it was becoming a sort of monomania with him to want that long look from Maggie and he was racking his invention continually to find out some means by which he could have it without its appearing singular and entailing subsequent embarrassment As for Maggie she had no distinct thought only the sense of a presence like that of a closely hovering broad winged bird in the darkness for she was unable to look up and saw nothing but Minny s black wavy coat But this must end some time perhaps it ended very soon and only seemed long as a minute s dream does Stephen at last sat upright sideways in his chair leaning one hand and arm over the back and looking at Maggie What should he say We shall have a splendid sunset I think sha n t you go out and see it I don t know said Maggie Then courageously raising her eyes and looking out of the window if I m not playing cribbage with my uncle A pause during which Minny is stroked again but has sufficient insight not to be grateful for it to growl rather Do you like sitting alone A rather arch look came over Maggie s face and just glancing at Stephen she said Would it be quite civil to say ve s It was rather a dangerous question for an intruder to ask said Stephen delighted with that glance and getting determined to stay for another But you will have more than half an hour to yourself after I am gone he added taking out his watch I know mister Deane never comes in till half past seven Another pause during which Maggie looked steadily out of the window till by a great effort she moved her head to look down at Minny s back again and said I wish Lucy had not been obliged to go out We lose our music We shall have a new voice to morrow night said Stephen Will you tell your cousin that our friend Philip Wakem is come back I saw him as I went home Maggie gave a little start it seemed hardly more than a vibration that passed from head to foot in an instant But the new images summoned by Philip s name dispersed half the oppressive spell she had been under She rose from her chair with a sudden resolution and laying Minny on his cushion went to reach Lucy s large work basket from its corner Stephen was vexed and disappointed he thought perhaps Maggie didn t like the name of Wakem to be mentioned to her in that abrupt way for he now recalled what Lucy had told him of the family quarrel It was of no use to stay any longer Maggie was seating herself at the table with her work and looking chill and proud and he he looked like a simpleton for having come A gratuitous entirely superfluous visit of that sort was sure to make a man disagreeable and ridiculous Of course it was palpable to Maggie s thinking that he had dined hastily in his own room for the sake of setting off again and finding her alone A boyish state of mind for an accomplished young gentleman of five and twenty not without legal knowledge But a reference to history perhaps may make it not incredible At this moment Maggie s ball of knitting wool rolled along the ground and she started up to reach it Stephen rose too and picking up the ball met her with a vexed complaining look that gave his eyes quite a new expression to Maggie whose own eyes met them as he presented the ball to her Good bye said Stephen in a tone that had the same beseeching discontent as his eyes He dared not put out his hand he thrust both hands into his tail pockets as he spoke Maggie thought she had perhaps been rude Won t you stay she said timidly not looking away for that would have seemed rude again No thank you said Stephen looking still into the half unwilling half fascinated eyes as a thirsty man looks toward the track of the distant brook The boat is waiting for me You ll tell your cousin Yes That I brought the music I mean Yes And that Philip is come back Yes Maggie did not notice Philip s name this time Won t you come out a little way into the garden said Stephen in a still gentler tone but the next moment he was vexed that she did not say No for she moved away now toward the open window and he was obliged to take his hat and walk by her side But he thought of something to make him amends Do take my arm he said in a low tone as if it were a secret There is something strangely winning to most women in that offer of the firm arm the help is not wanted physically at that moment but the sense of help the presence of strength that is outside them and yet theirs meets a continual want of the imagination Either on that ground or some other Maggie took the arm And they walked together round the grassplot and under the drooping green of the laburnums in the same dim dreamy state as they had been in a quarter of an hour before only that Stephen had had the look he longed for without yet perceiving in himself the symptoms of returning reasonableness and Maggie had darting thoughts across the dimness how came he to be there Why had she come out Not a word was spoken If it had been each would have been less intensely conscious of the other Take care of this step said Stephen at last Oh I will go in now said Maggie feeling that the step had come like a rescue Good evening In an instant she had withdrawn her arm and was running back to the house She did not reflect that this sudden action would only add to the embarrassing recollections of the last half hour She had no thought left for that She only threw herself into the low arm chair and burst into tears Oh Philip Philip I wish we were together again so quietly in the Red Deeps Stephen looked after her a moment then went on to the boat and was soon landed at the wharf He spent the evening in the billiard room smoking one cigar after another and losing lives at pool But he would not leave off He was determined not to think not to admit any more distinct remembrance than was urged upon him by the perpetual presence of Maggie He was looking at her and she was on his arm But there came the necessity of walking home in the cool starlight and with it the necessity of cursing his own folly and bitterly determining that he would never trust himself alone with Maggie again It was all madness he was in love thoroughly attached to Lucy and engaged engaged as strongly as an honorable man need be He wished he had never seen this Maggie Tulliver to be thrown into a fever by her in this way she would make a sweet strange troublesome adorable wife to some man or other but he would never have chosen her himself Did she feel as he did He hoped she did not He ought not to have gone He would master himself in future He would make himself disagreeable to her quarrel with her perhaps Quarrel with her Was it possible to quarrel with a creature who had such eyes defying and deprecating contradicting and clinging imperious and beseeching full of delicious opposites To see such a creature subdued by love for one would be a lot worth having to another man There was a muttered exclamation which ended this inward soliloquy as Stephen threw away the end of his last cigar and thrusting his hands into his pockets stalked along at a quieter pace through the shrubbery It was not of a benedictory kind Chapter VII Philip Re enters The next morning was very wet the sort of morning on which male neighbors who have no imperative occupation at home are likely to pay their fair friends an illimitable visit The rain which has been endurable enough for the walk or ride one way is sure to become so heavy and at the same time so certain to clear up by and by that nothing but an open quarrel can abbreviate the visit latent detestation will not do at all And if people happen to be lovers what can be so delightful in England as a rainy morning English sunshine is dubious bonnets are never quite secure and if you sit down on the grass it may lead to catarrhs But the rain is to be depended on You gallop through it in a mackintosh and presently find yourself in the seat you like best a little above or a little below the one on which your goddess sits it is the same thing to the metaphysical mind and that is the reason why women are at once worshipped and looked down upon with a satisfactory confidence that there will be no lady callers Stephen will come earlier this morning I know said Lucy he always does when it s rainy Maggie made no answer She was angry with Stephen she began to think she should dislike him and if it had not been for the rain she would have gone to her aunt Glegg s this morning and so have avoided him altogether As it was she must find some reason for remaining out of the room with her mother But Stephen did not come earlier and there was another visitor a nearer neighbor who preceded him When Philip entered the room he was going merely to bow to Maggie feeling that their acquaintance was a secret which he was bound not to betray but when she advanced toward him and put out her hand he guessed at once that Lucy had been taken into her confidence It was a moment of some agitation to both though Philip had spent many hours in preparing for it but like all persons who have passed through life with little expectation of sympathy he seldom lost his self control and shrank with the most sensitive pride from any noticeable betrayal of emotion A little extra paleness a little tension of the nostril when he spoke and the voice pitched in rather a higher key that to strangers would seem expressive of cold indifference were all the signs Philip usually gave of an inward drama that was not without its fierceness But Maggie who had little more power of concealing the impressions made upon her than if she had been constructed of musical strings felt her eyes getting larger with tears as they took each other s hands in silence They were not painful tears they had rather something of the same origin as the tears women and children shed when they have found some protection to cling to and look back on the threatened danger For Philip who a little while ago was associated continually in Maggie s mind with the sense that Tom might reproach her with some justice had now in this short space become a sort of outward conscience to her that she might fly to for rescue and strength Her tranquil tender affection for Philip with its root deep down in her childhood and its memories of long quiet talk confirming by distinct successive impressions the first instinctive bias the fact that in him the appeal was more strongly to her pity and womanly devotedness than to her vanity or other egoistic excitability of her nature seemed now to make a sort of sacred place a sanctuary where she could find refuge from an alluring influence which the best part of herself must resist which must bring horrible tumult within wretchedness without This new sense of her relation to Philip nullified the anxious scruples she would otherwise have felt lest she should overstep the limit of intercourse with him that Tom would sanction and she put out her hand to him and felt the tears in her eyes without any consciousness of an inward check The scene was just what Lucy expected and her kind heart delighted in bringing Philip and Maggie together again though even with all her regard for Philip she could not resist the impression that her cousin Tom had some excuse for feeling shocked at the physical incongruity between the two a prosaic person like cousin Tom who didn t like poetry and fairy tales But she began to speak as soon as possible to set them at ease This was very good and virtuous of you she said in her pretty treble like the low conversational notes of little birds to come so soon after your arrival And as it is I think I will pardon you for running away in an inopportune manner and giving your friends no notice Come and sit down here she went on placing the chair that would suit him best and you shall find yourself treated mercifully You will never govern well Miss Deane said Philip as he seated himself because no one will ever believe in your severity People will always encourage themselves in misdemeanors by the certainty that you will be indulgent Lucy gave some playful contradiction but Philip did not hear what it was for he had naturally turned toward Maggie and she was looking at him with that open affectionate scrutiny which we give to a friend from whom we have been long separated What a moment their parting had been And Philip felt as if he were only in the morrow of it He felt this so keenly with such intense detailed remembrance with such passionate revival of all that had been said and looked in their last conversation that with that jealousy and distrust which in diffident natures is almost inevitably linked with a strong feeling he thought he read in Maggie s glance and manner the evidence of a change The very fact that he feared and half expected it would be sure to make this thought rush in in the absence of positive proof to the contrary I am having a great holiday am I not said Maggie Lucy is like a fairy godmother she has turned me from a drudge into a princess in no time I do nothing but indulge myself all day long and she always finds out what I want before I know it myself I am sure she is the happier for having you then said Philip You must be better than a whole menagerie of pets to her And you look well You are benefiting by the change Artificial conversation of this sort went on a little while till Lucy determined to put an end to it exclaimed with a good imitation of annoyance that she had forgotten something and was quickly out of the room In a moment Maggie and Philip leaned forward and the hands were clasped again with a look of sad contentment like that of friends who meet in the memory of recent sorrow I told my brother I wished to see you Philip I asked him to release me from my promise and he consented Maggie in her impulsiveness wanted Philip to know at once the position they must hold toward each other but she checked herself The things that had happened since he had spoken of his love for her were so painful that she shrank from being the first to allude to them It seemed almost like an injury toward Philip even to mention her brother her brother who had insulted him But he was thinking too entirely of her to be sensitive on any other point at that moment Then we can at least be friends Maggie There is nothing to hinder that now Will not your father object said Maggie withdrawing her hand I should not give you up on any ground but your own wish Maggie said Philip coloring There are points on which I should always resist my father as I used to tell you That is one Then there is nothing to hinder our being friends Philip seeing each other and talking to each other while I am here I shall soon go away again I mean to go very soon to a new situation Is that inevitable Maggie Yes I must not stay here long It would unfit me for the life I must begin again at last I can t live in dependence I can t live with my brother though he is very good to me He would like to provide for me but that would be intolerable to me Philip was silent a few moments and then said in that high feeble voice which with him indicated the resolute suppression of emotion Is there no other alternative Maggie Is that life away from those who love you the only one you will allow yourself to look forward to Yes Philip she said looking at him pleadingly as if she entreated him to believe that she was compelled to this course At least as things are I don t know what may be in years to come But I begin to think there can never come much happiness to me from loving I have always had so much pain mingled with it I wish I could make myself a world outside it as men do Now you are returning to your old thought in a new form Maggie the thought I used to combat said Philip with a slight tinge of bitterness You want to find out a mode of renunciation that will be an escape from pain I tell you again there is no such escape possible except by perverting or mutilating one s nature What would become of me if I tried to escape from pain Scorn and cynicism would be my only opium unless I could fall into some kind of conceited madness and fancy myself a favorite of Heaven because I am not a favorite with men The bitterness had taken on some impetuosity as Philip went on speaking the words were evidently an outlet for some immediate feeling of his own as well as an answer to Maggie There was a pain pressing on him at that moment He shrank with proud delicacy from the faintest allusion to the words of love of plighted love that had passed between them It would have seemed to him like reminding Maggie of a promise it would have had for him something of the baseness of compulsion He could not dwell on the fact that he himself had not changed for that too would have had the air of an appeal His love for Maggie was stamped even more than the rest of his experience with the exaggerated sense that he was an exception that she that every one saw him in the light of an exception But Maggie was conscience stricken Yes Philip she said with her childish contrition when he used to chide her you are right I know I do always think too much of my own feelings and not enough of others not enough of yours I had need have you always to find fault with me and teach me so many things have come true that you used to tell me Maggie was resting her elbow on the table leaning her head on her hand and looking at Philip with half penitent dependent affection as she said this while he was returning her gaze with an expression that to her consciousness gradually became less vague became charged with a specific recollection Had his mind flown back to something that she now remembered something about a lover of Lucy s It was a thought that made her shudder it gave new definiteness to her present position and to the tendency of what had happened the evening before She moved her arm from the table urged to change her position by that positive physical oppression at the heart that sometimes accompanies a sudden mental pang What is the matter Maggie Has something happened Philip said in inexpressible anxiety his imagination being only too ready to weave everything that was fatal to them both No nothing said Maggie rousing her latent will Philip must not have that odious thought in his mind she would banish it from her own Nothing she repeated except in my own mind You used to say I should feel the effect of my starved life as you called it and I do I am too eager in my enjoyment of music and all luxuries now they are come to me She took up her work and occupied herself resolutely while Philip watched her really in doubt whether she had anything more than this general allusion in her mind It was quite in Maggie s character to be agitated by vague self reproach But soon there came a violent well known ring at the door bell resounding through the house Oh what a startling announcement said Maggie quite mistress of herself though not without some inward flutter I wonder where Lucy is Lucy had not been deaf to the signal and after an interval long enough for a few solicitous but not hurried inquiries she herself ushered Stephen in Well old fellow he said going straight up to Philip and shaking him heartily by the hand bowing to Maggie in passing it s glorious to have you back again only I wish you d conduct yourself a little less like a sparrow with a residence on the house top and not go in and out constantly without letting the servants know This is about the twentieth time I ve had to scamper up those countless stairs to that painting room of yours all to no purpose because your people thought you were at home Such incidents embitter friendship I ve so few visitors it seems hardly worth while to leave notice of my exit and entrances said Philip feeling rather oppressed just then by Stephen s bright strong presence and strong voice Are you quite well this morning Miss Tulliver said Stephen turning to Maggie with stiff politeness and putting out his hand with the air of fulfilling a social duty Maggie gave the tips of her fingers and said Quite well thank you in a tone of proud indifference Philip s eyes were watching them keenly but Lucy was used to seeing variations in their manner to each other and only thought with regret that there was some natural antipathy which every now and then surmounted their mutual good will Maggie is not the sort of woman Stephen admires and she is irritated by something in him which she interprets as conceit was the silent observation that accounted for everything to guileless Lucy Stephen and Maggie had no sooner completed this studied greeting than each felt hurt by the other s coldness And Stephen while rattling on in questions to Philip about his recent sketching expedition was thinking all the more about Maggie because he was not drawing her into the conversation as he had invariably done before Maggie and Philip are not looking happy thought Lucy this first interview has been saddening to them I think we people who have not been galloping she said to Stephen are all a little damped by the rain Let us have some music We ought to take advantage of having Philip and you together Give us the duet in Masaniello Maggie has not heard that and I know it will suit her Come then said Stephen going toward the piano and giving a foretaste of the tune in his deep brum brum very pleasant to hear You please Philip you play the accompaniment said Lucy and then I can go on with my work You will like to play sha n t you she added with a pretty inquiring look anxious as usual lest she should have proposed what was not pleasant to another but with yearnings toward her unfinished embroidery Philip had brightened at the proposition for there is no feeling perhaps except the extremes of fear and grief that does not find relief in music that does not make a man sing or play the better and Philip had an abundance of pent up feeling at this moment as complex as any trio or quartet that was ever meant to express love and jealousy and resignation and fierce suspicion all at the same time Oh yes he said seating himself at the piano it is a way of eking out one s imperfect life and being three people at once to sing and make the piano sing and hear them both all the while or else to sing and paint Ah there you are an enviable fellow I can do nothing with my hands said Stephen That has generally been observed in men of great administrative capacity I believe a tendency to predominance of the reflective powers in me Haven t you observed that Miss Tulliver Stephen had fallen by mistake into his habit of playful appeal to Maggie and she could not repress the answering flush and epigram I have observed a tendency to predominance she said smiling and Philip at that moment devoutly hoped that she found the tendency disagreeable Come come said Lucy music music We will discuss each other s qualities another time Maggie always tried in vain to go on with her work when music began She tried harder than ever to day for the thought that Stephen knew how much she cared for his singing was one that no longer roused a merely playful resistance and she knew too that it was his habit always to stand so that he could look at her But it was of no use she soon threw her work down and all her intentions were lost in the vague state of emotion produced by the inspiring duet emotion that seemed to make her at once strong and weak strong for all enjoyment weak for all resistance When the strain passed into the minor she half started from her seat with the sudden thrill of that change Poor Maggie She looked very beautiful when her soul was being played on in this way by the inexorable power of sound You might have seen the slightest perceptible quivering through her whole frame as she leaned a little forward clasping her hands as if to steady herself while her eyes dilated and brightened into that wide open childish expression of wondering delight which always came back in her happiest moments Lucy who at other times had always been at the piano when Maggie was looking in this way could not resist the impulse to steal up to her and kiss her Philip too caught a glimpse of her now and then round the open book on the desk and felt that he had never before seen her under so strong an influence More more said Lucy when the duet had been encored Something spirited again Maggie always says she likes a great rush of sound It must be Let us take the road then said Stephen so suitable for a wet morning But are you prepared to abandon the most sacred duties of life and come and sing with us Oh yes said Lucy laughing If you will look out the Beggar s Opera from the large canterbury It has a dingy cover That is a great clue considering there are about a score covers here of rival dinginess said Stephen drawing out the canterbury Oh play something the while Philip said Lucy noticing that his fingers were wandering over the keys What is that you are falling into something delicious that I don t know Don t you know that said Philip bringing out the tune more definitely It s from the Sonnambula Ah perche non posso odiarti I don t know the opera but it appears the tenor is telling the heroine that he shall always love her though she may forsake him You ve heard me sing it to the English words I love thee still It was not quite unintentionally that Philip had wandered into this song which might be an indirect expression to Maggie of what he could not prevail on himself to say to her directly Her ears had been open to what he was saying and when he began to sing she understood the plaintive passion of the music That pleading tenor had no very fine qualities as a voice but it was not quite new to her it had sung to her by snatches in a subdued way among the grassy walks and hollows and underneath the leaning ash tree in the Red Deeps There seemed to be some reproach in the words did Philip mean that She wished she had assured him more distinctly in their conversation that she desired not to renew the hope of love between them only because it clashed with her inevitable circumstances She was touched not thrilled by the song it suggested distinct memories and thoughts and brought quiet regret in the place of excitement That s the way with you tenors said Stephen who was waiting with music in his hand while Philip finished the song You demoralize the fair sex by warbling your sentimental love and constancy under all sorts of vile treatment Nothing short of having your heads served up in a dish like that mediaeval tenor or troubadour would prevent you from expressing your entire resignation I must administer an antidote while Miss Deane prepares to tear herself away from her bobbins Stephen rolled out with saucy energy Shall I wasting in despair Die because a woman s fair and seemed to make all the air in the room alive with a new influence Lucy always proud of what Stephen did went toward the piano with laughing admiring looks at him and Maggie in spite of her resistance to the spirit of the song and to the singer was taken hold of and shaken by the invisible influence was borne along by a wave too strong for her But angrily resolved not to betray herself she seized her work and went on making false stitches and pricking her fingers with much perseverance not looking up or taking notice of what was going forward until all the three voices united in Let us take the road I am afraid there would have been a subtle stealing gratification in her mind if she had known how entirely this saucy defiant Stephen was occupied with her how he was passing rapidly from a determination to treat her with ostentatious indifference to an irritating desire for some sign of inclination from her some interchange of subdued word or look with her It was not long before he found an opportunity when they had passed to the music of The Tempest Maggie feeling the need of a footstool was walking across the room to get one when Stephen who was not singing just then and was conscious of all her movements guessed her want and flew to anticipate her lifting the footstool with an entreating look at her which made it impossible not to return a glance of gratitude And then to have the footstool placed carefully by a too self confident personage not any self confident personage but one in particular who suddenly looks humble and anxious and lingers bending still to ask if there is not some draught in that position between the window and the fireplace and if he may not be allowed to move the work table for her these things will summon a little of the too ready traitorous tenderness into a woman s eyes compelled as she is in her girlish time to learn her life lessons in very trivial language And to Maggie such things had not been every day incidents but were a new element in her life and found her keen appetite for homage quite fresh That tone of gentle solicitude obliged her to look at the face that was bent toward her and to say No thank you and nothing could prevent that mutual glance from being delicious to both as it had been the evening before It was but an ordinary act of politeness in Stephen it had hardly taken two minutes and Lucy who was singing scarcely noticed it But to Philip s mind filled already with a vague anxiety that was likely to find a definite ground for itself in any trivial incident this sudden eagerness in Stephen and the change in Maggie s face which was plainly reflecting a beam from his seemed so strong a contrast with the previous overwrought signs of indifference as to be charged with painful meaning Stephen s voice pouring in again jarred upon his nervous susceptibility as if it had been the clang of sheet iron and he felt inclined to make the piano shriek in utter discord He had really seen no communicable ground for suspecting any ususual feeling between Stephen and Maggie his own reason told him so and he wanted to go home at once that he might reflect coolly on these false images till he had convinced himself of their nullity But then again he wanted to stay as long as Stephen stayed always to be present when Stephen was present with Maggie It seemed to poor Philip so natural nay inevitable that any man who was near Maggie should fall in love with her There was no promise of happiness for her if she were beguiled into loving Stephen Guest and this thought emboldened Philip to view his own love for her in the light of a less unequal offering He was beginning to play very falsely under this deafening inward tumult and Lucy was looking at him in astonishment when missus Tulliver s entrance to summon them to lunch came as an excuse for abruptly breaking off the music Ah mister Philip said mister Deane when they entered the dining room I ve not seen you for a long while Your father s not at home I think is he I went after him to the office the other day and they said he was out of town He s been to Mudport on business for several days said Philip but he s come back now As fond of his farming hobby as ever eh I believe so said Philip rather wondering at this sudden interest in his father s pursuits Ah said mister Deane he s got some land in his own hands on this side the river as well as the other I think Yes he has Ah continued mister Deane as he dispensed the pigeonpie he must find farming a heavy item an expensive hobby I never had a hobby myself never would give in to that And the worst of all hobbies are those that people think they can get money at They shoot their money down like corn out of a sack then Lucy felt a little nervous under her father s apparently gratuitous criticism of mister Wakem s expenditure But it ceased there and mister Deane became unusually silent and meditative during his luncheon Lucy accustomed to watch all indications in her father and having reasons which had recently become strong for an extra interest in what referred to the Wakems felt an unusual curiosity to know what had prompted her father s questions His subsequent silence made her suspect there had been some special reason for them in his mind With this idea in her head she resorted to her usual plan when she wanted to tell or ask her father anything particular she found a reason for her aunt Tulliver to leaving the dining room after dinner and seated herself on a small stool at her father s knee mister Deane under those circumstances considered that he tasted some of the most agreeable moments his merits had purchased him in life notwithstanding that Lucy disliking to have her hair powdered with snuff usually began by mastering his snuff box on such occasions You don t want to go to sleep yet papa do you she said as she brought up her stool and opened the large fingers that clutched the snuff box Not yet said mister Deane glancing at the reward of merit in the decanter But what do you want he added pinching the dimpled chin fondly to coax some more sovereigns out of my pocket for your bazaar Eh No I have no base motives at all to day I only want to talk not to beg I want to know what made you ask Philip Wakem about his father s farming to day papa It seemed rather odd because you never hardly say anything to him about his father and why should you care about mister Wakem s losing money by his hobby Something to do with business said mister Deane waving his hands as if to repel intrusion into that mystery But papa you always say mister Wakem has brought Philip up like a girl how came you to think you should get any business knowledge out of him Those abrupt questions sounded rather oddly Philip thought them queer Nonsense child said mister Deane willing to justify his social demeanor with which he had taken some pains in his upward progress There s a report that Wakem s mill and farm on the other side of the river Dorlcote Mill your uncle Tulliver s you know isn t answering so well as it did I wanted to see if your friend Philip would let anything out about his father s being tired of farming Why Would you buy the mill papa if he would part with it said Lucy eagerly Oh tell me everything here you shall have your snuff box if you ll tell me Because Maggie says all their hearts are set on Tom s getting back the mill some time It was one of the last things her father said to Tom that he must get back the mill Hush you little puss said mister Deane availing himself of the restored snuff box You must not say a word about this thing do you hear There s very little chance of their getting the mill or of anybody s getting it out of Wakem s hands And if he knew that we wanted it with a view to the Tulliver s getting it again he d be the less likely to part with it It s natural after what happened He behaved well enough to Tulliver before but a horsewhipping is not likely to be paid for with sugar plums Now papa said Lucy with a little air of solemnity will you trust me You must not ask me all my reasons for what I m going to say but I have very strong reasons And I m very cautious I am indeed Well let us hear Why I believe if you will let me take Philip Wakem into our confidence let me tell him all about your wish to buy and what it s for that my cousins wish to have it and why they wish to have it I believe Philip would help to bring it about I know he would desire to do it I don t see how that can be child said mister Deane looking puzzled Why should he care then with a sudden penetrating look at his daughter You don t think the poor lad s fond of you and so you can make him do what you like mister Deane felt quite safe about his daughter s affections No papa he cares very little about me not so much as I care about him But I have a reason for being quite sure of what I say Don t you ask me And if you ever guess don t tell me Only give me leave to do as I think fit about it Lucy rose from her stool to seat herself on her father s knee and kissed him with that last request Are you sure you won t do mischief now he said looking at her with delight Yes papa quite sure I m very wise I ve got all your business talents Didn t you admire my accompt book now when I showed it you Well well if this youngster will keep his counsel there won t be much harm done And to tell the truth I think there s not much chance for us any other way Now let me go off to sleep Chapter VIII Wakem in a New Light Before three days had passed after the conversation you have just overheard between Lucy and her father she had contrived to have a private interview with Philip during a visit of Maggie s to her aunt Glegg For a day and a night Philip turned over in his mind with restless agitation all that Lucy had told him in that interview till he had thoroughly resolved on a course of action He thought he saw before him now a possibility of altering his position with respect to Maggie and removing at least one obstacle between them He laid his plan and calculated all his moves with the fervid deliberation of a chess player in the days of his first ardor and was amazed himself at his sudden genius as a tactician His plan was as bold as it was thoroughly calculated Having watched for a moment when his father had nothing more urgent on his hands than the newspaper he went behind him laid a hand on his shoulder and said Father will you come up into my sanctum and look at my new sketches I ve arranged them now I m getting terrible stiff in the joints Phil for climbing those stairs of yours said Wakem looking kindly at his son as he laid down his paper But come along then This is a nice place for you isn t it Phil a capital light that from the roof eh was as usual the first thing he said on entering the painting room He liked to remind himself and his son too that his fatherly indulgence had provided the accommodation He had been a good father Emily would have nothing to reproach him with there if she came back again from her grave Come come he said putting his double eye glass over his nose and seating himself to take a general view while he rested you ve got a famous show here Upon my word I don t see that your things aren t as good as that London artist s what s his name that Leyburn gave so much money for Philip shook his head and smiled He had seated himself on his painting stool and had taken a lead pencil in his hand with which he was making strong marks to counteract the sense of tremulousness He watched his father get up and walk slowly round good naturedly dwelling on the pictures much longer than his amount of genuine taste for landscape would have prompted till he stopped before a stand on which two pictures were placed one much larger than the other the smaller one in a leather case Bless me what have you here said Wakem startled by a sudden transition from landscape to portrait I thought you d left off figures Who are these They are the same person said Philip with calm promptness at different ages And what person said Wakem sharply fixing his eyes with a growing look of suspicion on the larger picture Miss Tulliver The small one is something like what she was when I was at school with her brother at King s Lorton the larger one is not quite so good a likeness of what she was when I came from abroad Wakem turned round fiercely with a flushed face letting his eye glass fall and looking at his son with a savage expression for a moment as if he was ready to strike that daring feebleness from the stool But he threw himself into the armchair again and thrust his hands into his trouser pockets still looking angrily at his son however Philip did not return the look but sat quietly watching the point of his pencil And do you mean to say then that you have had any acquaintance with her since you came from abroad said Wakem at last with that vain effort which rage always makes to throw as much punishment as it desires to inflict into words and tones since blows are forbidden Yes I saw a great deal of her for a whole year before her father s death We met often in that thicket the Red Deeps near Dorlcote Mill I love her dearly I shall never love any other woman I have thought of her ever since she was a little girl Go on sir And you have corresponded with her all this while No I never told her I loved her till just before we parted and she promised her brother not to see me again or to correspond with me I am not sure that she loves me or would consent to marry me But if she would consent if she did love me well enough I should marry her And this is the return you make me for all the indulgences I ve heaped on you said Wakem getting white and beginning to tremble under an enraged sense of impotence before Philip s calm defiance and concentration of purpose No father said Philip looking up at him for the first time I don t regard it as a return You have been an indulgent father to me but I have always felt that it was because you had an affectionate wish to give me as much happiness as my unfortunate lot would admit not that it was a debt you expected me to pay by sacrificing all my chances of happiness to satisfy feelings of yours which I can never share I think most sons would share their father s feelings in this case said Wakem bitterly The girl s father was an ignorant mad brute who was within an inch of murdering me The whole town knows it And the brother is just as insolent only in a cooler way He forbade her seeing you you say he ll break every bone in your body for your greater happiness if you don t take care But you seem to have made up your mind you have counted the consequences I suppose Of course you are independent of me you can marry this girl to morrow if you like you are a man of five and twenty you can go your way and I can go mine We need have no more to do with each other Wakem rose and walked toward the door but something held him back and instead of leaving the room he walked up and down it Philip was slow to reply and when he spoke his tone had a more incisive quietness and clearness than ever No I can t marry Miss Tulliver even if she would have me if I have only my own resources to maintain her with I have been brought up to no profession I can t offer her poverty as well as deformity Ah there is a reason for your clinging to me doubtless said Wakem still bitterly though Philip s last words had given him a pang they had stirred a feeling which had been a habit for a quarter of a century He threw himself into the chair again I expected all this said Philip I know these scenes are often happening between father and son If I were like other men of my age I might answer your angry words by still angrier we might part I should marry the woman I love and have a chance of being as happy as the rest But if it will be a satisfaction to you to annihilate the very object of everything you ve done for me you have an advantage over most fathers you can completely deprive me of the only thing that would make my life worth having Philip paused but his father was silent You know best what satisfaction you would have beyond that of gratifying a ridiculous rancor worthy only of wandering savages Ridiculous rancor Wakem burst out What do you mean Damn it is a man to be horsewhipped by a boor and love him for it Besides there s that cold proud devil of a son who said a word to me I shall not forget when we had the settling He would be as pleasant a mark for a bullet as I know if he were worth the expense I don t mean your resentment toward them said Philip who had his reasons for some sympathy with this view of Tom though a feeling of revenge is not worth much that you should care to keep it I mean your extending the enmity to a helpless girl who has too much sense and goodness to share their narrow prejudices She has never entered into the family quarrels What does that signify We don t ask what a woman does we ask whom she belongs to It s altogether a degrading thing to you to think of marrying old Tulliver s daughter For the first time in the dialogue Philip lost some of his self control and colored with anger Miss Tulliver he said with bitter incisiveness has the only grounds of rank that anything but vulgar folly can suppose to belong to the middle class she is thoroughly refined and her friends whatever else they may be are respected for irreproachable honor and integrity All saint Ogg s I fancy would pronounce her to be more than my equal Wakem darted a glance of fierce question at his son but Philip was not looking at him and with a certain penitent consciousness went on in a few moments as if in amplification of his last words Find a single person in saint Ogg s who will not tell you that a beautiful creature like her would be throwing herself away on a pitiable object like me Not she said Wakem rising again and forgetting everything else in a burst of resentful pride half fatherly half personal It would be a deuced fine match for her It s all stuff about an accidental deformity when a girl s really attached to a man But girls are not apt to get attached under those circumstances said Philip Well then said Wakem rather brutally trying to recover his previous position if she doesn t care for you you might have spared yourself the trouble of talking to me about her and you might have spared me the trouble of refusing my consent to what was never likely to happen Wakem strode to the door and without looking round again banged it after him Philip was not without confidence that his father would be ultimately wrought upon as he had expected by what had passed but the scene had jarred upon his nerves which were as sensitive as a woman s He determined not to go down to dinner he couldn t meet his father again that day It was Wakem s habit when he had no company at home to go out in the evening often as early as half past seven and as it was far on in the afternoon now Philip locked up his room and went out for a long ramble thinking he would not return until his father was out of the house again He got into a boat and went down the river to a favorite village where he dined and lingered till it was late enough for him to return He had never had any sort of quarrel with his father before and had a sickening fear that this contest just begun might go on for weeks and what might not happen in that time He would not allow himself to define what that involuntary question meant But if he could once be in the position of Maggie s accepted acknowledged lover there would be less room for vague dread He went up to his painting room again and threw himself with a sense of fatigue into the armchair looking round absently at the views of water and rock that were ranged around till he fell into a doze in which he fancied Maggie was slipping down a glistening green slimy channel of a waterfall and he was looking on helpless till he was awakened by what seemed a sudden awful crash It was the opening of the door and he could hardly have dozed more than a few moments for there was no perceptible change in the evening light It was his father who entered and when Philip moved to vacate the chair for him he said Sit still I d rather walk about He stalked up and down the room once or twice and then standing opposite Philip with his hands thrust in his side pockets he said as if continuing a conversation that had not been broken off But this girl seems to have been fond of you Phil else she wouldn t have met you in that way Philip s heart was beating rapidly and a transient flush passed over his face like a gleam It was not quite easy to speak at once She liked me at King s Lorton when she was a little girl because I used to sit with her brother a great deal when he had hurt his foot She had kept that in her memory and thought of me as a friend of a long while ago She didn t think of me as a lover when she met me Well but you made love to her at last What did she say then said Wakem walking about again She said she did love me then Confound it then what else do you want Is she a jilt She was very young then said Philip hesitatingly I m afraid she hardly knew what she felt I m afraid our long separation and the idea that events must always divide us may have made a difference But she s in the town I ve seen her at church Haven t you spoken to her since you came back Yes at mister Deane s But I couldn t renew my proposals to her on several grounds One obstacle would be removed if you would give your consent if you would be willing to think of her as a daughter in law Wakem was silent a little while pausing before Maggie s picture She s not the sort of woman your mother was though Phil he said at last I saw her at church she s handsomer than this deuced fine eyes and fine figure I saw but rather dangerous and unmanageable eh She s very tender and affectionate and so simple without the airs and petty contrivances other women have Ah said Wakem Then looking round at his son But your mother looked gentler she had that brown wavy hair and gray eyes like yours You can t remember her very well It was a thousand pities I d no likeness of her Then shouldn t you be glad for me to have the same sort of happiness father to sweeten my life for me There can never be another tie so strong to you as that which began eight and twenty years ago when you married my mother and you have been tightening it ever since Ah Phil you re the only fellow that knows the best of me said Wakem giving his hand to his son We must keep together if we can And now what am I to do You must come downstairs and tell me Am I to go and call on this dark eyed damsel The barrier once thrown down in this way Philip could talk freely to his father of their entire relation with the Tullivers of the desire to get the mill and land back into the family and of its transfer to Guest company as an intermediate step He could venture now to be persuasive and urgent and his father yielded with more readiness than he had calculated on I don t care about the mill he said at last with a sort of angry compliance I ve had an infernal deal of bother lately about the mill Let them pay me for my improvements that s all But there s one thing you needn t ask me I shall have no direct transactions with young Tulliver If you like to swallow him for his sister s sake you may but I ve no sauce that will make him go down I leave you to imagine the agreeable feelings with which Philip went to mister Deane the next day to say that mister Wakem was ready to open the negotiations and Lucy s pretty triumph as she appealed to her father whether she had not proved her great business abilities mister Deane was rather puzzled and suspected that there had been something going on among the young people to which he wanted a clew But to men of mister Deane s stamp what goes on among the young people is as extraneous to the real business of life as what goes on among the birds and butterflies until it can be shown to have a malign bearing on monetary affairs And in this case the bearing appeared to be entirely propitious Chapter IX Charity in Full Dress The culmination of Maggie s career as an admired member of society in saint Ogg s was certainly the day of the bazaar when her simple noble beauty clad in a white muslin of some soft floating kind which I suspect must have come from the stores of aunt Pullet s wardrobe appeared with marked distinction among the more adorned and conventional women around her We perhaps never detect how much of our social demeanor is made up of artificial airs until we see a person who is at once beautiful and simple without the beauty we are apt to call simplicity awkwardness The Miss Guests were much too well bred to have any of the grimaces and affected tones that belong to pretentious vulgarity but their stall being next to the one where Maggie sat it seemed newly obvious to day that Miss Guest held her chin too high and that Miss Laura spoke and moved continually with a view to effect All well dressed saint Ogg s and its neighborhood were there and it would have been worth while to come even from a distance to see the fine old hall with its open roof and carved oaken rafters and great oaken folding doors and light shed down from a height on the many colored show beneath a very quaint place with broad faded stripes painted on the walls and here and there a show of heraldic animals of a bristly long snouted character the cherished emblems of a noble family once the seigniors of this now civic hall A grand arch cut in the upper wall at one end surmounted an oaken orchestra with an open room behind it where hothouse plants and stalls for refreshments were disposed an agreeable resort for gentlemen disposed to loiter and yet to exchange the occasional crush down below for a more commodious point of view In fact the perfect fitness of this ancient building for an admirable modern purpose that made charity truly elegant and led through vanity up to the supply of a deficit was so striking that hardly a person entered the room without exchanging the remark more than once Near the great arch over the orchestra was the stone oriel with painted glass which was one of the venerable inconsistencies of the old hall and it was close by this that Lucy had her stall for the convenience of certain large plain articles which she had taken charge of for missus Kenn Maggie had begged to sit at the open end of the stall and to have the sale of these articles rather than of bead mats and other elaborate products of which she had but a dim understanding But it soon appeared that the gentlemen s dressing gowns which were among her commodities were objects of such general attention and inquiry and excited so troublesome a curiosity as to their lining and comparative merits together with a determination to test them by trying on as to make her post a very conspicuous one The ladies who had commodities of their own to sell and did not want dressing gowns saw at once the frivolity and bad taste of this masculine preference for goods which any tailor could furnish and it is possible that the emphatic notice of various kinds which was drawn toward Miss Tulliver on this public occasion threw a very strong and unmistakable light on her subsequent conduct in many minds then present Not that anger on account of spurned beauty can dwell in the celestial breasts of charitable ladies but rather that the errors of persons who have once been much admired necessarily take a deeper tinge from the mere force of contrast and also that to day Maggie s conspicuous position for the first time made evident certain characteristics which were subsequently felt to have an explanatory bearing There was something rather bold in Miss Tulliver s direct gaze and something undefinably coarse in the style of her beauty which placed her in the opinion of all feminine judges far below her cousin Miss Deane for the ladies of saint Ogg s had now completely ceded to Lucy their hypothetic claims on the admiration of mister Stephen Guest As for dear little Lucy herself her late benevolent triumph about the Mill and all the affectionate projects she was cherishing for Maggie and Philip helped to give her the highest spirits to day and she felt nothing but pleasure in the evidence of Maggie s attractiveness It is true she was looking very charming herself and Stephen was paying her the utmost attention on this public occasion jealously buying up the articles he had seen under her fingers in the process of making and gayly helping her to cajole the male customers into the purchase of the most effeminate futilities He chose to lay aside his hat and wear a scarlet fez of her embroidering but by superficial observers this was necessarily liable to be interpreted less as a compliment to Lucy than as a mark of coxcombry Guest is a great coxcomb young Torry observed but then he is a privileged person in saint Ogg s he carries all before him if another fellow did such things everybody would say he made a fool of himself And Stephen purchased absolutely nothing from Maggie until Lucy said in rather a vexed undertone See now all the things of Maggie s knitting will be gone and you will not have bought one There are those deliciously soft warm things for the wrists do buy them Oh no said Stephen they must be intended for imaginative persons who can chill themselves on this warm day by thinking of the frosty Caucasus Stern reason is my forte you know You must get Philip to buy those By the way why doesn t he come He never likes going where there are many people though I enjoined him to come He said he would buy up any of my goods that the rest of the world rejected But now do go and buy something of Maggie No no see she has got a customer there is old Wakem himself just coming up Lucy s eyes turned with anxious interest toward Maggie to see how she went through this first interview since a sadly memorable time with a man toward whom she must have so strange a mixture of feelings but she was pleased to notice that Wakem had tact enough to enter at once into talk about the bazaar wares and appear interested in purchasing smiling now and then kindly at Maggie and not calling on her to speak much as if he observed that she was rather pale and tremulous Why Wakem is making himself particularly amiable to your cousin said Stephen in an undertone to Lucy is it pure magnanimity You talked of a family quarrel Oh that will soon be quite healed I hope said Lucy becoming a little indiscreet in her satisfaction and speaking with an air of significance But Stephen did not appear to notice this and as some lady purchasers came up he lounged on toward Maggie s end handling trifles and standing aloof until Wakem who had taken out his purse had finished his transactions My son came with me he overheard Wakem saying but he has vanished into some other part of the building and has left all these charitable gallantries to me I hope you ll reproach him for his shabby conduct She returned his smile and bow without speaking and he turned away only then observing Stephen and nodding to him Maggie conscious that Stephen was still there busied herself with counting money and avoided looking up She had been well pleased that he had devoted himself to Lucy to day and had not come near her They had begun the morning with an indifferent salutation and both had rejoiced in being aloof from each other like a patient who has actually done without his opium in spite of former failures in resolution And during the last few days they had even been making up their minds to failures looking to the outward events that must soon come to separate them as a reason for dispensing with self conquest in detail Stephen moved step by step as if he were being unwillingly dragged until he had got round the open end of the stall and was half hidden by a screen of draperies Maggie went on counting her money till she suddenly heard a deep gentle voice saying Aren t you very tried Do let me bring you something some fruit or jelly mayn t I The unexpected tones shook her like a sudden accidental vibration of a harp close by her Oh no thank you she said faintly and only half looking up for an instant You look so pale Stephen insisted in a more entreating tone I m sure you re exhausted I must disobey you and bring something No indeed I couldn t take it Are you angry with me What have I done Do look at me Pray go away said Maggie looking at him helplessly her eyes glancing immediately from him to the opposite corner of the orchestra which was half hidden by the folds of the old faded green curtain Maggie had no sooner uttered this entreaty than she was wretched at the admission it implied but Stephen turned away at once and following her upward glance he saw Philip Wakem sealed in the half hidden corner so that he could command little more than that angle of the hall in which Maggie sat An entirely new though occurred to Stephen and linking itself with what he had observed of Wakem s manner and with Lucy s reply to his observation it convinced him that there had been some former relation between Philip and Maggie beyond that childish one of which he had heard More than one impulse made him immediately leave the hall and go upstairs to the refreshment room where walking up to Philip he sat down behind him and put his hand on his shoulder Are you studying for a portrait Phil he said or for a sketch of that oriel window By George it makes a capital bit from this dark corner with the curtain just marking it off I have been studying expression said Philip curtly What Miss Tulliver s It s rather of the savage moody order to day I think something of the fallen princess serving behind a counter Her cousin sent me to her with a civil offer to get her some refreshment but I have been snubbed as usual There s natural antipathy between us I suppose I have seldom the honor to please her What a hypocrite you are said Philip flushing angrily What because experience must have told me that I m universally pleasing I admit the law but there s some disturbing force here I am going said Philip rising abruptly So am I to get a breath of fresh air this place gets oppressive I think I have done suit and service long enough The two friends walked downstairs together without speaking Philip turned through the outer door into the court yard but Stephen saying Oh by the by I must call in here went on along the passage to one of the rooms at the other end of the building which were appropriated to the town library He had the room all to himself and a man requires nothing less than this when he wants to dash his cap on the table throw himself astride a chair and stare at a high brick wall with a frown which would not have been beneath the occasion if he had been slaying the giant Python The conduct that issues from a moral conflict has often so close a resemblance to vice that the distinction escapes all outward judgments founded on a mere comparison of actions It is clear to you I hope that Stephen was not a hypocrite capable of deliberate doubleness for a selfish end and yet his fluctuations between the indulgence of a feeling and the systematic concealment of it might have made a good case in support of Philip s accusation Meanwhile Maggie sat at her stall cold and trembling with that painful sensation in the eyes which comes from resolutely repressed tears Was her life to be always like this always bringing some new source of inward strife She heard confusedly the busy indifferent voices around her and wished her mind could flow into that easy babbling current It was at this moment that doctor Kenn who had quite lately come into the hall and was now walking down the middle with his hands behind him taking a general view fixed his eyes on Maggie for the first time and was struck with the expression of pain on her beautiful face She was sitting quite still for the stream of customers had lessened at this late hour in the afternoon the gentlemen had chiefly chosen the middle of the day and Maggie s stall was looking rather bare This with her absent pained expression finished the contrast between her and her companions who were all bright eager and busy He was strongly arrested Her face had naturally drawn his attention as a new and striking one at church and he had been introduced to her during a short call on business at mister Deane s but he had never spoken more than three words to her He walked toward her now and Maggie perceiving some one approaching roused herself to look up and be prepared to speak She felt a childlike instinctive relief from the sense of uneasiness in this exertion when she saw it was doctor Kenn s face that was looking at her that plain middle aged face with a grave penetrating kindness in it seeming to tell of a human being who had reached a firm safe strand but was looking with helpful pity toward the strugglers still tossed by the waves had an effect on Maggie at this moment which was afterward remembered by her as if it had been a promise The middle aged who have lived through their strongest emotions but are yet in the time when memory is still half passionate and not merely contemplative should surely be a sort of natural priesthood whom life has disciplined and consecrated to be the refuge and rescue of early stumblers and victims of self despair Most of us at some moment in our young lives would have welcomed a priest of that natural order in any sort of canonicals or uncanonicals but had to scramble upward into all the difficulties of nineteen entirely without such aid as Maggie did You find your office rather a fatiguing one I fear Miss Tulliver said doctor Kenn It is rather said Maggie simply not being accustomed to simpler amiable denials of obvious facts But I can tell missus Kenn that you have disposed of her goods very quickly he added she will be very much obliged to you Oh I have done nothing the gentlemen came very fast to buy the dressing gowns and embroidered waistcoats but I think any of the other ladies would have sold more I didn t know what to say about them doctor Kenn smiled I hope I m going to have you as a permanent parishioner now Miss Tulliver am I You have been at a distance from us hitherto I have been a teacher in a school and I m going into another situation of the same kind very soon Ah I was hoping you would remain among your friends who are all in this neighborhood I believe Oh I must go said Maggie earnestly looking at doctor Kenn with an expression of reliance as if she had told him her history in those three words It was one of those moments of implicit revelation which will sometimes happen even between people who meet quite transiently on a mile s journey perhaps or when resting by the wayside There is always this possibility of a word or look from a stranger to keep alive the sense of human brotherhood doctor Kenn s ear and eye took in all the signs that this brief confidence of Maggie s was charged with meaning I understand he said you feel it right to go But that will not prevent our meeting again I hope it will not prevent my knowing you better if I can be of any service to you He put out his hand and pressed hers kindly before he turned away She has some trouble or other at heart he thought Poor child she looks as if she might turn out to be one of The souls by nature pitched too high By suffering plunged too low There s something wonderfully honest in those beautiful eyes It may be surprising that Maggie among whose many imperfections an excessive delight in admiration and acknowledged supremacy were not absent now any more than when she was instructing the gypsies with a view toward achieving a royal position among them was not more elated on a day when she had had the tribute of so many looks and smiles together with that satisfactory consciousness which had necessarily come from being taken before Lucy s chevalglass and made to look at the full length of her tall beauty crowned by the night of her massy hair Maggie had smiled at herself then and for the moment had forgotten everything in the sense of her own beauty If that state of mind could have lasted her choice would have been to have Stephen Guest at her feet offering her a life filled with all luxuries with daily incense of adoration near and distant and with all possibilities of culture at her command But there were things in her stronger than vanity passion and affection and long deep memories of early discipline and effort of early claims on her love and pity and the stream of vanity was soon swept along and mingled imperceptibly with that wider current which was at its highest force today under the double urgency of the events and inward impulses brought by the last week Philip had not spoken to her himself about the removal of obstacles between them on his father s side he shrank from that but he had told everything to Lucy with the hope that Maggie being informed through her might give him some encouraging sign that their being brought thus much nearer to each other was a happiness to her The rush of conflicting feelings was too great for Maggie to say much when Lucy with a face breathing playful joy like one of Correggio s cherubs poured forth her triumphant revelation and Lucy could hardly be surprised that she could do little more than cry with gladness at the thought of her father s wish being fulfilled and of Tom s getting the Mill again in reward for all his hard striving The details of preparation for the bazaar had then come to usurp Lucy s attention for the next few days and nothing had been said by the cousins on subjects that were likely to rouse deeper feelings Philip had been to the house more than once but Maggie had had no private conversation with him and thus she had been left to fight her inward battle without interference But when the bazaar was fairly ended and the cousins were alone again resting together at home Lucy said You must give up going to stay with your aunt Moss the day after to morrow Maggie write a note to her and tell her you have put it off at my request and I ll send the man with it She won t be displeased you ll have plenty of time to go by and by and I don t want you to go out of the way just now Yes indeed I must go dear I can t put it off I wouldn t leave aunt Gritty out for the world And I shall have very little time for I m going away to a new situation on the twenty fifth of June Maggie said Lucy almost white with astonishment I didn t tell you dear said Maggie making a great effort to command herself because you ve been so busy But some time ago I wrote to our old governess Miss Firniss to ask her to let me know if she met with any situation that I could fill and the other day I had a letter from her telling me that I could take three orphan pupils of hers to the coast during the holidays and then make trial of a situation with her as teacher I wrote yesterday to accept the offer Lucy felt so hurt that for some moments she was unable to speak Maggie she said at last how could you be so unkind to me not to tell me to take such a step and now She hesitated a little and then added And Philip I thought everything was going to be so happy Oh Maggie what is the reason Give it up let me write There is nothing now to keep you and Philip apart Yes said Maggie faintly There is Tom s feeling He said I must give him up if I married Philip And I know he will not change at least not for a long while unless something happened to soften him But I will talk to him he s coming back this week And this good news about the Mill will soften him And I ll talk to him about Philip Tom s always very compliant to me I don t think he s so obstinate But I must go said Maggie in a distressed voice I must leave some time to pack Don t press me to stay dear Lucy Lucy was silent for two or three minutes looking away and ruminating At length she knelt down by her cousin and looking up in her face with anxious seriousness said Maggie is it that you don t love Philip well enough to marry him Tell me trust me Maggie held Lucy s hands tightly in silence a little while Her own hands were quite cold But when she spoke her voice was quite clear and distinct Yes Lucy I would choose to marry him I think it would be the best and highest lot for me to make his life happy He loved me first No one else could be quite what he is to me But I can t divide myself from my brother for life I must go away and wait Pray don t speak to me again about it Lucy obeyed in pain and wonder The next word she said was Well dear Maggie at least you will go to the dance at Park House to morrow and have some music and brightness before you go to pay these dull dutiful visits Ah here come aunty and the tea Chapter X The Spell Seems Broken The suite of rooms opening into each other at Park House looked duly brilliant with lights and flowers and the personal splendors of sixteen couples with attendant parents and guardians The focus of brilliancy was the long drawing room where the dancing went forward under the inspiration of the grand piano the library into which it opened at one end had the more sober illumination of maturity with caps and cards and at the other end the pretty sitting room with a conservatory attached was left as an occasional cool retreat Lucy who had laid aside her black for the first time and had her pretty slimness set off by an abundant dress of white crape was the acknowledged queen of the occasion for this was one of the Miss Guests thoroughly condescending parties including no member of any aristocracy higher than that of saint Ogg s and stretching to the extreme limits of commercial and professional gentility Maggie at first refused to dance saying that she had forgotten all the figures it was so many years since she had danced at school and she was glad to have that excuse for it is ill dancing with a heavy heart But at length the music wrought in her young limbs and the longing came even though it was the horrible young Torry who walked up a second time to try and persuade her She warned him that she could not dance anything but a country dance but he of course was willing to wait for that high felicity meaning only to be complimentary when he assured her at several intervals that it was a great bore that she couldn t waltz he would have liked so much to waltz with her But at last it was the turn of the good old fashioned dance which has the least of vanity and the most of merriment in it and Maggie quite forgot her troublous life in a childlike enjoyment of that half rustic rhythm which seems to banish pretentious etiquette She felt quite charitably toward young Torry as his hand bore her along and held her up in the dance her eyes and cheeks had that fire of young joy in them which will flame out if it can find the least breath to fan it and her simple black dress with its bit of black lace seemed like the dim setting of a jewel Stephen had not yet asked her to dance had not yet paid her more than a passing civility Since yesterday that inward vision of her which perpetually made part of his consciousness had been half screened by the image of Philip Wakem which came across it like a blot there was some attachment between her and Philip at least there was an attachment on his side which made her feel in some bondage Here then Stephen told himself was another claim of honor which called on him to resist the attraction that was continually threatening to overpower him He told himself so and yet he had once or twice felt a certain savage resistance and at another moment a shuddering repugnance to this intrusion of Philip s image which almost made it a new incitement to rush toward Maggie and claim her for himself Nevertheless he had done what he meant to do this evening he had kept aloof from her he had hardly looked at her and he had been gayly assiduous to Lucy But now his eyes were devouring Maggie he felt inclined to kick young Torry out of the dance and take his place Then he wanted the dance to end that he might get rid of his partner The possibility that he too should dance with Maggie and have her hand in his so long was beginning to possess him like a thirst But even now their hands were meeting in the dance were meeting still to the very end of it though they were far off each other Stephen hardly knew what happened or in what automatic way he got through the duties of politeness in the interval until he was free and saw Maggie seated alone again at the farther end of the room He made his way toward her round the couples that were forming for the waltz and when Maggie became conscious that she was the person he sought she felt in spite of all the thoughts that had gone before a glowing gladness at heart Her eyes and cheeks were still brightened with her childlike enthusiasm in the dance her whole frame was set to joy and tenderness even the coming pain could not seem bitter she was ready to welcome it as a part of life for life at this moment seemed a keen vibrating consciousness poised above pleasure or pain This one this last night she might expand unrestrainedly in the warmth of the present without those chill eating thoughts of the past and the future They re going to waltz again said Stephen bending to speak to her with that glance and tone of subdued tenderness which young dreams create to themselves in the summer woods when low cooing voices fill the air Such glances and tones bring the breath of poetry with them into a room that is half stifling with glaring gas and hard flirtation They are going to waltz again It is rather dizzy work to look on and the room is very warm shall we walk about a little He took her hand and placed it within his arm and they walked on into the sitting room where the tables were strewn with engravings for the accommodation of visitors who would not want to look at them But no visitors were here at this moment They passed on into the conservatory How strange and unreal the trees and flowers look with the lights among them said Maggie in a low voice They look as if they belonged to an enchanted land and would never fade away I could fancy they were all made of jewels She was looking at the tier of geraniums as she spoke and Stephen made no answer but he was looking at her and does not a supreme poet blend light and sound into one calling darkness mute and light eloquent Something strangely powerful there was in the light of Stephen s long gaze for it made Maggie s face turn toward it and look upward at it slowly like a flower at the ascending brightness And they walked unsteadily on without feeling that they were walking without feeling anything but that long grave mutual gaze which has the solemnity belonging to all deep human passion The hovering thought that they must and would renounce each other made this moment of mute confession more intense in its rapture But they had reached the end of the conservatory and were obliged to pause and turn The change of movement brought a new consciousness to Maggie she blushed deeply turned away her head and drew her arm from Stephen s going up to some flowers to smell them Stephen stood motionless and still pale Oh may I get this rose said Maggie making a great effort to say something and dissipate the burning sense of irretrievable confession I think I am quite wicked with roses I like to gather them and smell them till they have no scent left Stephen was mute he was incapable of putting a sentence together and Maggie bent her arm a little upward toward the large half opened rose that had attracted her Who has not felt the beauty of a woman s arm The unspeakable suggestions of tenderness that lie in the dimpled elbow and all the varied gently lessening curves down to the delicate wrist with its tiniest almost imperceptible nicks in the firm softness A woman s arm touched the soul of a great sculptor two thousand years ago so that he wrought an image of it for the Parthenon which moves us still as it clasps lovingly the timeworn marble of a headless trunk Maggie s was such an arm as that and it had the warm tints of life A mad impulse seized on Stephen he darted toward the arm and showered kisses on it clasping the wrist But the next moment Maggie snatched it from him and glared at him like a wounded war goddess quivering with rage and humiliation How dare you She spoke in a deeply shaken half smothered voice What right have I given you to insult me She darted from him into the adjoining room and threw herself on the sofa panting and trembling A horrible punishment was come upon her for the sin of allowing a moment s happiness that was treachery to Lucy to Philip to her own better soul That momentary happiness had been smitten with a blight a leprosy Stephen thought more lightly of her than he did of Lucy As for Stephen he leaned back against the framework of the conservatory dizzy with the conflict of passions love rage and confused despair despair at his want of self mastery and despair that he had offended Maggie The last feeling surmounted every other to be by her side again and entreat forgiveness was the only thing that had the force of a motive for him and she had not been seated more than a few minutes when he came and stood humbly before her But Maggie s bitter rage was unspent Leave me to myself if you please she said with impetuous haughtiness and for the future avoid me Stephen turned away and walked backward and forward at the other end of the room There was the dire necessity of going back into the dancing room again and he was beginning to be conscious of that They had been absent so short a time that when he went in again the waltz was not ended Maggie too was not long before she re entered All the pride of her nature was stung into activity the hateful weakness which had dragged her within reach of this wound to her self respect had at least wrought its own cure The thoughts and temptations of the last month should all be flung away into an unvisited chamber of memory There was nothing to allure her now duty would be easy and all the old calm purposes would reign peacefully once more She re entered the drawing room still with some excited brightness in her face but with a sense of proud self command that defied anything to agitate her She refused to dance again but she talked quite readily and calmly with every one who addressed her And when they got home that night she kissed Lucy with a free heart almost exulting in this scorching moment which had delivered her from the possibility of another word or look that would have the stamp of treachery toward that gentle unsuspicious sister The next morning Maggie did not set off to Basset quite so soon as she had expected Her mother was to accompany her in the carriage and household business could not be dispatched hastily by missus Tulliver So Maggie who had been in a hurry to prepare herself had to sit waiting equipped for the drive in the garden Lucy was busy in the house wrapping up some bazaar presents for the younger ones at Basset and when there was a loud ring at the door bell Maggie felt some alarm lest Lucy should bring out Stephen to her it was sure to be Stephen But presently the visitor came out into the garden alone and seated himself by her on the garden chair It was not Stephen We can just catch the tips of the Scotch firs Maggie from this seat said Philip They had taken each other s hands in silence but Maggie had looked at him with a more complete revival of the old childlike affectionate smile than he had seen before and he felt encouraged Yes she said I often look at them and wish I could see the low sunlight on the stems again But I have never been that way but once to the churchyard with my mother I have been there I go there continually said Philip I have nothing but the past to live upon A keen remembrance and keen pity impelled Maggie to put her hand in Philip s They had so often walked hand in hand I remember all the spots she said just where you told me of particular things beautiful stories that I had never heard of before You will go there again soon won t you Maggie said Philip getting timid The Mill will soon be your brother s home again Yes but I shall not be there said Maggie I shall only hear of that happiness I am going away again Lucy has not told you perhaps Then the future will never join on to the past again Maggie That book is quite closed The gray eyes that had so often looked up at her with entreating worship looked up at her now with a last struggling ray of hope in them and Maggie met them with her large sincere gaze That book never will be closed Philip she said with grave sadness I desire no future that will break the ties of the past But the tie to my brother is one of the strongest I can do nothing willingly that will divide me always from him Is that the only reason that would keep us apart forever Maggie said Philip with a desperate determination to have a definite answer The only reason said Maggie with calm decision And she believed it At that moment she felt as if the enchanted cup had been dashed to the ground The reactionary excitement that gave her a proud self mastery had not subsided and she looked at the future with a sense of calm choice They sat hand in hand without looking at each other or speaking for a few minutes in Maggie s mind the first scenes of love and parting were more present than the actual moment and she was looking at Philip in the Red Deeps Philip felt that he ought to have been thoroughly happy in that answer of hers she was as open and transparent as a rock pool Why was he not thoroughly happy Jealousy is never satisfied with anything short of an omniscience that would detect the subtlest fold of the heart Chapter XI In the Lane Maggie had been four days at her aunt Moss s giving the early June sunshine quite a new brightness in the care dimmed eyes of that affectionate woman and making an epoch for her cousins great and small who were learning her words and actions by heart as if she had been a transient avatar of perfect wisdom and beauty She was standing on the causeway with her aunt and a group of cousins feeding the chickens at that quiet moment in the life of the farmyards before the afternoon milking time The great buildings round the hollow yard were as dreary and tumbledown as ever but over the old garden wall the straggling rose bushes were beginning to toss their summer weight and the gray wood and old bricks of the house on its higher level had a look of sleepy age in the broad afternoon sunlight that suited the quiescent time Maggie with her bonnet over her arm was smiling down at the hatch of small fluffy chickens when her aunt exclaimed Goodness me who is that gentleman coming in at the gate It was a gentleman on a tall bay horse and the flanks and neck of the horse were streaked black with fast riding Maggie felt a beating at head and heart horrible as the sudden leaping to life of a savage enemy who had feigned death Who is it my dear said missus Moss seeing in Maggie s face the evidence that she knew It is mister Stephen Guest said Maggie rather faintly My cousin Lucy s a gentleman who is very intimate at my cousin s Stephen was already close to them had jumped off his horse and now raised his hat as he advanced Hold the horse Willy said missus Moss to the twelve year old boy No thank you said Stephen pulling at the horse s impatiently tossing head I must be going again immediately I have a message to deliver to you Miss Tulliver on private business May I take the liberty of asking you to walk a few yards with me He had a half jaded half irritated look such as a man gets when he has been dogged by some care or annoyance that makes his bed and his dinner of little use to him He spoke almost abruptly as if his errand were too pressing for him to trouble himself about what would be thought by missus Moss of his visit and request Good missus Moss rather nervous in the presence of this apparently haughty gentleman was inwardly wondering whether she would be doing right or wrong to invite him again to leave his horse and walk in when Maggie feeling all the embarrassment of the situation and unable to say anything put on her bonnet and turned to walk toward the gate Stephen turned too and walked by her side leading his horse Not a word was spoken till they were out in the lane and had walked four or five yards when Maggie who had been looking straight before her all the while turned again to walk back saying with haughty resentment There is no need for me to go any farther I don t know whether you consider it gentlemanly and delicate conduct to place me in a position that forced me to come out with you or whether you wished to insult me still further by thrusting an interview upon me in this way Of course you are angry with me for coming said Stephen bitterly Of course it is of no consequence what a man has to suffer it is only your woman s dignity that you care about Maggie gave a slight start such as might have come from the slightest possible electric shock As if it were not enough that I m entangled in this way that I m mad with love for you that I resist the strongest passion a man can feel because I try to be true to other claims but you must treat me as if I were a coarse brute who would willingly offend you And when if I had my own choice I should ask you to take my hand and my fortune and my whole life and do what you liked with them I know I forgot myself I took an unwarrantable liberty I hate myself for having done it But I repented immediately I ve been repenting ever since You ought not to think it unpardonable a man who loves with his whole soul as I do you is liable to be mastered by his feelings for a moment but you know you must believe that the worst pain I could have is to have pained you that I would give the world to recall the error Maggie dared not speak dared not turn her head The strength that had come from resentment was all gone and her lips were quivering visibly She could not trust herself to utter the full forgiveness that rose in answer to that confession They were come nearly in front of the gate again and she paused trembling You must not say these things I must not hear them she said looking down in misery as Stephen came in front of her to prevent her from going farther toward the gate I m very sorry for any pain you have to go through but it is of no use to speak Yes it is of use said Stephen impetuously It would be of use if you would treat me with some sort of pity and consideration instead of doing me vile injustice in your mind I could bear everything more quietly if I knew you didn t hate me for an insolent coxcomb Look at me see what a hunted devil I am I ve been riding thirty miles every day to get away from the thought of you Maggie did not dared not look She had already seen the harassed face But she said gently I don t think any evil of you Then dearest look at me said Stephen in deepest tenderest tones of entreaty Don t go away from me yet Give me a moment s happiness make me feel you ve forgiven me Yes I do forgive you said Maggie shaken by those tones and all the more frightened at herself But pray let me go in again Pray go away A great tear fell from under her lowered eyelids I can t go away from you I can t leave you said Stephen with still more passionate pleading I shall come back again if you send me away with this coldness I can t answer for myself But if you will go with me only a little way I can live on that You see plainly enough that your anger has only made me ten times more unreasonable Maggie turned But Tancred the bay horse began to make such spirited remonstrances against this frequent change of direction that Stephen catching sight of Willy Moss peeping through the gate called out Here just come and hold my horse for five minutes Oh no said Maggie hurriedly my aunt will think it so strange Never mind Stephen answered impatiently they don t know the people at saint Ogg s Lead him up and down just here for five minutes he added to Willy who was now close to them and then he turned to Maggie s side and they walked on It was clear that she must go on now Take my arm said Stephen entreatingly and she took it feeling all the while as if she were sliding downward in a nightmare There is no end to this misery she began struggling to repel the influence by speech It is wicked base ever allowing a word or look that Lucy that others might not have seen Think of Lucy I do think of her bless her If I didn t Stephen had laid his hand on Maggie s that rested on his arm and they both felt it difficult to speak And I have other ties Maggie went on at last with a desperate effort even if Lucy did not exist You are engaged to Philip Wakem said Stephen hastily Is it so I consider myself engaged to him I don t mean to marry any one else Stephen was silent again until they had turned out of the sun into a side lane all grassy and sheltered Then he burst out impetuously It is unnatural it is horrible Maggie if you loved me as I love you we should throw everything else to the winds for the sake of belonging to each other We should break all these mistaken ties that were made in blindness and determine to marry each other I would rather die than fall into that temptation said Maggie with deep slow distinctness all the gathered spiritual force of painful years coming to her aid in this extremity She drew her arm from his as she spoke Tell me then that you don t care for me he said almost violently Tell me that you love some one else better It darted through Maggie s mind that here was a mode of releasing herself from outward struggle to tell Stephen that her whole heart was Philip s But her lips would not utter that and she was silent If you do love me dearest said Stephen gently taking her hand again and laying it within his arm it is better it is right that we should marry each other We can t help the pain it will give It is come upon us without our seeking it is natural it has taken hold of me in spite of every effort I have made to resist it God knows I ve been trying to be faithful to tacit engagements and I ve only made things worse I d better have given way at first Maggie was silent If it were not wrong if she were once convinced of that and need no longer beat and struggle against this current soft and yet strong as the summer stream Say ve s dearest said Stephen leaning to look entreatingly in her face What could we care about in the whole world beside if we belonged to each other Her breath was on his face his lips were very near hers but there was a great dread dwelling in his love for her Her lips and eyelids quivered she opened her eyes full on his for an instant like a lovely wild animal timid and struggling under caresses and then turned sharp round toward home again And after all he went on in an impatient tone trying to defeat his own scruples as well as hers I am breaking no positive engagement if Lucy s affections had been withdrawn from me and given to some one else I should have felt no right to assert a claim on her If you are not absolutely pledged to Philip we are neither of us bound You don t believe that it is not your real feeling said Maggie earnestly You feel as I do that the real tie lies in the feelings and expectations we have raised in other minds Else all pledges might be broken when there was no outward penalty There would be no such thing as faithfulness Stephen was silent he could not pursue that argument the opposite conviction had wrought in him too strongly through his previous time of struggle But it soon presented itself in a new form The pledge can t be fulfilled he said with impetuous insistence It is unnatural we can only pretend to give ourselves to any one else There is wrong in that too there may be misery in it for them as well as for us Maggie you must see that you do see that He was looking eagerly at her face for the least sign of compliance his large firm gentle grasp was on her hand She was silent for a few moments with her eyes fixed on the ground then she drew a deep breath and said looking up at him with solemn sadness Oh it is difficult life is very difficult It seems right to me sometimes that we should follow our strongest feeling but then such feelings continually come across the ties that all our former life has made for us the ties that have made others dependent on us and would cut them in two If life were quite easy and simple as it might have been in Paradise and we could always see that one being first toward whom I mean if life did not make duties for us before love comes love would be a sign that two people ought to belong to each other But I see I feel it is not so now there are things we must renounce in life some of us must resign love Many things are difficult and dark to me but I see one thing quite clearly that I must not cannot seek my own happiness by sacrificing others Love is natural but surely pity and faithfulness and memory are natural too And they would live in me still and punish me if I did not obey them I should be haunted by the suffering I had caused Our love would be poisoned Don t urge me help me help me because I love you Maggie had become more and more earnest as she went on her face had become flushed and her eyes fuller and fuller of appealing love Stephen had the fibre of nobleness in him that vibrated to her appeal but in the same moment how could it be otherwise that pleading beauty gained new power over him Dearest he said in scarcely more than a whisper while his arm stole round her I ll do I ll bear anything you wish But one kiss one the last before we part One kiss and then a long look until Maggie said tremulously Let me go let me make haste back She hurried along and not another word was spoken Stephen stood still and beckoned when they came within sight of Willy and the horse and Maggie went on through the gate missus Moss was standing alone at the door of the old porch she had sent all the cousins in with kind thoughtfulness It might be a joyful thing that Maggie had a rich and handsome lover but she would naturally feel embarrassed at coming in again and it might not be joyful In either case missus Moss waited anxiously to receive Maggie by herself The speaking face told plainly enough that if there was joy it was of a very agitating dubious sort Sit down here a bit my dear She drew Maggie into the porch and sat down on the bench by her there was no privacy in the house Oh aunt Gritty I m very wretched I wish I could have died when I was fifteen It seemed so easy to give things up then it is so hard now The poor child threw her arms round her aunt s neck and fell into long deep sobs Chapter XII A Family Party Maggie left her good aunt Gritty at the end of the week and went to Garum Firs to pay her visit to aunt Pullet according to agreement In the mean time very unexpected things had happened and there was to be a family party at Garum to discuss and celebrate a change in the fortunes of the Tullivers which was likely finally to carry away the shadow of their demerits like the last limb of an eclipse and cause their hitherto obscured virtues to shine forth in full rounded splendor It is pleasant to know that a new ministry just come into office are not the only fellow men who enjoy a period of high appreciation and full blown eulogy in many respectable families throughout this realm relatives becoming creditable meet with a similar cordiality of recognition which in its fine freedom from the coercion of any antecedents suggests the hopeful possibility that we may some day without any notice find ourselves in full millennium with cockatrices who have ceased to bite and wolves that no longer show their teeth with any but the blandest intentions Lucy came so early as to have the start even of aunt Glegg for she longed to have some undisturbed talk with Maggie about the wonderful news It seemed did it not said Lucy with her prettiest air of wisdom as if everything even other people s misfortunes poor creatures were conspiring now to make poor dear aunt Tulliver and cousin Tom and naughty Maggie too if she were not obstinately bent on the contrary as happy as they deserved to be after all their troubles To think that the very day the very day after Tom had come back from Newcastle that unfortunate young Jetsome whom mister Wakem had placed at the Mill had been pitched off his horse in a drunken fit and was lying at saint Ogg s in a dangerous state so that Wakem had signified his wish that the new purchasers should enter on the premises at once It was very dreadful for that unhappy young man but it did seem as if the misfortune had happened then rather than at any other time in order that cousin Tom might all the sooner have the fit reward of his exemplary conduct papa thought so very highly of him Aunt Tulliver must certainly go to the Mill now and keep house for Tom that was rather a loss to Lucy in the matter of household comfort but then to think of poor aunty being in her old place again and gradually getting comforts about her there On this last point Lucy had her cunning projects and when she and Maggie had made their dangerous way down the bright stairs into the handsome parlor where the very sunbeams seemed cleaner than elsewhere she directed her manoeuvres as any other great tactician would have done against the weaker side of the enemy Aunt Pullet she said seating herself on the sofa and caressingly adjusting that lady s floating cap string I want you to make up your mind what linen and things you will give Tom toward housekeeping because you are always so generous you give such nice things you know and if you set the example aunt Glegg will follow That she never can my dear said missus Pullet with unusual vigor for she hasn t got the linen to follow suit wi mine I can tell you She d niver the taste not if she d spend the money Big checks and live things like stags and foxes all her table linen is not a spot nor a diamond among em But it s poor work dividing one s linen before one dies I niver thought to ha done that Bessy missus Pullet continued shaking her head and looking at her sister Tulliver when you and me chose the double diamont the first flax iver we d spun and the Lord knows where yours is gone I d no choice I m sure sister said poor missus Tulliver accustomed to consider herself in the light of an accused person I m sure it was no wish o mine iver as I should lie awake o nights thinking o my best bleached linen all over the country Take a peppermint missus Tulliver said uncle Pullet feeling that he was offering a cheap and wholesome form of comfort which he was recommending by example Oh but aunt Pullet said Lucy you ve so much beautiful linen And suppose you had had daughters Then you must have divided it when they were married Well I don t say as I won t do it said missus Pullet for now Tom s so lucky it s nothing but right his friends should look on him and help him There s the tablecloths I bought at your sale Bessy it was nothing but good natur o me to buy em for they ve been lying in the chest ever since But I m not going to give Maggie any more o my Indy muslin and things if she s to go into service again when she might stay and keep me company and do my sewing for me if she wasn t wanted at her brother s Going into service was the expression by which the Dodson mind represented to itself the position of teacher or governess and Maggie s return to that menial condition now circumstances offered her more eligible prospects was likely to be a sore point with all her relatives besides Lucy Maggie in her crude form with her hair down her back and altogether in a state of dubious promise was a most undesirable niece but now she was capable of being at once ornamental and useful The subject was revived in aunt and uncle Glegg s presence over the tea and muffins Hegh hegh said mister Glegg good naturedly patting Maggie on the back nonsense nonsense Don t let us hear of you taking a place again Maggie Why you must ha picked up half a dozen sweethearts at the bazaar isn t there one of em the right sort of article Come now mister Glegg said his wife with that shade of increased politeness in her severity which she always put on with her crisper fronts you ll excuse me but you re far too light for a man of your years It s respect and duty to her aunts and the rest of her kin as are so good to her should have kept my niece from fixing about going away again without consulting us not sweethearts if I m to use such a word though it was never heared in my family Why what did they call us when we went to see em then eh neighbor Pullet They thought us sweet enough then said mister Glegg winking pleasantly while mister Pullet at the suggestion of sweetness took a little more sugar mister Glegg said missus G if you re going to be undelicate let me know La Jane your husband s only joking said missus Pullet let him joke while he s got health and strength There s poor mister Tilt got his mouth drawn all o one side and couldn t laugh if he was to try I ll trouble you for the muffineer then mister Glegg said missus G if I may be so bold to interrupt your joking Though it s other people must see the joke in a niece s putting a slight on her mother s eldest sister as is the head o the family and only coming in and out on short visits all the time she s been in the town and then settling to go away without my knowledge as I d laid caps out on purpose for her to make em up for me and me as have divided my money so equal Sister missus Tulliver broke in anxiously I m sure Maggie never thought o going away without staying at your house as well as the others Not as it s my wish she should go away at all but quite contrairy I m sure I m innocent I ve said over and over again My dear you ve no call to go away But there s ten days or a fortnight Maggie ll have before she s fixed to go she can stay at your house just as well and I ll step in when I can and so will Lucy Bessy said missus Glegg if you d exercise a little more thought you might know I should hardly think it was worth while to unpin a bed and go to all that trouble now just at the end o the time when our house isn t above a quarter of an hour s walk from mister Deane s She can come the first thing in the morning and go back the last at night and be thankful she s got a good aunt so close to her to come and sit with I know I should when I was her age La Jane said missus Pullet it ud do your beds good to have somebody to sleep in em There s that striped room smells dreadful mouldy and the glass mildewed like anything I m sure I thought I should be struck with death when you took me in Oh there is Tom exclaimed Lucy clapping her hands He s come on Sindbad as I told him I was afraid he was not going to keep his promise Maggie jumped up to kiss Tom as he entered with strong feeling at this first meeting since the prospect of returning to the Mill had been opened to him and she kept his hand leading him to the chair by her side To have no cloud between herself and Tom was still a perpetual yearning in her that had its root deeper than all change He smiled at her very kindly this evening and said Well Magsie how s aunt Moss Come come sir said mister Glegg putting out his hand Why you re such a big man you carry all before you it seems You re come into your luck a good deal earlier than us old folks did but I wish you joy I wish you joy You ll get the Mill all for your own again some day I ll be bound You won t stop half way up the hill But I hope he ll bear in mind as it s his mother s family as he owes it to said missus Glegg If he hadn t had them to take after he d ha been poorly off There was never any failures nor lawing nor wastefulness in our family nor dying without wills No nor sudden deaths said aunt Pullet allays the doctor called in But Tom had the Dodson skin I said that from the first And I don t know what you mean to do sister Glegg but I mean to give him a tablecloth of all my three biggest sizes but one besides sheets I don t say what more I shall do but that I shall do and if I should die to morrow mister Pullet you ll bear it in mind though you ll be blundering with the keys and never remember as that on the third shelf o the left hand wardrobe behind the night caps with the broad ties not the narrow frilled uns is the key of the drawer in the Blue Room where the key o the Blue Closet is You ll make a mistake and I shall niver be worthy to know it You ve a memory for my pills and draughts wonderful I ll allays say that of you but you re lost among the keys This gloomy prospect of the confusion that would ensue on her decease was very affecting to missus Pullet You carry it too far Sophy that locking in and out said missus Glegg in a tone of some disgust at this folly You go beyond your own family There s nobody can say I don t lock up but I do what s reasonable and no more And as for the linen I shall look out what s serviceable to make a present of to my nephey I ve got cloth as has never been whitened better worth having than other people s fine holland and I hope he ll lie down in it and think of his aunt Tom thanked missus Glegg but evaded any promise to meditate nightly on her virtues and missus Glegg effected a diversion for him by asking about mister Deane s intentions concerning steam Lucy had had her far sighted views in begging Tom to come on Sindbad It appeared when it was time to go home that the man servant was to ride the horse and cousin Tom was to drive home his mother and Lucy You must sit by yourself aunty said that contriving young lady because I must sit by Tom I ve a great deal to say to him In the eagerness of her affectionate anxiety for Maggie Lucy could not persuade herself to defer a conversation about her with Tom who she thought with such a cup of joy before him as this rapid fulfilment of his wish about the Mill must become pliant and flexible Her nature supplied her with no key to Tom s and she was puzzled as well as pained to notice the unpleasant change on his countenance when she gave him the history of the way in which Philip had used his influence with his father She had counted on this revelation as a great stroke of policy which was to turn Tom s heart toward Philip at once and besides that prove that the elder Wakem was ready to receive Maggie with all the honors of a daughter in law Nothing was wanted then but for dear Tom who always had that pleasant smile when he looked at cousin Lucy to turn completely round say the opposite of what he had always said before and declare that he for his part was delighted that all the old grievances should be healed and that Maggie should have Philip with all suitable despatch in cousin Lucy s opinion nothing could be easier But to minds strongly marked by the positive and negative qualities that create severity strength of will conscious rectitude of purpose narrowness of imagination and intellect great power of self control and a disposition to exert control over others prejudices come as the natural food of tendencies which can get no sustenance out of that complex fragmentary doubt provoking knowledge which we call truth Let a prejudice be bequeathed carried in the air adopted by hearsay caught in through the eye however it may come these minds will give it a habitation it is something to assert strongly and bravely something to fill up the void of spontaneous ideas something to impose on others with the authority of conscious right it is at once a staff and a baton Every prejudice that will answer these purposes is self evident Our good upright Tom Tulliver s mind was of this class his inward criticism of his father s faults did not prevent him from adopting his father s prejudice it was a prejudice against a man of lax principle and lax life and it was a meeting point for all the disappointed feelings of family and personal pride Other feelings added their force to produce Tom s bitter repugnance to Philip and to Maggie s union with him and notwithstanding Lucy s power over her strong willed cousin she got nothing but a cold refusal ever to sanction such a marriage but of course Maggie could do as she liked she had declared her determination to be independent For Tom s part he held himself bound by his duty to his father s memory and by every manly feeling never to consent to any relation with the Wakems Thus all that Lucy had effected by her zealous mediation was to fill Tom s mind with the expectation that Maggie s perverse resolve to go into a situation again would presently metamorphose itself as her resolves were apt to do into something equally perverse but entirely different a marriage with Philip Wakem Chapter XIII Borne Along by the Tide In less than a week Maggie was at saint Ogg s again outwardly in much the same position as when her visit there had just begun It was easy for her to fill her mornings apart from Lucy without any obvious effort for she had her promised visits to pay to her aunt Glegg and it was natural that she should give her mother more than usual of her companionship in these last weeks especially as there were preparations to be thought of for Tom s housekeeping But Lucy would hear of no pretext for her remaining away in the evenings she must always come from aunt Glegg s before dinner else what shall I have of you said Lucy with a tearful pout that could not be resisted And mister Stephen Guest had unaccountably taken to dining at mister Deane s as often as possible instead of avoiding that as he used to do At first he began his mornings with a resolution that he would not dine there not even go in the evening till Maggie was away He had even devised a plan of starting off on a journey in this agreeable June weather the headaches which he had constantly been alleging as a ground for stupidity and silence were a sufficient ostensible motive But the journey was not taken and by the fourth morning no distinct resolution was formed about the evenings they were only foreseen as times when Maggie would still be present for a little while when one more touch one more glance might be snatched For why not There was nothing to conceal between them they knew they had confessed their love and they had renounced each other they were going to part Honor and conscience were going to divide them Maggie with that appeal from her inmost soul had decided it but surely they might cast a lingering look at each other across the gulf before they turned away never to look again till that strange light had forever faded out of their eyes Maggie all this time moved about with a quiescence and even torpor of manner so contrasted with her usual fitful brightness and ardor that Lucy would have had to seek some other cause for such a change if she had not been convinced that the position in which Maggie stood between Philip and her brother and the prospect of her self imposed wearisome banishment were quite enough to account for a large amount of depression But under this torpor there was a fierce battle of emotions such as Maggie in all her life of struggle had never known or foreboded it seemed to her as if all the worst evil in her had lain in ambush till now and had suddenly started up full armed with hideous overpowering strength There were moments in which a cruel selfishness seemed to be getting possession of her why should not Lucy why should not Philip suffer She had had to suffer through many years of her life and who had renounced anything for her And when something like that fulness of existence love wealth ease refinement all that her nature craved was brought within her reach why was she to forego it that another might have it another who perhaps needed it less But amidst all this new passionate tumult there were the old voices making themselves heard with rising power till from time to time the tumult seemed quelled Was that existence which tempted her the full existence she dreamed Where then would be all the memories of early striving all the deep pity for another s pain which had been nurtured in her through years of affection and hardship all the divine presentiment of something higher than mere personal enjoyment which had made the sacredness of life She might as well hope to enjoy walking by maiming her feet as hope to enjoy an existence in which she set out by maiming the faith and sympathy that were the best organs of her soul And then if pain were so hard to her what was it to others Ah God preserve me from inflicting give me strength to bear it How had she sunk into this struggle with a temptation that she would once have thought herself as secure from as from deliberate crime When was that first hateful moment in which she had been conscious of a feeling that clashed with her truth affection and gratitude and had not shaken it from her with horror as if it had been a loathsome thing And yet since this strange sweet subduing influence did not should not conquer her since it was to remain simply her own suffering her mind was meeting Stephen s in that thought of his that they might still snatch moments of mute confession before the parting came For was not he suffering too She saw it daily saw it in the sickened look of fatigue with which as soon as he was not compelled to exert himself he relapsed into indifference toward everything but the possibility of watching her Could she refuse sometimes to answer that beseeching look which she felt to be following her like a low murmur of love and pain She refused it less and less till at last the evening for them both was sometimes made of a moment s mutual gaze they thought of it till it came and when it had come they thought of nothing else One other thing Stephen seemed now and then to care for and that was to sing it was a way of speaking to Maggie Perhaps he was not distinctly conscious that he was impelled to it by a secret longing running counter to all his self confessed resolves to deepen the hold he had on her Watch your own speech and notice how it is guided by your less conscious purposes and you will understand that contradiction in Stephen Philip Wakem was a less frequent visitor but he came occasionally in the evening and it happened that he was there when Lucy said as they sat out on the lawn near sunset Now Maggie s tale of visits to aunt Glegg is completed I mean that we shall go out boating every day until she goes She has not had half enough boating because of these tiresome visits and she likes it better than anything Don t you Maggie Better than any sort of locomotion I hope you mean said Philip smiling at Maggie who was lolling backward in a low garden chair else she will be selling her soul to that ghostly boatman who haunts the Floss only for the sake of being drifted in a boat forever Should you like to be her boatman said Lucy Because if you would you can come with us and take an oar If the Floss were but a quiet lake instead of a river we should be independent of any gentleman for Maggie can row splendidly As it is we are reduced to ask services of knights and squires who do not seem to offer them with great alacrity She looked playful reproach at Stephen who was sauntering up and down and was just singing in pianissimo falsetto The thirst that from the soul doth rise Doth ask a drink divine He took no notice but still kept aloof he had done so frequently during Philip s recent visits You don t seem inclined for boating said Lucy when he came to sit down by her on the bench Doesn t rowing suit you now Oh I hate a large party in a boat he said almost irritably I ll come when you have no one else Lucy colored fearing that Philip would be hurt it was quite a new thing for Stephen to speak in that way but he had certainly not been well of late Philip colored too but less from a feeling of personal offence than from a vague suspicion that Stephen s moodiness had some relation to Maggie who had started up from her chair as he spoke and had walked toward the hedge of laurels to look at the descending sunlight on the river As Miss Deane didn t know she was excluding others by inviting me said Philip I am bound to resign No indeed you shall not said Lucy much vexed I particularly wish for your company to morrow The tide will suit at half past ten it will be a delicious time for a couple of hours to row to Luckreth and walk back before the sun gets too hot And how can you object to four people in a boat she added looking at Stephen I don t object to the people but the number said Stephen who had recovered himself and was rather ashamed of his rudeness If I voted for a fourth at all of course it would be you Phil But we won t divide the pleasure of escorting the ladies we ll take it alternately I ll go the next day This incident had the effect of drawing Philip s attention with freshened solicitude toward Stephen and Maggie but when they re entered the house music was proposed and missus Tulliver and mister Deane being occupied with cribbage Maggie sat apart near the table where the books and work were placed doing nothing however but listening abstractedly to the music Stephen presently turned to a duet which he insisted that Lucy and Philip should sing he had often done the same thing before but this evening Philip thought he divined some double intention in every word and look of Stephen s and watched him keenly angry with himself all the while for this clinging suspicion For had not Maggie virtually denied any ground for his doubts on her side And she was truth itself it was impossible not to believe her word and glance when they had last spoken together in the garden Stephen might be strongly fascinated by her what was more natural but Philip felt himself rather base for intruding on what must be his friend s painful secret Still he watched Stephen moving away from the piano sauntered slowly toward the table near which Maggie sat and turned over the newspapers apparently in mere idleness Then he seated himself with his back to the piano dragging a newspaper under his elbow and thrusting his hand through his hair as if he had been attracted by some bit of local news in the Laceham Courier He was in reality looking at Maggie who had not taken the slightest notice of his approach She had always additional strength of resistance when Philip was present just as we can restrain our speech better in a spot that we feel to be hallowed But at last she heard the word dearest uttered in the softest tone of pained entreaty like that of a patient who asks for something that ought to have been given without asking She had never heard that word since the moments in the lane at Basset when it had come from Stephen again and again almost as involuntarily as if it had been an inarticulate cry Philip could hear no word but he had moved to the opposite side of the piano and could see Maggie start and blush raise her eyes an instant toward Stephen s face but immediately look apprehensively toward himself It was not evident to her that Philip had observed her but a pang of shame under the sense of this concealment made her move from her chair and walk to her mother s side to watch the game at cribbage Philip went home soon after in a state of hideous doubt mingled with wretched certainty It was impossible for him now to resist the conviction that there was some mutual consciousness between Stephen and Maggie and for half the night his irritable susceptible nerves were pressed upon almost to frenzy by that one wretched fact he could attempt no explanation that would reconcile it with her words and actions When at last the need for belief in Maggie rose to its habitual predominance he was not long in imagining the truth she was struggling she was banishing herself this was the clue to all he had seen since his return But athwart that belief there came other possibilities that would not be driven out of sight His imagination wrought out the whole story Stephen was madly in love with her he must have told her so she had rejected him and was hurrying away But would he give her up knowing Philip felt the fact with heart crushing despair that she was made half helpless by her feeling toward him When the morning came Philip was too ill to think of keeping his engagement to go in the boat In his present agitation he could decide on nothing he could only alternate between contradictory intentions First he thought he must have an interview with Maggie and entreat her to confide in him then again he distrusted his own interference Had he not been thrusting himself on Maggie all along She had uttered words long ago in her young ignorance it was enough to make her hate him that these should be continually present with her as a bond And had he any right to ask her for a revelation of feelings which she had evidently intended to withhold from him He would not trust himself to see her till he had assured himself that he could act from pure anxiety for her and not from egoistic irritation He wrote a brief note to Stephen and sent it early by the servant saying that he was not well enough to fulfil his engagement to Miss Deane Would Stephen take his excuse and fill his place Lucy had arranged a charming plan which had made her quite content with Stephen s refusal to go in the boat She discovered that her father was to drive to Lindum this morning at ten Lindum was the very place she wanted to go to to make purchases important purchases which must by no means be put off to another opportunity and aunt Tulliver must go too because she was concerned in some of the purchases You will have your row in the boat just the same you know she said to Maggie when they went out of the breakfast room and upstairs together Philip will be here it half past ten and it is a delicious morning Now don t say a word against it you dear dolorous thing What is the use of my being a fairy godmother if you set your face against all the wonders I work for you Don t think of awful cousin Tom you may disobey him a little Maggie did not persist in objecting She was almost glad of the plan for perhaps it would bring her some strength and calmness to be alone with Philip again it was like revisiting the scene of a quieter life in which the very struggles were repose compared with the daily tumult of the present She prepared herself for the boat and at half past ten sat waiting in the drawing room The ring of the door bell was punctual and she was thinking with half sad affectionate pleasure of the surprise Philip would have in finding that he was to be with her alone when she distinguished a firm rapid step across the hall that was certainly not Philip s the door opened and Stephen Guest entered In the first moment they were both too much agitated to speak for Stephen had learned from the servant that the others were gone out Maggie had started up and sat down again with her heart beating violently and Stephen throwing down his cap and gloves came and sat by her in silence She thought Philip would be coming soon and with great effort for she trembled visibly she rose to go to a distant chair He is not coming said Stephen in a low tone I am going in the boat Oh we can t go said Maggie sinking into her chair again Lucy did not expect she would be hurt Why is not Philip come He is not well he asked me to come instead Lucy is gone to Lindum said Maggie taking off her bonnet with hurried trembling fingers We must not go Very well said Stephen dreamily looking at her as he rested his arm on the back of his chair Then we ll stay here He was looking into her deep deep eyes far off and mysterious at the starlit blackness and yet very near and timidly loving Maggie sat perfectly still perhaps for moments perhaps for minutes until the helpless trembling had ceased and there was a warm glow on her check The man is waiting he has taken the cushions she said Will you go and tell him What shall I tell him said Stephen almost in a whisper He was looking at the lips now Maggie made no answer Let us go Stephen murmured entreatingly rising and taking her hand to raise her too We shall not be long together And they went Maggie felt that she was being led down the garden among the roses being helped with firm tender care into the boat having the cushion and cloak arranged for her feet and her parasol opened for her which she had forgotten all by this stronger presence that seemed to bear her along without any act of her own will like the added self which comes with the sudden exalting influence of a strong tonic and she felt nothing else Memory was excluded They glided rapidly along Stephen rowing helped by the backward flowing tide past the Tofton trees and houses on between the silent sunny fields and pastures which seemed filled with a natural joy that had no reproach for theirs The breath of the young unwearied day the delicious rhythmic dip of the oars the fragmentary song of a passing bird heard now and then as if it were only the overflowing of brimful gladness the sweet solitude of a twofold consciousness that was mingled into one by that grave untiring gaze which need not be averted what else could there be in their minds for the first hour Some low subdued languid exclamation of love came from Stephen from time to time as he went on rowing idly half automatically otherwise they spoke no word for what could words have been but an inlet to thought and thought did not belong to that enchanted haze in which they were enveloped it belonged to the past and the future that lay outside the haze Maggie was only dimly conscious of the banks as they passed them and dwelt with no recognition on the villages she knew there were several to be passed before they reached Luckreth where they always stopped and left the boat At all times she was so liable to fits of absence that she was likely enough to let her waymarks pass unnoticed But at last Stephen who had been rowing more and more idly ceased to row laid down the oars folded his arms and looked down on the water as if watching the pace at which the boat glided without his help This sudden change roused Maggie She looked at the far stretching fields at the banks close by and felt that they were entirely strange to her A terrible alarm took possession of her Oh have we passed Luckreth where we were to stop she exclaimed looking back to see if the place were out of sight No village was to be seen She turned around again with a look of distressed questioning at Stephen He went on watching the water and said in a strange dreamy absent tone Yes a long way Oh what shall I do cried Maggie in an agony We shall not get home for hours and Lucy O God help me She clasped her hands and broke into a sob like a frightened child she thought of nothing but of meeting Lucy and seeing her look of pained surprise and doubt perhaps of just upbraiding Stephen moved and sat near her and gently drew down the clasped hands Maggie he said in a deep tone of slow decision let us never go home again till no one can part us till we are married The unusual tone the startling words arrested Maggie s sob and she sat quite still wondering as if Stephen might have seen some possibilities that would alter everything and annul the wretched facts See Maggie how everything has come without our seeking in spite of all our efforts We never thought of being alone together again it has all been done by others See how the tide is carrying us out away from all those unnatural bonds that we have been trying to make faster round us and trying in vain It will carry us on to Torby and we can land there and get some carriage and hurry on to York and then to Scotland and never pause a moment till we are bound to each other so that only death can part us It is the only right thing dearest it is the only way of escaping from this wretched entanglement Everything has concurred to point it out to us We have contrived nothing we have thought of nothing ourselves Stephen spoke with deep earnest pleading Maggie listened passing from her startled wonderment to the yearning after that belief that the tide was doing it all that she might glide along with the swift silent stream and not struggle any more But across that stealing influence came the terrible shadow of past thoughts and the sudden horror lest now at last the moment of fatal intoxication was close upon her called up feelings of angry resistance toward Stephen Let me go she said in an agitated tone flashing an indignant look at him and trying to get her hands free You have wanted to deprive me of any choice You knew we were come too far you have dared to take advantage of my thoughtlessness It is unmanly to bring me into such a position Stung by this reproach he released her hands moved back to his former place and folded his arms in a sort of desperation at the difficulty Maggie s words had made present to him If she would not consent to go on he must curse himself for the embarrassment he had led her into But the reproach was the unendurable thing the one thing worse than parting with her was that she should feel he had acted unworthily toward her At last he said in a tone of suppressed rage I didn t notice that we had passed Luckreth till we had got to the next village and then it came into my mind that we would go on I can t justify it I ought to have told you It is enough to make you hate me since you don t love me well enough to make everything else indifferent to you as I do you Shall I stop the boat and try to get you out here I ll tell Lucy that I was mad and that you hate me and you shall be clear of me forever No one can blame you because I have behaved unpardonably to you Maggie was paralyzed it was easier to resist Stephen s pleading than this picture he had called up of himself suffering while she was vindicated easier even to turn away from his look of tenderness than from this look of angry misery that seemed to place her in selfish isolation from him He had called up a state of feeling in which the reasons which had acted on her conscience seemed to be transmitted into mere self regard The indignant fire in her eyes was quenched and she began to look at him with timid distress She had reproached him for being hurried into irrevocable trespass she who had been so weak herself As if I shouldn t feel what happened to you just the same she said with reproach of another kind the reproach of love asking for more trust This yielding to the idea of Stephen s suffering was more fatal than the other yielding because it was less distinguishable from that sense of others claims which was the moral basis of her resistance He felt all the relenting in her look and tone it was heaven opening again He moved to her side and took her hand leaning his elbow on the back of the boat and saying nothing He dreaded to utter another word he dreaded to make another movement that might provoke another reproach or denial from her Life hung on her consent everything else was hopeless confused sickening misery They glided along in this way both resting in that silence as in a haven both dreading lest their feelings should be divided again till they became aware that the clouds had gathered and that the slightest perceptible freshening of the breeze was growing and growing so that the whole character of the day was altered You will be chill Maggie in this thin dress Let me raise the cloak over your shoulders Get up an instant dearest Maggie obeyed there was an unspeakable charm in being told what to do and having everything decided for her She sat down again covered with the cloak and Stephen took to his oars again making haste for they must try to get to Torby as fast as they could Maggie was hardly conscious of having said or done anything decisive All yielding is attended with a less vivid consciousness than resistance it is the partial sleep of thought it is the submergence of our own personality by another Every influence tended to lull her into acquiescence That dreamy gliding in the boat which had lasted for four hours and had brought some weariness and exhaustion the recoil of her fatigued sensations from the impracticable difficulty of getting out of the boat at this unknown distance from home and walking for long miles all helped to bring her into more complete subjection to that strong mysterious charm which made a last parting from Stephen seem the death of all joy and made the thought of wounding him like the first touch of the torturing iron before which resolution shrank And then there was the present happiness of being with him which was enough to absorb all her languid energy Presently Stephen observed a vessel coming after them Several vessels among them the steamer to Mudport had passed them with the early tide but for the last hour they had seen none He looked more and more eagerly at this vessel as if a new thought had come into his mind along with it and then he looked at Maggie hesitatingly Maggie dearest he said at last if this vessel should be going to Mudport or to any convenient place on the coast northward it would be our best plan to get them to take us on board You are fatigued and it may soon rain it may be a wretched business getting to Torby in this boat It s only a trading vessel but I dare say you can be made tolerably comfortable We ll take the cushions out of the boat It is really our best plan They ll be glad enough to take us I ve got plenty of money about me I can pay them well Maggie s heart began to beat with reawakened alarm at this new proposition but she was silent one course seemed as difficult as another Stephen hailed the vessel It was a Dutch vessel going to Mudport the English mate informed him and if this wind held would be there in less than two days We had got out too far with our boat said Stephen I was trying to make for Torby But I m afraid of the weather and this lady my wife will be exhausted with fatigue and hunger Take us on board will you and haul up the boat I ll pay you well Maggie now really faint and trembling with fear was taken on board making an interesting object of contemplation to admiring Dutchmen The mate feared the lady would have a poor time of it on board for they had no accommodation for such entirely unlooked for passengers no private cabin larger than an old fashioned church pew But at least they had Dutch cleanliness which makes all other inconveniences tolerable and the boat cushions were spread into a couch for Maggie on the poop with all alacrity But to pace up and down the deck leaning on Stephen being upheld by his strength was the first change that she needed then came food and then quiet reclining on the cushions with the sense that no new resolution could be taken that day Everything must wait till to morrow Stephen sat beside her with her hand in his they could only speak to each other in low tones only look at each other now and then for it would take a long while to dull the curiosity of the five men on board and reduce these handsome young strangers to that minor degree of interest which belongs in a sailor s regard to all objects nearer than the horizon But Stephen was triumphantly happy Every other thought or care was thrown into unmarked perspective by the certainty that Maggie must be his The leap had been taken now he had been tortured by scruples he had fought fiercely with overmastering inclination he had hesitated but repentance was impossible He murmured forth in fragmentary sentences his happiness his adoration his tenderness his belief that their life together must be heaven that her presence with him would give rapture to every common day that to satisfy her lightest wish was dearer to him than all other bliss that everything was easy for her sake except to part with her and now they never would part he would belong to her forever and all that was his was hers had no value for him except as it was hers Such things uttered in low broken tones by the one voice that has first stirred the fibre of young passion have only a feeble effect on experienced minds at a distance from them To poor Maggie they were very near they were like nectar held close to thirsty lips there was there must be then a life for mortals here below which was not hard and chill in which affection would no longer be self sacrifice Stephen s passionate words made the vision of such a life more fully present to her than it had ever been before and the vision for the time excluded all realities all except the returning sun gleams which broke out on the waters as the evening approached and mingled with the visionary sunlight of promised happiness all except the hand that pressed hers and the voice that spoke to her and the eyes that looked at her with grave unspeakable love There was to be no rain after all the clouds rolled off to the horizon again making the great purple rampart and long purple isles of that wondrous land which reveals itself to us when the sun goes down the land that the evening star watches over Maggie was to sleep all night on the poop it was better than going below and she was covered with the warmest wrappings the ship could furnish It was still early when the fatigues of the day brought on a drowsy longing for perfect rest and she laid down her head looking at the faint dying flush in the west where the one golden lamp was getting brighter and brighter Then she looked up at Stephen who was still seated by her hanging over her as he leaned his arm against the vessel s side Behind all the delicious visions of these last hours which had flowed over her like a soft stream and made her entirely passive there was the dim consciousness that the condition was a transient one and that the morrow must bring back the old life of struggle that there were thoughts which would presently avenge themselves for this oblivion But now nothing was distinct to her she was being lulled to sleep with that soft stream still flowing over her with those delicious visions melting and fading like the wondrous aerial land of the west Chapter XIV Waking When Maggie was gone to sleep 
1736-152007-0000	train-other-500	Stephen weary too with his unaccustomed amount of rowing and with the intense inward life of the last twelve hours but too restless to sleep walked and lounged about the deck with his cigar far on into midnight not seeing the dark water
1736-152007-0001	train-other-500	hardly conscious there were stars living only in the near and distant future At last fatigue conquered restlessness and he rolled himself up in a piece of tarpaulin on the deck near Maggie s feet
1736-152007-0002	train-other-500	She had fallen asleep before nine and had been sleeping for six hours before the faintest hint of a midsummer daybreak was discernible She awoke from that vivid dreaming which makes the margin of our deeper rest She was in a boat on the wide water with Stephen
1736-152007-0003	train-other-500	and in the gathering darkness something like a star appeared that grew and grew till they saw it was the Virgin seated in saint Ogg s boat and it came nearer and nearer
none	none	 till they saw the Virgin was Lucy and the boatman was Philip 
1736-152007-0004	train-other-500	no not Philip but her brother who rowed past without looking at her and she rose to stretch out her arms and call to him and their own boat turned over with the movement and they began to sink till with one spasm of dread she seemed to awake
1736-152007-0005	train-other-500	and find she was a child again in the parlor at evening twilight and Tom was not really angry From the soothed sense of that false waking she passed to the real waking to the plash of water against the vessel and the sound of a footstep on the deck
1736-152007-0006	train-other-500	and the awful starlit sky There was a moment of utter bewilderment before her mind could get disentangled from the confused web of dreams but soon the whole terrible truth urged itself upon her Stephen was not by her now
1736-152007-0007	train-other-500	she was alone with her own memory and her own dread The irrevocable wrong that must blot her life had been committed she had brought sorrow into the lives of others into the lives that were knit up with hers by trust and love
1736-152007-0008	train-other-500	The feeling of a few short weeks had hurried her into the sins her nature had most recoiled from breach of faith and cruel selfishness she had rent the ties that had given meaning to duty and had made herself an outlawed soul
1736-152007-0009	train-other-500	with no guide but the wayward choice of her own passion And where would that lead her Where had it led her now She had said she would rather die than fall into that temptation She felt it now
1736-152007-0010	train-other-500	now that the consequences of such a fall had come before the outward act was completed There was at least this fruit from all her years of striving after the highest and best that her soul though betrayed beguiled ensnared could never deliberately consent to a choice of the lower
1736-152007-0011	train-other-500	And a choice of what O God not a choice of joy but of conscious cruelty and hardness for could she ever cease to see before her Lucy and Philip with their murdered trust and hopes Her life with Stephen could have no sacredness
1736-152007-0012	train-other-500	she must forever sink and wander vaguely driven by uncertain impulse for she had let go the clue of life that clue which once in the far off years her young need had clutched so strongly
none	none	 She had renounced all delights then 
1736-152007-0013	train-other-500	before she knew them before they had come within her reach Philip had been right when he told her that she knew nothing of renunciation she had thought it was quiet ecstasy she saw it face to face now that sad patient loving strength which holds the clue of life
1736-152007-0014	train-other-500	and saw that the thorns were forever pressing on its brow The yesterday which could never be revoked
none	none	 if she could have changed it now for any length of inward silent endurance 
1736-152007-0015	train-other-500	she would have bowed beneath that cross with a sense of rest Day break came and the reddening eastern light while her past life was grasping her in this way
none	none	 with that tightening clutch which comes in the last moments of possible rescue 
1736-152007-0016	train-other-500	She could see Stephen now lying on the deck still fast asleep and with the sight of him there came a wave of anguish that found its way in a long suppressed sob The worst bitterness of parting the thought that urged the sharpest inward cry for help
1736-152007-0017	train-other-500	was the pain it must give to him But surmounting everything was the horror at her own possible failure the dread lest her conscience should be benumbed again and not rise to energy till it was too late Too late it was too late already not to have caused misery
1736-152007-0018	train-other-500	too late for everything perhaps but to rush away from the last act of baseness the tasting of joys that were wrung from crushed hearts The sun was rising now and Maggie started up with the sense that a day of resistance was beginning for her
1736-152007-0019	train-other-500	Her eyelashes were still wet with tears as with her shawl over her head she sat looking at the slowly rounding sun Something roused Stephen too and getting up from his hard bed he came to sit beside her
1736-152007-0020	train-other-500	The sharp instinct of anxious love saw something to give him alarm in the very first glance He had a hovering dread of some resistance in Maggie s nature that he would be unable to overcome He had the uneasy consciousness that he had robbed her of perfect freedom yesterday
1736-152007-0021	train-other-500	there was too much native honor in him for him not to feel that if her will should recoil his conduct would have been odious and she would have a right to reproach him But Maggie did not feel that right she was too conscious of fatal weakness in herself
1736-152007-0022	train-other-500	too full of the tenderness that comes with the foreseen need for inflicting a wound She let him take her hand when he came to sit down beside her and smiled at him only with rather a sad glance she could say nothing to pain him till the moment of possible parting was nearer
1736-152007-0023	train-other-500	And so they drank their cup of coffee together and walked about the deck and heard the captain s assurance that they should be in at Mudport by five o clock each with an inward burthen but in him it was an undefined fear which he trusted to the coming hours to dissipate
1736-152007-0024	train-other-500	in her it was a definite resolve on which she was trying silently to tighten her hold Stephen was continually through the morning expressing his anxiety at the fatigue and discomfort she was suffering
1736-152007-0025	train-other-500	and alluded to landing and to the change of motion and repose she would have in a carriage wanting to assure himself more completely by presupposing that everything would be as he had arranged it For a long while Maggie contented herself with assuring him that she had had a good night s rest
1736-152007-0026	train-other-500	and that she didn t mind about being on the vessel it was not like being on the open sea it was only a little less pleasant than being in a boat on the Floss But a suppressed resolve will betray itself in the eyes
1736-152007-0027	train-other-500	and Stephen became more and more uneasy as the day advanced under the sense that Maggie had entirely lost her passiveness He longed but did not dare to speak of their marriage of where they would go after it and the steps he would take to inform his father and the rest of what had happened
1736-152007-0028	train-other-500	He longed to assure himself of a tacit assent from her But each time he looked at her he gathered a stronger dread of the new quiet sadness with which she met his eyes And they were more and more silent Here we are in sight of Mudport he said at last
1736-152007-0029	train-other-500	Now dearest he added turning toward her with a look that was half beseeching the worst part of your fatigue is over On the land we can command swiftness In another hour and a half we shall be in a chaise together and that will seem rest to you after this
none	none	 Maggie felt it was time to speak it would only be unkind now to assent by silence 
1736-152007-0030	train-other-500	She spoke in the lowest tone as he had done but with distinct decision We shall not be together we shall have parted The blood rushed to Stephen s face We shall not he said I ll die first
1736-152007-0031	train-other-500	It was as he had dreaded there was a struggle coming But neither of them dared to say another word till the boat was let down and they were taken to the landing place Here there was a cluster of gazers and passengers awaiting the departure of the steamboat to saint Ogg s
none	none	 Maggie had a dim sense when she had landed 
1736-152007-0032	train-other-500	and Stephen was hurrying her along on his arm that some one had advanced toward her from that cluster as if he were coming to speak to her But she was hurried along and was indifferent to everything but the coming trial A porter guided them to the nearest inn and posting house
1736-152007-0033	train-other-500	and Stephen gave the order for the chaise as they passed through the yard Maggie took no notice of this and only said
none	none	 Ask them to show us into a room where we can sit down 
1736-152007-0034	train-other-500	When they entered Maggie did not sit down and Stephen whose face had a desperate determination in it was about to ring the bell when she said in a firm voice I m not going we must part here Maggie
none	none	 he said turning round toward her and speaking in the tones of a man who feels a process of torture beginning do you mean to kill me What is the use of it now The whole thing is done 
1736-152007-0035	train-other-500	No it is not done said Maggie Too much is done more than we can ever remove the trace of But I will go no farther Don t try to prevail with me again I couldn t choose yesterday What was he to do He dared not go near her
1736-152007-0036	train-other-500	her anger might leap out and make a new barrier He walked backward and forward in maddening perplexity Maggie he said at last pausing before her and speaking in a tone of imploring wretchedness
none	none	 have some pity hear me 
1736-152007-0037	train-other-500	forgive me for what I did yesterday I will obey you now I will do nothing without your full consent But don t blight our lives forever by a rash perversity that can answer no good purpose to any one that can only create new evils Sit down dearest wait
1736-152007-0038	train-other-500	think what you are going to do Don t treat me as if you couldn t trust me He had chosen the most effective appeal but Maggie s will was fixed unswervingly on the coming wrench She had made up her mind to suffer We must not wait
1736-152007-0039	train-other-500	she said in a low but distinct voice we must part at once We can t part Maggie said Stephen more impetuously I can t bear it What is the use of inflicting that misery on me
1736-152007-0040	train-other-500	The blow whatever it may have been has been struck now Will it help any one else that you should drive me mad I will not begin any future even for you said Maggie tremulously
none	none	 with a deliberate consent to what ought not to have been What I told you at Basset I feel now 
1736-152007-0041	train-other-500	I would rather have died than fall into this temptation
none	none	 It would have been better if we had parted forever then 
1736-152007-0042	train-other-500	But we must part now We will not part Stephen burst out instinctively placing his back against the door forgetting everything he had said a few moments before I will not endure it You ll make me desperate I sha n t know what I do
1736-152007-0043	train-other-500	Maggie trembled She felt that the parting could not be effected suddenly She must rely on a slower appeal to Stephen s better self she must be prepared for a harder task than that of rushing away while resolution was fresh She sat down
1736-152007-0044	train-other-500	Stephen watching her with that look of desperation which had come over him like a lurid light approached slowly from the door seated himself close beside her and grasped her hand Her heart beat like the heart of a frightened bird but this direct opposition helped her
1736-152007-0045	train-other-500	She felt her determination growing stronger Remember what you felt weeks ago she began with beseeching earnestness
none	none	 remember what we both felt that we owed ourselves to others and must conquer every inclination which could make us false to that debt We have failed to keep our resolutions but the wrong remains the same No it does not remain the same said Stephen We have proved that it was impossible to keep our resolutions We have proved that the feeling which draws us toward each other is too strong to be overcome 
1736-152007-0046	train-other-500	That natural law surmounts every other we can t help what it clashes with It is not so Stephen I m quite sure that is wrong I have tried to think it again and again but I see if we judged in that way there would be a warrant for all treachery and cruelty
none	none	 we should justify breaking the most sacred ties that can ever be formed on earth 
1736-152007-0047	train-other-500	If the past is not to bind us where can duty lie We should have no law but the inclination of the moment But there are ties that can t be kept by mere resolution said Stephen starting up and walking about again What is outward faithfulness
1736-152007-0048	train-other-500	Would they have thanked us for anything so hollow as constancy without love Maggie did not answer immediately She was undergoing an inward as well as an outward contest At last she said with a passionate assertion of her conviction
1736-152007-0049	train-other-500	as much against herself as against him That seems right at first but when I look further I m sure it is not right Faithfulness and constancy mean something else besides doing what is easiest and pleasantest to ourselves
none	none	 They mean renouncing whatever is opposed to the reliance others have in us 
1736-152007-0050	train-other-500	whatever would cause misery to those whom the course of our lives has made dependent on us If we if I had been better nobler those claims would have been so strongly present with me I should have felt them pressing on my heart so continually
none	none	 just as they do now in the moments when my conscience is awake 
1736-152007-0051	train-other-500	that the opposite feeling would never have grown in me as it has done
none	none	 it would have been quenched at once 
1736-152007-0052	train-other-500	I should have prayed for help so earnestly I should have rushed away as we rush from hideous danger I feel no excuse for myself none I should never have failed toward Lucy and Philip as I have done if I had not been weak selfish and hard
1736-152007-0053	train-other-500	able to think of their pain without a pain to myself that would have destroyed all temptation Oh what is Lucy feeling now She believed in me she loved me she was so good to me Think of her
1736-152007-0054	train-other-500	Maggie s voice was getting choked as she uttered these last words I can t think of her said Stephen stamping as if with pain I can think of nothing but you Maggie You demand of a man what is impossible I felt that once but I can t go back to it now
1736-152007-0055	train-other-500	And where is the use of your thinking of it except to torture me You can t save them from pain now you can only tear yourself from me and make my life worthless to me And even if we could go back and both fulfil our engagements if that were possible now
1736-152007-0056	train-other-500	it would be hateful horrible to think of your ever being Philip s wife of your ever being the wife of a man you didn t love We have both been rescued from a mistake A deep flush came over Maggie s face and she couldn t speak Stephen saw this
1736-152007-0057	train-other-500	He sat down again taking her hand in his and looking at her with passionate entreaty Maggie Dearest If you love me you are mine Who can have so great a claim on you as I have My life is bound up in your love
1736-152007-0058	train-other-500	There is nothing in the past that can annul our right to each other it is the first time we have either of us loved with our whole heart and soul Maggie was still silent for a little while looking down Stephen was in a flutter of new hope
1736-152007-0059	train-other-500	he was going to triumph But she raised her eyes and met his with a glance that was filled with the anguish of regret not with yielding No not with my whole heart and soul Stephen she said with timid resolution
1736-152007-0060	train-other-500	I have never consented to it with my whole mind There are memories and affections and longings after perfect goodness that have such a strong hold on me they would never quit me for long they would come back and be pain to me repentance
1736-152007-0061	train-other-500	I couldn t live in peace if I put the shadow of a wilful sin between myself and God I have caused sorrow already I know I feel it but I have never deliberately consented to it I have never said They shall suffer that I may have joy
1736-152007-0062	train-other-500	It has never been my will to marry you if you were to win consent from the momentary triumph of my feeling for you you would not have my whole soul If I could wake back again into the time before yesterday I would choose to be true to my calmer affections and live without the joy of love
1736-152007-0063	train-other-500	Stephen loosed her hand and rising impatiently walked up and down the room in suppressed rage Good God he burst out at last what a miserable thing a woman s love is to a man s I could commit crimes for you
1736-152007-0064	train-other-500	and you can balance and choose in that way But you don t love me if you had a tithe of the feeling for me that I have for you it would be impossible to you to think for a moment of sacrificing me But it weighs nothing with you that you are robbing me of my life s happiness
none	none	 Maggie pressed her fingers together almost convulsively as she held them clasped on her lap A great terror was upon her 
1736-152007-0065	train-other-500	as if she were ever and anon seeing where she stood by great flashes of lightning and then again stretched forth her hands in the darkness No I don t sacrifice you I couldn t sacrifice you
none	none	 she said as soon as she could speak again 
1736-152007-0066	train-other-500	but I can t believe in a good for you that I feel that we both feel is a wrong toward others We can t choose happiness either for ourselves or for another we can t tell where that will lie We can only choose whether we will indulge ourselves in the present moment
1736-152007-0067	train-other-500	or whether we will renounce that for the sake of obeying the divine voice within us for the sake of being true to all the motives that sanctify our lives I know this belief is hard
none	none	 it has slipped away from me again and again 
1736-152007-0068	train-other-500	but I have felt that if I let it go forever
none	none	 I should have no light through the darkness of this life 
1736-152007-0069	train-other-500	But Maggie said Stephen seating himself by her again is it possible you don t see that what happened yesterday has altered the whole position of things What infatuation is it what obstinate prepossession that blinds you to that
1736-152007-0070	train-other-500	It is too late to say what we might have done or what we ought to have done Admitting the very worst view of what has been done it is a fact we must act on now our position is altered the right course is no longer what it was before
1736-152007-0071	train-other-500	We must accept our own actions and start afresh from them Suppose we had been married yesterday It is nearly the same thing The effect on others would not have been different It would only have made this difference to ourselves Stephen added bitterly
1736-152007-0072	train-other-500	that you might have acknowledged then that your tie to me was stronger than to others
none	none	 Again a deep flush came over Maggie s face and she was silent 
1736-152007-0073	train-other-500	Stephen thought again that he was beginning to prevail he had never yet believed that he should not prevail there are possibilities which our minds shrink from too completely for us to fear them Dearest
1736-152007-0074	train-other-500	he said in his deepest tenderest tone leaning toward her and putting his arm round her you are mine now the world believes it duty must spring out of that now In a few hours you will be legally mine and those who had claims on us will submit
1736-152007-0075	train-other-500	they will see that there was a force which declared against their claims Maggie s eyes opened wide in one terrified look at the face that was close to hers
none	none	 and she started up pale again Oh I can t do it 
1736-152007-0076	train-other-500	she said in a voice almost of agony Stephen don t ask me don t urge me I can t argue any longer I don t know what is wise but my heart will not let me do it I see I feel their trouble now it is as if it were branded on my mind
1736-152007-0077	train-other-500	I have suffered and had no one to pity me and now I have made others suffer It would never leave me it would embitter your love to me I do care for Philip in a different way I remember all we said to each other
1736-152007-0078	train-other-500	I know how he thought of me as the one promise of his life He was given to me that I might make his lot less hard and I have forsaken him And Lucy she has been deceived she who trusted me more than any one
1736-152007-0079	train-other-500	I cannot marry you I cannot take a good for myself that has been wrung out of their misery It is not the force that ought to rule us this that we feel for each other it would rend me away from all that my past life has made dear and holy to me
1736-152007-0080	train-other-500	I can t set out on a fresh life and forget that I must go back to it and cling to it else I shall feel as if there were nothing firm beneath my feet Good God Maggie said Stephen rising too and grasping her arm you rave
none	none	 How can you go back without marrying me You don t know what will be said dearest 
1736-152007-0081	train-other-500	You see nothing as it really is Yes I do But they will believe me I will confess everything Lucy will believe me she will forgive you and and
none	none	 oh some good will come by clinging to the right 
1736-152007-0082	train-other-500	Dear dear Stephen let me go don t drag me into deeper remorse My whole soul has never consented it does not consent now Stephen let go her arm and sank back on his chair half stunned by despairing rage He was silent a few moments not looking at her
1736-152007-0083	train-other-500	while her eyes were turned toward him yearningly in alarm at this sudden change At last he said still without looking at her Go then leave me
none	none	 don t torture me any longer I can t bear it Involuntarily she leaned toward him and put out her hand to touch his 
1736-152007-0084	train-other-500	But he shrank from it as if it had been burning iron and said again Leave me Maggie was not conscious of a decision as she turned away from that gloomy averted face and walked out of the room
1736-152007-0085	train-other-500	it was like an automatic action that fulfils a forgotten intention What came after A sense of stairs descended as if in a dream of flagstones of a chaise and horses standing then a street and a turning into another street where a stage coach was standing
1736-152007-0086	train-other-500	taking in passengers and the darting thought that that coach would take her away perhaps toward home But she could ask nothing yet she only got into the coach Home where her mother and brother were Philip Lucy the scene of her very cares and trials
1736-152007-0087	train-other-500	was the haven toward which her mind tended the sanctuary where sacred relics lay where she would be rescued from more falling The thought of Stephen was like a horrible throbbing pain which yet as such pains do seemed to urge all other thoughts into activity
1736-152007-0088	train-other-500	But among her thoughts what others would say and think of her conduct was hardly present Love and deep pity and remorseful anguish left no room for that The coach was taking her to York farther away from home
1736-152007-0089	train-other-500	but she did not learn that until she was set down in the old city at midnight It was no matter she could sleep there and start home the next day She had her purse in her pocket with all her money in it a bank note and a sovereign
1736-152007-0090	train-other-500	she had kept it in her pocket from forgetfulness after going out to make purchases the day before yesterday
none	none	 Did she lie down in the gloomy bedroom of the old inn that night 
1736-152007-0091	train-other-500	with her will bent unwaveringly on the path of penitent sacrifice The great struggles of life are not so easy as that the great problems of life are not so clear In the darkness of that night she saw Stephen s face turned toward her in passionate reproachful misery
1736-152007-0092	train-other-500	she lived through again all the tremulous delights of his presence with her that made existence an easy floating in a stream of joy instead of a quiet resolved endurance and effort The love she had renounced came back upon her with a cruel charm
1736-152007-0093	train-other-500	she felt herself opening her arms to receive it once more and then it seemed to slip away and fade and vanish leaving only the dying sound of a deep thrilling voice that said
none	none	 Gone forever gone Book VII The Final Rescue Chapter I The Return to the Mill Between four and five o clock on the afternoon of the fifth day from that on which Stephen and Maggie had left saint Ogg s Tom Tulliver was standing on the gravel walk outside the old house at Dorlcote Mill He was master there now he had half fulfilled his father s dying wish and by years of steady self government and energetic work he had brought himself near to the attainment of more than the old respectability which had been the proud inheritance of the Dodsons and Tullivers But Tom s face as he stood in the hot still sunshine of that summer afternoon had no gladness no triumph in it His mouth wore its bitterest expression his severe brow its hardest and deepest fold as he drew down his hat farther over his eyes to shelter them from the sun and thrusting his hands deep into his pockets began to walk up and down the gravel No news of his sister had been heard since Bob Jakin had come back in the steamer from Mudport and put an end to all improbable suppositions of an accident on the water by stating that he had seen her land from a vessel with mister Stephen Guest Would the next news be that she was married or what Probably that she was not married Tom s mind was set to the expectation of the worst that could happen not death but disgrace As he was walking with his back toward the entrance gate and his face toward the rushing mill stream a tall dark eyed figure that we know well approached the gate and paused to look at him with a fast beating heart Her brother was the human being of whom she had been most afraid from her childhood upward afraid with that fear which springs in us when we love one who is inexorable unbending unmodifiable with a mind that we can never mould ourselves upon and yet that we cannot endure to alienate from us That deep rooted fear was shaking Maggie now but her mind was unswervingly bent on returning to her brother as the natural refuge that had been given her In her deep humiliation under the retrospect of her own weakness in her anguish at the injury she had inflicted she almost desired to endure the severity of Tom s reproof to submit in patient silence to that harsh disapproving judgment against which she had so often rebelled it seemed no more than just to her now who was weaker than she was She craved that outward help to her better purpose which would come from complete submissive confession from being in the presence of those whose looks and words would be a reflection of her own conscience Maggie had been kept on her bed at York for a day with that prostrating headache which was likely to follow on the terrible strain of the previous day and night There was an expression of physical pain still about her brow and eyes and her whole appearance with her dress so long unchanged was worn and distressed She lifted the latch of the gate and walked in slowly Tom did not hear the gate he was just then close upon the roaring dam but he presently turned and lifting up his eyes saw the figure whose worn look and loneliness seemed to him a confirmation of his worst conjectures He paused trembling and white with disgust and indignation Maggie paused too three yards before him She felt the hatred in his face felt it rushing through her fibres but she must speak Tom she began faintly I am come back to you I am come back home for refuge to tell you everything You will find no home with me he answered with tremulous rage You have disgraced us all You have disgraced my father s name You have been a curse to your best friends You have been base deceitful no motives are strong enough to restrain you I wash my hands of you forever You don t belong to me Their mother had come to the door now She stood paralyzed by the double shock of seeing Maggie and hearing Tom s words Tom said Maggie with more courage I am perhaps not so guilty as you believe me to be I never meant to give way to my feelings I struggled against them I was carried too far in the boat to come back on Tuesday I came back as soon as I could I can t believe in you any more said Tom gradually passing from the tremulous excitement of the first moment to cold inflexibility You have been carrying on a clandestine relation with Stephen Guest as you did before with another He went to see you at my aunt Moss s you walked alone with him in the lanes you must have behaved as no modest girl would have done to her cousin s lover else that could never have happened The people at Luckreth saw you pass you passed all the other places you knew what you were doing You have been using Philip Wakem as a screen to deceive Lucy the kindest friend you ever had Go and see the return you have made her She s ill unable to speak My mother can t go near her lest she should remind her of you Maggie was half stunned too heavily pressed upon by her anguish even to discern any difference between her actual guilt and her brother s accusations still less to vindicate herself Tom she said crushing her hands together under her cloak in the effort to speak again whatever I have done I repent it bitterly I want to make amends I will endure anything I want to be kept from doing wrong again What will keep you said Tom with cruel bitterness Not religion not your natural feelings of gratitude and honor And he he would deserve to be shot if it were not But you are ten times worse than he is I loathe your character and your conduct You struggled with your feelings you say Yes I have had feelings to struggle with but I conquered them I have had a harder life than you have had but I have found my comfort in doing my duty But I will sanction no such character as yours the world shall know that I feel the difference between right and wrong If you are in want I will provide for you let my mother know But you shall not come under my roof It is enough that I have to bear the thought of your disgrace the sight of you is hateful to me Slowly Maggie was turning away with despair in her heart But the poor frightened mother s love leaped out now stronger than all dread My child I ll go with you You ve got a mother Oh the sweet rest of that embrace to the heart stricken Maggie More helpful than all wisdom is one draught of simple human pity that will not forsake us Tom turned and walked into the house Come in my child missus Tulliver whispered He ll let you stay and sleep in my bed He won t deny that if I ask him No mother said Maggie in a low tone like a moan I will never go in Then wait for me outside I ll get ready and come with you When his mother appeared with her bonnet on Tom came out to her in the passage and put money into her hands My house is yours mother always he said You will come and let me know everything you want you will come back to me Poor missus Tulliver took the money too frightened to say anything The only thing clear to her was the mother s instinct that she would go with her unhappy child Maggie was waiting outside the gate she took her mother s hand and they walked a little way in silence Mother said Maggie at last we will go to Luke s cottage Luke will take me in He was very good to me when I was a little girl He s got no room for us my dear now his wife s got so many children I don t know where to go if it isn t to one o your aunts and I hardly durst said poor missus Tulliver quite destitute of mental resources in this extremity Maggie was silent a little while and then said Let us go to Bob Jakin s mother his wife will have room for us if they have no other lodger So they went on their way to saint Ogg s to the old house by the river side Bob himself was at home with a heaviness at heart which resisted even the new joy and pride of possessing a two months old baby quite the liveliest of its age that had ever been born to prince or packman He would perhaps not so thoroughly have understood all the dubiousness of Maggie s appearance with mister Stephen Guest on the quay at Mudport if he had not witnessed the effect it produced on Tom when he went to report it and since then the circumstances which in any case gave a disastrous character to her elopement had passed beyond the more polite circles of saint Ogg s and had become matter of common talk accessible to the grooms and errand boys So that when he opened the door and saw Maggie standing before him in her sorrow and weariness he had no questions to ask except one which he dared only ask himself where was mister Stephen Guest Bob for his part hoped he might be in the warmest department of an asylum understood to exist in the other world for gentlemen who are likely to be in fallen circumstances there The lodgings were vacant and both missus Jakin the larger and missus Jakin the less were commanded to make all things comfortable for the old Missis and the young Miss alas that she was still Miss The ingenious Bob was sorely perplexed as to how this result could have come about how mister Stephen Guest could have gone away from her or could have let her go away from him when he had the chance of keeping her with him But he was silent and would not allow his wife to ask him a question would not present himself in the room lest it should appear like intrusion and a wish to pry having the same chivalry toward dark eyed Maggie as in the days when he had bought her the memorable present of books But after a day or two missus Tulliver was gone to the Mill again for a few hours to see to Tom s household matters Maggie had wished this after the first violent outburst of feeling which came as soon as she had no longer any active purpose to fulfil she was less in need of her mother s presence she even desired to be alone with her grief But she had been solitary only a little while in the old sitting room that looked on the river when there came a tap at the door and turning round her sad face as she said Come in she saw Bob enter with the baby in his arms and Mumps at his heels We ll go back if it disturbs you Miss said Bob No said Maggie in a low voice wishing she could smile Bob closing the door behind him came and stood before her You see we ve got a little un Miss and I want d you to look at it and take it in your arms if you d be so good For we made free to name it after you and it ud be better for your takin a bit o notice on it Maggie could not speak but she put out her arms to receive the tiny baby while Mumps snuffed at it anxiously to ascertain that this transference was all right Maggie s heart had swelled at this action and speech of Bob s she knew well enough that it was a way he had chosen to show his sympathy and respect Sit down Bob she said presently and he sat down in silence finding his tongue unmanageable in quite a new fashion refusing to say what he wanted it to say Bob she said after a few moments looking down at the baby and holding it anxiously as if she feared it might slip from her mind and her fingers I have a favor to ask of you Don t you speak so Miss said Bob grasping the skin of Mumps s neck if there s anything I can do for you I should look upon it as a day s earnings I want you to go to doctor Kenn s and ask to speak to him and tell him that I am here and should be very grateful if he would come to me while my mother is away She will not come back till evening Eh Miss I d do it in a minute it is but a step but doctor Kenn s wife lies dead she s to be buried to morrow died the day I come from Mudport It s all the more pity she should ha died just now if you want him I hardly like to go a nigh him yet Oh no Bob said Maggie we must let it be till after a few days perhaps when you hear that he is going about again But perhaps he may be going out of town to a distance she added with a new sense of despondency at this idea Not he Miss said Bob He ll none go away He isn t one o them gentlefolks as go to cry at waterin places when their wives die he s got summat else to do He looks fine and sharp after the parish he does He christened the little un an he was at me to know what I did of a Sunday as I didn t come to church But I told him I was upo the travel three parts o the Sundays an then I m so used to bein on my legs I can t sit so long on end an lors sir says I a packman can do wi a small lowance o church it tastes strong says I there s no call to lay it on thick Eh Miss how good the little un is wi you It s like as if it knowed you it partly does I ll be bound like the birds know the mornin Bob s tongue was now evidently loosed from its unwonted bondage and might even be in danger of doing more work than was required of it But the subjects on which he longed to be informed were so steep and difficult of approach that his tongue was likely to run on along the level rather than to carry him on that unbeaten road He felt this and was silent again for a little while ruminating much on the possible forms in which he might put a question At last he said in a more timid voice than usual Will you give me leave to ask you only one thing Miss Maggie was rather startled but she answered Yes Bob if it is about myself not about any one else Well Miss it s this Do you owe anybody a grudge No not any one said Maggie looking up at him inquiringly Why Oh lors Miss said Bob pinching Mumps s neck harder than ever I wish you did an tell me I d leather him till I couldn t see I would an the Justice might do what he liked to me arter Oh Bob said Maggie smiling faintly you re a very good friend to me But I shouldn t like to punish any one even if they d done me wrong I ve done wrong myself too often This view of things was puzzling to Bob and threw more obscurity than ever over what could possibly have happened between Stephen and Maggie But further questions would have been too intrusive even if he could have framed them suitably and he was obliged to carry baby away again to an expectant mother Happen you d like Mumps for company Miss he said when he had taken the baby again He s rare company Mumps is he knows iverything an makes no bother about it If I tell him he ll lie before you an watch you as still just as he watches my pack You d better let me leave him a bit he ll get fond on you Lors it s a fine thing to hev a dumb brute fond on you it ll stick to you an make no jaw Yes do leave him please said Maggie I think I should like to have Mumps for a friend Mumps lie down there said Bob pointing to a place in front of Maggie and niver do you stir till you re spoke to Mumps lay down at once and made no sign of restlessness when his master left the room Chapter II saint Ogg s Passes Judgment It was soon known throughout saint Ogg s that Miss Tulliver was come back she had not then eloped in order to be married to mister Stephen Guest at all events mister Stephen Guest had not married her which came to the same thing so far as her culpability was concerned We judge others according to results how else not knowing the process by which results are arrived at If Miss Tulliver after a few months of well chosen travel had returned as missus Stephen Guest with a post marital trousseau and all the advantages possessed even by the most unwelcome wife of an only son public opinion which at saint Ogg s as else where always knew what to think would have judged in strict consistency with those results Public opinion in these cases is always of the feminine gender not the world but the world s wife and she would have seen that two handsome young people the gentleman of quite the first family in saint Ogg s having found themselves in a false position had been led into a course which to say the least of it was highly injudicious and productive of sad pain and disappointment especially to that sweet young thing Miss Deane mister Stephen Guest had certainly not behaved well but then young men were liable to those sudden infatuated attachments and bad as it might seem in missus Stephen Guest to admit the faintest advances from her cousin s lover indeed it had been said that she was actually engaged to young Wakem old Wakem himself had mentioned it still she was very young and a deformed young man you know and young Guest so very fascinating and they say he positively worships her to be sure that can t last and he ran away with her in the boat quite against her will and what could she do She couldn t come back then no one would have spoken to her and how very well that maize colored satinette becomes her complexion It seems as if the folds in front were quite come in several of her dresses are made so they say he thinks nothing too handsome to buy for her Poor Miss Deane She is very pitiable but then there was no positive engagement and the air at the coast will do her good After all if young Guest felt no more for her than that it was better for her not to marry him What a wonderful marriage for a girl like Miss Tulliver quite romantic Why young Guest will put up for the borough at the next election Nothing like commerce nowadays That young Wakem nearly went out of his mind he always was rather queer but he s gone abroad again to be out of the way quite the best thing for a deformed young man Miss Unit declares she will never visit mister and missus Stephen Guest such nonsense pretending to be better than other people Society couldn t be carried on if we inquired into private conduct in that way and Christianity tells us to think no evil and my belief is that Miss Unit had no cards sent her But the results we know were not of a kind to warrant this extenuation of the past Maggie had returned without a trousseau without a husband in that degraded and outcast condition to which error is well known to lead and the world s wife with that fine instinct which is given her for the preservation of Society saw at once that Miss Tulliver s conduct had been of the most aggravated kind Could anything be more detestable A girl so much indebted to her friends whose mother as well as herself had received so much kindness from the Deanes to lay the design of winning a young man s affections away from her own cousin who had behaved like a sister to her Winning his affections That was not the phrase for such a girl as Miss Tulliver it would have been more correct to say that she had been actuated by mere unwomanly boldness and unbridled passion There was always something questionable about her That connection with young Wakem which they said had been carried on for years looked very ill disgusting in fact But with a girl of that disposition To the world s wife there had always been something in Miss Tulliver s very physique that a refined instinct felt to be prophetic of harm As for poor mister Stephen Guest he was rather pitiable than otherwise a young man of five and twenty is not to be too severely judged in these cases he is really very much at the mercy of a designing bold girl And it was clear that he had given way in spite of himself he had shaken her off as soon as he could indeed their having parted so soon looked very black indeed for her To be sure he had written a letter laying all the blame on himself and telling the story in a romantic fashion so as to try and make her appear quite innocent of course he would do that But the refined instinct of the world s wife was not to be deceived providentially else what would become of Society Why her own brother had turned her from his door he had seen enough you might be sure before he would do that A truly respectable young man mister Tom Tulliver quite likely to rise in the world His sister s disgrace was naturally a heavy blow to him It was to be hoped that she would go out of the neighborhood to America or anywhere so as to purify the air of saint Ogg s from the stain of her presence extremely dangerous to daughters there No good could happen to her it was only to be hoped she would repent and that God would have mercy on her He had not the care of society on His hands as the world s wife had It required nearly a fortnight for fine instinct to assure itself of these inspirations indeed it was a whole week before Stephen s letter came telling his father the facts and adding that he was gone across to Holland had drawn upon the agent at Mudport for money was incapable of any resolution at present Maggie all this while was too entirely filled with a more agonizing anxiety to spend any thought on the view that was being taken of her conduct by the world of saint Ogg s anxiety about Stephen Lucy Philip beat on her poor heart in a hard driving ceaseless storm of mingled love remorse and pity If she had thought of rejection and injustice at all it would have seemed to her that they had done their worst that she could hardly feel any stroke from them intolerable since the words she had heard from her brother s lips Across all her anxiety for the loved and the injured those words shot again and again like a horrible pang that would have brought misery and dread even into a heaven of delights The idea of ever recovering happiness never glimmered in her mind for a moment it seemed as if every sensitive fibre in her were too entirely preoccupied by pain ever to vibrate again to another influence Life stretched before her as one act of penitence and all she craved as she dwelt on her future lot was something to guarantee her from more falling her own weakness haunted her like a vision of hideous possibilities that made no peace conceivable except such as lay in the sense of a sure refuge But she was not without practical intentions the love of independence was too strong an inheritance and a habit for her not to remember that she must get her bread and when other projects looked vague she fell back on that of returning to her plain sewing and so getting enough to pay for her lodging at Bob s She meant to persuade her mother to return to the Mill by and by and live with Tom again and somehow or other she would maintain herself at saint Ogg s doctor Kenn would perhaps help her and advise her She remembered his parting words at the bazaar She remembered the momentary feeling of reliance that had sprung in her when he was talking with her and she waited with yearning expectation for the opportunity of confiding everything to him Her mother called every day at mister Deane s to learn how Lucy was the report was always sad nothing had yet roused her from the feeble passivity which had come on with the first shock But of Philip missus Tulliver had learned nothing naturally no one whom she met would speak to her about what related to her daughter But at last she summoned courage to go and see sister Glegg who of course would know everything and had been even to see Tom at the Mill in missus Tulliver s absence though he had said nothing of what had passed on the occasion As soon as her mother was gone Maggie put on her bonnet She had resolved on walking to the Rectory and asking to see doctor Kenn he was in deep grief but the grief of another does not jar upon us in such circumstances It was the first time she had been beyond the door since her return nevertheless her mind was so bent on the purpose of her walk that the unpleasantness of meeting people on the way and being stared at did not occur to her But she had no sooner passed beyond the narrower streets which she had to thread from Bob s dwelling than she became aware of unusual glances cast at her and this consciousness made her hurry along nervously afraid to look to right or left Presently however she came full on missus and Miss Turnbull old acquaintances of her family they both looked at her strangely and turned a little aside without speaking All hard looks were pain to Maggie but her self reproach was too strong for resentment No wonder they will not speak to me she thought they are very fond of Lucy But now she knew that she was about to pass a group of gentlemen who were standing at the door of the billiard rooms and she could not help seeing young Torry step out a little with his glass at his eye and bow to her with that air of nonchalance which he might have bestowed on a friendly barmaid Maggie s pride was too intense for her not to feel that sting even in the midst of her sorrow and for the first time the thought took strong hold of her that she would have other obloquy cast on her besides that which was felt to be due to her breach of faith toward Lucy But she was at the Rectory now there perhaps she would find something else than retribution Retribution may come from any voice the hardest cruelest most imbruted urchin at the street corner can inflict it surely help and pity are rarer things more needful for the righteous to bestow She was shown up at once after being announced into doctor Kenn s study where he sat amongst piled up books for which he had little appetite leaning his cheek against the head of his youngest child a girl of three The child was sent away with the servant and when the door was closed doctor Kenn said placing a chair for Maggie I was coming to see you Miss Tulliver you have anticipated me I am glad you did Maggie looked at him with her childlike directness as she had done at the bazaar and said I want to tell you everything But her eyes filled fast with tears as she said it and all the pent up excitement of her humiliating walk would have its vent before she could say more Do tell me everything doctor Kenn said with quiet kindness in his grave firm voice Think of me as one to whom a long experience has been granted which may enable him to help you In rather broken sentences and with some effort at first but soon with the greater ease that came from a sense of relief in the confidence Maggie told the brief story of a struggle that must be the beginning of a long sorrow Only the day before doctor Kenn had been made acquainted with the contents of Stephen s letter and he had believed them at once without the confirmation of Maggie s statement That involuntary plaint of hers Oh I must go had remained with him as the sign that she was undergoing some inward conflict Maggie dwelt the longest on the feeling which had made her come back to her mother and brother which made her cling to all the memories of the past When she had ended doctor Kenn was silent for some minutes there was a difficulty on his mind He rose and walked up and down the hearth with his hands behind him At last he seated himself again and said looking at Maggie Your prompting to go to your nearest friends to remain where all the ties of your life have been formed is a true prompting to which the Church in its original constitution and discipline responds opening its arms to the penitent watching over its children to the last never abandoning them until they are hopelessly reprobate And the Church ought to represent the feeling of the community so that every parish should be a family knit together by Christian brotherhood under a spiritual father But the ideas of discipline and Christian fraternity are entirely relaxed they can hardly be said to exist in the public mind they hardly survive except in the partial contradictory form they have taken in the narrow communities of schismatics and if I were not supported by the firm faith that the Church must ultimately recover the full force of that constitution which is alone fitted to human needs I should often lose heart at observing the want of fellowship and sense of mutual responsibility among my own flock At present everything seems tending toward the relaxation of ties toward the substitution of wayward choice for the adherence to obligation which has its roots in the past Your conscience and your heart have given you true light on this point Miss Tulliver and I have said all this that you may know what my wish about you what my advice to you would be if they sprang from my own feeling and opinion unmodified by counteracting circumstances doctor Kenn paused a little while There was an entire absence of effusive benevolence in his manner there was something almost cold in the gravity of his look and voice If Maggie had not known that his benevolence was persevering in proportion to its reserve she might have been chilled and frightened As it was she listened expectantly quite sure that there would be some effective help in his words He went on Your inexperience of the world Miss Tulliver prevents you from anticipating fully the very unjust conceptions that will probably be formed concerning your conduct conceptions which will have a baneful effect even in spite of known evidence to disprove them Oh I do I begin to see said Maggie unable to repress this utterance of her recent pain I know I shall be insulted I shall be thought worse than I am You perhaps do not yet know said doctor Kenn with a touch of more personal pity that a letter is come which ought to satisfy every one who has known anything of you that you chose the steep and difficult path of a return to the right at the moment when that return was most of all difficult Oh where is he said poor Maggie with a flush and tremor that no presence could have hindered He is gone abroad he has written of all that passed to his father He has vindicated you to the utmost and I hope the communication of that letter to your cousin will have a beneficial effect on her doctor Kenn waited for her to get calm again before he went on That letter as I said ought to suffice to prevent false impressions concerning you But I am bound to tell you Miss Tulliver that not only the experience of my whole life but my observation within the last three days makes me fear that there is hardly any evidence which will save you from the painful effect of false imputations The persons who are the most incapable of a conscientious struggle such as yours are precisely those who will be likely to shrink from you because they will not believe in your struggle I fear your life here will be attended not only with much pain but with many obstructions For this reason and for this only I ask you to consider whether it will not perhaps be better for you to take a situation at a distance according to your former intention I will exert myself at once to obtain one for you Oh if I could but stop here said Maggie I have no heart to begin a strange life again I should have no stay I should feel like a lonely wanderer cut off from the past I have written to the lady who offered me a situation to excuse myself If I remained here I could perhaps atone in some way to Lucy to others I could convince them that I m sorry And she added with some of the old proud fire flashing out I will not go away because people say false things of me They shall learn to retract them If I must go away at last because because others wish it I will not go now Well said doctor Kenn after some consideration if you determine on that Miss Tulliver you may rely on all the influence my position gives me I am bound to aid and countenance you by the very duties of my office as a parish priest I will add that personally I have a deep interest in your peace of mind and welfare The only thing I want is some occupation that will enable me to get my bread and be independent said Maggie I shall not want much I can go on lodging where I am I must think over the subject maturely said doctor Kenn and in a few days I shall be better able to ascertain the general feeling I shall come to see you I shall bear you constantly in mind When Maggie had left him doctor Kenn stood ruminating with his hands behind him and his eyes fixed on the carpet under a painful sense of doubt and difficulty The tone of Stephen s letter which he had read and the actual relations of all the persons concerned forced upon him powerfully the idea of an ultimate marriage between Stephen and Maggie as the least evil and the impossibility of their proximity in saint Ogg s on any other supposition until after years of separation threw an insurmountable prospective difficulty over Maggie s stay there On the other hand he entered with all the comprehension of a man who had known spiritual conflict and lived through years of devoted service to his fellow men into that state of Maggie s heart and conscience which made the consent to the marriage a desecration to her her conscience must not be tampered with the principle on which she had acted was a safer guide than any balancing of consequences His experience told him that intervention was too dubious a responsibility to be lightly incurred the possible issue either of an endeavor to restore the former relations with Lucy and Philip or of counselling submission to this irruption of a new feeling was hidden in a darkness all the more impenetrable because each immediate step was clogged with evil The great problem of the shifting relation between passion and duty is clear to no man who is capable of apprehending it the question whether the moment has come in which a man has fallen below the possibility of a renunciation that will carry any efficacy and must accept the sway of a passion against which he had struggled as a trespass is one for which we have no master key that will fit all cases The casuists have become a byword of reproach but their perverted spirit of minute discrimination was the shadow of a truth to which eyes and hearts are too often fatally sealed the truth that moral judgments must remain false and hollow unless they are checked and enlightened by a perpetual reference to the special circumstances that mark the individual lot All people of broad strong sense have an instinctive repugnance to the men of maxims because such people early discern that the mysterious complexity of our life is not to be embraced by maxims and that to lace ourselves up in formulas of that sort is to repress all the divine promptings and inspirations that spring from growing insight and sympathy And the man of maxims is the popular representative of the minds that are guided in their moral judgment solely by general rules thinking that these will lead them to justice by a ready made patent method without the trouble of exerting patience discrimination impartiality without any care to assure themselves whether they have the insight that comes from a hardly earned estimate of temptation or from a life vivid and intense enough to have created a wide fellow feeling with all that is human Chapter III Showing That Old Acquaintances Are Capable of Surprising Us When Maggie was at home again her mother brought her news of an unexpected line of conduct in aunt Glegg As long as Maggie had not been heard of missus Glegg had half closed her shutters and drawn down her blinds She felt assured that Maggie was drowned that was far more probable than that her niece and legatee should have done anything to wound the family honor in the tenderest point When at last she learned from Tom that Maggie had come home and gathered from him what was her explanation of her absence she burst forth in severe reproof of Tom for admitting the worst of his sister until he was compelled If you were not to stand by your kin as long as there was a shred of honor attributable to them pray what were you to stand by Lightly to admit conduct in one of your own family that would force you to alter your will had never been the way of the Dodsons and though missus Glegg had always augured ill of Maggie s future at a time when other people were perhaps less clear sighted yet fair play was a jewel and it was not for her own friends to help to rob the girl of her fair fame and to cast her out from family shelter to the scorn of the outer world until she had become unequivocally a family disgrace The circumstances were unprecedented in missus Glegg s experience nothing of that kind had happened among the Dodsons before but it was a case in which her hereditary rectitude and personal strength of character found a common channel along with her fundamental ideas of clanship as they did in her lifelong regard to equity in money matters She quarrelled with mister Glegg whose kindness flowing entirely into compassion for Lucy made him as hard in his judgment of Maggie as mister Deane himself was and fuming against her sister Tulliver because she did not at once come to her for advice and help shut herself up in her own room with Baxter s Saints Rest from morning till night denying herself to all visitors till mister Glegg brought from mister Deane the news of Stephen s letter Then missus Glegg felt that she had adequate fighting ground then she laid aside Baxter and was ready to meet all comers While missus Pullet could do nothing but shake her head and cry and wish that cousin Abbot had died or any number of funerals had happened rather than this which had never happened before so that there was no knowing how to act and missus Pullet could never enter saint Ogg s again because acquaintances knew of it all missus Glegg only hoped that missus Wooll or any one else would come to her with their false tales about her own niece and she would know what to say to that ill advised person Again she had a scene of remonstrance with Tom all the more severe in proportion to the greater strength of her present position But Tom like other immovable things seemed only the more rigidly fixed under that attempt to shake him Poor Tom he judged by what he had been able to see and the judgment was painful enough to himself He thought he had the demonstration of facts observed through years by his own eyes which gave no warning of their imperfection that Maggie s nature was utterly untrustworthy and too strongly marked with evil tendencies to be safely treated with leniency He would act on that demonstration at any cost but the thought of it made his days bitter to him Tom like every one of us was imprisoned within the limits of his own nature and his education had simply glided over him leaving a slight deposit of polish if you are inclined to be severe on his severity remember that the responsibility of tolerance lies with those who have the wider vision There had arisen in Tom a repulsion toward Maggie that derived its very intensity from their early childish love in the time when they had clasped tiny fingers together and their later sense of nearness in a common duty and a common sorrow the sight of her as he had told her was hateful to him In this branch of the Dodson family aunt Glegg found a stronger nature than her own a nature in which family feeling had lost the character of clanship by taking on a doubly deep dye of personal pride missus Glegg allowed that Maggie ought to be punished she was not a woman to deny that she knew what conduct was but punished in proportion to the misdeeds proved against her not to those which were cast upon her by people outside her own family who might wish to show that their own kin were better Your aunt Glegg scolded me so as niver was my dear said poor missus Tulliver when she came back to Maggie as I didn t go to her before she said it wasn t for her to come to me first But she spoke like a sister too having she allays was and hard to please oh dear but she s said the kindest word as has ever been spoke by you yet my child For she says for all she s been so set again having one extry in the house and making extry spoons and things and putting her about in her ways you shall have a shelter in her house if you ll go to her dutiful and she ll uphold you against folks as say harm of you when they ve no call And I told her I thought you couldn t bear to see anybody but me you were so beat down with trouble but she said I won t throw ill words at her there s them out o th family ull be ready enough to do that But I ll give her good advice an she must be humble It s wonderful o Jane for I m sure she used to throw everything I did wrong at me if it was the raisin wine as turned out bad or the pies too hot or whativer it was Oh mother said poor Maggie shrinking from the thought of all the contact her bruised mind would have to bear tell her I m very grateful I ll go to see her as soon as I can but I can t see any one just yet except doctor Kenn I ve been to him he will advise me and help me to get some occupation I can t live with any one or be dependent on them tell aunt Glegg I must get my own bread But did you hear nothing of Philip Philip Wakem Have you never seen any one that has mentioned him No my dear but I ve been to Lucy s and I saw your uncle and he says they got her to listen to the letter and she took notice o Miss Guest and asked questions and the doctor thinks she s on the turn to be better What a world this is what trouble oh dear The law was the first beginning and it s gone from bad to worse all of a sudden just when the luck seemed on the turn This was the first lamentation that missus Tulliver had let slip to Maggie but old habit had been revived by the interview with sister Glegg My poor poor mother Maggie burst out cut to the heart with pity and compunction and throwing her arms round her mother s neck I was always naughty and troublesome to you And now you might have been happy if it hadn t been for me Eh my dear said missus Tulliver leaning toward the warm young cheek I must put up wi my children I shall never have no more and if they bring me bad luck I must be fond on it There s nothing else much to be fond on for my furnitur went long ago And you d got to be very good once I can t think how it s turned out the wrong way so Still two or three more days passed and Maggie heard nothing of Philip anxiety about him was becoming her predominant trouble and she summoned courage at last to inquire about him of doctor Kenn on his next visit to her He did not even know if Philip was at home The elder Wakem was made moody by an accumulation of annoyance the disappointment in this young Jetsome to whom apparently he was a good deal attached had been followed close by the catastrophe to his son s hopes after he had done violence to his own strong feeling by conceding to them and had incautiously mentioned this concession in saint Ogg s and he was almost fierce in his brusqueness when any one asked him a question about his son But Philip could hardly have been ill or it would have been known through the calling in of the medical man it was probable that he was gone out of the town for a little while Maggie sickened under this suspense and her imagination began to live more and more persistently in what Philip was enduring What did he believe about her At last Bob brought her a letter without a postmark directed in a hand which she knew familiarly in the letters of her own name a hand in which her name had been written long ago in a pocket Shakespeare which she possessed Her mother was in the room and Maggie in violent agitation hurried upstairs that she might read the letter in solitude She read it with a throbbing brow Maggie I believe in you I know you never meant to deceive me I know you tried to keep faith to me and to all I believed this before I had any other evidence of it than your own nature The night after I last parted from you I suffered torments I had seen what convinced me that you were not free that there was another whose presence had a power over you which mine never possessed but through all the suggestions almost murderous suggestions of rage and jealousy my mind made its way to believe in your truthfulness I was sure that you meant to cleave to me as you had said that you had rejected him that you struggled to renounce him for Lucy s sake and for mine But I could see no issue that was not fatal for you and that dread shut out the very thought of resignation I foresaw that he would not relinquish you and I believed then as I believe now that the strong attraction which drew you together proceeded only from one side of your characters and belonged to that partial divided action of our nature which makes half the tragedy of the human lot I have felt the vibration of chords in your nature that I have continually felt the want of in his But perhaps I am wrong perhaps I feel about you as the artist does about the scene over which his soul has brooded with love he would tremble to see it confided to other hands he would never believe that it could bear for another all the meaning and the beauty it bears for him I dared not trust myself to see you that morning I was filled with selfish passion I was shattered by a night of conscious delirium I told you long ago that I had never been resigned even to the mediocrity of my powers how could I be resigned to the loss of the one thing which had ever come to me on earth with the promise of such deep joy as would give a new and blessed meaning to the foregoing pain the promise of another self that would lift my aching affection into the divine rapture of an ever springing ever satisfied want But the miseries of that night had prepared me for what came before the next It was no surprise to me I was certain that he had prevailed on you to sacrifice everything to him and I waited with equal certainty to hear of your marriage I measured your love and his by my own But I was wrong Maggie There is something stronger in you than your love for him I will not tell you what I went through in that interval But even in its utmost agony even in those terrible throes that love must suffer before it can be disembodied of selfish desire my love for you sufficed to withhold me from suicide without the aid of any other motive In the midst of my egoism I yet could not bear to come like a death shadow across the feast of your joy I could not bear to forsake the world in which you still lived and might need me it was part of the faith I had vowed to you to wait and endure Maggie that is a proof of what I write now to assure you of that no anguish I have had to bear on your account has been too heavy a price to pay for the new life into which I have entered in loving you I want you to put aside all grief because of the grief you have caused me I was nurtured in the sense of privation I never expected happiness and in knowing you in loving you I have had and still have what reconciles me to life You have been to my affections what light what color is to my eyes what music is to the inward ear you have raised a dim unrest into a vivid consciousness The new life I have found in caring for your joy and sorrow more than for what is directly my own has transformed the spirit of rebellious murmuring into that willing endurance which is the birth of strong sympathy I think nothing but such complete and intense love could have initiated me into that enlarged life which grows and grows by appropriating the life of others for before I was always dragged back from it by ever present painful self consciousness I even think sometimes that this gift of transferred life which has come to me in loving you may be a new power to me Then dear one in spite of all you have been the blessing of my life Let no self reproach weigh on you because of me It is I who should rather reproach myself for having urged my feelings upon you and hurried you into words that you have felt as fetters You meant to be true to those words you have been true I can measure your sacrifice by what I have known in only one half hour of your presence with me when I dreamed that you might love me best But Maggie I have no just claim on you for more than affectionate remembrance For some time I have shrunk from writing to you because I have shrunk even from the appearance of wishing to thrust myself before you and so repeating my original error But you will not misconstrue me I know that we must keep apart for a long while cruel tongues would force us apart if nothing else did But I shall not go away The place where you are is the one where my mind must live wherever I might travel And remember that I am unchangeably yours yours not with selfish wishes but with a devotion that excludes such wishes God comfort you my loving large souled Maggie If every one else has misconceived you remember that you have never been doubted by him whose heart recognized you ten years ago Do not believe any one who says I am ill because I am not seen out of doors I have only had nervous headaches no worse than I have sometimes had them before But the overpowering heat inclines me to be perfectly quiescent in the daytime I am strong enough to obey any word which shall tell me that I can serve you by word or deed Yours to the last Philip Wakem As Maggie knelt by the bed sobbing with that letter pressed under her her feelings again and again gathered themselves in a whispered cry always in the same words O God is there any happiness in love that could make me forget their pain Chapter IV Maggie and Lucy By the end of the week doctor Kenn had made up his mind that there was only one way in which he could secure to Maggie a suitable living at saint Ogg s Even with his twenty years experience as a parish priest he was aghast at the obstinate continuance of imputations against her in the face of evidence Hitherto he had been rather more adored and appealed to than was quite agreeable to him but now in attempting to open the ears of women to reason and their consciences to justice on behalf of Maggie Tulliver he suddenly found himself as powerless as he was aware he would have been if he had attempted to influence the shape of bonnets doctor Kenn could not be contradicted he was listened to in silence but when he left the room a comparison of opinions among his hearers yielded much the same result as before Miss Tulliver had undeniably acted in a blamable manner even doctor Kenn did not deny that how then could he think so lightly of her as to put that favorable interpretation on everything she had done Even on the supposition that required the utmost stretch of belief namely that none of the things said about Miss Tulliver were true still since they had been said about her they had cast an odor round her which must cause her to be shrunk from by every woman who had to take care of her own reputation and of Society To have taken Maggie by the hand and said I will not believe unproved evil of you my lips shall not utter it my ears shall be closed against it I too am an erring mortal liable to stumble apt to come short of my most earnest efforts your lot has been harder than mine your temptation greater let us help each other to stand and walk without more falling to have done this would have demanded courage deep pity self knowledge generous trust would have demanded a mind that tasted no piquancy in evil speaking that felt no self exaltation in condemning that cheated itself with no large words into the belief that life can have any moral end any high religion which excludes the striving after perfect truth justice and love toward the individual men and women who come across our own path The ladies of saint Ogg s were not beguiled by any wide speculative conceptions but they had their favorite abstraction called Society which served to make their consciences perfectly easy in doing what satisfied their own egoism thinking and speaking the worst of Maggie Tulliver and turning their backs upon her It was naturally disappointing to doctor Kenn after two years of superfluous incense from his feminine parishioners to find them suddenly maintaining their views in opposition to his but then they maintained them in opposition to a higher Authority which they had venerated longer That Authority had furnished a very explicit answer to persons who might inquire where their social duties began and might be inclined to take wide views as to the starting point The answer had not turned on the ultimate good of Society but on a certain man who was found in trouble by the wayside Not that saint Ogg s was empty of women with some tenderness of heart and conscience probably it had as fair a proportion of human goodness in it as any other small trading town of that day But until every good man is brave we must expect to find many good women timid too timid even to believe in the correctness of their own best promptings when these would place them in a minority And the men at saint Ogg s were not all brave by any means some of them were even fond of scandal and to an extent that might have given their conversation an effeminate character if it had not been distinguished by masculine jokes and by an occasional shrug of the shoulders at the mutual hatred of women It was the general feeling of the masculine mind at saint Ogg s that women were not to be interfered with in their treatment of each other And thus every direction in which doctor Kenn had turned in the hope of procuring some kind recognition and some employment for Maggie proved a disappointment to him missus James Torry could not think of taking Maggie as a nursery governess even temporarily a young woman about whom such things had been said and about whom gentlemen joked and Miss Kirke who had a spinal complaint and wanted a reader and companion felt quite sure that Maggie s mind must be of a quality with which she for her part could not risk any contact Why did not Miss Tulliver accept the shelter offered her by her aunt Glegg It did not become a girl like her to refuse it Or else why did she not go out of the neighborhood and get a situation where she was not known It was not apparently of so much importance that she should carry her dangerous tendencies into strange families unknown at saint Ogg s She must be very bold and hardened to wish to stay in a parish where she was so much stared at and whispered about doctor Kenn having great natural firmness began in the presence of this opposition as every firm man would have done to contract a certain strength of determination over and above what would have been called forth by the end in view He himself wanted a daily governess for his younger children and though he had hesitated in the first instance to offer this position to Maggie the resolution to protest with the utmost force of his personal and priestly character against her being crushed and driven away by slander was now decisive Maggie gratefully accepted an employment that gave her duties as well as a support her days would be filled now and solitary evenings would be a welcome rest She no longer needed the sacrifice her mother made in staying with her and missus Tulliver was persuaded to go back to the Mill But now it began to be discovered that doctor Kenn exemplary as he had hitherto appeared had his crotchets possibly his weaknesses The masculine mind of saint Ogg s smiled pleasantly and did not wonder that Kenn liked to see a fine pair of eyes daily or that he was inclined to take so lenient a view of the past the feminine mind regarded at that period as less powerful took a more melancholy view of the case If doctor Kenn should be beguiled into marrying that Miss Tulliver It was not safe to be too confident even about the best of men an apostle had fallen and wept bitterly afterwards and though Peter s denial was not a close precedent his repentance was likely to be Maggie had not taken her daily walks to the Rectory for many weeks before the dreadful possibility of her some time or other becoming the Rector s wife had been talked of so often in confidence that ladies were beginning to discuss how they should behave to her in that position For doctor Kenn it had been understood had sat in the schoolroom half an hour one morning when Miss Tulliver was giving her lessons nay he had sat there every morning he had once walked home with her he almost always walked home with her and if not he went to see her in the evening What an artful creature she was What a mother for those children It was enough to make poor missus Kenn turn in her grave that they should be put under the care of this girl only a few weeks after her death Would he be so lost to propriety as to marry her before the year was out The masculine mind was sarcastic and thought not The Miss Guests saw an alleviation to the sorrow of witnessing a folly in their Rector at least their brother would be safe and their knowledge of Stephen s tenacity was a constant ground of alarm to them lest he should come back and marry Maggie They were not among those who disbelieved their brother s letter but they had no confidence in Maggie s adherence to her renunciation of him they suspected that she had shrunk rather from the elopement than from the marriage and that she lingered in saint Ogg s relying on his return to her They had always thought her disagreeable they now thought her artful and proud having quite as good grounds for that judgment as you and I probably have for many strong opinions of the same kind Formerly they had not altogether delighted in the contemplated match with Lucy but now their dread of a marriage between Stephen and Maggie added its momentum to their genuine pity and indignation on behalf of the gentle forsaken girl in making them desire that he should return to her As soon as Lucy was able to leave home she was to seek relief from the oppressive heat of this August by going to the coast with the Miss Guests and it was in their plans that Stephen should be induced to join them On the very first hint of gossip concerning Maggie and doctor Kenn the report was conveyed in Miss Guest s letter to her brother Maggie had frequent tidings through her mother or aunt Glegg or doctor Kenn of Lucy s gradual progress toward recovery and her thoughts tended continually toward her uncle Deane s house she hungered for an interview with Lucy if it were only for five minutes to utter a word of penitence to be assured by Lucy s own eyes and lips that she did not believe in the willing treachery of those whom she had loved and trusted But she knew that even if her uncle s indignation had not closed his house against her the agitation of such an interview would have been forbidden to Lucy Only to have seen her without speaking would have been some relief for Maggie was haunted by a face cruel in its very gentleness a face that had been turned on hers with glad sweet looks of trust and love from the twilight time of memory changed now to a sad and weary face by a first heart stroke And as the days passed on that pale image became more and more distinct the picture grew and grew into more speaking definiteness under the avenging hand of remorse the soft hazel eyes in their look of pain were bent forever on Maggie and pierced her the more because she could see no anger in them But Lucy was not yet able to go to church or any place where Maggie could see her and even the hope of that departed when the news was told her by aunt Glegg that Lucy was really going away in a few days to Scarborough with the Miss Guests who had been heard to say that they expected their brother to meet them there Only those who have known what hardest inward conflict is can know what Maggie felt as she sat in her loneliness the evening after hearing that news from missus Glegg only those who have known what it is to dread their own selfish desires as the watching mother would dread the sleeping potion that was to still her own pain She sat without candle in the twilight with the window wide open toward the river the sense of oppressive heat adding itself undistinguishably to the burthen of her lot Seated on a chair against the window with her arm on the windowsill she was looking blankly at the flowing river swift with the backward rushing tide struggling to see still the sweet face in its unreproaching sadness that seemed now from moment to moment to sink away and be hidden behind a form that thrust itself between and made darkness Hearing the door open she thought missus Jakin was coming in with her supper as usual and with that repugnance to trivial speech which comes with languor and wretchedness she shrank from turning round and saying she wanted nothing good little missus Jakin would be sure to make some well meant remarks But the next moment without her having discerned the sound of a footstep she felt a light hand on her shoulder and heard a voice close to her saying Maggie The face was there changed but all the sweeter the hazel eyes were there with their heart piercing tenderness Maggie the soft voice said Lucy answered a voice with a sharp ring of anguish in it and Lucy threw her arms round Maggie s neck and leaned her pale cheek against the burning brow I stole out said Lucy almost in a whisper while she sat down close to Maggie and held her hand when papa and the rest were away Alice is come with me I asked her to help me But I must only stay a little while because it is so late It was easier to say that at first than to say anything else They sat looking at each other It seemed as if the interview must end without more speech for speech was very difficult Each felt that there would be something scorching in the words that would recall the irretrievable wrong But soon as Maggie looked every distinct thought began to be overflowed by a wave of loving penitence and words burst forth with a sob God bless you for coming Lucy The sobs came thick on each other after that Maggie dear be comforted said Lucy now putting her cheek against Maggie s again Don t grieve And she sat still hoping to soothe Maggie with that gentle caress I didn t mean to deceive you Lucy said Maggie as soon as she could speak It always made me wretched that I felt what I didn t like you to know It was because I thought it would all be conquered and you might never see anything to wound you I know dear said Lucy I know you never meant to make me unhappy It is a trouble that has come on us all you have more to bear than I have and you gave him up when you did what it must have been very hard to do They were silent again a little while sitting with clasped hands and cheeks leaned together Lucy Maggie began again he struggled too He wanted to be true to you He will come back to you Forgive him he will be happy then These words were wrung forth from Maggie s deepest soul with an effort like the convulsed clutch of a drowning man Lucy trembled and was silent A gentle knock came at the door It was Alice the maid who entered and said I daren t stay any longer Miss Deane They ll find it out and there ll be such anger at your coming out so late Lucy rose and said Very well Alice in a minute I m to go away on Friday Maggie she added when Alice had closed the door again When I come back and am strong they will let me do as I like I shall come to you when I please then Lucy said Maggie with another great effort I pray to God continually that I may never be the cause of sorrow to you any more She pressed the little hand that she held between hers and looked up into the face that was bent over hers Lucy never forgot that look Maggie she said in a low voice that had the solemnity of confession in it you are better than I am I can t She broke off there and said no more But they clasped each other again in a last embrace Chapter V The Last Conflict In the second week of September Maggie was again sitting in her lonely room battling with the old shadowy enemies that were forever slain and rising again It was past midnight and the rain was beating heavily against the window driven with fitful force by the rushing loud moaning wind For the day after Lucy s visit there had been a sudden change in the weather the heat and drought had given way to cold variable winds and heavy falls of rain at intervals and she had been forbidden to risk the contemplated journey until the weather should become more settled In the counties higher up the Floss the rains had been continuous and the completion of the harvest had been arrested And now for the last two days the rains on this lower course of the river had been incessant so that the old men had shaken their heads and talked of sixty years ago when the same sort of weather happening about the equinox brought on the great floods which swept the bridge away and reduced the town to great misery But the younger generation who had seen several small floods thought lightly of these sombre recollections and forebodings and Bob Jakin naturally prone to take a hopeful view of his own luck laughed at his mother when she regretted their having taken a house by the riverside observing that but for that they would have had no boats which were the most lucky of possessions in case of a flood that obliged them to go to a distance for food But the careless and the fearful were alike sleeping in their beds now There was hope that the rain would abate by the morrow threatenings of a worse kind from sudden thaws after falls of snow had often passed off in the experience of the younger ones and at the very worst the banks would be sure to break lower down the river when the tide came in with violence and so the waters would be carried off without causing more than temporary inconvenience and losses that would be felt only by the poorer sort whom charity would relieve All were in their beds now for it was past midnight all except some solitary watchers such as Maggie She was seated in her little parlor toward the river with one candle that left everything dim in the room except a letter which lay before her on the table That letter which had come to her to day was one of the causes that had kept her up far on into the night unconscious how the hours were going careless of seeking rest with no image of rest coming across her mind except of that far far off rest from which there would be no more waking for her into this struggling earthly life Two days before Maggie received that letter she had been to the Rectory for the last time The heavy rain would have prevented her from going since but there was another reason doctor Kenn at first enlightened only by a few hints as to the new turn which gossip and slander had taken in relation to Maggie had recently been made more fully aware of it by an earnest remonstrance from one of his male parishioners against the indiscretion of persisting in the attempt to overcome the prevalent feeling in the parish by a course of resistance doctor Kenn having a conscience void of offence in the matter was still inclined to persevere was still averse to give way before a public sentiment that was odious and contemptible but he was finally wrought upon by the consideration of the peculiar responsibility attached to his office of avoiding the appearance of evil an appearance that is always dependent on the average quality of surrounding minds Where these minds are low and gross the area of that appearance is proportionately widened Perhaps he was in danger of acting from obstinacy perhaps it was his duty to succumb Conscientious people are apt to see their duty in that which is the most painful course and to recede was always painful to doctor Kenn He made up his mind that he must advise Maggie to go away from saint Ogg s for a time and he performed that difficult task with as much delicacy as he could only stating in vague terms that he found his attempt to countenance her stay was a source of discord between himself and his parishioners that was likely to obstruct his usefulness as a clergyman He begged her to allow him to write to a clerical friend of his who might possibly take her into his own family as governess and if not would probably know of some other available position for a young woman in whose welfare doctor Kenn felt a strong interest Poor Maggie listened with a trembling lip she could say nothing but a faint Thank you I shall be grateful and she walked back to her lodgings through the driving rain with a new sense of desolation She must be a lonely wanderer she must go out among fresh faces that would look at her wonderingly because the days did not seem joyful to her she must begin a new life in which she would have to rouse herself to receive new impressions and she was so unspeakably sickeningly weary There was no home no help for the erring even those who pitied were constrained to hardness But ought she to complain Ought she to shrink in this way from the long penance of life which was all the possibility she had of lightening the load to some other sufferers and so changing that passionate error into a new force of unselfish human love All the next day she sat in her lonely room with a window darkened by the cloud and the driving rain thinking of that future and wrestling for patience for what repose could poor Maggie ever win except by wrestling And on the third day this day of which she had just sat out the close the letter had come which was lying on the table before her The letter was from Stephen He was come back from Holland he was at Mudport again unknown to any of his friends and had written to her from that place enclosing the letter to a person whom he trusted in saint Ogg s From beginning to end it was a passionate cry of reproach an appeal against her useless sacrifice of him of herself against that perverted notion of right which led her to crush all his hopes for the sake of a mere idea and not any substantial good his hopes whom she loved and who loved her with that single overpowering passion that worship which a man never gives to a woman more than once in his life They have written to me that you are to marry Kenn As if I should believe that Perhaps they have told you some such fables about me Perhaps they tell you I ve been travelling My body has been dragged about somewhere but I have never travelled from the hideous place where you left me where I started up from the stupor of helpless rage to find you gone Maggie whose pain can have been like mine Whose injury is like mine Who besides me has met that long look of love that has burnt itself into my soul so that no other image can come there Maggie call me back to you Call me back to life and goodness I am banished from both now I have no motives I am indifferent to everything Two months have only deepened the certainty that I can never care for life without you Write me one word say Come In two days I should be with you Maggie have you forgotten what it was to be together to be within reach of a look to be within hearing of each other s voice When Maggie first read this letter she felt as if her real temptation had only just begun At the entrance of the chill dark cavern we turn with unworn courage from the warm light but how when we have trodden far in the damp darkness and have begun to be faint and weary how if there is a sudden opening above us and we are invited back again to the life nourishing day The leap of natural longing from under the pressure of pain is so strong that all less immediate motives are likely to be forgotten till the pain has been escaped from For hours Maggie felt as if her struggle had been in vain For hours every other thought that she strove to summon was thrust aside by the image of Stephen waiting for the single word that would bring him to her She did not read the letter she heard him uttering it and the voice shook her with its old strange power All the day before she had been filled with the vision of a lonely future through which she must carry the burthen of regret upheld only by clinging faith And here close within her reach urging itself upon her even as a claim was another future in which hard endurance and effort were to be exchanged for easy delicious leaning on another s loving strength And yet that promise of joy in the place of sadness did not make the dire force of the temptation to Maggie It was Stephen s tone of misery it was the doubt in the justice of her own resolve that made the balance tremble and made her once start from her seat to reach the pen and paper and write Come But close upon that decisive act her mind recoiled and the sense of contradiction with her past self in her moments of strength and clearness came upon her like a pang of conscious degradation No she must wait she must pray the light that had forsaken her would come again she should feel again what she had felt when she had fled away under an inspiration strong enough to conquer agony to conquer love she should feel again what she had felt when Lucy stood by her when Philip s letter had stirred all the fibres that bound her to the calmer past She sat quite still far on into the night with no impulse to change her attitude without active force enough even for the mental act of prayer only waiting for the light that would surely come again It came with the memories that no passion could long quench the long past came back to her and with it the fountains of self renouncing pity and affection of faithfulness and resolve The words that were marked by the quiet hand in the little old book that she had long ago learned by heart rushed even to her lips and found a vent for themselves in a low murmur that was quite lost in the loud driving of the rain against the window and the loud moan and roar of the wind I have received the Cross I have received it from Thy hand I will bear it and bear it till death as Thou hast laid it upon me But soon other words rose that could find no utterance but in a sob Forgive me Stephen It will pass away You will come back to her She took up the letter held it to the candle and let it burn slowly on the hearth To morrow she would write to him the last word of parting I will bear it and bear it till death But how long it will be before death comes I am so young so healthy How shall I have patience and strength Am I to struggle and fall and repent again Has life other trials as hard for me still With that cry of self despair Maggie fell on her knees against the table and buried her sorrow stricken face Her soul went out to the Unseen Pity that would be with her to the end Surely there was something being taught her by this experience of great need and she must be learning a secret of human tenderness and long suffering that the less erring could hardly know O God if my life is to be long let me live to bless and comfort At that moment Maggie felt a startling sensation of sudden cold about her knees and feet it was water flowing under her She started up the stream was flowing under the door that led into the passage She was not bewildered for an instant she knew it was the flood The tumult of emotion she had been enduring for the last twelve hours seemed to have left a great calm in her without screaming she hurried with the candle upstairs to Bob Jakin s bedroom The door was ajar she went in and shook him by the shoulder Bob the flood is come it is in the house let us see if we can make the boats safe She lighted his candle while the poor wife snatching up her baby burst into screams and then she hurried down again to see if the waters were rising fast There was a step down into the room at the door leading from the staircase she saw that the water was already on a level with the step While she was looking something came with a tremendous crash against the window and sent the leaded panes and the old wooden framework inward in shivers the water pouring in after it It is the boat cried Maggie Bob come down to get the boats And without a moment s shudder of fear she plunged through the water which was rising fast to her knees and by the glimmering light of the candle she had left on the stairs she mounted on to the window sill and crept into the boat which was left with the prow lodging and protruding through the window Bob was not long after her hurrying without shoes or stockings but with the lanthorn in his hand Why they re both here both the boats said Bob as he got into the one where Maggie was It s wonderful this fastening isn t broke too as well as the mooring In the excitement of getting into the other boat unfastening it and mastering an oar Bob was not struck with the danger Maggie incurred We are not apt to fear for the fearless when we are companions in their danger and Bob s mind was absorbed in possible expedients for the safety of the helpless indoors The fact that Maggie had been up had waked him and had taken the lead in activity gave Bob a vague impression of her as one who would help to protect not need to be protected She too had got possession of an oar and had pushed off so as to release the boat from the overhanging window frame The water s rising so fast said Bob I doubt it ll be in at the chambers before long th house is so low I ve more mind to get Prissy and the child and the mother into the boat if I could and trusten to the water for th old house is none so safe And if I let go the boat but you he exclaimed suddenly lifting the light of his lanthorn on Maggie as she stood in the rain with the oar in her hand and her black hair streaming Maggie had no time to answer for a new tidal current swept along the line of the houses and drove both the boats out on to the wide water with a force that carried them far past the meeting current of the river In the first moments Maggie felt nothing thought of nothing but that she had suddenly passed away from that life which she had been dreading it was the transition of death without its agony and she was alone in the darkness with God The whole thing had been so rapid so dreamlike that the threads of ordinary association were broken she sank down on the seat clutching the oar mechanically and for a long while had no distinct conception of her position The first thing that waked her to fuller consciousness was the cessation of the rain and a perception that the darkness was divided by the faintest light which parted the overhanging gloom from the immeasurable watery level below She was driven out upon the flood that awful visitation of God which her father used to talk of which had made the nightmare of her childish dreams And with that thought there rushed in the vision of the old home and Tom and her mother they had all listened together O God where am I Which is the way home she cried out in the dim loneliness What was happening to them at the Mill The flood had once nearly destroyed it They might be in danger in distress her mother and her brother alone there beyond reach of help Her whole soul was strained now on that thought and she saw the long loved faces looking for help into the darkness and finding none She was floating in smooth water now perhaps far on the overflooded fields There was no sense of present danger to check the outgoing of her mind to the old home and she strained her eyes against the curtain of gloom that she might seize the first sight of her whereabout that she might catch some faint suggestion of the spot toward which all her anxieties tended Oh how welcome the widening of that dismal watery level the gradual uplifting of the cloudy firmament the slowly defining blackness of objects above the glassy dark Yes she must be out on the fields those were the tops of hedgerow trees Which way did the river lie Looking behind her she saw the lines of black trees looking before her there were none then the river lay before her She seized an oar and began to paddle the boat forward with the energy of wakening hope the dawning seemed to advance more swiftly now she was in action and she could soon see the poor dumb beasts crowding piteously on a mound where they had taken refuge Onward she paddled and rowed by turns in the growing twilight her wet clothes clung round her and her streaming hair was dashed about by the wind but she was hardly conscious of any bodily sensations except a sensation of strength inspired by mighty emotion Along with the sense of danger and possible rescue for those long remembered beings at the old home there was an undefined sense of reconcilement with her brother what quarrel what harshness what unbelief in each other can subsist in the presence of a great calamity when all the artificial vesture of our life is gone and we are all one with each other in primitive mortal needs Vaguely Maggie felt this in the strong resurgent love toward her brother that swept away all the later impressions of hard cruel offence and misunderstanding and left only the deep underlying unshakable memories of early union But now there was a large dark mass in the distance and near to her Maggie could discern the current of the river The dark mass must be yes it was saint Ogg s Ah now she knew which way to look for the first glimpse of the well known trees the gray willows the now yellowing chestnuts and above them the old roof But there was no color no shape yet all was faint and dim More and more strongly the energies seemed to come and put themselves forth as if her life were a stored up force that was being spent in this hour unneeded for any future She must get her boat into the current of the Floss else she would never be able to pass the Ripple and approach the house this was the thought that occurred to her as she imagined with more and more vividness the state of things round the old home But then she might be carried very far down and be unable to guide her boat out of the current again For the first time distinct ideas of danger began to press upon her but there was no choice of courses no room for hesitation and she floated into the current Swiftly she went now without effort more and more clearly in the lessening distance and the growing light she began to discern the objects that she knew must be the well known trees and roofs nay she was not far off a rushing muddy current that must be the strangely altered Ripple Great God there were floating masses in it that might dash against her boat as she passed and cause her to perish too soon What were those masses For the first time Maggie s heart began to beat in an agony of dread She sat helpless dimly conscious that she was being floated along more intensely conscious of the anticipated clash But the horror was transient it passed away before the oncoming warehouses of saint Ogg s She had passed the mouth of the Ripple then now she must use all her skill and power to manage the boat and get it if possible out of the current She could see now that the bridge was broken down she could see the masts of a stranded vessel far out over the watery field But no boats were to be seen moving on the river such as had been laid hands on were employed in the flooded streets With new resolution Maggie seized her oar and stood up again to paddle but the now ebbing tide added to the swiftness of the river and she was carried along beyond the bridge She could hear shouts from the windows overlooking the river as if the people there were calling to her It was not till she had passed on nearly to Tofton that she could get the boat clear of the current Then with one yearning look toward her uncle Deane s house that lay farther down the river she took to both her oars and rowed with all her might across the watery fields back toward the Mill Color was beginning to awake now and as she approached the Dorlcote fields she could discern the tints of the trees could see the old Scotch firs far to the right and the home chestnuts oh how deep they lay in the water deeper than the trees on this side the hill And the roof of the Mill where was it Those heavy fragments hurrying down the Ripple what had they meant But it was not the house the house stood firm drowned up to the first story but still firm or was it broken in at the end toward the Mill With panting joy that she was there at last joy that overcame all distress Maggie neared the front of the house At first she heard no sound she saw no object moving Her boat was on a level with the upstairs window She called out in a loud piercing voice Tom where are you Mother where are you Here is Maggie Soon from the window of the attic in the central gable she heard Tom s voice Who is it Have you brought a boat It is I Tom Maggie Where is mother She is not here she went to Garum the day before yesterday I ll come down to the lower window Alone Maggie said Tom in a voice of deep astonishment as he opened the middle window on a level with the boat Yes Tom God has taken care of me to bring me to you Get in quickly Is there no one else No said Tom stepping into the boat I fear the man is drowned he was carried down the Ripple I think when part of the Mill fell with the crash of trees and stones against it I ve shouted again and again and there has been no answer Give me the oars Maggie It was not till Tom had pushed off and they were on the wide water he face to face with Maggie that the full meaning of what had happened rushed upon his mind It came with so overpowering a force it was such a new revelation to his spirit of the depths in life that had lain beyond his vision which he had fancied so keen and clear that he was unable to ask a question They sat mutely gazing at each other Maggie with eyes of intense life looking out from a weary beaten face Tom pale with a certain awe and humiliation Thought was busy though the lips were silent and though he could ask no question he guessed a story of almost miraculous divinely protected effort But at last a mist gathered over the blue gray eyes and the lips found a word they could utter the old childish Magsie Maggie could make no answer but a long deep sob of that mysterious wondrous happiness that is one with pain As soon as she could speak she said We will go to Lucy Tom we ll go and see if she is safe and then we can help the rest Tom rowed with untired vigor and with a different speed from poor Maggie s The boat was soon in the current of the river again and soon they would be at Tofton Park House stands high up out of the flood said Maggie Perhaps they have got Lucy there Nothing else was said a new danger was being carried toward them by the river Some wooden machinery had just given way on one of the wharves and huge fragments were being floated along The sun was rising now and the wide area of watery desolation was spread out in dreadful clearness around them in dreadful clearness floated onward the hurrying threatening masses A large company in a boat that was working its way along under the Tofton houses observed their danger and shouted Get out of the current But that could not be done at once and Tom looking before him saw death rushing on them Huge fragments clinging together in fatal fellowship made one wide mass across the stream It is coming Maggie Tom said in a deep hoarse voice loosing the oars and clasping her The next instant the boat was no longer seen upon the water and the huge mass was hurrying on in hideous triumph But soon the keel of the boat reappeared a black speck on the golden water The boat reappeared but brother and sister had gone down in an embrace never to be parted living through again in one supreme moment the days when they had clasped their little hands in love and roamed the daisied fields together Conclusion Nature repairs her ravages repairs them with her sunshine and with human labor The desolation wrought by that flood had left little visible trace on the face of the earth five years after The fifth autumn was rich in golden cornstacks rising in thick clusters among the distant hedgerows the wharves and warehouses on the Floss were busy again with echoes of eager voices with hopeful lading and unlading And every man and woman mentioned in this history was still living except those whose end we know Nature repairs her ravages but not all The uptorn trees are not rooted again the parted hills are left scarred if there is a new growth the trees are not the same as the old and the hills underneath their green vesture bear the marks of the past rending To the eyes that have dwelt on the past there is no thorough repair Dorlcote Mill was rebuilt And Dorlcote churchyard where the brick grave that held a father whom we know was found with the stone laid prostrate upon it after the flood had recovered all its grassy order and decent quiet Near that brick grave there was a tomb erected very soon after the flood for two bodies that were found in close embrace and it was visited at different moments by two men who both felt that their keenest joy and keenest sorrow were forever buried there One of them visited the tomb again with a sweet face beside him but that was years after The other was always solitary His great companionship was among the trees of the Red Deeps where the buried joy seemed still to hover like a revisiting spirit The tomb bore the names of Tom and Maggie Tulliver and below the names it was written In their death they were not divided End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of
