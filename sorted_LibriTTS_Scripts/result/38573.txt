THE LITTLE PRACTICAL JOKE Don t be a silly ass Layton Do I look the sort of man to play such a fool s trick My dear fellow there s no silly ass about it You a lonely bachelor and not badly off desirous of settling down into quiet domestic life would like to find a young lady of refined and cultured tastes who would meet you with a view to matrimony I ll take my oath you are as ready as this gentleman is to swear you will make an excellent husband kind domesticated and Further speech was checked by a well directed cushion which descended plump upon the speaker s bronzed and grinning countenance momentarily obliterating grin and countenance alike whilst a shout of laughter went up from the other occupants of the smoking room Jack my boy Mernside wasn t far wrong when he defined you as a silly ass drawled a man who leant against the mantelpiece smoking a cigarette and looking with amused eyes at the squirming figure under the large cushion what unutterable drivel are you reading Is the Sunday Recorder responsible for that silly rot The Sunday Recorder is responsible for what you are pleased to call silly rot answered the young man who had now flung aside the cushion and sat upright looking at his two elders with laughing eyes whilst he clutched a newspaper in one hand and tried to smooth his rumpled hair with the other The Sunday Recorder has a matrimonial column and knowing poor old Rupert to be a lonely bachelor not badly off and desirous of settling down into quiet domestic life et cetera et cetera see the printed page he waved the journal over his head I merely wished to recommend my respected cousin to insert an advertisement on these lines in next Sunday s paper Because some wretched bounders choose to advertise for wives in the Sunday papers I don t see where I come in said a quiet and singularly musical voice that of the third man in the room he who a moment before had flung the large cushion at young Layton He was sitting in an armchair drawn close to the glowing fire his hands clasped under his head his face full of languid amusement turned towards the grinning youth upon the sofa Without being precisely a handsome man Rupert Mernside s was a striking personality and his face not one to be overlooked even in a crowd There was strength in his well cut mouth and jaw and the rather deeply set grey eyes held humour and a certain masterfulness which dominated less powerful characters than his own In those eyes there was a charm which neutralised his somewhat severe and rugged features but in Rupert Mernside s voice lay his greatest attraction and a lady of his acquaintance had once been heard to say that with such a voice as his he could induce anyone to follow him round the world Why he had remained so long a bachelor had long been matter for speculation not only to the feminine portion of the community but also to his men friends but thirty five still found Rupert Mernside unmarried and the manoeuvres of match making mothers and of daughters trained to play up to their mothers tactics had hitherto failed to lead him in the desired direction My dear Rupert his young cousin said solemnly after a pause you are a bachelor the fact is painfully self evident you have enough money to settle down and become domesticated There are hundreds no thousands of young women in the world who would meet you with a view to matrimony It seems a crying shame that you should waste your sweetness on the desert air when you might be blooming in a fair lady s garden You utter young rotter Mernside ejaculated laughing as he rose and stretched himself if you are so keen on matrimonial advertisements why not put one in on your own account Awful sport Layton ejaculated think of the piles of letters you would get from every kind of marriageable woman old and young And you might arrange to meet any number of them at different places and have no end of a ripping time You only have to ask them to meet you with a view to matrimony the matrimony needn t come off unless both parties are satisfied Silly ass Mernside exclaimed again with a laugh that mitigated the words one of these days you ll find yourself in some unpleasantly tangled web my boy if you play the goat over matrimonial advertisements Better leave well alone and come up to Handwell Manor with me Cicely wants a message taken to the Dysons Cicely s messages are like the poor always with us the younger man answered flippantly no thank you Rupert on this genial and pleasant November afternoon when you can t see half a mile ahead of you for the mist and the country lanes are two feet deep in mud I prefer the smoking room fire Besides I have letters to write I ll go with you Mernside the man who had been lounging against the mantelpiece straightened himself and flung away the end of his cigarette Cicely won t be down till tea time she is spending the afternoon in the nursery looking after the small girl Confounded nuisance for her that the nurse had to go off in a hurry like this for my respected sister was not intended by nature for the care of children Fortunate she has only one Mernside answered what would she have done with a large family party Managed by hook or by crook to get a party of nurses and nurserymaids to mind them laughed the other man she s the dearest little soul alive but Cicely never ought to have been a mother though I shouldn t say that excepting to you two who are members of the family and know of what stuff Cicely and I are made Mernside and Layton joined in the laughter and the younger man said lazily Cicely s just Cicely you can t imagine her less perfect than she is and you Wilfrid being merely her brother are not entitled to give an opinion about her Rupert and I as cousins see her in a truer perspective Bless her sweet heart She makes a perfect chatelaine for this delectable castle and the small heiress couldn t have a sweeter guardian Hear hear Mernside murmured touching Layton s shoulder with a kindly almost caressing touch as he and his cousin Lord Wilfrid Staynes went out of the room leaving the young man in sole possession Left alone Layton stretched himself again yawned lighted a cigarette and strolling to the window looked at the not very inviting prospect outside Bramwell Castle stood on the slope of a hill and on even moderately fine days the view commanded not only by the window of the smoking room but by every window on that side of the house was one of the wildest and most beautiful in the county But on this Sunday afternoon in November nothing more was visible than the broad gravel terrace immediately below the house and a grass lawn that sloped abruptly from the terrace and was dotted with trees Everything beyond the lawn was swallowed up in a white mist that drifted over the tree tops and clung to the dank grass blotting out completely all trace of the park that swept downwards from the lawn and of the great landscape which stretched from the woodlands to the far away hills Park woods and hills were visible to Jack Layton only in the eyes of his imagination he could see none of them and with a shiver and a shrug of the shoulders he turned back into the warm fire lit room Thanks to his close relationship to Lady Cicely Redesdale the mistress of the house to whom he had always been more of younger brother than cousin he had carte blanche to be at the Castle whenever he chose and to treat the house as if it were in reality what he assuredly made of it his actual home Both to him and to Cicely s other cousin Rupert Mernside the late John Redesdale her husband had extended the fullest and most warm hospitality and since his death it had still remained a recognised thing that the two cousins should spend their weekends at Bramwell whenever Lady Cicely and her little daughter were there The kindly millionaire who had married the lovely but impecunious Cicely Staynes one of the numerous daughters of the Earl of Netherhall possessed a host of hospitable instincts and the Castle had opened its gates wide to Cicely s relations and friends Only one reservation had been made by honest John Redesdale No man or woman of doubtful reputation or damaged character was allowed to be the guest of his wife and the shadier members of Society never set foot within any house of which the millionaire was master Jack Layton strolling idly now across the smoking room whose panelled walls and carved furniture had been Redesdale s pride and joy glanced up at the mantelpiece over which hung a portrait of the dead man Poor old John the young man reflected as he kicked a coal back into its place in the fire he was one of the best chaps that ever lived even if he hadn t many good looks with which to bless himself He looked up again at the plain but kindly features of the man in the portrait and a smile crossed his pleasant young face as his eyes met the pictured eyes above him It wasn t a love match of course his thoughts ran on at least I don t suppose Cicely loved the dear old fellow Well he was thirty years her senior so who could wonder But they were jolly happy for all that John worshipped the ground her pretty feet walked upon and he was her master without ever letting her feel his hand through the glove Cicely wants a master all women do want a master Jack wagged his head sagely when his thoughts reached this point Having attained to the ripe age of twenty five he felt he had plumbed the nature of woman to its lowest depths and Cicely was lucky to find a master who could give her a place like this He sauntered away from the fireplace and next surveyed the well stocked bookcases but although they contained every variety of literature nothing he saw appealed to his fastidious taste of the moment and yawning afresh he once more picked up the Sunday Recorder which he had flung upon the floor That someone who is perennially ready to turn idle hands to account was watching over this idle youth on that November afternoon may on the whole be taken for granted for as Jack s blue eyes ran down the columns of the paper a sudden mischievous light sprang into them a low laugh broke from his lips By Jove he exclaimed What sport what ripping sport Why on earth didn t I think of it before And as I start for a four months trip with Dundas on Saturday I shan t have to pay the piper so to speak yet awhile In fact by the time I come back good old Rupert may have forgotten the little practical joke Whilst he soliloquized he was making his way towards the writing table where having seated himself he drew towards him a blank sheet of paper and began to write a letter glancing frequently at the Sunday Recorder beside him An expansive grin lightened his features as he wrote and at intervals he chuckled softly to himself murmuring under his breath Poor old Rupert If only I could be there when he gets the answers But one can t have everything he went on philosophically whilst addressing an envelope to the Editor of the Sunday Recorder it will be pure joy to think of the dear soul s dismay horror and disgust Tis a mad world my masters and oh to see our Rupert s face when the letters pour in For they will pour in During this rapid soliloquy he was writing a second letter which gave him less trouble and needed less thought than the first Indeed it ran very briefly DEAR SIR I am desired to ask if you will be good enough to forward all letters in response to the enclosed advertisement to R M c o your newspaper to two hundred Termyn Street S W Yours faithfully J LAYTON With a final chuckle the young man put both letters into an envelope and having stamped it went whistling from the house and through the park to the village to post the missive himself at the little village post office Quiet and cultivated gentleman of good family and means is anxious to meet a young lady of good birth who needs a home et cetera et cetera et cetera he murmured as he walked slowly back to the Castle through the dripping November mist Oh what sport what utterly ripping sport CHAPTER II MUMMY S BABA DAT S ALL In the great Free Library of a crowded London district the gas burnt dimly the yellow fog of a November morning crept even into the big room and the few readers shivered a little in its cold clamminess At this early hour for the building had only just opened its doors on a Monday morning merely a scattered number of men and women were to be seen in the place and those who were there clustered round the advertisement columns of the newspapers Both men and women alike were a sorry looking crew and the sad words out of work were stamped upon them all Their clothing bore the marks of much wear and tear their faces were worn and in the eyes of each of them was that strained expression that rises from much looking for that which never comes Old and young men were there searching the long columns of the papers for work that might suit their pressing needs old and young women were there too women whose faces gave eloquent testimony to their hard fight with fortune whose eyes glanced hungrily along the printed lines whose hands tremblingly wrote down this or that address which might by some merciful chance give them if not exactly what they wanted at any rate that which would ensure their earning a pittance however scanty Almost every member of the forlorn group eyed every other member suspiciously with furtive glances that seemed to say If you are lucky enough to get a job out of those columns then I shall fail to get one We are cutting each other s throats here Your success is my failure And as each one finished jotting down the addresses that were likely to be of use he or she moved silently away from the library speaking no word to the rest like cowering animals who having received a bone or the promise of a bone slink away from their fellows fearful lest even the small thing they have gained should be snatched from them The greater number amongst the searchers for work consisted of those who for want of a better title may be described as belonging to the middle classes They were neither the very poor in the recognised acceptation of the words though heaven knows they were poor enough neither could they be classed amongst artisans or mechanics Their appearance would lead an onlooker to suppose that the men were accustomed to office work of some description and that the women were governesses companions or

none	none	 lady housekeepers all respectable all possessing certain ideals of life and propriety all struggling to maintain the degree of gentility which would keep them above the high water mark of degradation A girl who stood a little apart from the rest looked round the dimly lit room with pitiful eyes and a shudder ran through her slight frame as she watched the faces and forms of these women who were no longer young but who were yet still engaged in this hand to hand fight with destitution The girl was young it was impossible to suppose that more than twenty years had gone over her head though the deep shadows under her eyes and the lines of anxiety about her mouth might have made a casual observer regard her as an older woman Like the rest of her sex who scanned the advertisement columns she was dressed in clothes which had plainly seen better days much better days But whereas some of the other women had already begun to drift into untidiness and into the slovenly ways which mark the first step along a downward road this girl was exquisitely neat from head to foot Her hat in spite of its age was well brushed her threadbare coat and skirt were tidy and showed no traces of dirt or grease her gloves though they were white at the tips had no holes and there was no sign of neglect or disorder in the arrangement of the dark hair that showed in soft dusky curls below her hat Poor things Oh poor things was her thought as she looked at the sad string of humanity filing its slow way to the door Some of them have been every day for weeks and they are getting older every day And the older one gets the harder it is to find work Some day I shall be like that old and tired and worn out and then work will be more difficult to get than it is now and I can t get it even now when I am young The thoughts that had begun in sheer pity for those other battlers with the waves of this troublesome world ended in a shuddering realisation of her own position and not only of her position for the moment but of the future that stretched inimitably before her across the years She Christina Moore was only twenty and in all human probability another sixty years of life might be hers for she dimly remembered hearing her mother say that both she and her husband belonged to long lived families That they two had been cut off in the prime of life by a virulent epidemic of typhoid fever that swept the village like a plague did not alter the fact that they came of races famous for octogenarians and Christina the last of two long lines of ancestors shivered anew at the thought of the weary weary years of struggle that might still lie before her It was seldom that she was assailed by such depressing reflections her youth had a way as youth has of asserting itself and rebounding from its own despair and there was an abundance of pluck behind those queer green eyes of hers and no lack of resolution in her small square chin But the fog outside the chilly atmosphere of the big library whose fires were barely alight and the sight of the same unemployed men and women who for weeks past had as it were dogged her footsteps all combined this morning to send Christina s spirits down to zero Matters had not been improved by the calculations over which she had busied herself before leaving her lodgings an hour earlier Whilst eating her dry bread and drinking tea without milk because both milk and butter were luxuries she no longer dared to give herself she had written out her pitiful accounts upon a half sheet of paper and the result of the reckoning had given her a terrible feeling of desperation For two years since her parents death she had occupied the post of nursery governess in the family of a missus Donaldson to whom her mother had once shown some trifling kindness But three months earlier these people had left England for Canada and no longer required her services and Christina untrained to any profession with a few pounds in hand and with nothing but a strong personality and an innate love for little children to offer as her stock in trade found herself amongst the hundreds of other unemployed just a waif in a great city Relations as far as she knew she had none Her father had been an only child Her mother had cut herself off from her own people by marrying against their consent and Christina was even unaware of who they were or to what part of the country they belonged Long ago she had grasped the fact that she was alone in the world and when the Donaldsons went away she had no intimate friends in the old country two years of life with them in a London suburb having effectually cut her off from the very few acquaintances she had left behind in the Devonshire village where her parents died Alone in the world with no work after nearly three months of fruitless search for it and with her small stock of money growing beautifully less each day it was no wonder that on this morning in November Christina Moore s heart sank in despair Save for one or two men still busily engaged in extracting addresses from the papers she was alone in the library before she herself began her daily search along those monotonous columns whose lines seemed to her tired eyes to run into one another and become lost in an infinite haze So many people appeared to require nursery governesses companions and mothers helps and yet as bitter experience taught her there were many more applicants for the posts than there were posts to fill and it was with a half hearted sense of intense discouragement that she noted down some of the addresses She even wrote down some that she had hitherto despised those who offered only a home and no salary in return for services for as she reflected despondently even to have a roof over one s head and meals to eat is better than to have no lodging or food and no money to pay for either Having glanced down the advertisements in the chief dailies her hand idly turned the pages of one of the Sunday papers close by and her eyes glanced down them more with the idea of distracting her thoughts than with any conception that she might find anything there that would be of use to her And her lips parted in a smile as she read in large print MATRIMONIAL NEWS How funny she mused whilst she read that a gentleman of means wished to find a lady of fortune who would take pity on his loneliness or that a lady no longer young but still handsome wished to meet a gentleman with a moderate income with a view to marriage How funny how very funny she mused again then paused suddenly her glance riveted to a sentence that caught and held her attention almost against her will Quiet and cultivated gentleman of means so the paragraph ran is anxious to meet a young lady of good birth who needs a home No fortune is necessary but marriage may be agreed upon if both parties are mutually satisfied Reply by letter to R M Box forty thousand four Sunday Recorder Office Fleet Street E C Over the girl s white face there slowly spread a stain of vivid colour into her eyes crept an odd light She drew the paper more closely into her hands reading and re reading the paragraph until every word of it was imprinted upon her mind Young lady who needs a home no fortune necessary she murmured Oh if only it didn t seem so cold blooded and horrid what a way out it might be Only it seems so so mercenary and not what I always thought of when I was silly and dreamt things her musings ran on Once I dreamt about a fairy prince who would just come and make me love him and he and I would be all the world to each other But of course one couldn t be all the world to a person one had arranged to meet through a newspaper Another smile broke over her face and when she smiled Christina s face was very sweet It may be just some dreadful trap to catch a silly girl she reflected sagely and if if I did really think of answering it I should have to be very careful what I said and where I arranged to meet R M Of course I shan t really answer it at all only if I did and if he were nice and if it all came right there wouldn t be any more of this dreadful struggle She noted the address of this advertisement amongst the others in her little pocket book and then made her way out of the library and trudged homewards through the yellow murk buttoning her very inadequate coat tightly about her and shiveringly speculating whether if she really answered R M s advertisement there might be a chance of obtaining clothing more fitted to resist the penetrating chill of a November fog Her own small room looked dingier than usual when she entered it and it was so full of fog and damp that she rolled a blanket round her before lighting a candle and seating herself at the tiny table to answer some of the advertisements she had copied The room was bare of all but the most necessary furniture A camp bedstead stood against the wall whose paper was of that indeterminate drabness affected by lodging house keepers a deal table occupied the centre of the room with the common cane chair on which Christina sat and a painted chest of drawers nearly blocked up the one tiny window There was no wash hand stand a cracked white basin and a still more cracked jug stood upon the top of the drawers a looking glass of ancient and battered appearance hung over the mantelpiece and an open cupboard in the wall served Christina as sideboard and larder combined Beside the bed was a narrow strip of much faded carpet but of comfort and homeliness the room showed no trace whatever save in the tiny touches of home the girl had herself striven to impart to it by hanging on the walls one or two sketches of the Devonshire village she loved and by putting on the mantelpiece a few treasured photographs But her best endeavours had failed to make the room other than a most dreary and dispiriting abode and the view from the window of the backs of other houses looming darkly through the fog was not calculated to lift the cloud of despair that for the moment had settled heavily upon her She felt listlessly disinclined to state her qualifications as nursery governess or mother s help to the various ladies who hankered after such commodities Involuntarily but continually her thoughts returned to that paragraph from the Sunday Recorder which was not only engraved upon her mind but which she had actually copied also into her book Quiet and cultivated gentleman of means is anxious to meet a young lady of good birth who needs a home No fortune is necessary At that point in her reading Christina paused No fortune is necessary she said aloud in an oddly deprecating voice R M whoever he may be only asks for a young lady of good birth who needs a home Well she turned her eyes towards the foggy roofs just visible outside her dirty window panes well as far as I know I am of good birth even though father only taught music and some people seem to look down on musicians And I certainly need a home Her glance left the gloomy world without and went ruefully round the scarcely less gloomy prospect within And if I suited R M perhaps perhaps he would be good to me Should I suit him I wonder I m not pretty and certainly not amusing and I m dreadfully shabby and nearly as poor as it is possible to be There is not one single thing to recommend me She pushed back her chair and rising from the table moved slowly to the mantel piece over which hung the tarnished glass whose powers of reflecting objects satisfactorily had long since departed Into this unpromising mirror poor little Christina holding the candle far above her head peered long and earnestly her small white face looking all the whiter because of the background of yellow fog her eyes seeming more green than was their wont because of the dark shadows that underlay them She had thrown off her hat and the soft masses of her hair lay in curly confusion about her head It was a shapely little head and particularly well put on but these were points of which Christina took no special account being intent on finding beauties in her face and failing to notice that there was anything admirable in the turn of her neck in the poise of her firm chin and in the straightforward glance of her eyes If R M met me casually in the street he wouldn t look at me twice no man would she exclaimed with a sigh as she turned away from the glass I am horribly ordinary The only thing is if I could screw up my courage to answer him and then to meet him he might like to find a girl who didn t want anything but a quiet home who would be satisfied to go without gaiety or amusement She sighed again and a wistful look crept into her eyes I haven t really ever had any fun so I shouldn t miss it and I could just try to make a happy home for R M if that is all he wants And after all she went on still speaking aloud there isn t any harm in answering his letter It may all come to nothing and yet it might be worth while and it almost seems presidential that I just happened to see that paragraph in the Sunday Recorder The letter she sat down to write as the outcome of all these conflicting meditations was the most difficult she had ever written in her young life and before it was finished and finally consigned to its envelope she had torn up many sheets of paper and allowed fully two hours of the morning to pass by Twelve o clock was chiming from all the clocks in the neighbourhood when with her answers to some of the other advertisements in her hand she once more pinned on her hat and ran downstairs to the post The fog had thickened considerably during the morning and Christina found the street lamps alight tiny points of brightness set high above the prevailing gloom and producing very little effect upon the darkness Indeed there was something almost bewildering about those far off lights they seemed to heighten rather than diminish the all pervading blackness which deepened every moment The girl walked slowly feeling her way along the area railings and guiding herself as far as possible by the rumble of traffic along the roadway though the confusion of sounds made even this guidance a very uncertain one Drivers shouted horses slipped and stumbled and the shrill voices of boys carrying flaring torches added to the pandemonium Earlier in the morning the fog had merely been of the familiar yellow variety known to every Londoner It was now a black and total darkness that seemed to engulf the world To cross the road to the pillar box was a matter of no small difficulty but Christina with a dogged determination not to be outwitted by the elements stepped off the kerb and into the seething mass of carts cabs and other vehicles that jostled and struggled with one another in apparently inextricable confusion On the far side of the street she plunged into a comparatively quiet square where the fog had lifted somewhat and was no longer of such Cimmerian blackness but merely a drifting and bewildering white mist The pillar box at the corner loomed faintly through it and Christina had just dropped her packet of letters into it when there struck upon her ears the soft cry of a little child There was such a note of fear of lonely misery in that soft cry that Christina a child lover to the core of her being paused and listened intently Everything about her was very still the square was a quiet one though separated only by a short street from a main thoroughfare and excepting for the distant noise of traffic and shouting nothing was to be heard until again the little whimpering cry became audible on Christina s right What is it the girl said gently Don t be frightened dear I ll take care of you and as she spoke she heard a gasp of relief and a shaking childish voice exclaimed Baba s most drefful fightened please take Baba home But where is Baba Christina was beginning cheerily when through the fog she caught sight of a tiny figure coming quickly towards her and stooping down she gathered close into her arms a little child of perhaps three years old a little child who clung to her with a desperate terrified clutch lifting a tear stained face to hers Take Baba home the baby voice wailed again and as the fog rolled back a little more Christina saw that the child was no street waif but obviously the daintily clad darling of some great house Her golden head was bare and the tangle of curls was like a frame about the lovely little face whose great blue eyes looked appealingly into Christina s own A red woollen cloak hung over the child s shoulders but as the cloak fell back Christina saw that her frock was chiefly fashioned of exquisite filmy lace and that a string of pearls was fastened round the little white throat Where is Baba s home she questioned softly lifting the child right into her arms and kissing the flower like face on which the tears still lay like dewdrops in the heart of a rose Tell me where you live sweetheart and I will take you home Baba doesn t know where she lives the child shook her yellow curls and her big eyes filled again with tears Baba s awful drefful fightened The door was open and Baba did just run out to see the pretty horses and then it was all black and Baba was lost I don t think Baba ought to have come out by herself in a fog Christina said a gentle reproof in her tones and now we must try to find out where your home is little girl Tell me what your name is besides Baba Baba Mummy s Baba dat s all the baby answered with a conclusive shutting of her pretty mouth Baba s forgot her other name she s only just Mummy s Baba But Baba what Christina said patiently walking slowly along the square the child in her arms Try to remember your other name my sweet then I can take you safe home to mummy and nurse Baba hasn t got no nurse nurse s gone away Mummy minds Baba now and Baba can t remember her other name She s got a bone in her head quoth the baby smiling deliciously into Christina s troubled face and evidently paraphrasing some former servant s excuses Baba likes you pretty lady come home with Baba I wish I could Christina said gravely feeling rather helpless as she looked from the child in her arms to the stately houses in the square and back again I wonder where you live you queer mite and how I am going to find out who are your belongings They are probably moving heaven and earth at this moment to find you The baby laughed She did not follow more than half Christina s words but her infantile fancy had been caught by the girl s gentle manner and motherly ways and she put two dimpled arms round her rescuer s neck and rubbed her face confidently against Christina s white cheeks Baba s not fightened any more she murmured contentedly you just take Baba home and we ll find mummy and then Baba will be all right Yes it will be all right when we find home and mummy Christina answered with a short laugh but her arm tightened round the soft little body her lips pressed themselves against the tangled curls and all the time she pursued her slow way along the square hoping that so small a person could not have travelled very far and that presently someone in pursuit of her would put in an appearance They had gone the length of the square and down the line of houses along one of its sides when all at once the baby uttered a shout of triumph There s James over there she exclaimed now Baba can see her own house James James she cried excitedly and Christina saw that on the side of the square at right angles to them a footman stood on the doorstep looking distractedly to right and left of him At the sound of the uplifted baby voice he left his post at the door and ran quickly up to Christina who had paused to await his arrival That s my dear James the child cried and with the easy fickleness of her years she unclasped her arms from Christina s neck and held them out to the footman Baba was lost she said to him confidingly This lady finded Baba and brought her home The footman took the baby into his arms and turned a scared face to Christina She ve just been missed he said breathlessly must have run out when the door was open and we was all in a taking Where did you find her miss I m sure it s very kind of you to have brought her home She was on the far side of the square and very frightened in the fog I am so glad she is safe Baba quite safe now Baba going home with James good bye pretty lady and waving her hand to Christina the small girl was carried away in the arms of the breathless James who was still too distracted to reflect that his mistress might wish to thank the young lady who had brought back the child What a dear wee thing Christina reflected as she wended her way back to her lodgings I wonder who she is Somebody important if she lives here I wish then she sighed and fell to wondering whether anything would result from all the answers to the advertisements she had just posted I m glad I didn t post the one I wrote to R M she said to herself now I can think over it all day long and if I haven t changed my mind by then perhaps I will re write it and post it by the last post But I am not sure whether I shall be brave enough to do it CHAPTER III ONE OF THE BEST THINGS LEFT The chambers in Jermyn Street occupied by Rupert Mernside had a character which seemed to reflect their owner Perhaps all rooms in a more or less degree are reflections of those who live in them human beings whether consciously or unconsciously stamp their personalities upon their surroundings and create their distinctive atmospheres even in hired lodgings Rupert s rooms filled as they were with the furniture he had from time to time picked up the walls hung with pictures his fastidious taste had chosen the bookcases filled with his own special collection of books were to those with eyes to see a mirror of their master s nature Simplicity was the keynote of the whole There were no expensive hangings no luxurious rugs or heavily upholstered chairs and couches there was nothing of what Mernside himself would have described as frippery nothing effeminate or over dainty Matting with here and there a soft coloured rug covered the floor of the sitting room the walls tinted a pale apricot yellow were hung with water colour sketches each one of which bore the mark of a master hand the bookcases were of carved oak as were the one or two tables whilst the chairs of a severely simple pattern and even the few armchairs spoke rather of solid comfort than of any undue luxury Upon the breakfast table pushed near the window stood a bowl of chrysanthemums touched into jewelled beauty by a faint ray of November sunlight Seeing the sunlight on the rich coloured blossoms Rupert smiled as he entered the sitting room a week after his return from Bramwell Castle It was not his habit to fill his rooms with flowers he had a fancy that such a custom savoured of womanishness but Cicely his pretty little cousin had rifled the greenhouse for him with her own hands and Cicely s fashion of giving would have made even a dandelion a charming and acceptable gift Mernside was early that morning and he had seated himself in front of the silver coffee pot and covered dishes before Courtfield his irreproachable servant brought in the letters Good Lord man his master exclaimed as the salver was handed to him those letters can t possibly all be for me and he eyed the huge pile with the disfavour of one who regards a letter merely as a rather tiresome piece of business which must perforce be answered Well sir I should gather they were all for you Courtfield answered respectfully whilst his master gathered the packet of envelopes into his two hands I thought myself at first that there must be some mistake seeing that they are only addressed in initials But the number is correct sir By Jove Mernside exclaimed gazing with stupefied eyes at the unprecedented batch of correspondence and observing that every letter bore the initials only R M and had been forwarded to him from a newspaper office Courtfield noiselessly left the room but his master s coffee remained in the pot and his breakfast untasted whilst he sat and stared with a petrified stare at the pile of unopened letters with their extraordinarily unfamiliar address A dusky flush mounted to his forehead and he turned over one of the letters distastefully as though its very touch were odious to him I am not in the habit of being addressed by initials only he muttered nor of corresponding through newspapers the wretched things are probably not meant for me at all unless it s some confounded hoax he added after a pause at the same moment tearing open the top letter of the pile one addressed in an untidy uneducated handwriting Good heavens he exclaimed pushing back his chair and staring down at the letter he unfolded with the disgusted stare of one who sees something unexpectedly horrible is the woman mad or am I mad or what does it mean His eyes travelled quickly down the written page the large sprawling writing imprinting itself upon his brain DEAR SIR so the epistle ran Having seen your advertisement in yesterday s Sunday Recorder I beg to say that I should be pleased to enter into correspondence with you with a view to meeting et cetera Am twenty one tall and said to be elegant Some call me pretty Have large blue eyes fair hair and a good complexion Am domesticated and sweet tempered Would send photograph if desired Yours truly ROSALIE PS Should be pleased to cheer your loneliness Mernside read this effusion to the end then one word only and that a forcible one broke from his lips and with grimly set mouth and eyes grown suddenly steely he began to open and read one after another of the other letters his expression becoming sterner and more grim as he laid each one down in turn My opinion of women is not enhanced by my morning s correspondence he reflected cynically during the course of his reading could one have believed there were so many silly women in the world or so many plain ones and with a short laugh he picked up two photographs and looked with scornful scrutiny at the wholly unattractive features of the ladies of uncertain age and quite certain lack of beauty Before he had waded half through the packet of letters his table was strewn with his correspondence and the look on his face was one which as his best friends would have known indicated no amiable frame of mind Domesticated Would make a lonely man intensely happy Only long for a quiet home such as you suggest Such as I suggest I Mernside looked wildly round him Do I appear to be in search of a quiet home he exclaimed apostrophising the pictures on the walls do I want a domesticated female Am considered pretty oh are you my good young woman You can t write a civilised letter that s certain I have a slender income of my own amply sufficient for my modest wants but I gather you do not require a fortune with the lady only a companion for your loneliness A fortune with the lady I don t require the lady thank you Rupert soliloquised picking out sentences from the letters as he read them and flung them one by one upon the pile I have been lonely for so long myself that I can fully understand what a lonely man feels I am no longer in my first youth but I have a heart overflowing with tenderness Your happiness would be my first my only care et cetera et cetera Pshaw what tommy rot All my friends say I am cheerful I have often been called a little ray of sunshine Rupert lay back in his chair and shouted with sudden laughter I would make your home a heaven of bliss Oh Good lord Good lord quoth the unhappy reader who in heaven s name has played this confounded practical joke upon me And what am I to do with these abominable letters and photographs I should like to burn the lot but oh hang it all the silly women have taken some rotten hoax for earnest and he paused as though struck by a sudden recollection then bounced out of his chair with a good round expletive That young ass Jack Layton I ll take my oath he was at the bottom of this tomfoolery Wasn t he reading some matrimonial humbug out of wait by Jove it was the Sunday Recorder and without more ado Mernside strode across the room and rang the bell Get me a copy of the Sunday Recorder of the day before yesterday at once he said curtly when Courtfield appeared As soon as the man had vanished he returned to the table gathered up the letters he had read and thrust them into the bureau near the fireplace and by the time Courtfield came back with the paper in his hand his master was decorously eating a poached egg and deliberately opening the nineteenth or twentieth letter of his morning mail There was little deliberation in his movements when alone once more he feverishly turned the pages of the Sunday Recorder until his eyes fell on the words Matrimonial Bureau Yes there it was The wretched thing seemed to leap into sight as though it were alive and to his disordered vision the lines appeared to be twice the size of the ordinary print Quiet and cultivated gentleman of means who is very lonely is anxious to meet a young lady of good birth who needs a home No fortune is necessary but marriage may be agreed upon if both parties are mutually satisfied Oh may it indeed Mernside said scathingly flinging the paper upon the floor A young lady of good birth His thoughts went back to the letters he had just been perusing most of them ill written many mis spelt some genteel some sentimental but all bearing the unmistakable stamp of having been penned by the underbred and the vulgar A young lady of good birth Again he reflected grimly continuing to eat his breakfast and to open letter after letter mechanically expending over their contents a force of language which would greatly have surprised the writers could they have heard it Not one of these good women has the most elementary conception what the word lady means No lady would be likely to answer such an advertisement his thoughts continued contemptuously as he picked up the last letter of the pile and glanced idly at the writing of the address That writing held his attention it was different from the others yes it was certainly different It did not sprawl it was not exaggerated or affected it was merely a round simple girlish hand with unmistakable character in the well formed letters and clean strokes And when he had drawn out the contents of the envelope and read them slowly some of the grim lines about his mouth faded away a softer look came into his eyes This is different he said very different and for the second time he read the terse phrases c o missus Cole Newsagent one hundred Cartney Street S W DEAR SIR I should not have answered your advertisement but that I cannot find work I need a home very much If I could make things better for somebody else who is lonely I should be very pleased I am not at all pretty or clever but I can cook a little and I can sew Yours truly C M I am twenty Poor little girl Rupert murmured if this is genuine I am sorry for C M She is the only one of the lot who writes like a lady and the only one who does not suggest a meeting or actually appoint a meeting place Those are points in her favour But had I ever any intention of marrying I should not make my matrimonial arrangements through the medium of a newspaper Each writer of the letters which had so disturbed Mernside at breakfast time received a few hours later a short note and the wording of all the notes was identical DEAR MADAM I regret that both you and I should have been the victims of a hoax The advertisement in the Sunday Recorder was inserted without my knowledge or consent Regretting any annoyance this may cause you Yours faithfully R M But when having laboured through the mass of Rosalies Violets Lilians and Hildas he finally reached the little note signed C M Mernside paused I don t think I can let this little girl know she has been the victim of a hoax he mused a pitiful tenderness creeping about his heart as he thought of the girl who was without work or home the others are fairly tough skinned I am ready to swear This one he looked again at the round characteristic handwriting the simple phrases this one did not make up her mind to write such a letter excepting under stress of circumstances I am sure of that This one is different And if that incorrigible young ass Jack Layton hadn t started on a yachting cruise last week I should jolly well like to give him a thrashing Feeling the need as he himself expressed it of a balloon full of fresh air after his distasteful occupation of the morning Rupert went out at about eleven o clock taking with him the pile of letters he had to post Can t leave them for Courtfield s inquisitive eyes he muttered Good chap as he is Courtfield would think I had gone raving mad if he saw all these things addressed to Christian names and initials I ll get rid of the horrors and then see if Margaret can take the taste of them away from me The letters posted he made his way briskly along Piccadilly and across the Park to a quiet road in Bayswater where he stopped before a small detached house standing a little back from the pavement in its own garden His ring at the bell brought to the door a middle aged servant whose plain but kindly face expanded into a smile when she saw him He was evidently a frequent and welcome visitor for to his cheery Well Elizabeth how are things this morning she answered with another smile We ve had a bad two days sir but missus Stanforth is better now She is downstairs sir and opening a door on the right of the tiny hall she ushered Rupert into a long narrow room whose windows at either end gave it an unusual look of brightness and sunshine A piano took up a large share of one wall and over the piano hung some fine photographs of Old Masters chiefly of the Italian school The fireplace was flanked by bookshelves and drawn close to one of these was a couch on which lay a woman of such rare and startling beauty that Mernside familiar as her face was to him caught his breath as he entered and for a moment stood still looking silently down at her Her cheeks were very white but it was the whiteness of a pure white rose and gave one no sense of ill health although there was about her a certain air of fragility Her hair soft and dark waved back from her forehead in dusky masses that made just the right background for her exquisitely chiselled features and for the eyes that seemed to concentrate in themselves all the loveliness of her face They were wonderful eyes dark deep unfathomable with a mystery in their depths that enhanced their strange fascination Those dark eyes with their sweeping lashes and the crimson line of her beautiful mouth were the only points of colour in her face and as she turned her head to greet the visitor the gleam of light that shot into those eyes might well have turned a stronger head than Rupert s Meeting her glance his pulses quickened and his own eyes grew bright but his voice was very quiet very self contained as he said I am three days too soon I know it you need not tell me But I had to come to day She put one of her hands into his but she did not move from her prostrate position on the couch and her visitor seated himself on a low chair by her side whilst she gently withdrew the hand he still held and said softly Why especially to day You must not break through the stipulation Rupert If there is a particular reason now I will forgive you but we must keep to our bargain Gentle as was the voice gentle as was the look in her eyes a look of almost maternal tenderness there was evidence that behind the tenderness lay a most unusual strength of character The woman with the beautiful face although she lay prone upon a sofa and was obviously an invalid showed in her personality no trace of weakness Her eyes met the eyes of her visitor squarely and straightly there was almost a hint of severity in the set of her lips Why did you come to day she repeated when he stirred uneasily in his chair and kicked away a footstool in front of him with a touch of irritability When I begin to put it into words it sounds a babyish reason but that jackanapes Layton has been playing an idiotic practical joke upon me and I was fool enough to mind it I wanted soothing down and I wanted your advice about a girl About a girl you A note of excitement was apparent in her accents she looked at him narrowly Has it come at last Rupert she questioned and her quiet voice shook just a little No no my God no he exclaimed nothing of that sort is ever likely to come into my life again he uttered the last words under his breath and his eyes rested hungrily on her beautiful face there is no question of my caring for any girl only young Jack Layton has made me responsible for what may make a perfectly innocent girl unhappy And forthwith he plunged into a full description of the sheaf of letters received that morning winding up with a mention of the terse little letter signed C M His listener s eyes twinkled mischievously as he told the first part of his story in wrathful accents and over some of his quotations from the letters that had reached him she laughed a frank delicious laugh that seemed oddly out of keeping with the tragic mystery of her eyes But as he described that last letter with its simple wording her face grew grave again and when his voice ceased she uttered the precise words that had fallen from his own lips three hours earlier Poor little girl oh poor little girl I am sorry for her Mernside said impetuously and it doesn t seem fair that she should perhaps suffer for that idiotic young fool s love of practical jokes Goodness knows what hopes she may have built upon this letter and upon me Of course I can t give her a home and I don t want to meet her with a view to anything There is no place in my life for women even as friends There is no place in my life for more than one woman he ended vehemently Hush she said softly Remember you promised and if you break your promise I can t ever let you come here again I know I know he cried with an impetuosity very foreign to his usual self control but Margaret is it to be like this always Will a time never come when you when I She put out her hand and laid it over one of his with a firm touch that had a curiously quieting effect upon him You and I are great friends as we have been for longer than we care to think But there could not ever be an idea between us of anything else not even the thought of such a thing It is out of the question It always has been out of the question You know that as well as I do and you must not come here at all unless you can keep to our agreement in spirit as well as in letter Is our friendship nothing to you he asked sullenly It is so much to me that I will not risk spoiling it for ever she said firmly but if you talk as you are talking now I shall tell Elizabeth I cannot see you And you are putting up this fence between us when I might be some comfort to you he exclaimed almost roughly getting up as he spoke to lean against the mantelpiece and glower threateningly down at her when every reasonable being would tell you that he Ah hush she cried and the sudden sharp anguish in her tones gave him pause don t let us go into it all over again Whilst I feel as I do feel I must go on in the way I have marked out for myself one can only follow the right as one sees it Besides which Besides which his little finger is more to you than Ah don t don t she interrupted him again her eyes darkening and deepening with agony Rupert I can t bear it there are some things I am not strong enough to bear I was a brute he said his rough tone changing all at once into caressing tenderness I let myself go I was an utter brute Forgive me dear and try to forget He sat down beside her again and his face which had shown the same strong emotion that had rang in his words resumed its quiet look of strength A great relief swept over the woman s beautiful features but she was shivering from head to foot and in her eyes there still lay a haunting anguish With an effort how great an effort only she herself knew she regained her self control and her voice though still shaken was very gentle again Tell me now about the poor little girl and the matrimonial letter Can we put our heads together to devise any way of helping her I might conceivably get her some work Rupert answered but people are a little chary of engaging employees recommended by bachelors like myself Cicely might help her but first of all I must find out if she is genuine I couldn t impose a stranger even on Cicely good natured easy going little soul that she is And to find out anything about this girl will entail meeting her Margaret Stanforth smiled Poor Rupert I am not by way of making rendezvous with young women he said with sarcasm it is not a pastime in which I have ever indulged At the same time I don t want to let a fellow creature go empty away if I could really help her How would it be if you suggested her coming here I could see her too and two heads being better than one we might be able to do something really helpful If the letter is sincere it is obvious the girl is not a mere husband hunter she is at her wits end and I can t bear to think of any girl stranded in this great hungry London I myself she pulled herself up short leaving her sentence unfinished then went on more quietly Write to C M and appoint a meeting here Say this is the house of a lady of your acquaintance ask her to come and see me and incidentally to see you It is like you to make such a suggestion about a total stranger Rupert exclaimed but she may turn out an entire fraud an arrant adventuress and I could not be responsible for bringing such a person here Such a person My dear Rupert even if she were all the terrible things you describe I don t think she could hurt me I have seen so much of the seamy side of life For a moment Rupert looked at her silently Long as he had known her Margaret Stanforth was still largely an enigma to him and it often seemed to him that the mysterious depths of her eyes veiled mysteries of her life which he had never fathomed For my own sake for this girl s sake I should like to jump at your offer he said after that long searching look into her face but There is no but she put in gaily a sudden smile momentarily chasing away the sadness of her face Write a civil non committal letter to C M and ask her as I say to come here Surely between us we can do something for this poor little waif and stray Why not fix to morrow afternoon at five o clock If the poor girl s need is urgent we ought not to delay And you forgive me for all I ought not to have said this morning Rupert said when ten minutes later he rose to depart I have not hurt you No you have not hurt me but in future you will remember our bargain And there are some things I can t bear Rupert Mernside walked slowly away from the house his brain and heart full of the woman he had just left who after his departure lay back amongst the silken cushions on her sofa with a look of profound exhaustion There now my dearie you didn t ought to let him come and tire you this way you get worn out with him coming worrying The faithful Elizabeth had entered the room with a salver in her hand and stood looking into her mistress s white face with distress written all over her plain kindly features Margaret opened her eyes and smiled up into the loving ones fixed upon her No he doesn t worry me he is a comfort he helps me Don t scold nursie dear his friendship is one of the best things I have in life one of the best things I have left out of all the wreckage but to day he brought back some of the old memories and I am so silly still They hurt sometimes it all feels unbearable The ring of almost uncontrollable pain in her voice brought a spasm of answering pain into the other s face and she laid a work roughened hand tenderly upon the dusky head against the cushions There my dearie there there she murmured speaking as if her beautiful stately mistress were a little child there s nothing so hard in this world but what it can be borne if we look at it in the right way The strength comes along with the sorrow and tis all for the best Is it Into the dark eyes there flashed for a second a look of bitterness and then Margaret drew the other woman s hand down to her lips and kissed it I wish I had your simple straightforward faith dear old nurse of mine she said wearily you are so sure things will come right and that what hurts us is for our good And I I can t say Thy will be done at least I can t say it as if I meant it But what did you bring in on that salver she asked after a moment of silence and with an effort at brightness There my pretty I nearly forgot it after all It came when I was speaking to the butcher on the doorstep and mister Mernside was here so I waited to bring it in till he was gone She had a purpose in lengthening her story and chatting on garrulously whilst Margaret opened the orange envelope for the faithful creature had seen the sudden dilation of her mistress s dark eyes the whitening of her lips had seen too how her hands shook as they unfolded the telegram I don t understand it missus Stanforth whispered shakily when her eyes had scanned the few words before her I don t know what it means Elizabeth but I must go I must go at once The servant drew the flimsy paper from her trembling hands and read the message shaking her head in bewilderment as the sense of it penetrated to her brain I m sure I don t know what it means no more than you do dearie she said Graystone Come at once prepare for surprise MARION CHAPTER IV I SUPPOSE IT WAS AN HOUR Poor dear James is the worthiest soul but he has no more brains than a pin the small kind of pin that you get in change for a farthing 
7354-87667-0001	train-other-500	James always seemed to me a good footman Rupert He is an admirable footman I haven t a word to say against him in that capacity
7354-87667-0002	train-other-500	He does his duties with the beautiful regularity of an automatic machine But move James from his own dear little beaten track and he is lost hopelessly irrevocably lost
7354-87667-0003	train-other-500	What beaten track has he left and why is he rousing your ladyship s wrath Lady Cicely Redesdale
none	none	 lying back in the cosiest chair of her cosy boudoir swung her pretty foot to and fro 
7354-87667-0004	train-other-500	and glanced up at her tall cousin with one of her gay little laughs Rupert Mernside the son of her mother s sister
none	none	 had always been to her more of elder brother than cousin 
7354-87667-0005	train-other-500	and from their earliest youth there had existed between them a frank camaraderie which had never degenerated into flirtation or drifted into any sentimental relationship
7354-87667-0006	train-other-500	Cicely was in the habit of saying that Rupert was the person of all others from whom she would not only ask but take advice because his judgment was so sound
none	none	 and he possessed a really well balanced mind 
7354-87667-0007	train-other-500	This opinion of him had been endorsed by her late husband who had only qualified it with one limitation Rupert s got as sound and balanced a mind as any man could wish for
7354-87667-0008	train-other-500	but once let the right woman get hold of him and she will twist him round her little finger Those words of her husband recurred to Cicely now as she lifted her eyes from their contemplation of her own
7354-87667-0009	train-other-500	dainty shoes and looked up into Rupert s rugged face I should rather like to see a woman twist you round her little finger she said irrelevantly A woman
7354-87667-0010	train-other-500	me What on earth have a woman and I got to do with James s delinquencies There is method in my madness but the lane that led from James to your little finger
7354-87667-0011	train-other-500	and the not impossible she is so long that I can t take you back along its windings It all comes of the power of association I shall have Baba taught everything by association
7354-87667-0012	train-other-500	I am planning a scheme of education that Where does James come in to the plan for Baba s education Rupert contrived to ask his grey eyes shining a whimsical smile playing round his mouth Oh
7354-87667-0013	train-other-500	my dear boy I had completely forgotten James though talking of Baba would soon have reminded me of him poor silly thing
none	none	 Baba ran away two days ago in that appalling fog and Baba ran away 
7354-87667-0014	train-other-500	Well the door was open I suppose the outside world looked rather fascinating and mysterious and she has no nurse just now you know so there was no one with her and of course Jane
7354-87667-0015	train-other-500	the nursery maid was fetching something from the kitchen and well the long and the short of it was that Baba ran out into the street and was promptly swallowed up by the fog My dear Cicely
7354-87667-0016	train-other-500	Providentially as I now consider it I was out I had an early appointment with Mathilde Your dressmaker My dressmaker Wasn t it kind of luck
7354-87667-0017	train-other-500	or whatever it is to let it all happen when I wasn t there Rupert if I had been at home and they told me Baba was lost I should have gone straight off my head
none	none	 That would have been an eminently useful and practical thing to do 
7354-87667-0018	train-other-500	was the dry retort You have never been a mother you don t know what a mother feels like about her only child Cicely said with an attempt at dignity that sat quaintly upon her small person
7354-87667-0019	train-other-500	and drew an amused laugh from her cousin I believe it would kill me if anything really happened to Baba she went on more gravely you think I m just a silly frivolous thing but Baba is all the world to me
7354-87667-0020	train-other-500	I know dear I know quite well Rupert answered kindly and nobody could think you silly But go on and tell me what happened two days ago We haven t got to James s shortcomings yet
7354-87667-0021	train-other-500	Baba ran out into the square
none	none	 and nobody missed her at first 
7354-87667-0022	train-other-500	Then when that goose of a Jane came back from her wanderings in the kitchen she found the nurseries empty and Baba nowhere to be found There was a tremendous hue and cry the servants seem to have been on the verge of distraction
7354-87667-0023	train-other-500	and ran off in all directions like frightened hens leaving James on guard at the door And after a few minutes when the fog lifted James caught sight of Baba in a strange girl s arms
7354-87667-0024	train-other-500	evidently quite at home with her and very happy You know Baba s ducky way of making friends with everybody James flew out seized Baba seems to have thanked her rescuer
none	none	 and bustled back to the house with the child without ever dreaming of asking the stranger her name What sort of a person was she 
7354-87667-0025	train-other-500	Oh I don t know When I asked James he could only say Well my lady she seemed a nice respectable young person
none	none	 but heaven knows what James means by a young person 
7354-87667-0026	train-other-500	He further volunteered that she was rather shabbily dressed and I can t bear to think that she went away with no thanks from me and with no reward
7354-87667-0027	train-other-500	Rupert smiled down into his cousin s pretty eager face
none	none	 Perhaps the thought of reward never entered her head 
7354-87667-0028	train-other-500	There are still some disinterested people left in the world
none	none	 And Baba is a very fetching little being 
7354-87667-0029	train-other-500	to rescue from the dangers of a fog She looked so fetching that morning too I came in just after she was brought back and there she was the little monkey
7354-87667-0030	train-other-500	in her red cloak which she had found in the hall where needless to say it ought not to have been with no hat and all her curls in a delicious tangle
7354-87667-0031	train-other-500	her face so soft and pink and her eyes shining She looked a delectable baby but Rupert
none	none	 she had on the most valuable lace frock and pearls round her neck 
7354-87667-0032	train-other-500	Only think what might have happened if some horrible person had found her My pretty baby and Cicely s face grew suddenly white and grave whilst she shivered at the picture conjured up by her own mind
7354-87667-0033	train-other-500	I asked James why he hadn t told the young person to give him her name and address and he could only say feebly that it never crossed his mind
none	none	 Poor James I don t believe he s got a mind 
7354-87667-0034	train-other-500	You could advertise for the young lady If you really want to find her an advertisement in some leading paper should unearth her for you Perhaps too if she was shabbily dressed
none	none	 a reward might be a god send to her 
7354-87667-0035	train-other-500	Oh Rupert
none	none	 perhaps she s fearfully poor Do 
7354-87667-0036	train-other-500	do advertise for me I can t bear to think that a girl may be in difficulties when I have more money than I know what to do with
none	none	 Will you advertise for me 
7354-87667-0037	train-other-500	Yes of course I don t know what I should do without you she continued looking at him gravely but with no hint of coquettishness in her glance
7354-87667-0038	train-other-500	I do miss John so dreadfully I do want a man to help me and advise me You can have me whenever you want me her cousin answered with equal gravity knowing that her words
none	none	 which in another woman s mouth might have implied a desire to change their friendly relations 
7354-87667-0039	train-other-500	for something more lover like on Cicely s lips held merely their surface meaning no more I always hope that some day you will marry again Rupert went on with brotherly frankness
7354-87667-0040	train-other-500	you have been alone three years now Your great property is a big handful for a woman to manage
none	none	 and John would wish for your happiness above everything else in the world 
7354-87667-0041	train-other-500	John never thought of anything but my happiness was the gentle answer I don t think any girl ever had a better dearer husband People thought perhaps you thought so
7354-87667-0042	train-other-500	too that I just married him for his money It wasn t true At first quite at first when father showed me what a huge difference it would make to them all if I married a millionaire
7354-87667-0043	train-other-500	I did think more of John s fortune than of himself But it was only quite at first After that I knew
7354-87667-0044	train-other-500	I would rather live in a cottage with him than in a palace with anybody else I don t think I shall marry again
none	none	 unless I find I am too weak and silly to manage Baba s fortune by myself Rupert looked silently down at her bent 
7354-87667-0045	train-other-500	bright head a new reverence stirring within him for the little cousin
none	none	 Hitherto he had regarded her with the kindly affection of an elder brother for a small sister whom he considers scarcely more than a child but this grave Cicely was showing him depths of whose existence he had never been even dimly aware But that s enough of being solemn Cicely exclaimed shattering his new conception of her with characteristic suddenness talking of marriage the thing I hanker for most in the whole world is to see you married Rupert You don t look a bit like a soured old bachelor and yet 
7354-87667-0046	train-other-500	here you are more than thirty five and not one single woman s name has ever been mentioned in connection with yours For which mercy let us be humbly and devoutly thankful
7354-87667-0047	train-other-500	her cousin answered laughing though how sincere was his thankfulness only his own heart knew and into that heart there flashed as he spoke the vision of a white face and dark eyes
7354-87667-0048	train-other-500	deep with unfathomable mystery if I don t want to marry why hustle me into the holy estate
none	none	 I believe the Prayer Book strongly urges us not to undertake it lightly or unadvisedly 
7354-87667-0049	train-other-500	Now you are flippant As if you would be marrying lightly or
none	none	 unadvisedly 
7354-87667-0050	train-other-500	if you wait until you are within five years of forty before choosing a wife
none	none	 When I think of the hundreds of really charming girls I ve introduced you to with 
7354-87667-0051	train-other-500	With a view to matrimony Rupert ended the sentence punctuating his words with a laugh Let me recommend you to study the matrimonial columns of some of the papers
7354-87667-0052	train-other-500	You will possibly find an eligible husband there for some of your charming girls Rupert don t be so incorrigibly low and horrid As if any girl with a rag of decency or self respect
7354-87667-0053	train-other-500	would answer one of those advertisements Why men who advertise for wives can only be seedy adventurers the sort of person one reads of in books and never meets in real life
7354-87667-0054	train-other-500	Seedy sort of adventurers Rupert repeated slowly turning as if by chance to survey his own reflection in the mirror over the mantelpiece
none	none	 there are adventurers and adventurers Perhaps some of those who advertise do it for a joke Just like a man if they do his cousin answered vehemently 
7354-87667-0055	train-other-500	and then some poor girl takes the wretched creature seriously and thinks he means his stupid joke I should despise a girl who answered such an advertisement but I should much more despise the man who inserted it
7354-87667-0056	train-other-500	Don t scorn them too much Everybody has different ideals and it takes all sorts to make a world Your sort don t advertise for husbands and wives
7354-87667-0057	train-other-500	but our section of society is not so faultless that we can afford to throw stones even at people who marry through a matrimonial bureau
none	none	 It s so low The sort of thing a shop girl might do 
7354-87667-0058	train-other-500	Not lower than displaying your daughters in the best market
none	none	 as the Society mother does 
7354-87667-0059	train-other-500	Rupert answered sternly not lower than running a man to earth as shoals of women do and do it without an ounce of shame But
none	none	 answering an advertisement like that is almost asking a man to marry you Perhaps and when poor old Donkin lost his wife a year ago 
7354-87667-0061	train-other-500	a lot of women wrote and proposed to him Yes actually wrote and offered to marry him He told me so himself and those were women of your class well born and well educated
7354-87667-0062	train-other-500	Well we have the consolation of knowing that he refused the lot Horrid beasts no wonder you men lose your respect for women if you think we are all capable of doing that sort of thing
7354-87667-0063	train-other-500	We don t think so Rupert s contemptuous tones grew gentle again we know the difference between the womanly woman and the others Thank God there are plenty of the right sort left
7354-87667-0064	train-other-500	and Rupert stooped suddenly and took his cousin s two small hands into his You aren t going she exclaimed I wanted you to see Baba and there are thousands of things I meant to say to you
7354-87667-0065	train-other-500	So sorry but the thousands of things must be postponed I have an appointment at five and I must keep it You will advertise for the young person Yes
7354-87667-0066	train-other-500	I won t forget the young person and by the way Cicely a slight trace of embarrassment showed on his face didn t you tell me you wanted to find a sort of nursery governess for Baba
7354-87667-0067	train-other-500	Certainly I do but my dear boy what do you know about nursery governesses I don t know anything about them was the reply
7354-87667-0068	train-other-500	but Cicely s quick eyes still noted embarrassment in both voice and manner but I heard the other day of a girl who who might be wanting a post A girl who might be wanting a post
7354-87667-0069	train-other-500	Cicely exclaimed mockingly the person I engage for Baba would have to be somebody much less vague than that and she must have unimpeachable references
7354-87667-0070	train-other-500	Unimpeachable references Mernside reflected as he left his cousin s house and side by side with Cicely s words
none	none	 other words tossed to and fro in his brain 
7354-87667-0071	train-other-500	words written in a clear girlish hand that had an odd character of its own I cannot find work and I need a home very much Probably she is quite impossible
7354-87667-0072	train-other-500	his reflections ran on Cicely had a good deal of right on her side when she talked about shop girls and matrimonial advertisements I daresay I shall find C M belongs to that class of girl
7354-87667-0073	train-other-500	and if so what am I going to do about her Ah well Margaret will help
none	none	 It was this thought that buoyed him up during his walk across the park from the Redesdale s mansion in Eaton Square 
7354-87667-0074	train-other-500	to the small white house in Bayswater but as he pushed open the familiar gate and walked up the garden path a shock of surprise awaited him
7354-87667-0075	train-other-500	The blinds of the room to the right of the front door were pulled down and his repeated ringing of the bell brought no response from within The bell clanged in the kitchen regions its echoes dying away forlornly
7354-87667-0076	train-other-500	but no footstep sounded in the hall no hand lifted the latch of the door and as he stepped back and looked up at the house Rupert saw that no smoke was coming from the chimneys
7354-87667-0077	train-other-500	A sick fear smote at his heart What had happened What could have happened The day before he had been here
none	none	 sitting with Margaret in that very room over whose windows 
7354-87667-0078	train-other-500	the blinds were now so closely drawn She had seemed tired it was true but not more tired than he had often seen her and he had no reason to suppose that she was more ill than usual
7354-87667-0079	train-other-500	She was always fragile he was accustomed to find her one week on the sofa another week sufficiently strong to be moving about the room and even going out of doors
7354-87667-0080	train-other-500	But that her house should be barred and bolted against him was inexplicable He felt as though the ground had been cut away from under his feet as if the very foundations of his life had been shaken Why
7354-87667-0081	train-other-500	to day was the day she had herself fixed for his interview in her house with the girl of the advertisement Margaret had arranged the hour it was by her suggestion that he had written to C M
none	none	 proposing a meeting at one hundred Barford Road 
7354-87667-0082	train-other-500	and now he found the house locked up and apparently empty with no word of explanation or apology Could Margaret have been suddenly taken ill If so why had she not let him know Yet
7354-87667-0083	train-other-500	if she was ill she would be in the house and Elizabeth with her Somebody would have answered his ringing which had grown more and more imperative as each ring remained unanswered Could she have gone away
7354-87667-0084	train-other-500	Gone away without letting him have the slightest hint of her intended going Was that more conceivable than his theory of sudden illness Again sick dismay knocked at the door of his heart
7354-87667-0085	train-other-500	and with it came a wave of hot anger against Margaret Surely his years of faithful devotion of willing service had entitled him to more consideration than this at her hands
7354-87667-0086	train-other-500	He had made few demands upon her but this sudden and unexplained disappearance was a strain which even the merest friendship should not be called upon to bear Once again he pealed the bell
7354-87667-0087	train-other-500	and even knocked vigorously at the knocker but neither sound produced the slightest effect
none	none	 and he was perforce turning away when the gate clicked and he saw a breathless personage of the charwoman class hurrying up the path 
7354-87667-0088	train-other-500	I m sure I beg your parding sir she panted just like my luck to a popped out for a minute twice in the afternoon and each time somebody called Are you in charge of this house
7354-87667-0089	train-other-500	Rupert asked his own agitation making him speak more sternly than the occasion quite warranted Yes sir and I m truly sorry sir the woman whimpered wiping her much heated face with a grimy apron
7354-87667-0090	train-other-500	come here yesterday I did all of a sudden
none	none	 missus Stanforth and Miss Herring 
7354-87667-0091	train-other-500	her maid going away unexpected
none	none	 and me havin a extra lot of washin and all But I says to Jem 
7354-87667-0092	train-other-500	my son Jem I says Yes yes Rupert interrupted impatiently but where is missus Stanforth Did she leave any message Any note
7354-87667-0093	train-other-500	Did she tell you to say anything to people who called Lor no sir Went off in a hurry and didn t leave no messages nor nothin
none	none	 And I m sure I m sorry I wasn t ere when you come but I d popped out for a minute and let out the kitchen fire too and I just ad to see to my bit o washin 
7354-87667-0094	train-other-500	and there I run back a half an our ago
none	none	 and there was a young lady in a rare takin then and so A young lady 
7354-87667-0095	train-other-500	Rupert again broke into her stream of words Pore young thing she did seem upset over it too Said she was expected
none	none	 and she was to be ere at five and all There I was sorry for er 
7354-87667-0096	train-other-500	Seemed to strike er all of an eap
none	none	 when she see the shut up ouse 
7354-87667-0097	train-other-500	She says quite urt like Well I s pose it was an oax Them was er very words I suppose you explained to her that the lady had gone away unexpectedly
7354-87667-0098	train-other-500	Rupert exclaimed with growing irritation you didn t let the young lady think she had been brought here for a joke Well o course sir I didn t know nothin about it
none	none	 was the offended retort 
7354-87667-0099	train-other-500	if you ask me I should say there was somethin queer in tellin somebody to come to an ouse at five o clock and then for the ouse to be shut up Which I should say it was a pore joke meself She says
7354-87667-0100	train-other-500	Ain t mister Mernside ere and I says I don t know nothin about nobody o that name
none	none	 and she looks as took aback as if I d it er 
7354-87667-0101	train-other-500	and so Rupert uttered a smothered oath then mastered himself and asked more quietly And how long has the young lady been gone Best part of a quarter of a hour
7354-87667-0102	train-other-500	Quiet young lady she was too dressed very plain you might say shabby
none	none	 and went orf lookin fit to cry with disappointment And I just popped out agin to git me bit o relish for tea and you come 
7354-87667-0103	train-other-500	lor it do seem strange
none	none	 The good lady was left to address her rambling remarks to the shrubs in the garden for Rupert unable to bear more of her discursiveness turned and fled shutting the garden gate with a sharp clang behind him and feeling that his world had all at once gone wrong very wrong indeed CHAPTER V I KNOW THIS IS WORTH A LOT OF MONEY I suppose I was stupid to think it could be anything but a hoax But the letter seemed so kind not as if it were written by a horrid person who would want to play a practical joke Christina having climbed the stairs to her room with weary dragging footsteps sat down on her one chair feeling tired depressed and indignant The dire necessity of saving her every penny drove her to walk from Bayswater to her far off lodgings in the S W district and as a fine rain had begun to fall long before she was half way across the park she was not only worn out and miserable but very wet as well In their best days her serge coat and skirt had not been thick much wear and tear had reduced them to a threadbare condition quite incapable of resistance to weather The drizzling rain had penetrated her inadequate coat and thin blouse her skirt hung limply about her legs she felt what she actually was wet to the skin and too tired even to exert herself to make some tea over her spirit lamp I expect it is true what missus Jones says she reflected she says men are all brutes and you can t trust one of them I used to think she only said it because mister Jones drank himself to death and drank away her earnings first and beat her But now I don t know With cold fingers she drew the hatpins from her sodden hat threw off the wet coat that clung so chillily to her shivering form and took from her pocket a letter addressed in a bold masculine hand C M c o missus Cole Newsagent ten Cartney Street S W It looks like the handwriting of a gentleman the poor little girl s reflections ran on I shouldn t have thought a man who wrote like that could be a brute and his letter isn t a brute s letter either she added pathetically drawing the letter from its envelope and reading the words which were already engraved upon her mind DEAR MADAM I think perhaps I may be able to be of some use to you if you could make it convenient to call at one hundred Barford Road Bayswater at five o clock to morrow Wednesday We might have a little talk My friend to whom the house belongs will be very glad to see you Yours faithfully R MERNSIDE And then I find the house shut up Christina said shakily and aloud and an old charwoman tells me she never heard of mister Mernside and I suppose it was just all a mean practical joke Two tears tears of sheer fatigue and of bitter disappointment welled up in the girl s eyes and dropped slowly down her cheeks She was so tired so tired and cold and miserable and she had built more hopes than she quite knew upon the answer to her timid little letter The entire absence of any allusion to matrimonial prospects in mister Mernside s note had quieted her fears and many hopes had mingled with the nervous doubts that had filled her soul as she set out that afternoon on her strange expedition Some faint idea that this unknown mister Mernside might be instrumental in helping her to find work sustained her through the long walk to Barford Road she had been so sure so very sure that the writer of the terse kindly letter was a gentleman and a good man to boot that the sight of the shut up house came to her with the force of an actual blow whilst the caretaker s unfeigned ignorance of anybody of the name of Mernside made Christina s theory of a hoax seem more than probable And not one answer to all the letters I wrote about situations she exclaimed wearily pulling herself up from her chair and taking the spirit lamp from its place in the cupboard I wonder whether there are lots of other girls as poor as I am and without any relations or friends In another week I shan t have enough money to pay my rent and missus Jones won t let it run she s said so over and over again Another shiver ran through her and this time dread apprehension of the future was more responsible for the shiver than even the damp chilliness of her condition I don t know what I shall do when the money is all gone Oh I don t know what I shall do and a little sob broke from her as she took from the cupboard the materials for her tea It was a meagre enough meal that her cold shaking fingers spread on the old deal table and she was repeatedly forced to brush away the tears from her face so fast did they run down it now that exhaustion and misery were at last finding an outlet Her lunch had consisted of a glass of milk and a bun bought at a neighbouring shop since lunch time she had walked some miles had incidentally become wet through during the process and her walk had been crowned by a cruel disappointment It was not wonderful that the girl plucky little soul though she was should feel now as if the end were reached and she could hope no more To add to her misery everything seemed to go awry The matches were only found after a prolonged hunt for them for many minutes the lamp refused to light and when at last a flame shot up Christina thought that the water in the kettle boiled more slowly than water had ever boiled before Dry bread had never tasted more unappetising and milkless tea though it was certainly warm and in that respect carried a certain amount of comfort with it tasted bitter and nauseating The girl longed with an almost childish longing for something more to eat and drink Visions rose before her of the Donaldsons cosy nursery of a plate piled high with hot buttered toast of a big home made seed cake that could be eaten as quickly as the nursery folks liked without any dread of future want and she pushed away her plate and laid her head down upon the table sobbing as though her heart would break Hot buttered toast and seed cake are unromantic sounding things enough no doubt but when one is very hungry and very heartsick and only twenty into the bargain the thoughts of past plenty make present poverty seem well nigh intolerable Good stuff must have gone to the making of little Christina and whoever those ancestors on her mother s side had been they had passed on to her a goodly heritage of courage and endurance Her storm of sobs was of very brief duration Giving herself a little shake both actually and metaphorically she raised her head from the table resolutely dried her eyes choked back her sobs and forced herself to finish eating the dry morsels of bread and drinking the nauseous draught of tea Either the food itself or the effort she had made to eat it sent a tingling of new strength along her limbs and she broke into a faint laugh over her own despair You perfect goose she said firmly rising to wash up her tea things crying won t make anything better mister Donaldson used to say Don t look for your bridges before you come to them and so I won t look at the bridge missus Jones will put up for me about the rent until I am really going to step right on to it And before I give up every bit of hope I ought perhaps I ought to try and pawn the pendant only I can t bear doing it I can t bear it missus Jones was not at all the pleasant and kindly landlady of fiction who succours and helps her tenants and plays the part of mother to them The only part missus Jones understood playing was that of the cruel stepmother of fairy legend and Christina did not err in thinking that to allow rent to remain unpaid was no part of her landlady s methods missus Jones s own life had been a hard one Grinding work in her early girlhood a brutal husband and much grinding poverty during her married life and in her widowhood an unending struggle to make two ends meet these made up the sum of the landlady s existence and she treated the world as she found herself treated by the world She expected nothing from others and she gave them nothing She asked for no help from her fellow beings and she most assuredly bestowed none She was lighting the gas jet in the hall a hard featured tight lipped woman when half an hour later Christina went out again a small brown paper parcel in her hand and missus Jones s thin lips tightened more than ever as her sharp eyes fell upon the parcel Goin out to pop somethin was her grim thought and the thought was displeasing to her Not that she particularly pitied her lodger Pity was a virtue not cultivated by missus Jones But she instinctively dreaded the moment when her lodgers began to slip out stealthily with parcels under their arms or in their hands The significance of those parcels was well known to her and she was fully aware that lodgers who once began to pawn their goods passed by easy stages to backwardness in paying their rent and then followed eviction and new tenants No missus Jones mistrusted brown paper parcels just as much as she mistrusted the look half shy half frightened which Christina cast at her in passing and the flood of colour that dyed the girl s face when she met the landlady s glance Some of her smarter clothes Christina had long ago sold to an old clothes shop round the corner but this was the first time she had visited a real pawnbroker and her heart beat like a sledge hammer as she stood outside the window of a jeweller s shop over which the three balls were displayed She had shrunk from going into the establishment of mister Moss the recognised pawnbroker of that squalid neighbourhood and had gone further afield thinking that from a jeweller even though he engaged in pawnbroking as well she would meet with more consideration and perhaps receive a larger sum of money But looking through the glass doors at the two men who lounged behind the counter her spirits sank to zero and she allowed ten minutes to slip by before taking her courage into her hands she finally entered the shop Coming in out of the damp of the November evening the pleasant warmth was grateful to her but the brilliant gaslight dazzled her eyes and sheer nervousness made her stumble hopelessly over the sentence she had been committing to memory ever since she had left her lodgings I called to ask whether this pendant was of any value she had intended to say But instead of that she found herself stammering breathlessly I I came would you please tell me if you can give me something on this and she thrust her parcel into the hand indolently stretched out for it by one of the young men behind the counter His eyes looked her up and down with an insolent stare that sent the blood flying over her face and his smile gave her an impotent longing to strike his fat sleek countenance How much do you want for it my dear that s the question the man said jauntily his eyes never leaving the girl s flushed face we are always pleased to accommodate a pretty young lady like you eh Tom with an odious leer he nudged the elbow of his companion who emitted a hoarse guffaw and winked facetiously as Christina turned a distressed glance in his direction Unfortunately for her the master of the shop was absent and she was at the mercy of two of those underbred mean spirited curs who regard any defenceless woman as lawful prey and take the same delight in baiting her as their ignoble ancestors took in baiting an equally defenceless dumb animal You tell us what you want miss the man called Tom struck in leaning across the counter and tapping the girl s hand anything you ask in reason we shall be pleased to oblige you with Now what s this thing and this thing and this very pretty thing he ended facetiously whilst his fellow shopman unfastened Christina s parcel and opened the cardboard box it contained It is a pendant Christina faltered afraid to show the indignation she felt lest the men should refuse to give her what she needed it has been a long time in my family and I know it is very valuable Oh you know it is very valuable do you queried the first man mocking her trembling accents now it is for us to tell you its value not for you to tell us you know Hum old fashioned thing he ejaculated holding up to the light the piece of jewellery he had drawn from its box this sort of antique article may have suited our grandmothers but it doesn t go down nowadays That is not at all the case Christina answered boldly everybody likes antique things now and that pendant is worth a great deal as you know Anger was beginning to conquer her nervous tremors and the odious smile with which her remark was received by both young men made her draw herself up proudly Hoity toity said the man called Tom as we know indeed If mister Franks my excellent friend and colleague he made an exaggerated bow to his companion considers the bauble old fashioned and worthless it certainly is worthless and old fashioned It is certainly nothing of the kind Christina cried anger driving away the last semblance of nervousness I should be much obliged if you would tell me at once how much you can advance me upon it If you are unable to give me anything I can take it elsewhere As she spoke she looked straight into the smiling insolent faces before her her own grown rigid and proud and in spite of her shabby clothing and obvious poverty she suddenly assumed a look of imperial dignity which had an instantaneous effect upon her tormentors Come come miss don t talk like that the man called Franks said sheepishly we were just having a bit of fun over it that s all And I m sure we ll give you the best we can for the pendant Christina s threat of taking the jewel elsewhere had brought the shopmen sharply to their senses for it had needed no more than a cursory glance to show them both that the jewel the girl had brought them was of no small value and they were uncomfortably aware that the vials of their master s wrath would be emptied upon their heads if they allowed such an article to be disposed of in another establishment It is a very pretty piece of work the first man said taking the pendant in his hand and looking over it with a fine assumption of carelessness family initials I suppose in this twisted monogram I suppose so I cannot give you any history of the pendant I don t know its history myself It came to me from my mother Christina gave this piece of gratuitous information feeling uneasily that it might be supposed she had stolen the beautiful piece of jewellery and with the thought all the old associations that were interwoven with it swept into her mind and almost choked further utterance A V C the young man said slowly deciphering the monogram which in exquisitely chased gold surmounted the pendant itself This latter consisted of an emerald remarkably vivid in colour and set in the same finely chased gold as that which formed the monogram A V C would have been some ancestor of yours no doubt he asked jocularly and with another wink at his companion I don t know Christina repeated as I tell you I know nothing of the jewel s history I believe it to be a genuine emerald and I am sure it is very valuable Both men simultaneously shrugged their shoulders and laughed odious deprecating laughs My dear young lady said Franks who seemed to occupy a position superior to the other someone has been as we say getting at you if they told you this was a genuine emerald Why if it was an emerald a real emerald mind you it would be worth and he raised his eyes to the ceiling and lifted up his hands as if to demonstrate the magnitude of a sum he could not mention in spoken language It is a real emerald and it is worth a great deal Christina said firmly but if you do not care to advance me what it is worth I will take it away and she put out her hand for the pendant from which the gleams of light flashed brilliantly Now look here said mister Franks persuasively you believe me missy this is no more an emerald than I am but it is a nice little bit of paste and the gold is well worked I m taking a good bit upon myself in making the suggestion and goodness knows what the boss will say to me when he comes home But I ll take it off your hands for five pounds There he ended triumphantly as though convinced that the generosity must be a delicious surprise for his hearer Five pounds Christina s voice rang with indignation five pounds for what you know as well as I do is worth twenty times that amount Franks laughed contemptuously and began putting the ornament back into its box with elaborate care You have an exaggerated idea of the thing s value he said I couldn t undertake to offer you more than five pounds for it and if you take my advice he added darkly with a swift glance at his colleague and back at the girl you ll accept the offer and let us have the thing altogether You see he coughed significantly awkward questions might be asked about a thing like this with initials If I did my business properly I ought to ask you where you got it The colour ebbed out of Christina s face the possibility that had confronted her a few minutes ago had all at once taken definite form This man was hinting nay more than hinting that the pendant had come into her hands by unlawful means and she had nothing but her word to prove her own statement I have told you that it belonged to my mother she said tremblingly it is an old family ornament and I cannot part with it altogether Look here miss the man s voice became rough and harsh it s no use your coming old family ornaments over me People with old family ornaments don t come to places like this pawning them What price your old family eh He ended his coarse speech with a coarser laugh at the sound of which Christina shrank and shivered I will take back my pendant please she said trying to regain her courageous tone I do not wish to sell it outright and if you will not advance me anything on it there is nothing more to be said Not so fast not so fast the man called Tom exclaimed pushing back the hand she once more extended towards the box What mister Franks says is very true how do we know where you got this pendant The more you go on making difficulties over letting it go the more doubtful the whole affair looks Now if you re really so badly in want of cash he went on brutally you take what we offer five pounds down If you don t we may feel ourselves obliged to send for the police and Quite unable in her innocence to understand that the two cowards were bullying her to the top of their bent already worn out by the events of the day and by many days of fatigue and under feeding a panic terror seized upon her Before the astonished men were aware of her intention she had reached over the counter snatched the box from Franks s hand and fled out of the shop and down the street her heart beating to suffocation her eyes wide with terror Never once looking back she threaded her way along the pavement oblivious of the expostulations of passers by against whom she brushed almost unconscious of their very existence in her frantic desire speedily to put as great a distance as possible between herself and the objectionable jewellers Heedless of the traffic she dashed headlong over the crossings and plunging into a network of by streets ran on still at full speed possessed by the horrible fear that those men with the dreadful smiles might already have put the police upon her track I can t prove the pendant is mine she panted breathlessly I have no proof that I didn t steal it What can I say if they take me up as a thief The bare thought made her redouble her pace although she was already on the verge of exhaustion and her breath was coming in great gasps Beads of perspiration stood on her forehead and when at last she reached her own room she was powerless to do more than sink upon a chair shaking in every limb For many minutes she could only lean back with closed eyes and ashen face drawing long painful breaths each one of which was a sob but as a sense of safety grew upon her she roused herself to light her lamp and to draw off her damp clothing preparatory to going to bed Even with the slender supply of blankets missus Jones allowed her lodgers it would be warmer than sitting up without a fire and she dared not allow herself the luxury of a fire especially now that her last hope of raising money had been snatched from her For I shall never dare take the pendant to show to anybody again she thought with a shudder The next person I went to might send for the police then and there And perhaps it was horrible of me to think of pawning mother s pendant at all only I don t believe she would have minded if she had known how dreadfully dreadfully poor her little girl was going to be and how hard it is for a girl even to get bread enough to keep from starvation And I know this is worth oh a lot of money she exclaimed pathetically once more taking the ornament from its box and holding it before her in the light of the lamp As the green gleam of the stones flashed out before her eyes the dreary room in which she sat her squalid surroundings even her own misery faded from her mind she was back in the past back in her mother s bedroom in the dear Devonshire home her mother s dying voice sounding in her ears Through the open window had drifted the song of the sea mingling with the hum of bees amongst the roses that climbed to the very sill and made the room fragrant with their sweetness And a bird had sung ah how it had sung on that last night of her mother s life when Christina felt that her life too was going down into the dark for ever My little girl how faint the gentle voice had been I can t stay now father has gone he and I could not ever be apart He is my world all my world The dim resentment which Christina the child had sometimes experienced because those two beings she loved best had seemed so remote from her so perfectly able to live their lives without her had smitten the girl Christina afresh as she listened to her mother s words Her father and mother had been so wrapped up in one another always so wholly sufficient for each other s needs that their child had played a very secondary part in their lives And the child had dimly resented it Through all the sorrow that filled her heart as she stood beside her mother s deathbed that smouldering resentment would not be wholly stilled Her mother could barely spare a thought for the girl she was leaving to face the world alone because her husband filled her whole soul she could remember only that he had gone before her into the silent land and that she must hasten to join him again You are so young the dying voice had murmured on whilst the fast dimming eyes looked not at her little daughter but at the blue sky outside the window somebody will want you some day as Ronald wanted me as he wants me still Christina did not answer only her eyes followed her mother s glance out to the deep blue sky framed by the nodding roses round the window and she wondered dully whether anybody would really care for her some day or whether there was something inherently unlovable in her seeing that her own father and mother had seemed to find her so little worthy of love The bitter thought passed She bent over her mother and gently stroked back the damp hair from her forehead I shall be able to take care of myself she said bravely and Be good my little girl the murmuring voice broke in be good and come to us some day Ronald and I will be there together I want to tell you the pendant the emerald pendant a look of excitement flashed into her eyes she made a great effort to raise herself in the bed but such effort was far beyond her feeble strength I can t tell you now she gasped later after sleep the pendant take the emerald tell Arthur and at that word her strength suddenly failed her eyes closed she slipped down among her pillows in an unconsciousness from which she never again awoke All through the fragrant summer night following that sunshiny afternoon Christina had watched beside her hoping against hope that some faint knowledge of outward things would return to her that the strange unfinished sentence might be ended I want to tell you her mother had said What was it she wished to tell her daughter What was the meaning of those strange words that seemed so incoherent and without sense The pendant take the emerald tell Arthur But no glimmer of consciousness crossed the still white face the eyes that had last looked at the sunny sky of June and the nodding roses opened no more upon this world s sunshine and flowers the faltering voice was silenced for ever and in the grey dawn of morning Christina s mother had passed to the land where she and the man she loved would part no more The vision faded Christina was back again in the present the dull light of the oil lamp shining on the jewel she held in the clammy cold of a November evening that was as far removed from the sunny sweetness of June as her sordid room was removed from the rose scented fragrance of her old home I wonder what she wanted to tell me the girl mused again as she had mused countless times before what could she have meant when she said those words The pendant take the emerald tell Arthur I wonder who Arthur could have been CHAPTER VI BABA LOVES YOU VERY MUCH Will the lady who on Monday morning brought Baba home out of the fog kindly call at one hundred Eaton Square any time between eleven and one o clock The words seemed to start from the printed page before Christina s eyes and she read them over and over again with growing wonder It was Friday morning two days after her two disastrous visits one to the shut up house in Bayswater the other to the insolent jewellers and with difficulty she had managed to crawl round to the Free Library feeling that she dared leave no stone unturned in a fresh search for work The day before she had perforce spent in bed for her day of fatigue emotion and exposure to the weather had been followed by a night of fever and aching limbs and on the Thursday morning she could scarcely lift her head from the pillow But on Friday realising affrightedly that each day brought her nearer to absolute destitution she made a herculean effort got up and dressed and feeling more dead than alive dragged herself to the library to study the monotonous advertisement columns of the newspapers And having wearily glanced down the familiarly worded lines in which nursery governesses and companions were asked for at wages that would not satisfy the average kitchen maid she turned to the front page of the Morning Post and found herself confronted with the advertisement that now held her astonished eyes Will the lady who on Monday morning brought Baba home out of the fog kindly call at one hundred Eaton Square any time between eleven and one o clock Unless there were two Babas in the world and two ladies who had taken them home out of the fog she herself was clearly the person indicated by the advertisement and as the square in which the bewitching baby had been taken from her by an excited footman was certainly Eaton Square she had little doubt but that the advertiser wished to thank and perhaps to reward her A hot flush came into her white cheeks as the word reward entered her mind all her instincts revolted against the notion of being rewarded for doing what had been a most obvious duty But with the instinct of revolt came also a little rush of hope To the tired girl the advertisement seemed like a friendly hand outstretched towards her and though pride whispered to her to pay no heed to it and to ignore it altogether the sense that kindliness towards a total stranger had prompted the advertisement fought hard with pride After all if she went to one hundred Eaton Square she need accept nothing at the hands of the inmates that they should wish to thank her for the safe return of their little one was only natural and it would be churlish of her to refuse to be thanked In her excitement she omitted to take down any addresses of employers for the first time since she had begun to haunt the Free Library she went out of its doors without a list of names to which letters must be written setting forth her own qualifications for tending children or amusing the elderly She had actually forgotten to draw from her pocket the sheet of notepaper she never failed to bring with her on her morning quest so full was her mind of the coming visit to Eaton Square Her weary limbs still refused to hurry and she walked slowly back to her lodgings to make herself tidy as she put it before venturing into what was to her an actually new world Her heart was beating very fast as she rang the bell of the great Eaton Square mansion and thanks partly to nervousness partly to fatigue her legs were trembling so much that she was obliged to clutch at the wall for support to prevent herself from falling A footman flung open the door a tall rather supercilious footman whose face was not the good natured foolish face of the James who had lifted the red cloaked baby from her arms This man looked the visitor up and down with a comprehensive stare which held in it both enquiry and contempt and had the effect of banishing Christina s small remnant of courage Could I see the lady of the house she asked What might you want with her the servant demanded with a sniff There was an advertisement in to day s Morning Post the girl answered her voice shaking with nervous weariness it said call between eleven and one and I came to Come after the place have you the footman s tone changed to one of huge condescension Oh well step in and I ll see if her ladyship can see you The place her ladyship Christina looked at the man with bewildered eyes and said faintly I don t know anything about a place I have not come for that Only the advertisement said call between eleven and one o clock Step inside came the short order whilst Henry the first footman inwardly remarked that he wished her ladyship wouldn t go putting in advertisements and not mentioning them to the establishment Take a seat there and I ll ascertain whether her ladyship is disengaged Had Christina been in her normal health the man s grandiloquent manner and language would have amused her With her nerves at high tension her limbs trembling and her whole frame exhausted and weary she felt only a great inclination either to flee out of the front door or to sit down and cry The hall softly carpeted and warm fragrant with the flowers massed in great pots at the foot of the staircase and quiet with the stillness of a well ordered house oppressed her The solemn voice of a grandfather clock in the corner had only the effect of making the prevailing silence more noticeable and Christina experienced a wild longing to scream or to burst into uncontrollable laughter just to break the stillness which weighed upon her like a nightmare Will you come this way please She started violently as the footman s voice sounded close to her His footstep on the thick pile of the stair carpet had been quite inaudible and she was surprised to see him once more beside her At his bidding she rose mechanically and followed him up the wide staircase whose soft carpet was a bewildering novelty to the girl accustomed to the simplest surroundings across a landing fragrant like the hall with growing roses and exotic plants into a small boudoir in which she found herself alone In all her twenty years of life she had never before been in a room like this room and standing in the centre of it just where her guide had left her she looked round her timidly and drew a long breath of admiration and amazement The murkiness of the November day that darkened the world outside did not appear to enter into this lovely apartment which gave Christina a sense of summer and sunshine It is just like a pink rose she said to herself her eyes wandering from the walls delicately tinted a soft rose colour to the sofa and chairs upholstered in a deeper shade of the same colour and the carpet whose darker tint of rose harmonised with the paler hues Every table seemed to the girl to overflow with books and magazines bowls of flowers vases of flowers pots of flowers stood on every available shelf and in every possible corner The windows were draped with rose coloured silk curtains that made even the grey sky beyond them look less grey and the pictures on the walls drew a gasp of delight from Christina s lips They were mainly landscapes and in almost every case they represented wide spaces open tracts of country that gave one a sense of life and freshness Here was an expanse of sea blue and smiling as the sky that stooped to meet it there long green rollers swept up a sandy beach whilst clouds lit up by a rift of sunshine lay on the horizon On this side was a moorland purple with heather bathed in the glory of the setting sun on that side a plain far reaching as the sea itself soft and green and misty bounded by mountains whose snow crowned summits stood out in serried stateliness against the faint blue sky In a looking glass hanging on the wall Christina caught sight of her own reflection and a shamed consciousness of her white face and shabby clothes gave her a sense of the incongruousness between her own appearance and the loveliness around her But this uneasy sense of discrepancy had barely entered her mind when the door opened and there entered a tiny personage whose daintiness made Christina all at once feel huge awkward and ungainly It was sweet of you to come the little lady exclaimed holding out to the girl a white hand flashing with diamonds you are the kind lady who brought my Baba home Henry was very incoherent he always is in a grand long winded way of his own But I gathered from his meandering remarks that you had come in answer to my advertisement Yes Christina answered I saw it the advertisement in the Morning Post to day I thought it was so kind of you to advertise that I came But of course when I brought the darling baby home I only did what everybody else would have done she added rather breathlessly A lady and very proud the thought ran through her listener s brain but aloud the little lady only said I can t put into words how grateful I am to you all the same You see my little girlie is my ewe lamb my only child and she is very precious If anything had happened to her I oh but we mustn t talk about dreadful things that might happen when I hope they never will Baba was a naughty monkey to run out alone But she is rather a sweet monkey isn t she She is one of the dearest babies I ever saw Christina answered simply sitting down in the chair her hostess pushed forward for her and feeling some of her awkwardness slipping from her in presence of this kindly dainty little lady With girlish enthusiasm her eyes drank in the loveliness of the other s fair face its delicate colouring its crown of bright hair the perfection of the tiny form the gracefulness of the dead black gown that fell in exactly the right folds and was hung as no dress of poor little Christina s had ever been persuaded to hang Baba we call her Baba because her own name Veronica is so big for such a baby has managed to get rather out of hand since her nurse left We do try not to spoil her but we don t always succeed very well I think you must be very fond of children aren t you You made a great impression on Baba I love little children Christina answered with the simplicity and sincerity which characterised her since I have had to earn my own living I have been a nursery governess It is very absurd but I don t even know your name and I daresay you are equally ignorant of mine the little lady in the armchair exclaimed with a gay laugh Rupert did not put any name in the advertisement he said it was wiser not but I am Lady Cicely Redesdale and Baba as I say is my only child and very precious Lady Cicely s blue eyes looked thoughtfully at Christina her last words were spoken absently I did not even know into which house the small girl was carried on Monday Christina replied laughing also the footman ran along the pavement when he saw us and until I read your advertisement to day I had no idea which number in the square was the one he had come from My name is Moore Christina Moore and I live in Maremont Street In Maremont Street But isn t that rather a wretched neighbourhood for you Do your people live there I have no people the girl answered an unconscious wistfulness in her eyes that appealed to Lady Cicely s kind heart I lost my father and mother three years ago and since then I have been living with some friends and taking care of their children But now they have gone to Canada and I am alone in the world It was said without any arriere pensee no thought of exploiting her loneliness crossed Christina s mind The sympathetic glance of the blue eyes watching her led her on to frankness of speech and to speak to an educated lady again was a delight to which for the past few months she had been an entire stranger And you are obliged to work for yourself Lady Cicely put the question with hesitating kindliness Oh yes a faint smile crossed Christina s face and just now it is rather hard to get Nobody seems to want the sort of work that I can do You see I have had very little education not enough to teach big children and I have no certificates or diplomas or anything I don t think my father ever dreamt that I should have to earn my own living or he would have had me trained to do it But you have taken care of little children again Lady Cicely s eyes searched the girl s face earnestly and you are very fond of them I love them Christina said for the third time and I am never tired of being with them and taking care of them But there are such lots of other girls like me with very few qualifications and so though I answer ever so many advertisements I can t get a place Do you mind waiting here just a moment Lady Cicely asked abruptly I I should like you to see Baba before you go perhaps we might find we might think and with this vague sentence the small lady went out of the room leaving Christina puzzled and wondering Lady Cicely meanwhile hurried downstairs to the library where a man sat looking over a mass of legal papers Rupert she exclaimed impetuously it is the girl who brought Baba back and my brain is teeming with plans for helping her Is she a young person No no a lady Very shabby very tired looking very poor I should guess but unmistakably a lady And I m so sorry for her Rupert she is just a slip of a girl who looks as if she wanted mothering Now Cicely do you wish to embark on the mother s role As one of your trustees let me warn you I shan t allow any quixotism Leave those tiresome old papers for five minutes and come and see this girl I don t want to be quixotic and I am ready to abide by your judgment but come and look at Miss Moore The tiresome old papers are fairly important deeds connected with your estate and the future inheritance of your daughter Miss Veronica Joan Redesdale her cousin answered with a laugh but I suppose your ladyship s whims must take precedence of your property Where is Miss Moore In my boudoir and very shy I am sure she was afraid at first that I meant to offer her money there was a sort of proud shrinking in her eyes and she has very pretty eyes too Of course my idea had been to offer her money because I imagined she would be of the shop girl type but I should as soon think of offering you money as of suggesting giving it to Miss Moore Come along then let us get the inspection over But if you can t give her money what do you propose to do with her I thought Lady Cicely paused glanced into her cousin s grave face and glanced away again I fancied perhaps I might help her to get work She is horribly poor and she looks half fed and so tired I well I really and truly Rupert I wondered whether she could come here as nurse to Baba A low whistle was Rupert s response then he said slowly You didn t suggest this to her did you You are so kind so impulsive but remember this girl is a perfect stranger She may be anything As you yourself told me two days ago you must have unimpeachable references with anyone who takes charge of Baba Of course I said nothing to her Now Rupert I know I am impulsive but I am not entirely devoid of all common sense Come and give me your opinion and I promise yes I absolutely promise to be guided by you Rupert s grey eyes smiled down with brotherly affection into his little cousin s face and he followed her obediently from the room and upstairs wondering vaguely why it was that much as he cared for and admired Cicely she had never inspired him with any deeper affection Like an elder brother to her from her earliest childhood the brotherly relation had continued between them after Cicely s marriage and it had been by her dead husband s most earnest wish and specified instructions that Mernside was one of her trustees and Baba s guardians and mister Redesdale had bidden his wife consult Rupert about everything connected with the estate and its baby heiress On the landing at the head of the stairs a small figure with flying golden curls and filmy white frock flung herself upon her mother shrieking delightedly Baba s runned away from Jane Now Baba come with mummy Oh Baba you are not a good baby Cicely exclaimed with an attempt at severity which only produced a chuckle from the small girl it is time mummy found a very stern nurse Nevertheless her appearance is opportune she said sotto voce to Rupert I told Miss Moore I would fetch Baba and I don t want her to feel she is being inspected Run on into mummy s boudoir sweetheart she added aloud to the child there s somebody there for Baba to see It was a pretty sight which greeted the two elders when a moment later they entered the rose coloured room and Rupert paused for an instant in the doorway to look and smile Baba after one short glance at the stranger who had risen from her chair made a rush across the room towards her clasped her round the knees and cried fervently Dat s Baba s lady what found her in the ugly fog Kiss Baba and at the moment of their entrance Rupert and Cicely saw the girl stoop and lift the baby in her arms with a tenderness that marked a true child lover and an absence of self consciousness induced by her ignorance that two pairs of eyes were fixed upon her Baba loves you very much the child babbled on her soft fingers touching Christina s white face and thank you for bringing Baba home Pretty lady she added suddenly Baba like when the pinky colour goes all up and down your cheeks For at that moment the girl had become aware of the presence not only of Lady Cicely but of a tall stranger with grave grey eyes and a rosy flush swept over the whiteness of her face Baba has not forgotten you the former said with her gay little laugh Rupert this is Miss Moore who so kindly brought naughty Baba home out of the fog My cousin is Baba s guardian Miss Moore and he is as grateful to you as I am Christina in her embarrassment did not observe Lady Cicely s omission of the tall stranger s surname Cicely herself was unconscious that she had not said it and Rupert was only intent on setting the girl at her ease Baba seems to be bestowing her own thanks in her own violent way he said as the child s dimpled arms were flung again round Christina s neck and her soft face pressed against the girl s flushed one but we all owe you a debt of gratitude for having found and brought her back London streets are not the safest place for little babies of that age with pearl necklaces round their necks That was what I thought Christina exclaimed impulsively at least I mean she stammered I couldn t help being glad that I was the first person to find her and that it was not one of the dreadful people who do prowl about in fogs who saw her first We are most thankful for that too Rupert answered and then being a man of the world he skilfully led the conversation to more general subjects until Christina was soon talking quietly and naturally with no more tremors or self consciousness When a few minutes later she rose to go Lady Cicely held her hands in a clasp that was very comforting to the weary girl and said gently I am not going to worry you with more thank yous but I want you to come and see me again in a day or two I think perhaps I may be able to hear of some work that would suit you As Christina wended her way homewards she felt tired though she was as if her feet trod on air Hope was once more fully alive within her Lady Cicely s lovely face and charming manner had bewitched the girl and she was sure quite quite sure that if the sweet little blue eyed lady said she would do something for her that something would infallibly be done And the tall cousin with the grave grey eyes and the mouth that seemed to Christina to be set in lines of pain Those grey eyes and that firmly set mouth haunted her during the whole course of her walk and through her mind there flashed unbidden the thought I wish I could comfort him I am sure he is unhappy Her way led her past the newspaper shop kept by mister Coles and the little man himself was standing at his door surveying the world There is a letter in here for you miss he said good naturedly it came yesterday morning and the wife and I made sure you d be in for it Christina started The events of the day had obliterated from her mind all recollection of the matrimonial advertisement and the letters that were to be addressed to mister Coles s shop The memory of Wednesday s disappointment came back to her and as mister Coles put into her hand a letter addressed C M in the same bold strong hand that had addressed the other letter her momentary inclination was to return it to its writer unopened Perhaps there is some explanation was her next and saner reflection and walking along the street she opened and read the letter feeling a certain compunction as she did so The address was still that of the newspaper office and the letter ran DEAR MADAM I deeply regret that you found the house at which I had asked you to call shut up I reached it a few minutes after you had left and to my own great surprise found as you had done no one there but a caretaker My friend must have been called away suddenly for on Tuesday when I saw her she most kindly arranged that her house should be at my disposal Please forgive what must have seemed to you most strange Would it suit you to arrange any meeting place that would accord with your wishes With renewed apologies Yours faithfully R MERNSIDE CHAPTER VII A VERY BEAUTIFUL PENDANT WITH THE INITIALS A V C With all her undoubted strength of character Christina was only human and the courteous apology she had received from the man signing himself Rupert Mernside sorely tempted her Curiosity to see the writer and a lurking feeling that he might really be able to find work for her were mingled with a girlish longing for adventure and for some of the youthful joys she had missed and all these sensations made her more than half inclined to assign a meeting place to this mister Mernside She had known few men either in her quiet Devonshire home or when she was in the Donaldsons service and any pleasant social intercourse with the other sex had never come in her way at all There rose before her a vision of meeting this man of the bold characteristic handwriting of perhaps being taken by him to tea in one of those tea rooms about which she had heard tea rooms where the waitresses were ladies dressed in soft lilac gowns with dainty muslin aprons and where delicious music was played to the fortunate tea drinkers To have tea in such a place with a man whose business it was for the moment to look exclusively after her and her well being would be such a treat as she had never enjoyed in all her life Her parents had not encouraged any social gaiety thinking over it now it seemed to Christina that for some inexplicable reason they had avoided society and actually warded off those of their neighbours who were inclined to be friendly And with a sudden revolt against her own loneliness and dullness the girl felt as though at any cost she must seek friendship amusement distraction Of course I haven t any clothes in which to go to a really smart tea room she thought when in the shelter of her own small room she read her letter for the second time but there maybe somewhere not too smart where he could take me and he leaves me to decide where to meet him and oh I do want some fun I do dreadfully want it The man who would be the central figure of the entertainment entered little into her calculations She was far more interested in her vision of tea rooms and the smart folk she might be fortunate enough to see there than in the man whose open sesame was to admit her to the sacred precincts And only when some chance train of thought reminded her of her recent interview with Lady Cicely did she reflect that the person who would sit beside her and attend to her wants at the tiny table in the enthralling tea room would be a stranger to her perhaps even an objectionable stranger With the remembrance of her visit to Eaton Square came also the recollection of the tall man with the grave grey eyes the man introduced to her by Lady Cicely as my cousin and a hot flush of shame rushed to her face as she wondered what he would think of her if he knew she was planning to meet a person she had never seen and of whom she had only heard through a matrimonial advertisement He would certainly despise her and it was not nice to contemplate the kindly glance of those eyes turned to scorn and contempt Although she knew it was absurd to suppose that Lady Cicely s cousin could ever be aware of or interested in the doings of so insignificant a person as herself she shrank oddly from doing anything of which he would disapprove To arrange to meet a strange man isn t really a very womanly thing to do she said when she sat down to write her letter to the unknown mister Mernside I shouldn t ever have answered the advertisement at all if I had not been so dreadfully poor and I shouldn t like to look Lady Cicely s cousin in the face again if I met this man The letter was not so difficult a one to write as the first had been and its recipient both smiled and sighed as he read the terse little sentences in the round girlish handwriting DEAR SIR Thank you for your kind letter but I hope I now have a chance of getting some work so that I need not trouble you any more Yours faithfully C MOORE Well that s a relief Rupert ejaculated throwing the note into the fire what I could have done with the girl if she had agreed to meet me heaven only knows Margaret would have helped me but Margaret His meditations ended abruptly he drew from his breast pocket a letter that had reached him a post or two before Christina s arrived and for the fiftieth time read it from end to end The sense of it had long since imprinted itself upon his brain but it gave him a painful pleasure to let his eyes rest upon the well formed letters of the handwriting though a resentful indignation towards the writer stirred within him She had not treated him well and yet she was the one woman in the world to him this woman of the dark eyes and rare white beauty who signed her letter with the one word Margaret No address stood at the head of the letter it was undated and the postmark was that of the West Central district Forgive me for having left London so abruptly and without telling you of my intention she wrote I was summoned away by telegram and in my hurry and anxiety I forgot to let you know I cannot tell you my address just now but Elizabeth is with me and I am safe and well I have often warned you have I not my dear faithful friend that much in my life must always seem to you strange and mysterious I can give you no explanation now But trust me still MARGARET Letters sent to me c o missus Milton one hundred eighty Gower Street will be forwarded Mernside wrote four letters each one of which in turn he tore up and flung into the fire as soon as it was written finally writing a fifth which appeared to satisfy him for having addressed and stamped it he put it into his pocket when he went out Drive sharply to one hundred eighty Gower Street were his directions to the driver as he swung himself into a passing hansom and leant forward on the closed doors watching the traffic with listless glances which only saw a woman s dark eyes set in a white face No sir I couldn t tell you missus Stanforth s address was the uncompromising reply to his question and missus Milton s inflexible countenance and flat rigid form were as uncompromising as her speech she bid me say to anyone enquiring that she was gone in the country for a time and I can only answer the same to you as I answers to the rest Letters and people they come on here from Barford Road and I says the same to all of em Rupert s creed as a gentleman forbade his pressing for the address of a woman who wished to keep herself hidden but with all the hatred of his sex for mysteries he moved impatiently away speculating grimly on the eccentricities of women Why when she had a house of her own did Margaret have her visitors and letters sent to Gower Street for information or re addressing respectively What object was being served by all this mysterious behaviour And why was she sometimes so apparently frank with him at other times so strangely secret True that her very uncertainty was part of her charm but without swerving in his unshakable loyalty to her he felt himself occasionally wishing that Margaret had some of the transparent candour of his little cousin Cicely Redesdale Cicely was incapable of dark secrets or hidden mysterious actions she and Baba were children together and one was scarcely more innocent and crystal pure than the other which reflections brought him by easy stages to his cousin s estates and his own trusteeship and the memory of a paper needing Cicely s signature made him retrace his steps to his own chambers and thence to Eaton Square where he found Cicely and her small daughter enjoying the delights of tea together in the bright nursery at the top of the house Jane has got a sick mother Cicely explained dolefully Jane was imperatively needed at home at an hour s notice and behold me head nurse and nursery maid rolled into one and Baba in the seventh heaven of bliss If you want any tea Rupert you must have it here hot buttered toast and all Dawson won t approve but I am tired of trying to live up to him Dawson was the butler a magnificent personage who had only condescended to anything more insignificant than a ducal mansion in consideration of mister Redesdale s generosity in the matter of wages and Dawson regarded any departure from the orthodox with disapproving eyes You will never succeed in reaching Dawson s criterion of correctness Rupert laughed meanwhile nursery tea is much jollier than the drawing room meal We can eat double as much and we can spread our own jam But you know Rupert I can t spend my whole life in the nursery Cicely began when the appetites of the baby and the big man had been partially satisfied Baba has chosen a new nurse for herself but I can t let her decide anything so important I am afraid you will call me quixotic if I say I am half inclined to Is it the young person James s young person her cousin broke in I knew that girl with the green eyes and shabby clothes was making indelible marks on your kind heart But you know nothing about her dear and as you told me you must have unimpeachable references Rupert to remind a woman of the things she has said in a remote past is like driving a pig towards the north when you want him to go there When you have a wife you will understand the inwardness of my remark I shall never have a wife was the quick retort and am I to infer from your remark that you are intending to engage a nurse who cannot produce the necessary references I don t know what she can produce yet but I have written to ask your green eyed friend of the shabby hat to come and see me and then I thought we could talk things over Then things are a foregone conclusion said Rupert with a laugh I know you Cicely The girl seemed to have a way with children she looked and spoke like a lady and And Baba loved her Cicely lowered her voice but the child absorbed in putting a consignment of dolls to bed gave no heed to her elders and ever since the girl came here Baba has gone on saying Baba would like that pretty lady to live with her can t the pretty lady come And sometimes children and dogs have wonderful instincts about people don t they Baba s instinct may be just the right one It may Let us hope it will There was something very straightforward about that girl s eyes and her voice was particularly pleasant It reminded me of somebody but who the somebody is I can t for the life of me remember By the way didn t you tell me the other day you knew of a nursery governess who wanted work Can she come and see me as well Perhaps you have found out more about her by now She has just succeeded in hearing of work Rupert answered and Cicely noticed that as before he spoke with a trace of embarrassment I have found out nothing more about her but I hear she is or hopes to be suited as the servants say I am very strongly inclined to try the girl who brought Baba in from the fog Something about her appealed to me and she must be able to produce some kind of reference She can t just have growed like Topsy into her present position Oh Dawson who and what is it she broke off to say as the butler s stately form and impassive face appeared in the doorway Sir Arthur Congreve wishes to see your ladyship very particularly was the reply I will be down in one moment she answered and when the door had closed noiselessly after the butler she turned to Rupert and made a small grimace Now what has brought that tiresome old person here to day she demanded of the world in general you don t know him do you He is a cousin of John s and the most intolerable bore ever created to worry his long suffering relations I know him by name naturally but I never had the pleasure Come and have it now Cicely sprang to her feet and rang the bell I must get a housemaid to take care of Baba and you come and be introduced to my pet bugbear He and his wife hardly ever come to town They look upon it as modern Babylon sunk in iniquity He is hugely rich and their jewels are amazing but very few people ever see them He lives in a very remote corner of the country somewhere on the Welsh border about ten miles from every reasonable sort of place and my private opinion is that he is more mad than sane Why Oh a woman s reason I think him so because I think him so No but without joking all sorts of queer things have happened in that family dark mysteries and I fancy even crimes but John never told me details Sir Arthur is a most unspeakably conventional person but I believe some of his relations were quite the reverse Come and help me entertain him she added when a housemaid had entered the nursery he will probably disapprove of you and tell me later on that your presence in the house is damaging to my reputation she added as they went down the stairs together The elderly gentleman who stood on the drawing room hearthrug surveying the room with an air of disapproval was Rupert thought one of the handsomest men he had ever seen White haired with a heavy white moustache his complexion was clear and healthy as a girl s and his refined well cut features were almost cameo like in their perfect chiselling His eyes were dark and very bright and they fixed themselves at once upon Rupert with a glance of suspicion My dear Cicely he said shaking her stiffly by the hand urgent business tiresome family business brought me to this city of dreadful night for a few hours and I thought I must call and enquire after your health and the health of Veronica Thank you Cousin Arthur do sit down I am very flourishing and Baba is in rude health We don t call her Veronica yet you know she is really only quite a baby still I strongly deprecate the calling of children by fancy names Sir Arthur answered pompously Veronica is a name in our family a name about which alas cling many sad associations But still I am convinced that if her poor father had lived your poor daughter I haven t introduced you to my cousin Cicely cut in unceremoniously feeling that any comments upon her husband s possible conduct would be unendurable from Sir Arthur s lips I believe you have never met him mister Mernside Sir Arthur Congreve Sir Arthur bowed stiffly Rupert s greeting was pleasant and friendly the older man s rigid attitude merely amused him No I have certainly never met mister Mernside Sir Arthur said coldly as you know my dear Cicely I never come to this terrible Babylon unless absolutely driven to do so by irresistible circumstances And in your husband s lifetime I do not ever remember to have seen your cousin he added with a severe glance at Mernside If you had been much in town in John s lifetime you would often have met Rupert Cicely answered quickly Rupert was one of John s greatest friends and is Baba s trustee and guardian But you she tried to speak more lightly you and Cousin Ellen bury yourselves so completely in your country fastness that you know nothing of the troublesome world in which we live Troublesome world indeed answered Sir Arthur wagging his head and looking at her solemnly The saving grace of humour had been omitted from his composition and he took himself and the whole world with a seriousness that could not be shaken in this dreadful city you frolic like children on the edge of a volcano but one day the eruption will come and And then we shall all be little bits of lava shan t we Cicely asked her blue eyes wide and innocent her lips parted in an engaging smile You are sadly flippant Cicely I had hoped that walking through the vale of misery your flippancy would have fallen from you But I fear you are determined to turn this vale of tears this troublesome world as you so justly call it into a mere playground A very delightful vale sometimes Rupert said in his slow charming voice the troublesome world can be beautiful as well as troublesome you will allow especially if you live in the country Beautiful Sir Arthur glared at the speaker But all to be burnt some day all to be burnt When I am asked to admire the mountains near my home the woods the river I say the same thing always I say It is all being prepared for the burning Perhaps we may enjoy its beauties during the time of preparation Rupert said smiling until the conflagration the beauty is ours I did not call to day to engage in flippant small talk Sir Arthur answered sternly Like Babylon of old London is rushing on its doom and I have no doubt that the fashionable throng which numbers you amongst its members has long ago resigned every serious thought and effort Conversation is as loose as manners and morals and My manners and morals are not conspicuously loose Cousin Arthur Cicely said demurely but I don t belong to the smart set and I don t even want to belong to it and I expect that is what you meant by the fashionable throng We live very quietly Baba and I Quietly In all this luxury this pomp Sir Arthur glanced round the exquisite room with a shudder One of my designs in coming here to day was to ask whether you would ever care to come and pay us a visit at Burnbrooke but we could offer you no such luxury as this If however you would care to come we have peace there It is very kind of you and of Cousin Ellen to have thought of it Cicely faltered with a recollection of a depressing fortnight spent in Sir Arthur s home during her husband s lifetime perhaps in the spring or summer you would let us come and see you We have been away so frequently during the last three years that we have seen few people My poor wife being a martyr to rheumatism has had to visit foreign watering places we have as you know been little at home and we have invited few guests to Burnbrooke If you will come we shall be happy to see you or if at any time you would care to send Veronica with her nurse to breathe some other air than the pernicious air of this dark town pray send them Cicely made a courteous and smiling rejoinder but Rupert thought he could read in the mutinous setting of her pretty lips that she had small intention of allowing her little daughter to breathe the salubrious air of Burnbrooke You are in town on business only not for pleasure the little lady asked taking a certain malicious delight in seeing Sir Arthur s start of horror Pleasure I here for pleasure Heaven forbid I have come on troublesome business I am anxious about the news of my unfortunate brother in law and his wife my poor foolish sister Ah well you never knew her did you No never Cicely shook her head wildly trying to unearth from the depths of her mind any fragments of knowledge she might ever have possessed about Sir Arthur s brother in law but finding herself entirely at sea gave up the attempt Poor misguided soul the visitor went on with a solemn shake of the head she would never listen to reason never believe what I told her My sisters Ah well well I must not trouble you with our family skeletons I have come up to try and find out if I can where my brother in law is and to avert worse scandals than already exist Cicely still completely at sea as to the drift of his conversation murmured something non committal and sympathetic and he continued speaking with unabated energy I also have some business to do with Scotland Yard he said importantly my wife has lost a piece of jewellery which she greatly values and which I also value exceedingly The loss is a very strange one and after serious deliberation I have decided to put the case into the hands of the Scotland Yard officials Have you had a burglary No nothing of that kind at all We can only account for the loss in one way We were travelling home last week after a visit and at Liverpool station my wife s maid put her mistress s dressing bag into the carriage she herself standing beside the door One person was in the compartment a quiet looking young lady so the maid describes her We reached home My wife discovered the loss of the jewel she so much values It had been put into the bag at the last minute before we left our friends house as she had been showing it to a visitor The bag it is true was unlocked but the maid vows she did not leave the carriage door and that the young person in the carriage seemed to be a lady The fact remains that the pendant has vanished A pendant was it Cicely asked with interest A very beautiful pendant one that to my mind is unique It is made of a single and very remarkable emerald set in beautifully chased gold and above the emerald there are three initials twisted together in gold the initials A V C CHAPTER VIII IT IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH And the Prince had the dearest face in all the world It was not exactly handsome but it was very strong and when you looked at it you knew that he was good And his eyes were grey and very kind and And did he wear white armour all shining and a silver crown on his head Baba s voice clear and imperious interrupted Christina s dreamy tones and her dimpled fingers seized and shook the girl s hand in order to attract her attention which as the baby was vaguely aware had wandered from the fairy tale in process of being told Did the Prince have white armour Yes I expect so Christina answered with momentary hesitation flushing as a vision flashed into her mind of a tall figure in well cut dark blue serge that bore no resemblance whatever to silver armour he he put on armour when he had to go and fight dragons but when he was in the Castle with the lovely Princess he wore a velvet tunic dark blue velvet and a silver crown upon his head And

none	none	 was just zactly like you Baba said lovingly pressing her golden head more closely against Christina s breast and looking into the girl s face with adoring eyes just zactly like my pretty lady Christina laughed softly running her hands through the child s curls and bending down to kiss the uplifted face You are a little monkey Baba she said and a flatterer You mustn t call Christina a pretty lady She isn t a bit pretty and she s only just your nurse Baba will call Christina just zactly what she likes the child answered sturdily enunciating her words with the clearness often found in an only child who is constantly with grown up people Christina s a very pretty lady and Baba loves her Baba s a goose and we must put on our things and go out in the sunshine and see what we can find in these nice lanes She put the child off her lap and going into an adjacent room brought out the red cloak in which she had first seen her and wrapped it round Baba s graceful little form drawing the hood over the golden curls Barely a fortnight had gone by since Christina had first entered Lady Cicely s service after an interview which had ended precisely as Rupert had laughingly declared it would end in the engagement of Christina as Baba s nurse The references the girl had produced from her late employer missus Donaldson from an old clergyman who had known her in Devonshire and from her father s solicitor had seemed to Cicely to justify her in taking this step even though the Donaldsons were in Canada the old clergyman dead and the solicitor gone to South Africa She looks genuine I am sure she is genuine the little lady said afterwards to Rupert and she was so overwhelmed with delight and gratitude at the idea of coming to us No doubt she was Rupert responded drily well no great harm can come of giving her a month s trial I am glad you had the saving grace to suggest that And during the month you will be able to see what she is made of But the month had not fallen out quite as Rupert had naturally supposed that it would Lady Cicely driven nearly distracted by a scare of scarlet fever in the near neighbourhood and unable to use Bramwell Castle which was in the builder s hands had sent Christina and Baba off almost at a moment s notice to Graystone In this remote hamlet on a remote Sussex border missus Nairne an old servant of the Staynes family owned a small farmhouse and also received lodgers and here for the past ten days Christina and her little charge had been rejoicing in the country sights and sounds which even in early December had a fascination all their own To Baba the farmyard was an unfailing source of delight and to Christina the great spaces of moorland the deep lanes the woods whose soft brown hues gave colour to the hillsides were a welcome change from London streets and the squalor of London lodgings To the girl who for so long had been tossing on a sea of struggle and privation her quiet life at Graystone was like a haven of rest and her one passionate prayer was that at the end of her month of probation she might still find favour in Lady Cicely s eyes and keep the situation which seemed to her a more delightful one than she had ever dared to hope for in her wildest dreams With the help of a little pony cart she and the child could make quite lengthy excursions about the country side and Christina often found herself wondering why it was the fashion to talk as if there were no beauties to be found in the country in winter time She revelled in the great sweeps of moorland that rolled away to far hills on the horizon hills scarcely less blue than the soft blue of the winter sky And if the moorlands were no longer clad in their robe of purple heather or pale pink ling the duns and browns of heath and bracken the dark green of fir trees and the brightly tinted leaves of the bilberry plants offered no lack of colour On the oaks in the lanes bright brown leaves still hung and the trees that were leafless delicate birches sturdy ashes smooth stemmed beeches made so dainty a lacework of bare boughs against their background of sky that the leaflessness was in itself beautiful The sunlight poured a flood of radiance on the upland road as Christina and Baba jogged peacefully along it in the wake of the small black pony who meandered on at his own pace just as the fancy took him Larks sang in the sunlight in the copse under the hill the thrushes were already beginning to learn their songs of spring and Christina drinking in all the loveliness about her laughed aloud for sheer gladness of heart They had driven for some distance along the main road when they came to a spot where four roads met and towards one of them Baba pointed a fat forefinger Let s go along there she said it s such a ducky wee road and there s a pond Christina was lain to confess that the road indicated had special attractions of its own It wound down from the upland between hedges which in summer must be a tangled loveliness of briar roses honeysuckle and clematis and skirting a common where a pond reflected the sunshine on its small ruffled waves turned down again between woods that climbed steeply up the hill side on either hand The lane narrowed as it wound onwards and Christina was beginning to wonder whether it would end in a mere grassy track when she saw a clearing in the woods on the right hand side and became aware of chimney pots showing above a very high wall What an extraordinarily lonely place the girl reflected looking with a little shudder at the height of the wall and at the dense woods which hemmed it in on every side Excepting where the space for the actual house itself had been cleared and where the lane meandered past it it was entirely shut in by woods beech oak and birch on the lower levels pines climbing upward to the summit closing the building in from all observation Thanks to the steep hills and the overhanging woods only a very small proportion of sunshine could filter into the lane and Christina shivered again feeling that there was something sinister about this secluded spot and the house that was barely visible behind its encircling walls Baba thinks p raps the Princess lives behind there said the baby looking with round blue eyes at the frowning walls it s a awful dreadful place and p raps the Dragon s got the Princess safe in there and she s waiting for the Prince to come and get her out The Prince will come in his shining armour Christina answered brightly and then the Princess will come away and be happy ever after At the moment they were driving past a green door in the wall and as she spoke these words the door was hurriedly opened and a tall woman stepped out into the lane She was closely wrapped in a dark cloak and some magnificent black lace draped her hair But it was the sight of her face that made Christina draw in her breath sharply for she thought she had never seen anything more beautiful than its white loveliness anything more sad than the glance of the great dark eyes She panted a little as though she had been running there was a strange mingling of fear and anguish in her expression and she held up her hand with so pleading a gesture that Christina pulled up and leaning from the cart said gently Is there anything I can do for you The dark eyes met hers a startled look one would almost have said a look of recognition swept over the white face then she exclaimed breathlessly Why I thought you were I beg your pardon it was foolish of me of course I have never seen you before No never Christina answered emphatically knowing that the lovely face of this woman once seen could never have faded from her memory but I am afraid you are in trouble can I help you A doctor the other panted I must have a doctor and yet I am afraid I am afraid she wrung her hands together and her lips quivered pitifully We are driving back to Graystone Can I send a doctor if there is one in the place Or can I send over to the nearest town Christina asked struck afresh by the anguish in the other s eyes and realising that only some vital necessity could so have moved her I must have a doctor the words were reiterated and the woman put her hands upon the cart and leant heavily against it I can t let him die and yet no one must know if the doctor comes here she exclaimed suddenly pulling herself upright and speaking fast and earnestly not a living soul must ever know and the doctor himself If you find a doctor for me promise to make him swear that he will never divulge where he has been or what he sees in this house Christina looked the bewilderment she felt and a faint wonder flashed across her mind whether this woman could be sane Her speech savoured of melodrama her hurried breathless sentences the nervous glances she cast over her shoulder and the strangeness of the words she spoke all tended to make the girl doubt the speaker s sanity But the dark eyes unfathomable and sad as they were looked straight into hers without a trace of madness and though she was plainly afraid of something or somebody it was not the unreasoning fear of insanity Is there someone ill in that house the girl questioned practically is it of great importance to have a doctor It is a matter of life and death was the broken answer when I heard wheels in the lane I came out hoping it might be someone who would help me I cannot leave him myself I have no one to send it is all that my servant and I can do to manage she pulled herself up abruptly adding after a moment for pity s sake help me if you can I will do the best I can Christina answered bewildered surprise still her dominant sensation I am a stranger in Graystone We are only staying in a farmhouse there but by hook or by crook I will get a doctor for you I think you will carry through whatever you undertake the other answered a smile flitting across the wan misery of her face as her eyes rested on the girl s square chin and firmly cut lips you look as if you would not easily be beaten Christina smiled back at her and shook her head I was very nearly beaten a little while ago she said gathering up the reins and preparing to turn the pony s head up the steep ascent again when one is poor and hungry all the fight seems to go out of one But I don t like being beaten and I shall find a doctor for you She nodded her head cheerily and was touching the pony lightly with the whip when the stranger clutched the side of the cart again and laid a hand on the girl s shoulder Remember no one must be told that the doctor is coming here and he himself must be sworn sworn to secrecy Promise me you will not tell a soul you have seen me not a living soul She was labouring under strong excitement and it alarmed Christina to notice how the whiteness of her face had extended to her very lips and what black shadows of suffering and fear lay under her eyes Promise she repeated her grasp tightening on Christina s shoulder I promise Christina answered slowly I will not tell anyone that I have seen you or what you have said to me and I will do as you wish about the doctor Having received the girl s assurance the woman drew back from the cart and stood watching it retrace its way up the hill her hands wrung together in anguish her dark eyes wide with pain Baba had been a silent spectator of the strange little scene understanding very little of what passed between her two elders but watching the face of the beautiful stranger with an intent scrutiny curious in one so young That was a beautiful Princess she said after the cart had driven a short distance Baba hopes the Prince will come soon and take her right away Perhaps he will Christina answered absently relieved that the child had woven the strange lady into a fairy tale thus obviating the possibility that close attention would be paid to remarks Baba might make about their encounter with her and speculating vainly over all that she had just heard and seen and over the striking personality of the woman who had commissioned her to do so strange an errand Resourceful as nature and necessity had made her Christina was nevertheless a little puzzled to think how she could make enquiries about a doctor without betraying what she had been especially conjured to keep secret but during the drive home her plans were matured and having reached the farm and put Baba into her cot for her afternoon nap she went to the kitchen in search of missus Nairne That worthy dame was engaged in making scones for tea and turned a flushed but kindly face to Christina who had already won her heart Well missy you and the precious baby s had a nice drive and I m sure you re wise and right to take her out early in the sunshine and let her rest a bit before her tea a prettier baby never was She is a darling Christina answered and if she hadn t the sweetest most wholesome nature in the world she would be spoilt everybody adores her so There and who can wonder miss The little dear I was baking some scones for her tea and yours miss and That is very good of you missus Nairne I was going to ask whether you would be so kind as to look in upon Baba presently she is asleep in her cot and quite safe there But if you would look at her now and then I should be so grateful I haven t had the cart sent round to the stables for I must go up to the post office And I ll do it with pleasure miss You go out with a light heart no harm shall come to that little dear that I ll promise you The post office which occupied one side of the tiny general shop was at the end of the straggling row of houses Graystone called its village street and mister Canning the postmaster besides watching over His Majesty s mails served customers with bacon and butter sweets or string sugar or tea as occasion required He was weighing out very brown and moist looking Demarara sugar when Christina entered the shop and he looked at her over his spectacles with all the absorbing interest felt by a villager for the stranger in their midst A shillingsworth of penny stamps please Christina said when with much deliberation he had tied up the parcel of brown sugar and handed it to his customer and a packet of halfpenny cards Then when the customer had departed she asked a few questions about the neighbourhood adding with well feigned carelessness I suppose in such a small place as this you have no resident doctor Well no miss the man answered we have no one nearer than doctor Stokes doctor Martin Stokes He lives on the other side of the hill at Manborough I hope the little lady is not ailing mister Canning asked sympathetically for Baba s gracious little personality had endeared itself to the postmaster and to the rest of the villagers No oh no Christina answered quickly she is very well and we like this lovely place so much It is a good thing though to know where the doctor lives isn t it she added brightly and evasively Ah there you are right miss Getting the doctor in time saves fetching the undertaker as I ve said more than once and mister Canning bowed Christina out of his shop with all the empressement of a courtier Manborough the other side of the hill It was as the girl knew at least three miles off and Sandro the fat pony who stood lazily flicking his tail before the shop door was not to be hurried under any circumstances A matter of life and death Those words and the anguished tones in which they had been uttered recurred to her as she stood looking thoughtfully up the village street and before her eyes rose the white agonised face of the woman who uttered them I think you will carry through whatever you undertake Other words spoken in that same voice came back to the girl s thoughts and she looked with a puzzled frown at Jem the farm boy who stood at the pony s head Taking the short cut over the moor I believe I can walk there as quickly as Master Sandro would joggle along the main road she reflected saying aloud after that second of reflection You can take the cart back Jem and please ask missus Nairne if she will be so very kind as to give Miss Baba her tea and say I have been detained The boy nodded and drove off whilst Christina walked away in the opposite direction following the main road to Manborough until she reached a point some way beyond the village where a steep path the short cut she had recollected struck across the open moorland She had just reached this point and was about to turn into the by path when the hoot of a motor sounded behind her and turning she saw a large car coming slowly up the road It contained only two occupants and with a leap of the heart at her own audacity Christina suddenly resolved to stop them and ask for their help A matter of life and death the words still rang in her ears and with the resourcefulness in emergency which belonged to her character she held up her hand to the two men in the car and signalled to them to stop The great car instantly slowed down and Christina flushing rosily at her own audacity stepped forward to speak to one of the two men who bent towards her Both were gentlemen she saw at once and one of them she recognised and her heart almost stopped beating when her eyes met the grey eyes of Lady Cicely s cousin He looked at her with grave courtesy but evidently with no idea that he had ever seen her before and indeed on the one and only occasion when they had met in Lady Cicely s boudoir he had paid very scant attention to the girl beyond observing that she was white and thin and very shabbily dressed The girl who stood now beside his car was neatly and becomingly gowned in garments of soft dark green which had the effect of making her eyes look very deep and green she was flushing rosily and becomingly and the wind blew her dark hair into fascinating little curls about her forehead Oh please forgive me for stopping you she exclaimed breathlessly but are you going to Manborough Yes Rupert answered we are going through Manborough Is there anything we can do for you Christina noticed again as she had noticed on the occasion of their first meeting the peculiarly musical quality of his voice its tones sent little thrills running along her pulses and a dreamy conviction crept over her that if only he would go on speaking she could willingly stand here for ever listening to his deep vibrating voice His question roused her to the absurdity of her thoughts and flushing more vividly she answered I hardly dare ask you what flashed into my mind to ask when I stopped you But I am very anxious to get quickly over to Manborough to the doctor it is an urgent case and I Of course we will drive you over Rupert broke in quickly opening the door and holding out his hand to help her into the back part of the car I am very glad we happened to be passing It was dreadfully audacious of me to stop you Christina answered smiling in response to his smile but I do so want to get to the doctor as fast as I can and when I saw the car I thought of nothing but what I wanted to do Rupert glanced back at her an amused twinkle in his grey eyes You don t let obstacles hinder your attaining your goal he questioned I don t think I do was the reply and especially when it is a matter of real importance one of life and death By this time they were whirling along the road at a pace which rendered conversation difficult and Christina sat back in her comfortable seat looking first at the man who had spoken to her and was now steering the machine then at his companion who sat beside him Now that Rupert was no longer smiling pleasantly at her she observed how grave and worn was his face what new deep lines seemed to have carved themselves about his mouth what a shadow of pain or of some gnawing anxiety lay in his eyes He is in trouble the girl thought her heart contracting with pity as her eyes rested on the strong rugged face I wish I could help him he looks as if he had lost something he cared for with all his soul and it is breaking his heart From the strong face with its lines of pain her eyes turned to his companion a slight alert man military in build and with fair good humoured features devoid of any marked personality His blue eyes had brightened when Christina stopped the car and whilst she talked to Rupert he watched her expressive face with growing admiration They had only proceeded a short distance on their journey when he turned round to the girl and said kindly We are going a great pace and you are not dressed for motoring you must be cold Will you wrap yourself in this and drawing from behind him a heavy fur coat which he had brought as an extra wrap if necessary he handed it to Christina who gratefully rolled herself in its warm folds By Jove she looks more fetching than ever with her face looking out of all that fur the blue eyed young man reflected when he again glanced over his shoulder at her those green eyes of hers are like no others I ever saw and Christina little as she was in the habit of considering such things could not help noticing how often during their three miles drive the young man turned to look at her or to shout a remark The grey eyed man looked round only once to say shortly but kindly Quite comfortable But even those two words in the vibrating voice had as before an oddly thrilling effect on Christina s pulses That rapid drive across the moorland in the low sunlight of the December afternoon seemed to her for long afterwards like part of some extraordinary dream a dream in which she and the grey eyed man and the beautiful white faced woman were all playing parts a dream which had no real relation at all to the commonplace details of everyday life Here is Manborough Rupert called out when over the brow of a steep hill they came in sight of clustering red roofed houses amongst pine woods now where does the doctor live What is his name Doctor Martin Stokes is his name I don t know what his house is called but Manborough is only a small place Christina answered If you will very kindly put me down in the main street I shall easily find the right house Oh no we will drive you up in state was the laughing rejoinder and the car once more slowed down whilst Rupert put a question to a passing rustic who jerked his thumb to the right Doctor s house be up among they pines he said Doctor calls un Pinewood Lodge Unromantic and ordinary person that doctor said Rupert with a short laugh this country and those woods might inspire a man to invent a name with some sort of poetry in it Ah here is the lodge in question and as ordinary as its name he concluded stopping the car before a closed brown gate through which a well kept drive led to a red brick house that might have been transplanted bodily to these heights from a London suburb I don t know how to say thank you properly Christina said a little tremulously when she stood by the brown gate helped out of the car by the blue eyed young man who had skilfully forestalled Rupert in this act of gallantry it is very very good of you to have helped me and will you please forgive me for being so bold and stopping you as I did Rupert laughed and held out his hand Don t think twice about it he said heartily I am very glad you did stop the car and very glad we were able to save so much time for you I hope the doctor will pull your patient well through the illness His hand closed over Christina s small one the blue eyed man likewise shook her by the hand and before the door bell of the doctor s house had been answered the car had whirled out of sight Poor little girl she was very prettily grateful Rupert said to his companion I wonder whose illness she is agonising over Plucky thing to do stopping us as she did She is a young woman of resource the other answered I like that sort of git up and git way of tackling a difficulty Now in her place I should have just begun to think what might have happened if I had stopped somebody s car by the time the car was two miles further down the road My dear Wilfred you hit your own character to a nicety Rupert answered with a laugh but it s only your confounded laziness of mind that prevents your being as much on the spot as that little green eyed girl Very fetching eyes too Wilfred mused aloud and a smile that she ought to find useful Can t we come back this way to morrow old man We might find she wanted some errand done in the opposite direction and I ll keep a sharp look out for her all along the road As it happens I have every intention of coming back this way Rupert answered drily though not in order to enable you to rescue distressed damsels You were not intended for a knight errant my good Wilfred leave well alone But I am bound to come back through Graystone I promised Cicely that on my way home from Lewes I would look in on Baba and her new nurse They are lodging at old missus Nairne s farm and it s somewhere near Graystone village Cicely wants to know whether the new nurse is all she should be we will look in upon them on our way back CHAPTER IX A VERY BEAUTIFUL LADY The doctor s consulting room was as uninteresting as the rest of the house inside and out and whilst Christina looked at the orthodox red walls the few conventional engravings the closely curtained windows and the severely correct chairs and tables a feeling of depression stole over her Almost unconsciously she had hoped that the doctor of whom she had come in search would prove to be an individual of no ordinary description she had an odd fancy that the situation with which he would have to deal would be one that was out of the common and the bare thought of sending a commonplace country doctor to help the beautiful lady with the anguished face was intolerable to her More than once whilst she sat and waited in the dreary room whose outlook into the depths of the pine woods was as depressing as everything else about it she half rose with a determination to go elsewhere and seek another doctor Remembering however the urgency of her message and the uncertainty of finding another medical man within any reasonable distance she was deterred from acting upon this impulse though her heart sank with apprehension when the door at last opened But the man who entered was in no sense the kind of man she had dreaded to see there was nothing ordinary or commonplace either in his own personality or in his greeting of her and Christina could only feel devoutly thankful that she had not been misled by the mere externals of house and furniture Now will you tell me what I can do for you The voice was cheery and kind it gave her a sense of helpfulness and the man s personality like his voice brought into the room an atmosphere of power and strength He was a short man with very bright brown eyes a clean shaven face and a mouth in which humour and determination struggled for the mastery But beyond and above everything else it was a reliable face Christina knew with a subtle and sure instinct that whatever this man undertook would be carried through if heaven and earth had to be moved to bring about the carrying Doctor Stokes she said enquiringly No I am not Doctor Stokes he answered Doctor Stokes is away he was summoned away suddenly My name is Fergusson and I am doing Doctor Stokes s work I am very glad Christina exclaimed naively with a fervour of which she was not aware until she saw the twinkle of amusement in the brown eyes watching her Oh I beg your pardon she stammered I ought not It is not my pardon you must beg the doctor answered laughing a spontaneous and very boyish laugh and I will promise not to tell Doctor Stokes what you said he added his eyes still twinkling as he saw the girl s confusion But indeed please oh do understand she faltered I don t know Doctor Stokes I am a stranger here and I never saw him in my life but Then why were you so glad to find I was not he asked Fergusson his amused look turning to one of puzzled enquiry It sounds so silly Christina said with seeming irrelevance but I didn t think the person who lived in this kind of room was the sort of doctor I wanted to find Fergusson threw back his head and laughed Do you judge all humanity by the rooms in which it lives he asked Nobody but a commonplace person could live contentedly in a room like this Christina answered vehemently or call his house Pinewood Lodge or have a house just like this house I rather agree with you but Doctor Stokes is a total stranger to me too we may be libelling him entirely and meanwhile what can I do for you I have come to ask you to go somewhere on a matter of life and death she answered but Life and death the doctor s smiling face grew grave then we must not delay Where am I wanted He touched a bell by the fireplace I will order the car at once Tell me all details as briefly as possible His humorous accent had dropped he spoke in terse business like tones his brown eyes looked searchingly at her Bring the car round immediately he said to a man who answered his bell Now tell me everything quickly he went on turning back to Christina Before you go I have to ask you to promise not to tell any living soul where you have been and you must swear to tell nobody what you see and hear when you get to the house Fergusson stared at her blankly Swear secrecy about where I go and what I find there he said Yes swear it she answered quailing a little before the sudden sternness of his eyes But why in heaven s name why he questioned his voice growing imperious What reason can you have for making such extraordinary conditions Oh I have nothing to do with the conditions Christina cried and please please don t look doubtful and as if you didn t mean to do what I ask I have only come here as a messenger There was nobody else to send and the poor beautiful lady seemed nearly distracted with grief What poor beautiful lady You are talking in riddles Try to tell me quietly where I have to go and what is the name of the lady who needs me I don t know Christina faltered conscious of how strangely her words must fall upon his ears when she saw the bewilderment deepen on his face I was passing a house she said quickly before he could speak and a lady came running out a very beautiful lady She asked me to fetch a doctor She said it was a matter of life and death and she made me promise to ask the doctor to swear secrecy absolute secrecy That is all I know really all I know But I am sure she is urgently in need of help What an extraordinary story the doctor said in a low voice and you don t know who is ill or what is the matter Not in the least I conclude the patient is a man because the lady spoke of him and he but I know nothing more than I have told you You will go to her You will make the promise she asks I can t bear to think of her sad beautiful face and her wonderful eyes I will go yes certainly I will go Fergusson exclaimed after a moment s pause if it is really a matter of life and death I have no choice but to go And you will promise He looked into her face with a curiously grave and questioning glance You know of no reason why I should refuse to take such an unprecedented oath he asked I know nothing she answered emphatically I know of no reason either for or against your doing it Only when I think of her beautiful face and of her eyes that seemed to hold all the sorrow in the world I feel as if you could only do what she asked you And if I refuse to swear Then I shall refuse to tell you where the lady lives she answered with spirit and I shall go and find another doctor But oh please do what she asks A smile broke over Fergusson s grave face I don t half like the business he said I am not fond of swearing in the dark so to speak and what guarantee have I that I am not going to mix myself up in some discreditable affair The lady I saw could not do anything discreditable Christina exclaimed warmly it is unthinkable Fergusson s smile deepened She has a warm advocate in you you are not a friend of hers I never saw her before Christina answered I am staying near Graystone I am nurse to Lady Cicely Redesdale s little girl and it was only by chance that we were passing the beautiful lady s house to day There comes the car Fergusson said as the crunching of wheels on gravel became audible now I will drive you as far as our ways go together and you shall tell me where I am to go I will not take my man lest there should be any risk of my destination being discovered And I will take the required oath Mind I do it much against my will but if it is a matter of life and death I can t refuse it Come your beautiful lady s secrets will be absolutely safe with me As well as she was able Christina gave a minute description of the lonely house in the valley where she had received the strange message and Fergusson having deposited her safely within a very few hundred yards of missus Nairne s farm raced on across the moor and down the steep lane which the little cart had traversed so short a time before Never knew there was any house down here he mused as he drove further and further along the lane uncanny sort of place The short December day was drawing to a close No ray of the sunshine that still shone on the moorland above penetrated into this valley whose steep thickly wooded sides threw deep shadows across it What on earth possessed anybody to build a house in this gloomy hole when all the uplands were there to be built upon So Fergusson s musings ran on whilst the shadows thickened round him the gloom of the place beginning to oppress him like a nightmare The roughness and steepness of the road obliged him to proceed slowly and with great caution and the fast fading light made his progress a difficult one It was a relief to him therefore when through the semi darkness he became aware of a high stone wall on his right and descried above the wall the dim outline of a chimney from which smoke issued This presumably is the place he muttered stopping the car before a door in the wall and now how does one get into such a very prison like abode He had by this time alighted and was standing in the lane looking first at the closed green door then at the frowning wall and finally up the steep way by which he had come a way which in the fast falling darkness was beginning to resemble a long black tunnel Now that the sound of his car s machinery had ceased the silence around him was very eerie and Fergusson found that some words of the burial service were beating backwards and forwards in his brain The grave and gate of death The grave and gate of death He made a great effort to shake off his uncanny sensations but they were only heightened by the gloom about him and by the death like silence which brooded over the valley The lane as he could faintly see ended only a few yards beyond the gate at which he stood and merged itself into a grassy track amongst the densest woodland and the house with its surrounding wall was so enclosed by woods that they seemed to be on the point of swallowing it up altogether What a place for a crime for any number of crimes Fergusson reflected with a shudder as he peered about the green door trying to discover any means of making his presence known to the inmates of the house beyond the wall But neither bell nor knocker was visible and the doctor after banging vainly on the wood of the door moved away and walked slowly round the wall seeking for another entrance A narrow grass grown path evidently rarely used ran close under the wall but Fergusson made the whole circuit of the place without finding any other means of entrance excepting an old iron gate rusty with age choked up with weeds and rank grass It was obvious that the gate had not been opened for years and that it was certainly not reckoned by the inhabitants of the house as one of the entrances Fergusson peered through the bars but the light was so dim and the grass and undergrowth so thick and high that beyond getting an impression of a neglected garden he saw nothing He fancied however that he could catch a distant murmur of voices and he called out loudly Is there any means of getting in here I am the doctor Total silence answered him a silence only broken by the sharp clang of a closing door inside the house When the echoes of the sharply clanging door died away silence settled down more deeply than ever upon the place and Fergusson as he completed his circuit of the walls and found himself once more at the green door felt strongly tempted to climb into his car again and drive away But the remembrance of the girl who had so lately stood in his consulting room looking at him with wistful eyes speaking in so appealing a voice determined him to make one more attempt to gain access to the inaccessible house and lifting up his hands he battered on the green door with heavy thuds that reverberated loudly in the silence They must be all deaf or dead if that fails to bring them out he exclaimed grimly pausing for a moment to take breath then when no one responded to his efforts he was beginning again to hammer at the door when the sound of a footstep fell on his ears and a woman s voice from within the gate cried Who is there The doctor doctor Fergusson he answered impatiently and upon that he heard the grinding of a key in the lock bolts were shot back and the door was opened A woman stood in the aperture a woman whom Fergusson took to be a servant and she stood aside a little as though inviting him to enter I was asked to come here he said Is there someone ill Am I wanted Yes sir the woman answered quietly Will you come in I am sorry there was any delay in answering the door but I couldn t get away Her voice was low and shaken and Fergusson now observed that she was trembling violently Come in quickly sir she jerked out I am afraid what may happen come quickly Whilst she spoke she was locking and bolting the green door again then without uttering another syllable she led the way up a flagged path across a bare and deserted garden to a white stone house through whose open front door a stream of light fell across an unkempt overgrown lawn This way sir the woman said when having entered the door she turned across a wide hall this way quickly As she uttered the last word a little cry broke the stillness of the house a woman s cry sharp with fear and the doctor s guide her face suddenly grown livid and pinched broke into a run They were passing along a corridor which intersected the hall at one end and even in his hurry Fergusson noticed the thickness of the carpet beneath his feet and the heavy curtains that shrouded the windows on his right noticed too that after that one short sharp cry a silence had fallen over the house again a silence as sinister and uncanny as that in the valley outside His guide paused before a door on their left and as she turned her plain but kindly face towards him he saw how strained and ashen it had grown and what a great fear looked out of her eyes It is so quiet she whispered in low horror stricken accents so quiet I am afraid Pushing her aside Fergusson opened the door ashamed of feeling how hard his own heart was knocking against his ribs ashamed of that momentary shrinking from what he might find inside the room but his involuntary shrinking did not bring with it even a second of hesitation He opened the door widely and stepped straight into the apartment Excepting for a night light burning on a chest of drawers the room was in darkness and he could make out nothing of his surroundings Then as his eyes grew accustomed to the gloom he uttered a short exclamation of horror and moved hurriedly forwards calling to the woman behind him to bring a light and to bring it quickly CHAPTER X IT IS ONLY HE WHO MATTERS Christina s thoughts that evening often travelled to the silent valley and to the beautiful woman with the anguished face who had made so profound an impression upon her Having tucked Baba safely into her cot and heard the soft breathing which indicated that the blue eyed baby was sleeping Christina returned to the sitting room and drawing an armchair close to the fire took up a novel in which she was deeply interested But to night her thoughts refused to follow the chequered fortunes of her heroine and she no longer felt herself the least thrilled over the approaching climax of the story The strange piece of real life into which she had been unwittingly plunged interested her far more than any heroes or heroines of fiction and she soon found herself with her book on her lap and her own eyes fixed on the glowing coals whilst her mind recapitulated all the events of the past few hours It is just like something entrancingly exciting in a melodrama she reflected that lonely house and the beautiful lady with the white face and that silent valley Remembering the silence in the valley she shuddered a little and wondered whether the lady of the unfathomable eyes ever minded the loneliness and silence whether sometimes she was afraid down there in the stillness of those sheltering woodlands I don t suppose I shall ever know any more about her the girl s thoughts ran on but I should like to see her again I never saw anybody like her in my life before and she looked so sad I wish I could have helped her more From this point her reflections passed on to subsequent events of the day to her own audacious stopping of the big motor to the grey eyed man whose failure to recognise her had given her just a tiny pang of regret to the blue eyed man who had looked at her with an admiration to which she was quite unaccustomed The memory of it brought a little flush to her face even now that she sat alone in the firelight and brought with it too a stab of resentment I don t think I quite like anybody to look at me like that she thought and after all even if I am only a nurse earning my own living I am still a woman She drew up her head with a proud gesture characteristic of her and then her reflections slipped away from the two men who had driven her to the doctor s house and wandered on to the doctor himself I like that man she murmured emphatically lifting her foot to push a protruding coal between the bars he wouldn t ever look at any woman as if he didn t respect her and a woman might put her whole trust in him so she might in that other Rupert s face rose again before her mental vision and she wondered as she had wondered many times that afternoon and evening what was the pain that had carved such deep lines in his face and brought so haunting a look of misery into his eyes His eyes seem as if he was looking all the time for something he has lost she thought repeating her former musings perhaps if he is Lady Cicely s cousin I may see him again some day I wonder what his name is besides Rupert I only heard him called Rupert She leant back in her chair her book still upon her knee her eyes seeing many pictures in the coals pictures in which a man with a rugged face and kind grey eyes seemed to be continually walking beside a tall lady with a beautiful white face and eyes of unfathomable sadness and mystery until the pictures merged themselves into dreams and Christina slept peacefully A loud knocking at the door startled her into wakefulness and jumping to her feet she confronted missus Nairne who looked at her with injured amusement Been asleep by the fire missy I suppose I couldn t make you hear nohow knock as I might There s a gentleman in a motor car at the door wanting to speak to you all in a hurry A gentleman in a motor wanting me Christina asked feeling that she must still be in the world of dreams Well he said he wanted to speak to the young lady who was staying here with the little girl missus Nairne answered and Christina a faint hope stirring at her heart that Lady Cicely s cousin might have come to ask her about Baba went quickly to the farmhouse door to be greeted by doctor Fergusson who awaited her with obvious impatience I came to see if I could get some help from you he said with no other preamble I have been to the house in the valley and things there are pretty bad But how can I help Christina asked I want you to come back with me to the house and stay there for the night with the lady of whom you told me to day I could not do that Christina answered decidedly it is out of the question I am here in charge of a little child I could not go away for the night and leave her Wouldn t she be safe with the woman of the house Fergusson asked imperiously she looked to me a very reliable body Although they were alone at the door he and Christina spoke in low voices perhaps some of the mystery of the lonely valley and shut in house lingered with them still missus Nairne is in every way reliable but Lady Cicely my little charge s mother has trusted me so entirely I should feel I was abusing her trust if I did what you ask I am at my wits end to know what to do was the answer I don t profess to be able to understand the inwardness of all I saw at the house I have just left but it is plain that there is some vital need for secrecy I can t possibly send a woman from the village to these people and yet they must have somebody for the night I came to you because I am sure you can hold your tongue Certainly I can do that Christina laughed a little and drew more closely round her the cloak she had snatched from its peg as she came to the door and I would gladly oh most gladly do anything I could to help that poor lady But my duty seems to lie here I should only ask you to come for a few hours I will undertake that you shall be back here before your little charge is ready for you in the morning It is vitally necessary that someone should be with that poor lady as you rightly call her and my thoughts flew at once to you I wish I knew what was right to do Christina said wistfully and at her words doctor Fergusson sprang from his car and seized her hands in his I will tell you he said firmly it is right to come with me I will explain to missus Nairne as much of the circumstances as it is necessary she should know and I have no doubt she will come to the rescue Go and fetch whatever you will need for the night it will be a night spent in sitting up not in bed and I will settle with the good woman Swept off her feet by the masterfulness which brooked no resistance Christina obediently did his bidding and when she returned to the door found missus Nairne in close conversation with the doctor There missy that ll be all right never you fear she said as Christina appeared the doctor he ve been telling me there s a poor lady in great trouble and that you could comfort her by sitting up with her a bit Why I ll sleep with the little missy with all the pleasure in life and you can feel as safe about her as if you was here yourself When the doctor had handed her into the car and they drove swiftly away the girl felt as if she were merely a puppet whose strings were being pulled by Fergusson s strong hands She had a curious sense of helplessness that was not wholly unpleasant So dominating was the personality of the man who sat beside her that she was convinced he was only doing what was right in whirling her away with him through the darkness and his brown eyes were so steadfast so reliable that when their glance met hers she felt safe He spoke scarcely at all to her until they had turned off the moorland into the steep lane that led to the house amongst the woods Then he said quietly steering the car at a walking pace I found an uncomfortable state of things in the house to which we are going when I got there to day Was someone very ill Christina questioned the lady said a matter of life and death It was certainly that he answered grimly considering I was only just in time to save her from being murdered by as violent a homicidal maniac as I ever saw Oh Christina exclaimed with horror At first I couldn t get into the place at all Then a servant came to the gate and she seemed in a terrible state No wonder She took me into the house and in one of the rooms I found the lady of whom you have been speaking in the grip of a madwoman lighting for her life My God I was only just in time It seems the woman had been ill and had had paroxysms of what they thought was delirium As a matter of fact it was acute mania and as I say I was only just in time What have you done with Christina broke off with a shudder but Fergusson saw that her face was white With the unfortunate madwoman I have secured her for the time and I mean to drive her over to night to the nearest asylum But I must take the servant with me and that is why I want you Your beautiful lady cannot be left alone I thought it must have been a man who was ill Christina said she certainly spoke of him and he I saw no man only the madwoman and a servant And why is there all this mystery Christina said with bewilderment in her voice what makes so much secrecy necessary Ah that I do not know the doctor answered gravely I can t understand it myself but it is quite obvious that for some reason the lady of the house is most anxious to keep her whereabouts hidden from the world And when one looks at her one feels it is impossible to do anything but respect her wishes and help her keep her secret whatever it may be he added under his breath My beautiful lady has bewitched him too Christina reflected shrewdly and for the rest of the way spent her time in silently speculating upon what lay before her The green door stood ajar now and a lighted lantern had been placed on the ground just inside it By its rather uncertain light Fergusson led her across the garden and into the hall where a wood fire was burning brightly They did not however linger here but crossing it ascended a wide staircase to the floor above on which were several rooms The door of one of these stood wide open a stream of light from it flooded the landing and the doctor tapping gently on the door entered Christina following him half fearfully dreading what she might see But no dreadful sight met her gaze She saw only a simply furnished bedroom and in the bed propped up by pillows and with her face turned anxiously towards the door lay the beautiful woman whose image had haunted the girl ever since the afternoon She looked if possible even whiter than when she had accosted Christina in the lane and her eyes seemed darker and more heavily pencilled with shadows but she greeted her visitors with a smile and held out her hand in welcome How good of you to come she said grasping the girl s hand in a nervous clinging clasp how very good of you I think I should really have been quite safe just for a few hours but the doctor would not let me stay here Alone Fergusson exclaimed when her sentence remained unfinished certainly not Now see here Miss he paused and looked at Christina It sounds very absurd to say so but I don t know your name he added Moore she answered Well Miss Moore all I want you to do is to sit with this lady see that she takes some food through the night and don t allow her to worry about anything A faint laugh broke from the woman in the bed What an easy order to give and what a hard one to carry out she said but I will promise to try and keep my mind at rest as far as possible she added under her breath and you are taking poor Marion where she will be safe and well cared for I am taking her where she will do no one any harm Fergusson answered grimly and I will bring your servant back as soon as I can She is a treasure that servant of yours I think she is worth her weight in gold was the quiet answer she is more than servant she is a friend a faithful loyal friend You are fortunate to have found such an one Fergusson smiled and now I must go and get that poor soul away and Miss Moore will keep you company and take care of you until I bring your servant back As he spoke the last words he was gone closing the door softly behind him and carrying with him some of the sense of health giving strength and vitality with which his very presence seemed to fill the room Unusual as was the position in which she found herself Christina had sufficient perception to see that the nerves of the woman she had come to tend were already stretched to breaking point and that a normal manner and matter of fact way of taking the situation for granted would do more than anything else to relieve the tension She took off her hat and cloak therefore with quiet deliberation unrolled the dressing gown she had brought with her and was proceeding to hang it over a chair before the fire when her patient said suddenly Watch them go tell me when they have gone Tell me when you and I are alone Christina moved from the fire to the bedside You want me to see them off from the gate she asked and the other nodded Yes Lock and bolt the gate after them When the doctor comes back we shall hear him But the door must be locked behind them now Her voice rose in feverish excitement her hands moved restlessly on the sheet her eyes were bright with eagerness and Christina could have sworn that fear looked out of them too Of course I will go and do as you wish she said very gently her hand stroking the restlessly moving hands you will lie very quietly here whilst I am gone Yes oh yes the accents were impatient Only go go down now They must be ready to start Slipping on her cloak again Christina ran downstairs pausing half way as she heard a sound of voices and footsteps coming from the corridor that intersected the hall and that was just out of her sight Carefully lift her feet a little take care round this corner so she heard the sentence jerked out in the doctor s voice and from her post of observation she presently saw him emerge slowly into the hall walking backwards and holding an inanimate woman s head and shoulders in his arms Holding her feet bearing half the burden of her unconscious form was a tall woman of the servant class upon whose face the rays of the hall lamps fell fully and Christina could see all the shrewd kindliness of the plain features Gently wait a moment to rest There that s right now then Ah the lantern he exclaimed we must have the lantern across that dark garden I will bring the lantern Christina called out rather tremulously but running down the stairs without delay I was sent to lock the gate after you I can light you across the garden She picked up the lantern from the hall table upon which Fergusson had placed it and with one shuddering glance at the flushed heavily breathing woman who was being carried from the house she put herself at the head of the strange little procession lighting their footsteps as well as she was able It was no easy task to lift the unfortunate creature first through the green door and then into the car but Fergusson being an athletic man with muscles in excellent order and the tall servant being strong and well built their joint efforts succeeded in laying their burden along the cushions Christina stood at the door for a moment watching the car turn up the lane but when its brilliant lights were engulfed by the darkness she turned back with a shiver into the garden locking and bolting the door with trembling fingers and running up the dark path as though all the powers of evil were at her heels The front door of the house she secured as firmly as the other then more than half ashamed of the nameless terror that shook her she sat down for a moment on an oak chest by the fire You silly coward she said to herself you know you and a sick woman are alone in the house and what are you afraid of But for all her attempt at courage as she flew up the stairs again she repeatedly looked over her shoulder with a nervous dread of she knew not what Have they gone safely gone And is the door locked The words greeted her ears directly she entered the bedroom upstairs and the dark eyes of the woman in the bed looked at her with agonised questioning and dread Yes they have driven away and everything is locked up and now I want to make you comfortable and poke up the fire and we shall be quite cosy in this nice warm room Christina spoke cheerfully all trace of her own nervous fears had vanished she was intent on calming the troubled woman whose feverish excitement was still only too apparent Nice and cosy the woman laughed drearily I can t rest quietly until I know he Can I trust you She pulled herself bolt upright in the bed and looked fixedly at Christina will you be silent about everything you see everything you hear Why of course But you will try and go to sleep now won t you Christina said soothingly with a startled certainty that her beautiful charge must be delirious Go to sleep The dreary laugh came again How could I sleep I must lie here there is no help for that Marion has done her work well though poor soul she did not mean to harm me But I can t lie here whilst he you will promise to keep silence I promise Christina said hastily intent only on quieting her at any cost is there something you want me to do The other nodded Go along the passage that leads off this landing she said knock at the third door on the left and ask my the person who is there if there is anything he needs He may need food we could do nothing for him whilst Marion and the doctor She dropped back upon the pillow with closed eyes and so exhausted a look that Christina bent over her too anxious about her well being to think of her own surprise at the order just given her Never mind me the dark eyes opened the brows drew together in a frown only go to him and do what he needs I shall be all right it is only he who matters Unfeignedly puzzled and with all her nervous tremors trooping back upon her Christina went across the landing and turned along the passage as directed Who and what was she going to find in that third room on the left And why was there a necessity for all this secrecy Her heart beat very fast so fast that it nearly suffocated her as she passed on and paused at the third door wondering again with a sinking dread what new mystery was to be revealed to her To her soft knock a man s voice responded Come in and she entered a warm and luxuriously furnished apartment which appeared to be sitting room and bedroom combined Closely wrapped in a thick dressing gown and seated in an armchair by the fire was a man whose cadaverous face and sunken eyes seemed to show recent recovery from some severe illness and his efforts to rise when he saw a stranger at the door only resulted in his sinking back with a groan Who are you he asked why have you come Where is Madge Christina fancied she detected a faint foreign accent in his words though he spoke fluent English I was sent by by the lady of the house Christina answered I don t know her name but she is very tired She substituted that word for ill when she saw how the sick man started and flushed She asked me to come and see if there is anything you need Madge tired he said in a slow dreamy voice it is so difficult to think that Madge can be tired She used to be such a tower of strength always such a tower of strength His sunken eyes glanced wistfully at Christina she felt compelled to utter some words of comfort Perhaps she is only tired just for the time she answered though in uttering the words a remorseful remembrance smote her of the fragile white face of the woman she had left She will feel stronger again soon Do you think so Do you really think so He leant forward and Christina saw how his hands were trembling you see I feel I can t help feeling that it is my fault all my fault First the old trouble and then my coming back to burden But you are a stranger to us he exclaimed breaking off and looking at her with a new alertness why did Madge send a stranger Where is Elizabeth Christina jumping to the conclusion that Elizabeth must be the kindly faced servant and anxious to check the sick man s rising excitement said gently She is busy just now and they sent me because I am a friend and you may be quite sure that I shall never speak a word to anyone of what I see or hear in this house Then you don t know he began breaking off again and looking at her almost furtively I know nothing was the grave response I came here just for to night to help because because Elizabeth is busy That is all To her great relief he accepted her explanation without further questioning the truth being that his brain exhausted by illness refused to work with any rapidity being ready enough to accept whatever was put before it and with a weary sigh he turned away from the girl and held out his thin hands to the fire Now can I fetch you anything or do anything for you Christina asked brightly try to look upon me as as Elizabeth and let me do for you what she would do if she were here His eyes turned to her again he smiled You are not very like Elizabeth he said his glance taking in the slight figure in its neat green gown the girlish face the eager eyes a very fertile imagination would be needed to see Elizabeth in you I am afraid I am not half so capable as Elizabeth she said ignoring the subtle compliment but I will do my best Will you give me your arm to the bed then I am too much of a cripple to walk there alone but I can get myself into it when I am there And if you would further be good enough to bring me from next door some milk and whatever other eatables Elizabeth has prepared for me I shall be very grateful Though I cannot imagine why Elizabeth is leaving me to a stranger to night he went on with the petulance of a sick child Christina thought it best to ignore the latter half of this sentence and having fetched from the dressing room next door a tray of appetising viands which she deposited on a table by the bed she came to the sick man s side to give him the help he needed It was with great difficulty that he dragged himself from his chair and the girl s strength was taxed to the utmost to support his weight when he leant heavily upon her shoulder He was considerably taller than he had looked when sitting in the chair and he was so weak and apparently so crippled that his progress across the room was a slow and painful one Short though the transit was from chair to bed his breath came fast as he sank down upon the pillow and for several seconds he looked so worn and exhausted that Christina did not dare to leave him Into the milk put ready for him she poured some brandy from a flask on the tray and holding the glass to his lips was thankful to see that he could drink its contents and that having done so the colour gradually returned to his face Better now he said slowly opening his sunken eyes and looking at Christina with a smile that gave his face a pathetic wistfulness I shall be all right soon Can t I do anything more for you Christina asked still troubled by his exhausted looks No nothing more Come back in half an hour to see if I am all right just to console Madge he answered smiling again as she softly stole away Did he ask many questions Had he heard anything of what happened He was not frightened or upset The questions poured out in a torrent from the lips of the white faced woman in the other room when Christina re entered it She was sitting up in the bed her hands clasped in front of her her eyes dark with anxiety He asked very little Christina answered and I think he could not have been upset by hearing anything that happened I am sure he could have heard nothing she added earnestly he is going to bed now and I am to go back presently to see that he is all right He said it would comfort Madge A smile flickered over the white face My poor Max she whispered under her breath I could not bear it if anything else happened to hurt him I could not bear it The passion in her voice brought a lump into Christina s throat He has had so much to bear Ah my God give him peace at the last The vehement voice died into silence and Christina feeling very young and forlorn and quite unable to cope with a grief and passion so intense could only stand silently by the bed her hand just touching the restless hand on which a thick wedding ring was the only ornament You don t know what it means to care like that for a man the passionate voice spoke again you are so young just a slip of a girl the woman s dark eyes rested tenderly almost sadly on Christina s face You don t know what it means to care so much for a man that no matter what he is or does he is your world your whole world Do you she asked leaning forward and seizing the girl s hands in her own hot ones No o Christina faltered whilst unbidden there flashed into her mind the vision of a rugged face and two grey eyes full of hidden pain but I think I can understand she ended shyly You dear little girl the two hot hands drew her down and Christina felt a gentle kiss on her cheek some day you will know if I judge your eyes aright Nature did not give you those eyes and that face for nothing I wonder the woman s glance suddenly concentrated itself upon the girl I wonder why something in your face seems to me familiar Can I ever have seen you before No I could not ever forget you if I had seen you Christina answered quickly and the other though she smiled still looked into the girl s face with a puzzled expression Half an hour later Christina upon whom her responsibilities weighed with double heaviness now that she had realised the presence of the sick man in the house went to visit the room along the passage The patient there was now in bed and the girl observed that the look of intense exhaustion had left his face and that he was breathing normally and quietly Tell Madge I am quite all right he said his voice sounding stronger than before don t let her worry about me She must rest herself if she is tired Tell her I shall sleep like a top To Christina the night that followed was one of her most curious experiences In a strange house with people of whose very names she was ignorant and about whom hung a mystery the nature of which was unknown to her she felt as though she had become part of a story or of a puzzling dream from which she should presently awake in her own bed at Graystone with Baba s cot beside her Wrapped in her thick dressing gown she sat by the fire in the room of the woman who in her own mind she called the beautiful lady sometimes turning the leaves of a book she had found on the table sometimes looking dreamily at the flickering flames In accordance with the doctor s orders she occasionally fed her patient who though very wide awake spoke but little during the long night hours Christina by the light of the softly shaded lamp could see how seldom her companion s eyes were closed how almost continually they were fixed either upon her or upon the firelit walls Once or twice she uttered some brief remark but no word was said that made clear to the watching girl any of the strange happenings in this strange house But when the grey light of dawn was beginning to steal through the window curtains the woman in the bed said gently It was wonderfully good of you to come here and take care of me like this I wonder whether you are thinking you have come into a place of mad people No I did not think that You have taken a great deal on trust and though it is very much to ask of a stranger I am going to ask you still to take me on trust I have not done anything wrong if it is folly well I shall have to pay the price To this enigmatical sentence Christina could think of no reply but she went to the bedside and gently touched the shapely hand on which rested that plain gold ring Your eyes tell me you are a faithful soul the low voice continued you belong to the race of people who make good friends I have another good friend in the world but he will you still take me on trust she ended abruptly her fingers closing round Christina s hand I couldn t do anything else the girl answered quickly you need not tell me you have done nothing wrong I know it Nobody who looked into your face could ever distrust you she added in a burst of girlish enthusiasm Some day if we meet again and if you care to hear it you shall hear all the story but not now not now And you you will keep silence about everything here The dark eyes searched her face anxiously Remember even the doctor knows nothing I will keep silence about everything Christina answered solemnly stooping for the second time to touch the beautiful face with her lips CHAPTER XI YOU CAN TRUST doctor FERGUSSON When at about seven o clock in the morning doctor Fergusson and the servant Elizabeth once more reached the house amongst the woods Christina was dressed and ready to admit them by the little green gate in the wall She had made herself ready for the day at a very early hour stealing out of her beautiful charge s room whilst the latter was sleeping peacefully and Fergusson smiled approvingly when he caught sight of the girl s trim figure and smiling face He alighted quickly from the car and helped Elizabeth to descend and whilst the servant hurried into the house he put a quick question or two to Christina Yes she has had a quiet night on the whole the girl answered she has not slept much at a time but she has dozed now and then and she has been wonderfully calm She is asleep now but she told me most particularly that she wished to be awakened when you came I think the girl hesitated as she glanced into the doctor s face I think she has something special to say to you I am sorry to have to wake her Fergusson answered but I am afraid there is no help for it if she wishes to speak to me I can t wait till she wakes naturally I have a very busy day before me besides which I ought to take you back to the small girl Whilst he spoke he was walking up the flagged path to the house by Christina s side glancing with pardonable curiosity at the white building against its background of dark woods Curious he said reflectively I do not want to be unduly prying but it is impossible to help wondering what that exceptionally beautiful woman is doing in this remote place with apparently only an old servant and a homicidal maniac for company Christina s eyes met his and she flushed In the face of the promise of secrecy she had given to the lady of the house she could not mention to Fergusson the existence of the sick man whose presence she shrewdly suspected was in some way the reason for the beautiful lady s residence in this desolate corner of the world and in answer to his words she only said quietly I think there must be some very good reason why she does not wish people to know she is here but of course I don t know what the reason is and saying this she entered the hall door and preceded the doctor to the room where her charge of the night still lay sleeping a little smile on her beautiful face Elizabeth stood beside her and Christina saw that the good woman s eyes were full of tears It does me good to see her sleeping like that she whispered to the two who stood just within the doorway it s seldom she gets such restful sleep You are sure she really wants to speak to me Fergusson asked the girl speaking in low tones I cannot bear to disturb her and yet I must do it if she really wants me I have one or two urgent cases that should be seen early and I cannot stay here I am afraid we must disturb her Christina whispered back Before she went to sleep she told me I was on no account to let you go without speaking to her I am sure she has something important she wishes to say Then I ll be going to make some tea for you all Elizabeth said gently you haven t slept much yourself miss I can see she added looking kindly into Christina s face which bore traces of her wakeful vigil I have lighted the kitchen fire the girl said gaily ignoring the remarks about her own night and I think tea will be just the loveliest thing in the world and as Elizabeth went downstairs she crept softly to the bedside and laid her hand upon the white hand on the coverlet the hand whose only ornament was its thick wedding ring doctor Fergusson has come back she said very gently when at her touch the dark eyes opened I am so sorry to wake you but you wanted to speak to him In that moment of waking the smile that had lain on the sleeping face faded from it and a long sigh escaped her I was dreaming that Max and I she began and then as recollection returned to her she broke off her sentence saying abruptly Yes I must speak to the doctor I must take the risk all the risk she added under her breath and Christina saw that a look of fear stole into her eyes Is there something I can do for you Fergusson approached the bed and his voice was as gentle as Christina s had been Something in the fragile appearance of the woman before them something in the anguish of the deep eyes gave both to the man and to the girl beside him a feeling of almost reverential awe Instinctively they realised the presence of some great human tragedy instinctively they felt that in its presence all voices must be hushed and that no rough things of every day should be allowed to intrude into the place of grief The woman in the bed raised herself on her pillow and looked full into Fergusson s face I can trust you she said I believe you will keep your own counsel about whatever you see or hear in this house Certainly I shall he replied When Miss Moore came to me yesterday I promised her that I would respect your confidence absolutely I have entered the patient I have just taken to the asylum as resident at the London address you gave me I hope that was right I have a rooted objection to telling deliberate lies he added a little grimly What I told you was quite true she answered smiling faintly Poor Marion was only here temporarily her home is in London Will you tell me about her before I ask you anything more Is there any hope of her recovery It all seemed so dreadfully sudden She must have had a tendency to homicidal mania for years probably all her life and I should think her recovery is extremely doubtful In any case she will have to be under restraint for a long time a very long time and at present she is quite off her head Poor Marion his listener said sadly Poor poor Marion There need be no difficulty about her expenses She must have every care everything that is necessary and if anything is ever wanted for her will the asylum authorities write to missus Stanforth c o missus Milton one hundred eighty Gower Street The doctor jotted down the address in his notebook then looked again into the white troubled face on the pillow and said slowly There was something else you wanted me to do was there not Will you tell me now what it is A faint colour tinged the whiteness of her face for a second her glance wavered before his and he saw that her hand moved restlessly I know he will be angry with me she said at last but I must ask you to see him I am so afraid he is worse than he thinks than we all think And you have promised secrecy You have promised it she said vehemently putting out her hands towards him Fergusson looked as he felt profoundly puzzled I have already promised to mention nothing of what I see or hear in this house to a living soul he said a trace of irritation creeping into his quiet voice I shall keep my promise I cannot say more than that Is there someone you wish me to see The woman s dark eyes turned to Christina who stood at the foot of the bed a silent and interested spectator of the strange little scene I want the doctor to see my the sick man you helped she said in faltering accents Will you take him to the room you went to last night Will you explain that I that Madge begs him to tell the doctor all about his illness He he may be angry she looked into Fergusson s eyes again but I think you will understand I think you will soothe him Is he Fergusson was beginning when one of those restlessly moving hands touched his Please don t ask me to tell you who he is she said earnestly he has been very ill he has only come here since he was convalescent again her eyes fell before the doctor s glance but before he came here he was very ill and in great trouble Ah be good to him she exclaimed her enforced calm of manner suddenly giving way let him have peace now he has had such a troubled life The tortured look in her eyes touched Fergusson deeply his hand closed over her trembling one with a strong reassuring grasp I will do my best for him he said cheerily and I will ask no unnecessary questions You need not be afraid that I shall try to find out anything beyond his physical symptoms Trust me And with another kindly glance from those eminently trustworthy eyes of his he bade Christina lead the way to his new patient In silence they traversed the passage by which Christina had passed along on the previous night but as she knocked on the door of the sick man s apartment the doctor stooped towards her and whispered I don t know whether I ought to let you be mixed up in what may turn out an unpleasant mystery Would you rather go away at once I can explain my own presence to this man Christina shook her head and her mouth took on a little determined look which Fergusson learnt to recognise later on as one of her most marked characteristics No I will do what she asked me to do she said I am not afraid of mysteries and I must help my beautiful lady as much as ever I can So saying she turned the handle of the door in response to an impatient Come in and she and Fergusson entered together The sick man lay propped up with pillows his eyes turned towards the door a fretful expression on his face an expression which turned to one of acute fear when he saw the doctor s form behind Christina Who are you he exclaimed shrinking back and trembling violently Why have you come here I tell you I am all right in this place you can t do me any harm now I am safe safe why I have not come to do you any harm the doctor answered soothingly hiding the surprise he undoubtedly felt I am only a doctor who wants to make you well You have been ill haven t you Well what of that the other answered sullenly his eyes furtively watching Fergusson s face his weak mouth quivering I don t want a doctor even if I have been ill I can do very well without a doctor Why did you come Christina stepped softly to the bedside and her voice was very gently You remember me she said I came to help you last night and I was told to tell you now as a special message that Madge sent the doctor that she begs you to tell him all about your illness You can trust doctor Fergusson the girl went on earnestly He will not tell anybody that he has seen you You can safely trust him We are trusting too many people came the querulous retort First Elizabeth was busy and you came to me last night and you are a total stranger Though you were so kind to me it is no use to pretend you are not a stranger Yet I had to trust you and now I have to trust the doctor There are too many people in it now This young lady Miss Moore and I know absolutely nothing about you or about the lady of this house Fergusson said firmly but soothingly We do not even know your relationship to one another Your secrets are quite safe with us because we have no idea what those secrets are Therefore you can safely trust us And in any case I can answer for Miss Moore as for myself in any case we shall keep silence about everything we have seen in this house The sick man muttered one or two more feeble remonstrances after which with the sudden abandonment of his position so characteristic of a weak nature he said resignedly Well well it is no use talking it is never of any use for me to talk and if Madge wishes me to be overhauled so be it I will put myself into your hands but understand I do it under protest Denis Fergusson only nodded and smiled in response saying to Christina Now if you will go and have that cup of tea I will do my best for the patient here and come to fetch you in a few minutes and the girl taking the hint left the two men together and returned to the other room where she found the beautiful lady lying with eyes wistfully turned towards the door whilst Elizabeth vainly implored her to drink the tea she had made I couldn t think of tea or of anything else till you came back the beautiful woman exclaimed stretching out her hands to the girl with feverish eagerness Was he vexed my poor Max was he dreadfully vexed when you took the doctor to his room Christina was conscious of a sudden wonder Why she speculated did this woman s voice drop into accents of such divine tenderness when she spoke of the sick man What attraction could that weak querulous invalid possess for this stately beautiful creature who to the girl s admiring eyes seemed as far above him as a star is far from the earth Why did she love him as she most obviously did with that intense overmastering love which in a woman of this calibre almost approaches to the divine Just at first he was rather vexed she answered but doctor Fergusson is very tactful he inspires confidence I think it will be all right now And I have come back here to have some tea with you she added brightly seeing and understanding the old servant s anxious glances I am going to confess that I have been awake a great deal of the night and tea will be very refreshing She added these words because she saw that the other woman would be more likely to drink her own tea if she felt that Christina was really in need of the refreshment and her surmise was right Oh but you must have your tea at once the woman in the bed exclaimed I can t bear to think I have been keeping you awake indeed it is dreadful to think that you have all unwittingly come into my shadowed life she added under her breath whilst the girl seated herself beside the bed and Elizabeth served them both I am glad I have been able to help you Christina said impulsively when the servant softly left the room you don t know how glad I should be if I could do anything to make things easier for you she ended rather lamely but the admiration in her eyes was unmistakable and the shapely white hand with its one ring was laid on Christina s You have helped me to night more than you suppose she said there is something very restful about your personality little girl do you know that All night you have given me a feeling of rest and peace I am glad Christina answered a light flashing into her eyes I believe I would rather be restful to people than anything else in the world A rest bringer was the soft answer you will always be that if you go on as you have begun And it is work worth doing to bring rest to tired souls to those who go through the vale of misery who know what pain means Be a rest bringer little girl you could not be anything better or sweeter Christina flushed vividly partly at the words of praise partly because as they were spoken a face rose before her mental vision a man s face lined and rugged with marks of pain carved upon it with a haunting look of pain in its grey eyes And with that remembrance came also a sudden impetuous wish that it might be given to her to bring rest to the man who was Lady Cicely s cousin the man whose very name she did not know She was startled out of the strange train of thought by her companion s voice I cannot imagine she was saying why it is that your face and voice are in some odd way familiar to me and yet you assure me we have never met before We have never met Christina answered decidedly I could not have forgotten you if I had ever seen you and oh she went on with an eager girlish gesture please mayn t I have some name to remember you by not any name that that you would rather I did not know she added quickly seeing an anxious look in the other s eyes only just something to keep in my thoughts of you Call me just Margaret in your thoughts was the answer that is one of my names call me that But it seems Christina hesitated it seems like impertinence to call you by a Christian name You Yes I know I am old enough to be your mother the dark eyes looked wistfully into the eager young face and the life I have lived makes me feel more as if I was a thousand instead of only thirty eight But still there is a young corner in my heart quite a young corner where I can feel like a girl again and it would please me if you called me Margaret Margaret Christina repeated softly I am glad you have such a beautiful name It seems to belong to your beautiful face She spoke dreamily scarcely aware of what she said but as the sound of her own words fell on her ears she flushed deeply and a deprecating look came into her eyes Oh I beg your pardon she exclaimed I was speaking my thoughts aloud and it was rude of me But do you know ever since I first saw you I have called you in my mind the beautiful lady You see I had no name by which to call you It was very pretty of you Margaret smiled her fingers touching the girl s dusky hair Once upon a time long ago when I was as young as you I was beautiful it is not vanity to say that now I was a beautiful girl But life and all that life has brought have They have made you more beautiful the girl interrupted eagerly they have put sadness into your face but they have not taken away its beauty they have only added to it Margaret smiled again and an answering smile flashed over the girl s face making the older woman lean towards her and exclaim with a puzzled stare It certainly is most extraordinary how when you smile I find something so familiar in your face The quick way you smile reminds me of another face I have seen but I cannot remember where I saw it or whose it is And your voice reminds me of just such another clear voice with restful cadences in it Could I ever have known anyone belonging to your family Christina shook her head recognising dimly that the woman before her belonged to a circle of life very different from that in which her father and mother had moved I don t think it is at all likely you ever saw any relation of mine she answered My name is Moore and we were always very poor and lived in an out of the way Devonshire village I never knew any of my relations and I don t even know my mother s maiden name I think her people had treated her very badly she never mentioned them Ah well it must be some chance likeness but it will worry me until I can remember who the person is of whom you remind me Is that the doctor she broke off to say her lighter tone changing to one of acute anxiety What is he coming to tell me The animation that for a few moments had lighted her features and lessened some of the tragedy in her eyes died away and the face that was turned towards doctor Fergusson as he once more entered the room had nothing upon it but an agonised question He has allowed you to examine him thoroughly she asked Yes quite thoroughly Fergusson s voice was gentle but very grave and as he came and stood beside the bed Christina instinctively realised that he hesitated to speak further because what he had to say was of a painful nature Tell me Margaret spoke a little breathlessly her eyes never left the kind shrewd face looking down at her the anguish in their depths hurt Denis s tender heart To give pain to any woman above all to a woman so fragile so physically unfit to bear it as this woman seemed to be was almost intolerable to him Yet his honesty and strength of nature never allowed him to evade the truth when truth had to be told and he did not evade it now I am afraid I have not good news to bring you he said The patient I have just examined is only momentarily convalescent I think it is only fair to be quite honest with you there is no real hope of his ultimate recovery The woman in the bed uttered a little low sound which seemed to Christina the most pitiful she had ever heard but when she spoke her voice was unnaturally quiet You mean he has some incurable disease Tell me the exact truth Yes quite incurable and very far advanced I can give him a certain amount of alleviation but it would not be right to let you build any hopes on the possibility of a cure There is no such possibility When the doctor s voice ceased there was a strange tense silence in the room for many minutes and Christina standing by the fireplace felt as if she could almost see and hear the woman in the bed gathering up her forces to meet this blow Once the girl glanced at the white face and deep eyes but she turned away her glance again feeling it was not right that any other human being should gaze upon the tortured soul that looked out of those eyes Margaret herself first broke the silence Will it be long she asked I think not Fergusson answered gravely but in a case like this everything depends upon the temperament of the patient his surroundings his mental attitude Anxiety worry any mental strain would accelerate matters The white hands that all this time had been so still on the coverlet clasped themselves together and there was a new note of passion in Margaret s voice as she said And the mental strain is exactly what I cannot help cannot prevent cannot save him from You must remember I am only giving you one man s opinion only my own Fergusson replied gently Would you like me to bring a London colleague to No oh no the look of fear he had before noticed in her eyes leapt into them once more nobody else must come here nobody else must see him As it is the risks she stopped suddenly and ended her sentence in less agitated tones I am quite satisfied with your opinion doctor Fergusson she said I would rather not have another doctor and you will respect my wish for silence about everything that has passed in this house Certainly I will respect it you can trust me In the patient s own interest I think I ought to see him again perhaps in two or three days but nobody excepting Miss Moore and myself will know anything about the affairs of your house Having given her a few technical instructions as to the treatment of the sick man the doctor was ready to take his departure and he and Christina left the house together after the girl had for a moment been drawn into Margaret s arms and gently kissed Thank you for all you have done the beautiful woman whispered I don t think I can ever be grateful enough to you Perhaps we shall not ever meet again but think sometimes of me pray sometimes for me little rest bringer That poor soul that poor soul They were Fergusson s first words after he had turned the car out of the rough lane into the main road I daresay it was fanciful but the words in the Litany haunted me when I watched her this morning In all time of our tribulation Good Lord deliver us She looks as if she had been through such an infinity of tribulation Christina s eyes were still dim with the tears brought there by Margaret s parting words and her voice was not quite steady as she answered Yes the word seems to belong to her but she gives me the feeling that she is so strong so tender in spite of or perhaps because of all that she has suffered I wish I could do something more for her Perhaps the opportunity may yet be given you Fergusson answered I never believe people come into one s life purposelessly we meet them for some reason and we get chances of helping them even if sometimes they seem only like ships that pass in the night greeting us as they sail by CHAPTER XII YOU ARE JUST ZACKLY LIKE THE PRINCE The gentleman said he would be back in half an hour he is staying a night at the inn and he just wanted to see you and Miss Baba missus Nairne delivered this long message to Christina when she and her small charge came in from their afternoon walk a few days later and at her words Christina s heart gave a sudden leap Was it possible that the grey eyed man of the rugged face the man who had called himself Lady Cicely s cousin could be driving that way again And was he coming to see the child She was secretly pleased to observe that the landlady had provided a tea of superlative excellence and that the worthy missus Nairne thought as she also thought that Lady Cicely s cousin might perhaps partake of that meal with Baba and her nurse There was a happy smile on her lips and her eyes shone brightly as she moved to and fro about their little sitting room putting it tidy and arranging in two of missus Nairne s fearsome vases cherished possessions of that good lady be it known a tangle of brown leaves and crimson berries that she and Baba had brought in from the hedges The child s clear voice drifted in to her from the kitchen where the small girl was proudly conscious of extreme usefulness whilst she pattered to and fro behind missus Nairne and helped to arrange the tea tray We ve got the best tea set to day she announced to Christina in triumph when she and the landlady entered the sitting room together and I think the cakes is beautiful she added with a little sigh of bliss as her eyes rested on the table at which Christina had also glanced approvingly I thought the gentleman might like a cup of tea missus Nairne said apologetically and I can t bear for there not to be enough to eat I am sure there will be plenty for us all Christina answered gravely though her eyes twinkled and it is good of you to have taken so much trouble I can assure you Baba and I will appreciate all the good things you have given us and we are as hungry as hunters The sight that greeted Rupert Mernside s eyes when a few minutes later he came into the firelit room made a picture that lingered in his mind for the rest of his life There were two candles on the round table at which the child and girl sat but the room was really lighted by the ruddy glow of the fire whose flames leapt about the great log of wood on the top of the coals and shed a delicious radiance all over the low old fashioned apartment Some dead and departed mistress of missus Nairne had given her the oak furniture of which the landlady herself spoke deprecatingly as queer old stuff and the firelight was reflected a hundred times in the highly polished black of the oak and the bright brass of handles and knobs The chintz that covered the furniture had also come from a defunct mistress whose taste had led her to love just those soft dim colours and the old world patterns that best suited the oak of the furniture and the whole result was supremely pleasing to an aesthetic taste Flowers sent from Bramwell Castle made a delicious fragrance in the air and to the man coming in out of the cold of a damp and foggy December afternoon there was a peace in the atmosphere that gave him a pleasing sense of home and restfulness The firelight shone full on Baba s delicately tinted face and golden curls shone too on the dusky softness of her companion s hair bringing out in it unexpected gleams of brightness illuminating the girl s clear white colouring and her sweet eyes showing to the man who entered the tenderness of the look that was bent on the little child beside her Cousin Rupert Baba shrieked joyfully scrambling from her seat and flinging herself upon him whilst Christina pushed back her chair more deliberately and rose to greet their visitor We ve cakes with sugar on them to day cos missus Nairne thought you d come to tea Oh she thought I should come to tea did she Rupert answered smiling as he held out his hand to Christina looking at her over Baba s curly head The child was already in his arms her soft face pressed against his and his chin resting on her rippling curls whilst he shook hands with her nurse and said in his deep pleasant voice I am glad I have just caught you both at tea Miss Moore Now you will let me have some tea and then I shall hear how you both are and be able to carry news of you to my cousin at first hand Christina was far too guileless and simple of soul to read into Rupert s descent upon them what was the actual truth namely that he felt impelled as Baba s guardian to keep a watchful eye upon the new importation Cicely had so impulsively introduced into her household felt it indeed to be nothing more than his bare duty to see that Baba s new nurse was all that Cicely enthusiastically believed her to be Dear little Cicely s swans have before now turned out to be geese Rupert had said to Wilfred Staynes Cicely s brother when he and that smart young soldier were returning from their motor trip across Sussex She insisted on engaging this lady nurse for the child and practically took her without references The references she gave us were to all intents and purposes so much waste paper The writers of them were all dead or in the colonies Cicely was always like that Cicely s brother made reply She had the rattiest collection of sick and sorry animals in her youth and of sick and sorry friends as she grew older She has a way of stepping down into the highways and hedges and compelling their inhabitants to enjoy her hospitality It makes one feel one could always turn to Cicely if one went wrong you know he added thoughtfully she s always for the under dog as somebody once put it Cicely is the dearest soul in the world Rupert said quickly We all love her for her loving heart but at the same time I can t risk letting Baba fall into the hands of a stray adventuress because Cicely s heart has been touched If it s a question of adventuresses I ll come and see the kid too Wilfred answered laughingly I like the type it amuses me Bronze hair green eyes seductive manner Oh Rupert my friend if you think Baba is in the care of an adventuress take oh take me to call on her too What an ass you are Wilfred Rupert answered with a lazy laugh Is it likely that even our dear and impulsive Cicely would hand Baba over to the care of your adventuress type of woman No the only time I saw her the girl seemed a most harmless quiet little individual You ve seen her Yes I saw her in the nursery at Eaton Square making friends with Baba but she made no impression upon me she was just quite an ordinary looking girl Oh la la then you may go alone to call on her at Graystone and see that she is performing the whole duty of the nurse The ordinary looking girl makes no appeal to me His own and Wilfred s idle words flashed back into Rupert s mind now as across Baba s tangle of golden curls his eyes looked down into the eyes uplifted to his eyes to which the dancing firelight gave an oddly elusive effect What colour were they he wondered grey hazel or green deep soft green with great black pupils and sweeping dark lashes that curled upwards in a deliciously fascinating way There was something child like and appealing about those sweet eyes something of the eternal child indeed about her whole face from the unclouded brow on which the dusky hair fell in soft tendrils and curls to the half parted lips on which the smile over Baba s latest sally of wit still lingered There was nothing of the adventuress type about this girl that was very certain was his first thought his second that the uplifted face was in some way familiar to him that quite lately he had seen it uplifted in precisely this way and thirdly he remembered how and when they had met Why he exclaimed how oblivious you must have thought me the other day Surely you are the young lady to whom my cousin and I gave a lift in the car A vivid blush flooded Christina s face with colour her eyes wavered under his glance Yes it was I who stopped your car and I thought afterwards how dreadfully audacious and impatient I must have seemed But I was anxious to get quickly to the doctor that Not for this young person was it Rupert interrupted looking down at the child in his arms she doesn t wear an invalid appearance Oh no no not for her Christina spoke hurriedly remembering the secrecy that had been enjoined upon her by the lady of the lonely house and anxious to lead the conversation away as soon as possible from her visit to the doctor But Rupert having deposited Baba in her chair seated himself beside her and helped himself to a slice of missus Nairne s hot buttered toast continuing to talk placidly of the very subject the girl most desired to avoid I am afraid somebody was really ill he said and Christina noticed again what a musical voice his was You seemed to be desperately anxious to get the doctor as soon as possible Yes Christina answered trying to speak in matter of fact tones someone had asked me to fetch the doctor for them and I didn t want to lose any time I hope you found the doctor a satisfactory sort of person Sometimes the medical men in these out of the way places are very impossible I found a very unusual man Christina said thoughtfully he is a doctor Fergusson doing locum tenens work here He has a remarkable personality he made one feel he was meant to be a leader of men I hope he will do the patient good I hope he will Christina said hurriedly he was in a great difficulty that night and I hope I did not do wrong in giving him some help he asked for she added looking deprecatingly into the grey eyes fixed on her face feeling that it was her obvious duty to tell this man who was Lady Cicely s representative of the night during which she had left Baba I don t think you can have done anything very wrong Rupert answered with a smile and speaking almost caressingly as he might have spoken to a child His smile and the tone of his words set the girl s pulses beating although she vaguely realised he was treating her with the same kindliness he might have bestowed upon Baba doctor Fergusson was in a great difficulty she went on trying again to speak in matter of fact tones The lady of the house to which he went was was very lonely and he asked me to take care of her for the night In fact Christina smiled at the recollection he was very masterful he really made me go But I should not have gone if I had not known that Baba was absolutely safe with missus Nairne And she paused I think I was able to help somebody in great trouble Rupert s eyes still rested kindly on her face I don t know that I should recommend you to make a practice of leaving Baba and sitting up with people at night he said his smile taking away any possible sting from his words but I am sure in this instance you only did what seemed most right You and Baba are happy here he went on anxious to spare her any unnecessary embarrassment Baba likes this nice place the child struck in and Christina tell about the prince Baba thinks the prince is just zackly like you she ended with a wise nod of her curly head Rupert found himself speculating why at the child s speech Baba s nurse flushed with such extreme vividness and why she evinced so sudden a desire to change the subject Oh Baba we don t want to talk about fairy stories now she interposed Tell tell all about the pony cart and our nice drives Do you know she added looking at him with a shy glance which seemed to him infinitely attractive I have never heard your name so I don t know what to call you Call him the prince Baba s clear little voice remarked he s my Cousin Rupert but he s zackly like the prince and you re just zackly like the princess she added to Christina s no small discomfiture pointing a dimpled forefinger in the girl s direction and some day the prince will marry the princess and so they ll live happy ever after Again a flood of colour rushed over Christina s face and though Rupert saw it in the swift glance he cast at her he was merciful enough to turn his eyes upon the child and say gaily You must find a much better prince than I am for your princess little maid Cousin Rupert is a battered old gentleman with no prince like qualities Princes are always young and handsome with blue eyes and golden hair and silver armour and lots of other jolly things like that aren t they Miss Moore Yes certainly she answered rallying to his mood and laughing brightly they always dress in silver armour and the princesses never wear anything but white gowns Sometimes green gowns do quite as well for princesses he answered glancing at the girl s well made green gown with eyes of commendation Green belongs to fairyland he added when again the colour flushed into her cheeks I believe that you and Baba have only quite lately come from that enchanted country both the two of you as my old nurse used to say We like fairyland Baba and I the girl said gently and we both hope some day to see the fairies inside the flowers or dancing round one of their lovely rings We have found ever so many fairy rings in the fields round here She spoke with something of a child s eagerness all her momentary embarrassment gone and Rupert looked at her with an increasing sense of approval Cicely had not acted altogether unwisely in deciding to give her small daughter this unknown unvouched for girl as a nurse She was obviously a lady and a cultured lady and she possessed that nameless quality which never failed to appeal to Rupert s fastidious taste the restful charm of the true gentlewoman He liked this Miss Moore he told himself he distinctly liked her and he inwardly commended Cicely s choice whilst he said to Christina And all this time I have most rudely left your question unanswered You asked my name it is Mernside Rupert Mernside Oh was the only word that jerked itself out of Christina s lips whilst her eyes gazed at him with an expression of such unmistakable dismay that he looked at her in surprise Have you any unpleasant associations with my name he asked Has anybody called Mernside ever annoyed you Oh no she answered quickly Only once I heard the name before just R Mernside and I was surprised when when it turned out to be your name too The words were so incoherent the sentence so oddly turned that Rupert only looked as he felt more puzzled than before I had not ever seen you had I until I saw you in Baba s nursery he questioned No never She looked increasingly disconcerted beneath his puzzled stare It was only that I had heard had come across the name before and it surprised me to hear it again Not wishing to add to her almost painful embarrassment Rupert tactfully changed the subject but being an unusually observant man he noticed that she was not really at her ease during the whole course of his visit He rose to go therefore earlier than he would otherwise have done seeing how singularly peaceful he found the home like atmosphere The girl with her sweet eyes and restful manner the baby with her flower like face and her loving ways the old world firelit room the pervading sense of what was child like simple serene all these soothed the man racked with suspense and misery It was with reluctance that he closed the door upon it all Baba s parting words echoing in his ears as he ran downstairs and out into the fog of the December evening I think you are just zackly like the prince my pretty lady s prince and she s the princess Walking briskly up the village street in the direction of the inn he smiled as the words spoken in the clear little voice recurred to him again and the picture of the child and the girl stayed in his mind during the remainder of the evening whilst he sat in the uncompromisingly dull sitting room with Wilfred listening with very fluctuating attention to that young man s chatter about motoring sport and the possibilities of a Frontier campaign And what about Baba and her nurse the young man ended by saying As Baba s uncle I believe it was really my stern duty to go and look her up Ah well I happen to be her guardian Rupert answered drily and you were very much occupied with that American and his Daimler when I went out And has the nurse the bronze hair of the typical adventuress only tell me that Staynes answered stretching out his long legs to the fire If she has I shall feel it imperative to call on Baba to morrow before Don t talk rot my good fellow Rupert s tones had in them a note of irritation which his astute cousin was not slow to observe Didn t I explain to you that Cicely with all her tenderness of heart has too much common sense to give over Baba to the care of any doubtful sort of person The child s nurse is just a nice quiet girl who looks after her well and keeps her happy Great Scott A nice quiet girl I think I can safely take her on trust if you are satisfied that she is nice and quiet The adventuress appealed to me but nice quiet girls no thank you Rupert Now if only she had been like that delightful young person with green eyes who stopped the car the other day I should have felt twinges of conscience about my duty as an uncle What an utter rotter you are In spite of himself Mernside laughed knowing from a long and intimate acquaintance with Wilfred that the young man s surface nonsense went no deeper than the surface and that Staynes was in no sense of the word a Lothario A slight a very slight twinge afflicted his own conscience when he remembered the identity of the girl he had left that afternoon in the home like firelit room with the girl to whom his cousin had just alluded There is no necessity to tell him that the two girls are one and the same Rupert argued with himself Some day presumably he will meet Miss Moore and he may then recognise her again But the probability is that by that time the motor incident will have gone out of his head Meanwhile throughout the bantering conversation he carried on with Wilfred he found himself constantly wondering why the sound of his name had caused Baba s nurse such surprise and embarrassment She had seemed so friendly so natural so simple until the moment when his name had been mentioned and then she had changed into hesitating self consciousness her eyes afraid to meet his her manner uneasy and shy The real reason for the change in her never of course occurred to him It was only very occasionally that he even remembered the annoying episode of the matrimonial advertisement and then merely with a passing feeling of regret that he had failed to help the girl who had been his fellow victim in Jack Layton s hoax The girl s initials had faded from his memory in the more personal and acute trouble of Margaret Stanforth s continued absence and silence and he never for a moment connected the writer of the wistful little note signed C M with Baba s newest and most devoted slave If his thoughts that evening ran with curious persistency on Christina her thoughts turned with no less persistency to him and his visit and above all to the dismaying discovery that he was the R Mernside to whom she had audaciously written who in return had written to her so kindly After Baba had been safely tucked up in her cot sleepily asseverating that she meant to go for a ride in Cousin Rupert s car and that he was her Christina s prince Christina herself returned back to the sitting room and seated before the fire went over in her own mind all the conversation of the afternoon with its final climax And I don t know whether I ought to tell him who I really am or not the girl reflected looking deep into the heart of the glowing coals He was so kind to day but I don t believe he would go on feeling kind to a girl who could answer an advertisement like that even though he would still be kind because he is a gentleman I wonder if I ought to tell him And yet it would be horrible horrible to have to say it I should be so ashamed so dreadfully ashamed Only I think perhaps he would understand how poor I was how desperate I felt that day when I wrote to him He has such an understanding face and his eyes look as if they had seen so much sorrow so that he would know what other people s sorrows mean I wish I could be a rest bringer to him From that thought she drifted away to the lonely house in the valley to the beautiful woman whose troubled face and deep anguished eyes haunted the girl like an obsession and to the sick man whose death so doctor Fergusson had said was only perhaps a matter of a few short weeks What strange tragedy was hidden by the four walls of that lonely house What did it all mean the secrecy the isolation and above all the trouble that had been written so plainly on that beautiful woman s face I don t suppose I shall ever see her again was Christina s final and regretful thought as she rose to go to bed I wish people didn t have to be like ships that pass in the night only passing not staying together for a little while CHAPTER XIII YOU HAVE BEEN A FRIEND TO ME TO DAY Rupert would have found it difficult to explain why 
7354-87676-0000	train-other-500	on the following afternoon his steps again turned towards missus Nairne s house and why he assured himself that it would be kind to Cicely to go to see Baba again
7354-87676-0001	train-other-500	and take the latest tidings of the child back to her mother He only knew that he had a great desire to sit quietly in that firelit room again
7354-87676-0002	train-other-500	to feel the sense of peace and home like tranquillity that seemed to hover about it he only felt that in some inexplicable fashion Baba s new nurse
none	none	 the girl with the sweet eyes and gentle voice 
7354-87676-0003	train-other-500	rested him that her simplicity and some child like quality in her
none	none	 soothed the pain that tore at his heart 
7354-87676-0004	train-other-500	Women had played no part in his life until one woman had played an overmastering one and all that his passionate adoration of Margaret Stanforth had cost and was costing him
7354-87676-0005	train-other-500	gave an added charm to a nature devoid of all subtlety simple and serene Across the stretch of years between them he regarded Christina as little more than a child
none	none	 but it is often from a child s hands that the passion tossed 
7354-87676-0006	train-other-500	world weary soul can find most comfort and as Mernside for the second time sat in the old fashioned sitting room and had tea with Christina and her small charge
7354-87676-0007	train-other-500	he felt that in some indefinable fashion
none	none	 the girl s hands were unconsciously smoothing away some of the misery 
7354-87676-0008	train-other-500	that chafed his soul She showed no traces of her embarrassment of the previous day Night had brought its own counsels
none	none	 and she had determined not to disclose her identity to Mernside 
7354-87676-0009	train-other-500	After all she reflected philosophically
none	none	 I didn t do anything wrong 
7354-87676-0010	train-other-500	only something silly and it is all over now Probably he has forgotten all about the stupid girl who wrote him that letter and anyhow he doesn t think about me at all excepting
7354-87676-0011	train-other-500	as Baba s nurse so it would be foolish to make a fuss Having come to this determination Christina with characteristic good sense
none	none	 put away from her all thoughts of self consciousness and embarrassment and allowed herself to enjoy Mernside s visit with much the same childish delight as was evinced by Baba 
7354-87676-0012	train-other-500	And if the two showed their pleasure in different ways it was none the less patent to their visitor that the little nurse with her big green eyes and dusky cloud of hair
7354-87676-0013	train-other-500	took as much pleasure in his coming as did the golden haired baby and it gave him an odd glow of satisfaction to see her eyes brighten as he talked
none	none	 and to watch the swift soft flushes of colour that came and went in her cheeks 
7354-87676-0014	train-other-500	Rupert when he chose could talk well and interestingly he had travelled over the greater part of the world and in the course of his travels had used eyes and ears to good purpose
7354-87676-0015	train-other-500	And to Christina the little travelled to Christina the whole sum of whose existence had been divided between
none	none	 a Devonshire village the Donaldsons suburban house and a London lodging all that Rupert told of distant countries 
7354-87676-0016	train-other-500	and strange uncouth peoples was breathlessly interesting and entrancing Sitting there in the firelight Baba nestled closely in his arms Christina seated opposite to him
7354-87676-0017	train-other-500	her chin propped on her hands her eager eyes following his every word
none	none	 Rupert found himself talking as he had not talked for a long time with an eager boyish interest 
7354-87676-0018	train-other-500	that surprised himself
none	none	 It was only when some chance word of his led Christina to ask him a question about Biskra 
7354-87676-0019	train-other-500	that the flow of his eloquence suddenly ceased It was there in that garden of the desert that he had first met Margaret The girl s gently asked question
7354-87676-0020	train-other-500	for some inexplicable reason brought back to him
none	none	 as though it were only yesterday 
7354-87676-0021	train-other-500	the afternoon when the woman who ever since had dominated his whole existence had first come into his life Overhead the deep pure depths of the bluest sky he had ever seen
7354-87676-0022	train-other-500	against its blue stately palms that waved their fan like leaves with the soft rustling sounds that only belong to the palm trees and there in the sunlight
none	none	 stately as one of the great trees 
7354-87676-0023	train-other-500	her white gown falling about her Margaret had stood her dark eyes turned towards the all surrounding desert How or why they had begun to speak he could not now recall
7354-87676-0024	train-other-500	but from that first speech of fellow countrymen in a far off land they had passed into acquaintanceship and from that by easy stages to the friendship which he had implored her to give him
none	none	 in default of that which she had told him could never be his 
7354-87676-0025	train-other-500	Well at least in the years that followed he had been able to serve her to help her to ease some of the burden of her life
7354-87676-0026	train-other-500	that burden of which he himself knew so little And to have served her was something for which to be thankful If only there was the bitterness
none	none	 if only she had not gone away out of his ken now 
7354-87676-0027	train-other-500	in this strange mysterious fashion leaving him ignorant of her whereabouts and of all that concerned her If only she had trusted him more If only
7354-87676-0028	train-other-500	With a start he roused himself to realise that Christina s eyes were watching him with a certain shy wonder and remembering that he had broken off his conversation almost in the middle of a sentence he looked at her
7354-87676-0029	train-other-500	with a smile of apology Do please forgive me he said Your mention of Biskra brought back so many pictures of the past and
none	none	 I was looking at them instead of going on with my story 
7354-87676-0030	train-other-500	Baba likes pictures the child murmured drowsily Perhaps Baba would like the picture I saw her cousin answered feeling an odd compulsion to speak of what was in his thoughts
7354-87676-0031	train-other-500	a picture of palm trees and a princess in a white gown who walked amongst them and Was the princess like Christina
7354-87676-0032	train-other-500	Baba all at once pulled herself into an upright position on his knee and looked earnestly into his face Tell Baba if that princess was like mine own pretty lady
7354-87676-0033	train-other-500	The eyes of the two elders met and Christina laughed confusedly Baba sees the people she loves through very rosy spectacles she said and Rupert smiled
7354-87676-0034	train-other-500	whilst Baba s insistent voice repeated Tell if the princess in the white frock was like Christina No no not at all like her Rupert began
7354-87676-0035	train-other-500	his eyes glancing at the bent dark head opposite to him at the clear whiteness of the cheeks into which the colour was flushing so becomingly at the deep green of her eyes
7354-87676-0036	train-other-500	the red line of her lips no the princess was at least he broke off suddenly and looked more narrowly at the girl
none	none	 How absurd he exclaimed 
7354-87676-0037	train-other-500	and what an extraordinary hallucination
none	none	 It shows what a power of imagination the least imaginative of us may possess 
7354-87676-0038	train-other-500	but at that moment your princess and mine little Baba had a queer fantastic likeness to one another Christina looked up at him sharply
7354-87676-0039	train-other-500	surprise the predominating expression on her face But before she could speak
none	none	 Baba s clear tones again made themselves heard 
7354-87676-0040	train-other-500	Just tell Baba zackly zackly what the princess in the white frock was like
none	none	 Baba wants to know 
7354-87676-0041	train-other-500	Again Rupert felt impelled to speak
none	none	 almost against his own inclination and his words came with a readiness 
7354-87676-0042	train-other-500	which if he had considered the matter would greatly have surprised him She was tall he answered very tall and very stately
7354-87676-0043	train-other-500	as stately as one of the palm trees under which she stood and her face was white like her gown only it was not white as sick people are white but like the whiteness of a rose
7354-87676-0044	train-other-500	very clear and pure And her hair was black black as a raven s wing his voice grew dreamy he seemed to have forgotten his listeners and merely to be thinking aloud
none	none	 whilst he watched the leaping flames of the fire 
7354-87676-0045	train-other-500	and her eyes were deep and dark fathomless wells of colour and very sad Christina drew in her breath quickly and leant forward an eager look on her face I
none	none	 never saw any eyes like those 
7354-87676-0046	train-other-500	the man s voice continued they held so much
none	none	 they had seen so much they were so beautiful and so sad The princess he started and tried to resume a lighter tone was the most beautiful lady in the world little Baba She is just like Christina began impetuously then stopped short remembering the secrecy enjoined upon her by the woman whom she knew only as Margaret the woman of the lonely valley house Just like who Rupert turned to her with the sharp question a sudden gleam in his eyes Do you know anybody answering to the description I have just given Have you ever seen someone like like my princess The eagerness of his tones the gleam in his eyes showed Christina the necessity for caution and she answered quietly I think the lady you describe is something like a lady I once saw at least she was beautiful with dark eyes and hair the girl ended confusedly It could not be the same person Rupert said with decision The princess I am describing was unique You would not speak of her in those terms of lukewarm praise Her beauty was something beyond and above anything ordinary or everyday So Christina was on the point of saying almost indignantly so was the beauty of my lovely lady but she checked her words just in time prudence demanded that she should say nothing rather than that by saying a word too much she should betray another woman s trust I should like to have seen her under the palm tree she said wondering in her girlish heart whether it was the beautiful princess in the white gown who had brought the lines of pain about this man s face and into his grey eyes wishing too with girlish innocent fervour that it might be given to her to take away some of his pain I wish you could have seen her he answered her speech I think you and she would understand one another but again the words seemed forced from him at this moment I don t even know where she is The concentrated bitterness of the tone the haggard misery of the look that accompanied the words stabbed at Christina s tender heart Oh I am sorry she exclaimed I wish I could help you she spoke with a child s impulsive eagerness but it was the tender pity of a womanly woman that looked out of her eyes and the look gave Rupert a sense of having been touched with some healing balm Baba was no longer taking any conscious part in the conversation the warmth of the fire combined with the consumption of a plentiful supply of missus Nairne s toast and cake had induced profound drowsiness and the sounds of her elders voices having acted as a final soporific the little maid now slept peacefully her dimpled hand against Rupert s neck her golden curls upon his shoulder The man and girl were to all intents and purposes alone and Rupert looked across at Christina with the smile that gave such extraordinary charm to his face No wonder this small girl looks at you with rosy spectacles he said you are one of the born helpers of this world What makes you say you would like to help me Do you think I need help I am sure you do came the prompt reply your eyes she broke off startled by her own audacity her glance wavering from his face to the fire Your eyes he repeated after her What do you find in my eyes that makes you think I want help He spoke with the same caressing kindliness he might have bestowed on a child he felt an odd desire to confide in her as a grown up person does sometimes feel oddly constrained to confide in a little child whose sympathy whilst lacking comprehension is still full of comfort Your eyes are so sad she answered frankly when he paused for her reply you seem as if you were looking always for something you have lost something which is very precious to you So I am he replied pillowing Baba more closely in his arms and leaning nearer to Christina I don t know by what wonderful gift you discovered all that in my eyes but it is true I am looking for something I have lost or perhaps something I have never had he added bitterly under his breath Some day surely you will find it she said gently her heart aching because of the sudden hardening of his mouth and eyes Find what I have never had he laughed and his laugh hurt the girl who listened I may find the person who has gone out of my ken that is possible I never forget to look for what I have lost wherever I go and I go to many places in my car But even if I found the human being I have lost will everything be less elusive less hopeless than before Of course you know you are talking in riddles Christina answered gravely her brows drawn together in a frown you don t want to let me understand what you really mean and that is very natural she added with a practical common sense that sat quaintly upon her but I should have liked to help you You do help me he said quickly it sounds absurd to say so even to myself it seems absurd because it is not my way to take anybody into my confidence But I can trust you The simply spoken words set Christina s heart beating with innocent pride her eyes looked at him gratefully Thank you for saying that she answered I think it is true You can trust me and I am glad so very glad if there is anything I can do to help you If if I might understand a little better she added falteringly The story I told Baba just now was a true one he answered abruptly the beautiful lady really walked under the palm trees and I well these stories all have the same plot I wanted her for my princess But she had a prince of her own already The half bitter half jesting way in which he spoke sent all the child in the girl into the background brought all the woman in her into prominence she put out her hand with a little pitiful gesture Oh she whispered softly oh but that was hard It seemed hard to me his tone was grim it seemed an irony of fate beyond my poor powers of comprehension more especially when I found no not found I don t know for certain even now I know nothing less than nothing again came that bitterness that hurt his listener but when I guessed that the prince was not worthy of her that it was my lot to stand aside and be a friend only whilst someone not worthy to touch the hem of her gown had the place of honour then I knew what sorry tricks Fate can play And the poor princess Christina asked gently A light flashed over Rupert s face There is the wonder of it all the wonder of womanhood he exclaimed mind I don t know any facts for certain I only guess that the rightful prince is not worthy to tie the strings of her shoes and yet he is all the world to her The rest of us are nothing No that isn t true either he corrected himself hurriedly I have her friendship I have the unspeakable honour of being her friend but the best of her is given to someone who is not worthy Not that the best man among us is worthy to touch her hand he added with an impetuosity that made him seem all at once oddly young and boyish And she your friend is it she you have lost now Christina questioned softly when he paused He nodded Yes she left town suddenly giving me no reason for going I have been able to do many things for her things a friend could do She is very fragile she has been very ill and now I do not even know where she is I can only surmise that the man who is not worthy needed her help and she has done his bidding Worthy or unworthy her soul is wrapped up in him Woman s love is a wonderful thing almost incomprehensible to men Unbidden before Christina s mind there rose a half darkened room a bed piled high with pillows and lying back amongst the pillows a woman with a beautiful stricken face and deep eyes of haunting sadness Unbidden there came to her memory words spoken in a low passionate voice You don t know what it means to care so much for a man that no matter what he is or does he is your world your whole world And with the memory came an illuminating flash of thought Could it be possible that the beautiful lady of the lonely valley and the princess in the white gown of whom this man spoke were one and the same person Her preoccupation with this thought made her silent for so long after Rupert s last speech that presently he said quietly I don t know why I am inflicting all this upon you or why I have been egotistical enough to think my confidence could be in the smallest degree interesting to somebody who is almost a stranger A stranger Christina echoed the words blankly then laughed a little tremulously I had forgotten we had only met so seldom she said it doesn t feel as if you were a stranger and I am so glad so proud that you have trusted me Some people from the very beginning don t seem like strangers do they she asked with a smile That s quite true he answered I am not a subtle person I don t profess to be able to explain these things but some people do seem to jump directly into one s friendship whilst other people jog along beside us all our lives and we get no nearer to them at last than we were at first You have been a friend to me to day Have I I am glad the colour rushed into her face and I wish I could help more He smiled at her again He still had the feeling that he was talking to a charming child one of rarely sympathetic and understanding nature and yet through all the mist of masculine density in which he was wrapped he was conscious of the womanly tenderness that had looked out of Christina s eyes and spoken in her voice That maternal instinct which is innately part of every good woman s nature was largely developed in Christina and involuntarily Rupert had made an appeal to that instinct He would have laughed to scorn the bare idea that he a strong and self reliant man of the world could ever lean or need to lean upon a slip of a girl whose youthfulness was written in every line of her face and of her slight form And yet unwittingly he had put out his hands to her for help much as a little child puts out hands to its mother for comfort and guidance Children all these men folk of the world Children all they have been from days immemorial and presumably will be still the same in the days to come And their womenkind love them and comfort them guide them and tend them learning with the sure instinct of womanhood that they are just little boys to be taken care of and watched over and mothered all the time Christina knew this truth instinctively if she could not have put it into definite words Christina knew it each daughter of Eve knows it by experience bitter or sweet it is the truth that every woman knows CHAPTER XIV I AM QUITE SURE YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID You are sure I need not be alarmed You are quite quite sure She is all my world Denis Fergusson looked down at the small trembling creature his eyes full of grave kindliness Indeed you need not be alarmed Lady Cicely he said I advised Miss Moore to send for you because with a child everything is so rapid that one never quite knows at the beginning of an illness how things may go But little Miss Baba is doing exactly as she ought to do in every way You need not have the slightest anxiety The little mother with her lovely troubled face stood in the window of that same low old fashioned room which Rupert a fortnight earlier had found such a restful place and the doctor stood by her side The winter sunshine fell upon her delicately cut features lighting the pale gold of her hair into a halo and the blue eyes she turned to her companion seemed to him scarcely less innocent and sweet than the eyes which had looked into his from Baba s cot Such a little woman to have the responsibilities of womanhood was his thought such a little woman who looks as if she ought to be wrapped round with care and tenderness Perhaps some of the chivalrous tenderness of his thought showed itself in his glance perhaps Cicely could read in his face the trustworthy nature of the man for she said quickly You see Baba and I have only each other in the world and that makes her very extra precious Sometimes I am afraid because I love her so much Afraid The doctor s glance was puzzled Yes afraid lest God should take her away from me He might think I was making an idol of her and that it was better I should do without her That thought makes me afraid To no living soul before had Cicely told of the fear that often stirred within her but Denis Fergusson s brown eyes and sympathetic manner invited confidence and in some unaccountable fashion he made her think of John the loving husband who had always understood Isn t yours rather a pagan way of looking at things Fergusson said gently Surely our God is not a jealous God Who takes away what we love because we love it I don t believe it is possible to love a person too much if one only loves them rightly And I could never believe that the God Whose name is Father could be angry with a mother s love I am glad you have said that to me Cicely answered Baba is so much to me so very very much but I don t want to make an idol of her dear little sweetheart She is a very adorable person Fergusson said brightly I shall miss my daily visits to her she and I have made great friends She is the friendliest soul We have always wrapped her round with love I wanted her to be loving and happy I think you have succeeded She is the delight of the village and of the whole neighbourhood She and her very capable nurse are known for miles round There will be great lamentations when they go They must come back Cicely smiled well pleased at the praise of her darling I am taking them both to Bramwell for Christmas but later on in the spring or summer they will come here again But I alas shall be gone Ah I forgot you are only doing temporary work here You know you are not quite in the picture here she said with a smile Why The one word though abruptly uttered was accompanied by the smile that made Fergusson s poorer patients say it warmed their hearts when he smiled at them and Cicely had the same sensation of warmth Because you are not in the least like any country doctor I ever came across and I am sure you would never bear being buried in rural depths You belong to cities and people I hoped I had managed to hide my proclivity for gutters he answered laughing I am afraid you are right A big city draws me like a magnet I can say with the poet The need of a world of men for me The finest scenery in the world does not make up to me for the lack of human beings Then you are a town person Very much a town person My home and work lie in a rather sordid very poor to me enthrallingly interesting corner of South London I am only here for a time doing his work for an old acquaintance and incidentally getting a change I rather needed You knocked yourself up with work in South London Not quite that I got a little played out and the air of this place has more than set me up I shall go back like a giant refreshed They are chiefly poor people your patients she questioned Almost entirely poor It is always interesting work sometimes heartrending work often humiliating The poor are so wonderful in their attitude to one another and to all their difficulties and troubles But if I once begin to talk about my South London folk I shall never stop Some day you will perhaps let me tell you of their hard fight with life and of their splendid courage You must let me help you and them she answered impulsively and thank you again ten thousand times for all you have done for my little Baba The short sharp illness which had brought Cicely flying down from town at a moment s notice had safely run its course and Baba was now enjoying a convalescence in which she was petted and spoilt to her heart s content petted to an extent that might have done harm to a less sweet and wholesome character But the love that had wrapped the child round from her first hours of life had only made her sunny sweetness of nature more sweet and sunny and she was a very captivating patient missus Nairne vied with Cicely and Christina in as she phrased it cosseting up the precious little dear and the village folk who had learnt to love the small girl in her red cloak with her dainty face and gracious manners showered gifts and enquiries upon the invalid Very quaint presents found their way to Baba s bedside A plump young chicken from good missus Smithers whose poultry yard had caused the child the keenest delight eggs from Widow Jones who cherished a few rakish fowls in her strip of back garden girdle cakes most fearsome for digestive purposes from missus Madden the blacksmith s wife whilst the blacksmith himself brought a horse shoe polished to the brightness of a silver mirror for the little lady who had loved to stand beside the flaming forge watching the sparks fly up as his huge hammer struck the anvil Children came shyly with bunches of the berries and coloured leaves that still hung in the hedges and a very ancient dame whose garden boasted of two equally ancient apple trees proudly toddled up to missus Nairne s door with the largest and rosiest of her apples for the pretty little lady Baba seems to have made them all love her Cicely said to Christina tears standing in her blue eyes when she returned from interviewing the old lady of the apples everybody who comes speaks of her as if she were an old and valued friend She has made friends with every living soul Christina answered she is the most loving little child and so tender hearted over everything that is hurt or unhappy I don t wonder everyone here adores her doctor Fergusson seems to think she will soon be quite well and we must move her home for a few days and then to Bramwell Yes he says she will soon be quite well Christina repeated but I think I ought to remind you that my month of probation ended last week and and I don t know whether you would care to let me still be Baba s nurse Nobody knew what it cost the girl to say those apparently simple words nor how hard it had been to resist the temptation to leave them unsaid Lady Cicely had obviously forgotten that her new nurse had come on a month s trial only she was taking it for granted that Christina was a permanent part of her household and the girl shrank indescribably from any possibility of a change And yet conscience urged her to remind her employer of their compact for a month s probation She instinctively felt that to drift on into being Baba s permanent nurse would not be fair to Baba s kindly impulsive little mother You don t know whether I should care to keep you on Cicely exclaimed when Christina had finished her halting speech what absurdity Why the doctor told me your careful nursing helped to get my darling safely out of her nasty wood As if I should dream of letting you go unless you want to leave us she questioned hastily Want to leave you Christina s eyes dilated with the intensity of her emotion why I am so happy with Baba and with you that I couldn t bear even the very thought of going away from you Only I thought it was right to remind you about our agreement It was rather a stupid agreement Cicely answered lightly I had the fear of Rupert before my eyes I knew he was thinking me a sort of impetuous infant for insisting on asking you to come to Baba just because you and she got on so well together Rupert has a very well balanced mind He likes things done decently and in order I am not built on the same lines Christina laughed Still you do like decency and order she answered Ah yes Cicely shrugged her shoulders but Rupert the dear soul is more conventional Men always are He likes beaten tracks and the ways in which all our dear ancestors pottered along for countless generations I like to make nice little new paths with my own feet and do little new things that my great grandmother never dreamt of doing even in her wildest dreams Is mister Mernside so very conventional Christina asked and Cicely responded quickly He s a perfect dear but he would not for the world go out of the orthodox track He believes in formal introductions and long acquaintance as a prelude to friendship and he would rather die than give his confidence to anyone unless he had known them for years and knew everything about them A faint a very faint smile hovered over Christina s lips Did mister Mernside really think long acquaintance a necessary prelude to friendship Did he only give his confidence to those he had known longest Seated in the firelight in this very room only a fortnight ago he had told her many things which surely he would only have told to a friend a faithful and loyal friend And yet she had known him for so short a time if time was to be measured merely by days and weeks You saw Rupert the other day Lady Cicely went on no thought of what was in the girl s mind crossing her own he wrote and told me how well and happy Baba looked He was so kind Christina s voice was quite non committal He came twice to have tea with Baba I think he enjoyed nursery tea she added demurely He loves children and they love him He is a most disappointing person never to have married I always tell him so But he is not the least a woman s man I really don t believe there has ever been a woman in Rupert s life at all The words echoed oddly in Christina s ears when memory was still bringing back to her the vivid recollection of Rupert s princess in the white gown of Rupert s own lined and haggard face when he had told her the story of the beautiful lady who dominated his life Discretion led her to reply more or less evasively to Cicely s words and to her great relief the subject dropped and her small ladyship returned to the discussion of Christina s own affairs As to any question of your leaving us she said there is no such question Neither Baba nor I can do without you now And I have not yet discovered that you are any of the dreadful things one seems to expect people to be We always ask if nurses are sober and honest and I don t believe you drink or steal Christina laughed gaily No I m not a thief or a drunkard I can truly say But all the same you might not have found that I knew enough about children to give you satisfaction and there are so many ways in which you might say I am inefficient I find you just what I want Cicely answered emphatically and so does Baba Why if you left her now it would break her dear little heart No you have got to stay with us for ever and ever amen we will take Baba to town as soon as that nice doctor Fergusson says she may move and then we will go to Bramwell for Christmas The thought of that nice doctor Fergusson recurred to the little lady more than once that evening when she sat writing in the sitting room whilst Christina performed Baba s evening toilette He makes me think of John so Cicely s thoughts ran he has the same kind understanding eyes brown like John s and the same gentle way with him that John had I think he knew how lonely it feels for me sometimes and what a big responsibility life is for one little scrap of a woman like me And indeed strangely enough thoughts not at all unlike these were passing through Denis Fergusson s mind as he drove rapidly back to Pinewood Lodge and whilst he ate his solitary meal that evening in doctor Stokes s trim dining room furnished in precisely the way Fergusson himself would not have furnished it he found Cicely s delicately fair face and soft blue eyes constantly rising before his mental vision he found himself wondering what manner of man her husband had been and whether those blue eyes had been lighted with love for that dead man s sake She looked like some lovely pathetic child when she talked to me to day so his reflections ran she and that fascinating Baba of hers are just a pair of babies together and yet all the woman and the mother are in her too and glancing round the formal room Fergusson sighed and made a great effort to turn his thoughts away from sudden alluring dreams of a home of his own a home that would be really a home not merely a place in which to live where the centre of all its peace and happiness would be his wife His wife He laughed aloud a little short laugh that rang discordantly in his ears It was quite improbable that he would ever be able to afford to ask any woman to marry him much less a dainty delicately nurtured woman who who Back into his mind flashed the picture which he had been resolutely thrusting from him the picture of a lovely face like some exquisite flower rising above a cloud of filmy lace and soft dark furs the big feathers in her hat drooping against the gold of her hair It was on missus Nairne s doorstep that he had first met Cicely and the picture of her as he saw her then in the pale wintry sunlight seemed to haunt him all the more persistently because side by side with it he saw another and strangely different picture His own house in a South London road its sordid surroundings its unsavoury neighbourhood all these made Cicely and her daintiness seem like some princess belonging to another world Pshaw you poor fool Fergusson ejaculated aloud when his dinner ended he retired to smoke in a small den dignified by the name of smoking room the sooner doctor Stokes comes back and you clear out from here and return to the sober realities of life in Southwark the better for you Dreaming dreams and seeing visions is no part of your vocation He had reached this stage of his meditations and had drawn up a chair to the writing table with a grim determination to finish an article for a medical journal when the parlourmaid entering handed him an exceedingly grubby note It was briefly worded Please come at once He is dying There was no address and the only signature was the one letter M but Fergusson at once understood what the message portended The car hurriedly ordered was soon waiting for him at the front door and telling the man he would drive himself the doctor glided quickly away in the direction of the lonely house in the valley Shall I discover anything of the mystery belonging to the house he wondered as he sped along the dark country roads his own powerful lamps throwing a stream of light upon the road ahead or will the secret whatever it is die with that unfortunate man Whatever he has done or been and he has either done or been something out of the common and something not very commendable I am prepared to swear his crimes were crimes of weakness not of wickedness The man is weak through and through and why that wonderful woman has poured out such a wealth of love upon him is one of the problems of womanhood He smiled as his meditations reached this point and once again his thoughts flew back to that picture which had haunted them earlier in the evening the picture of Baba s mother fair sweet and dainty Would she be ready to love through good and ill as that other woman had done he reflected would she be ready to act as a prop or must she find someone to look up to and depend upon and thinking these things he drew up before the high wall and the green door before which a lantern flung a feeble light upon the surrounding blackness Elizabeth admitted him her face looked very worn her eyes were heavy with want of sleep He took a bad turn two hours ago she said in answer to the doctor s question he s going fast and I can t get her to leave him though it is killing her too It would only make her worse to try and take her away from him now Fergusson said gently knowing the good woman s devotion to her mistress hearing the little shake in her voice as she spoke of Margaret if the end has come it will not be long he has no strength to fight a long fight Strength the servant muttered a curious contempt in her accents you couldn t name him and the word strength in the same breath There I ve no business to talk like that of one who s dying but give me a strong man give them me strong all the time I can t do with them weak Fergusson made no reply He saw that the woman overwrought with long watching and anxiety was temporarily deprived of her normal reticence and taciturnity and he recognised that her outburst owed its origin to her great love for her mistress and to that natural antagonism which a strong character is apt to feel towards the weak Handing her his coat he passed rapidly along the corridor to the room with which he was now familiar and going in softly saw at a glance that the sick man in the bed was drawing very near to the Valley of the Shadow He lay propped up with pillows and the beautiful woman known to Fergusson as missus Stanforth stood beside him his head drawn close to her breast Her arm was about him and he had turned his face against her as a child lays its face against its mother his dim eyes fixed upon her with a look of almost passionate adoration With her free hand she stroked back the damp hair from his forehead now and again wiping away the drops of sweat with a filmy handkerchief she held and her eyes watched him with a hungry loving look that brought a lump into Fergusson s throat To know that a woman will look into one s dying face with such a look as that is worth everything the thought flashed unbidden into his mind as he stepped softly up to the bed and laid a hand upon the patient s wrist The dying man looked at him with a faint smile of welcome but the woman did not move or glance at him Her whole soul was wrapped up in the man she loved the man who was passing so fast away from her into the silent land Nearly done doctor the man in the bed panted out the smile still lingering on his face I thought I should have been afraid but now the time has come there is no fear His eyes left Fergusson and lifted themselves to the face bending over him You rest me sweetheart he said I am never afraid when you are with me As his eyes met hers his smile acquired a strange radiance and Fergusson all at once recognised the charm of the man that magnetic something which had won and held the love of such a woman as Margaret Until this moment the reason for the weak man s hold over this woman had baffled almost annoyed Denis Now in a flash of illumination it seemed to him he understood it He had seen at once that the dying man was already beyond all human aid he gave him an injection of strychnine but there was nothing else he could do to ward off that dread visitor whose feet had already crossed the threshold Yet he felt that his presence in the house if not in the room would be a help to the woman so soon to be left desolate and having spoken a word or two of comfort and cheer in that strong voice of his which carried comfort in its very tones he moved away to the adjoining room Call me if there is the slightest change he whispered to Margaret you and he would rather be alone just now She bent her head and for the fraction of a second her eyes met his The misery in those deep eyes tore at his heart strings his powerlessness to help this fellow creature who was in such dire sorrow hurt him as if he had received some physical blow Alone in the next room he seated himself by the fire and tried to read a book he picked up from the table but his thoughts refused to take in a single word of the printed page he was conscious of nothing but the low murmur of voices from the bed he could just see through the open door The words spoken by the two whom death was parting he could not hear but his heart ached intolerably for them both for the man who was drifting into the Great Silence for the woman who was being left behind One long failure one long chapter of infamy and wrong the man s whisper barely reached the woman s ears as she bent over him But you are sorry for it all now my darling she whispered back only think that you are sorry for the wrong only think that now If you forgive surely God forgives The dim eyes looked wistfully up at hers and she stooped with an infinitely tender gesture to kiss his ashen face Surely most surely God forgives she answered solemnly the strength of her voice carrying conviction with it where there is a great love there is great forgiveness and Like yours he interrupted dreamily great love such a great love and a great forgiveness I have heaped your life with misery and shame and still you forgive still you love Still I love she whispered a passion of tenderness in the low spoken words Max love real love can t wear out or die whatever happens It has always been you only you you entirely my man my whole world At the last words she drew his head more closely against her breast and bending over him kissed him with a long lingering kiss Only me in spite of everything Only you sweetheart she murmured only you always And that other who has been your friend of whom you told me His voice was growing fainter He has been he is my good and loyal friend she answered he is nothing more to me than that He could not ever be anything more Perhaps afterwards when I have gone you and he But she would not let him finish his halting breathless sentence He and I will never be more than friends she said very clearly very firmly I could not love another man There is not room in my heart for anyone but you A silence followed a silence only broken by the dying man s difficult long drawn breaths by the occasional dropping of a coal into the grate or the creaking of the heavy old furniture And all the time Margaret stood immovable in her place her arms about the dying man his head close pillowed against her All at once he spoke again hurriedly fearfully You are sure forgiveness he gasped out God will forgive I am sure she answered and there was no quaver in her voice only a great certainty there are no bounds to God s love He will forgive He loves you my dear I am quite sure you need not be afraid She spoke as gently in as simple language as though he had been a little child and the fear slowly died out of his face His eyes looked once again into hers with a look of adoring love and reverence then with a tired sigh the sigh of an over weary child his head sank back more heavily against her and the gasping breath was still CHAPTER XV I DO TRUST CICELY YOU KEEP HER IN HER PLACE Your being in town for Christmas is quite an unusual occurrence isn t it Cousin Arthur Quite unusual I may almost say unprecedented Dear Ellen and I as you know have the greatest horror of any prolonged stay in this Babylon but at the present moment it is impossible to avoid it And Cousin Ellen is bearing up pretty well Cicely could not keep the twinkle out of her eyes although her voice was perfectly grave but Sir Arthur being as has been said totally devoid of humour only observed the becoming gravity of tone and not the twinkle As well as can be expected he responded with a gloomy shake of the head but she dislikes hotels at all times and at Christmas she doubly dislikes having to live a hotel life We have our little festivities at home quite small unpretentious festivities for the servants and the men on the estate and we shall feel not taking part in them And surely the servants will miss you Cicely said with her pretty gracious manner whilst it must be confessed she inwardly wondered whether the Congreves household staff would regret or be relieved by the absence of their master and mistress at this festive season We hope so we hope so Sir Arthur answered pompously dear Ellen and I always try to infuse a wholesome spirit into all the little gaieties and we feel keenly being absent this Christmas But we must be in London just now Our own beloved border is too remote Cicely thought with a shudder of that wild Welsh border on which the Congreve mansion stood and instinctively she drew her costly furs more closely round her dainty person as if the very memory of the remote region gave her a sensation of chill You are in town on business of course she went on more for the sake of saying something than because she felt the slightest grain of interest in the affairs of her husband s elderly cousin I must bring Baba to see Cousin Ellen before we go to Bramwell Baba is the duckiest wee thing in the world in my prejudiced opinion and I believe Cousin Ellen will like her Sir Arthur disliked all modern terms of endearment He looked frigidly at Cicely and wondered not for the first time what his sensible and sober minded cousin John Redesdale could possibly have seen to admire in this frivolous creature who was now his widow I am not surprised poor John died Sir Arthur reflected such flightiness such flippancy must have grated on him terribly It was not given to Sir Arthur to understand his fellow men much less his fellow women and it is doubtful whether he would have believed John Redesdale himself if that dear and noble man had risen from the dead to assure his cousin of his passionate and unswerving devotion to Cicely his much loved wife Dear Ellen will be very pleased to see your little girl Sir Arthur said stiffly after that swift moment of thought You know we always call her Veronica We disapprove of pet names and Veronica is a valued name in our family The vexed question of Baba s style and title being one that recurred on every occasion when Cicely and Sir Arthur met the little lady made a hasty change of subject saying brightly I will bring her one day You know she was ill at Graystone She gave me a terrible fright but she is quite well again and I think we owe a great deal to Christina Baba s delightful nurse a lady a most dear and charming girl who is as much of a companion for me as for her own special charge A lady A lady nurse I hope you are wise in this my dear Cicely it is rather an innovation a departure from the good old ways Now I have a theory that a middle aged nurse of the very respectable old fashioned type is the best sort of person to be about a child If only one could dig her out of anywhere Cicely answered with her bright smile but she is so scarce nowadays as to be practically prehistoric I have had every variety of nurse and they seemed to me to oscillate between minxes and humbugs until I found Christina And with this young woman you no doubt had excellent references said Sir Arthur fixing a piercing glance upon his companion too much care could not be exercised about the person who has charge of your little girl Cicely gave what she afterwards explained to herself as a mental gasp but she was mistress of the situation She looked into Sir Arthur s severe face with a smile upon her own and said smoothly I do agree so entirely with you about being very careful who one engages as a nurse for a little child I often feel that Baba s whole future depends on the hands that mould her now when her dear little character is so much clay to be made into what shape the hands choose Sir Arthur let loose on another of his favourite hobby horses the education of the young forgot to notice that his cousin s pretty widow had omitted to answer the question he had put to her and cantering away on the above horse did not realise that he was as ignorant as before about Christina s references He was still descanting forcibly on the most absolutely perfect and in fact the only way of training a child in the way it should go when the door of the hotel sitting room opened and Lady Congreve entered She was a depressed looking little woman with the meek mouth and deprecating eyes of a wife whose lord s word is law and more than law and her first glance was not for their guest but for the masterful gentleman standing with legs firmly apart on the hearth rug giving his opinion in the full certainty that Cicely s interested attention signified complete acquiescence in all his views Ah my dear there you are he broke off to say with a gracious wave of his hand to his wife Cicely and I have been talking about education and I am glad to think she sees matters quite as I see them The tiniest smile dimpled about Cicely s mouth Sir Arthur s interpretation of her total silence during his harangue pleased her sense of humour but being of a peace loving disposition and averse to argument especially with such an obstinately one sided arguer as Sir Arthur she allowed his statement to pass without contradiction and greeted Lady Congreve with the charming cordiality that gave her so delightful a personality I am so sorry you have to be in town at this time of the year just when you must want to be at home she said sympathetically Lady Congreve cast another fleeting glance at her husband then looked with a sigh round the stiffly furnished sitting room with its suite of brightly upholstered furniture and its particularly unhomelike air It is a great disappointment to us both she answered in her soft deprecating voice that to Cicely always seemed to be apologising for daring to make itself heard at all I dislike this terribly noisy wicked city as much as dear Arthur does and we had looked forward to our usual pleasant Christmas gathering To me Christmas is scarcely Christmas if it is not spent in a home a real home In the flash of a second Cicely with her wonted kindly impulsiveness made up her mind to do what in the bottom of her soul she knew she loathed doing and what she knew would rob her own Christmas of all its joyousness She looked from one to the other of the two Congreves Sir Arthur still upright on the hearth rug his wife a small dejected heap in an armchair and said in her most gracious manner I do wonder if you will do what I am going to ask you to do I know you are here on business but just at Christmas time itself just for Christmas Day and Boxing Day you can t do any business at all so will you come and spend at least those days with us at Bramwell We go to morrow could you come three days hence on Christmas Eve or earlier if you will I quite see that your own home is too far away but our home is so near only an hour by train and we mean to try and have a home like Christmas Do come Lady Congreve s pathetic little face brightened a gleam of pleasure shot into her wistful eyes Somewhere in that small crushed soul of hers the soul that for nearly forty years her husband had manipulated with ruthless hands she had a profound longing for all the colour and glory of life and in some nebulous and inexplicable way Cicely had always seemed to her the embodiment of both Oh Arthur she faltered Could we It would be delightful such a relief after this great wilderness of an hotel Could we go dear Sir Arthur drew his brows together in a judicial way peculiar to him and bearing no relation to the importance of the matter in hand Very kind of you to think of such an arrangement my dear Cicely he began very kind indeed And it is true as you say that ordinary business cannot be transacted at Christmas time But we are not here on quite ordinary business I think I told you when I last saw you that my unfortunate brother in law is giving us great uneasiness Yes you did mention it Cicely answered again racking her brain in vain to remember what constituted the misfortunes of the brother in law but I did not know Quite so quite so Sir Arthur interrupted waving her words aside we do not discuss the subject frequently because as you are aware it is one which is most repugnant to us But for my poor sister s sake I feel bound to come forward now greatly as I dislike being mixed up with such an affair I belong to those who believe that the touch of pitch defiles Cicely wondered more and more who and what the recalcitrant brother in law could be that the mention of him drew such strong expressions from Sir Arthur s lips brought so stern a look to his face but he did not allow her time to ask any questions or make any comment on his speech resuming with scarcely a pause I am using what influence I possess to have the whole matter hushed up as far as is compatible with right and justice The poor man himself is not likely to live long enough to be punished and if scandal can be averted from our family which for so many generations has been sans reproche I shall feel rewarded for all my trouble Cicely reflected that it was quite useless to try and disentangle the meaning of Sir Arthur s mysterious and incomprehensible words and being by nature the least inquisitive of beings she asked no further questions But if all that you have to do leaves you free for two or three days at Christmas please come to us she said we shall be only a very small party My brother Wilfred can t come and I am afraid Rupert Mernside my cousin may not be with us this year but my dear old governess Miss Doubleday always comes to us for Christmas and Baba Christina and I are the gay and youthful elements I like to make Christmas a very happy time for my girlie she added almost apologetically when she saw how at her words Sir Arthur s lips closed tightly You think it rather wrong to be young and gay don t you she went on a touch of defiance in her pretty voice but you see I am anyhow not at all old and I want to keep myself as young as ever I can for Baba I have no objection to youth as such Sir Arthur answered with a lofty condescension that gave Cicely an overpowering wish to giggle feebly but I should have thought you a widow with so many cares so many responsibilities and above all with an immortal soul entrusted to your care that you would have put childish things behind you and taken up life with greater seriousness Do you know Cicely answered very softly though her eyes shone John my dear husband told me he hoped I should always keep my young heart and I hope I shall I want to be young as he liked me to be when I meet him again And I want to keep Baba always with her child soul too she went on a sudden dreaminess in her glance John used to say that the Kingdom of Heaven was for the child like and the children But I mustn t waste your time and Cousin Ellen s in argument she exclaimed with a brisk change of tone only promise to come to Bramwell for Christmas and we will try to make you happy And I am sure you will like my dear little Christina You are not allowing her to presume on her being a lady I do trust Cicely Sir Arthur said gravely You keep her in her place If she has undertaken to be a children s nurse she should learn to occupy the position usually occupied by children s nurses and only that Cicely lifted lovely pleading eyes to his censorious blue ones I am afraid you will think me all sorts of dreadful things but I could not keep Christina exclusively in the nursery When you see her you will understand what I mean She and Baba are a good deal with me and at Bramwell they will probably be with me still more There was a gentle dignity about her manner which made even the outrageous autocrat before her understand that he had touched the limit of interference Cicely might appear to be sweet and yielding and indeed she was almost invariably more inclined to yield her own will than to struggle to attain it but there was no lack of character in her small person and when she had once determined that a course of action was expedient or right nothing had power to turn her from that course Your cousin Ellen and I will enjoy spending Christmas with you very much Sir Arthur said beating his retreat with dignity I have no doubt I can manage to be out of London for three days and I should like to see Bramwell again John and I had many talks about the alterations and improvements he carried out there Cicely had a vivid recollection of her husband s whimsical description of Sir Arthur s well meant but annoying suggestions about those same alterations and she was conscious again of a giggle choked on its way to birth but she contrived to make a suitable reply adding hastily And when you were in town in November you told me you had some business with Scotland Yard about a pendant I do hope the police have found the jewel for you Alas no It is altogether a most singular thing about that pendant I told you it was a family heirloom a magnificent emerald with three letters A V C twisted together above it Yes The police had a very strange clue the other day a clue that so far has come to nothing A pawnbroker in a back street in Chelsea came forward and stated that a pendant answering in every particular to the stolen one had been offered to him for sale a few weeks ago Then why didn t he send for the police and give the person offering it for sale into custody Cicely asked Because the police had not then notified the pawnbrokers of London of the loss In fact as far as I can make out the attempted sale must have taken place at almost identically the same time when I came to London to make enquiries about the pendant The pawnbroker himself it seems did not see the pendant Two of his assistants were in charge of the shop when a young woman came in and asked them what they would give her for it They seem to have suspected her from the first for she was obviously very poor and not at all the sort of person likely to be possessed of such a magnificent ornament They made her an offer and apparently she took flight and left the shop in a violent hurry She evidently saw and understood their suspicions of her but unfortunately they lost sight of her in the fog and all trace of her is completely gone I think I remember you suspected a young woman of the theft Does the description of the young person who went to the pawnbroker answer to the woman who was alone in the railway carriage with Cousin Ellen s dressing bag The pawnbroker s assistants can only give a confused account of a shabbily dressed girl who seemed badly in need of money Their descriptions are far from explicit According to our maid the young woman in the railway carriage was neatly dressed and very respectable in appearance but the two people might very easily be identical Very easily Cicely answered but it is unfortunate that the pawnbroker s assistants let the girl go By now I suppose the pendant may be broken up and the stones untraceable Only too likely Sir Arthur answered and yet I cannot help still hoping to recover the thing intact I cannot bear to think that a jewel my mother so greatly valued one which indeed has become an heirloom should be irretrievably lost Not irretrievably I hope Cicely answered as she rose to go Perhaps when you come to us at Bramwell you will be able to bring us good news of the missing jewel and she added with some hesitation and about your brother in law too Again she wished that she could in the least recollect what the scandal had been Possibly she might never even have heard it for John her chivalrous and tender husband had kept from her ears everything that could vex or soil them and if she had ever heard the story it had long since been buried in oblivion At her words Sir Arthur s face clouded All there will never be any good news about that wretched man The best news about him the only news I can honestly say I wish to hear would be that he was safely in his grave My sister poor silly woman is infatuated about him still I believe She was always a fool where he was concerned always a fool Sir Arthur s tones were irascible you never saw her of course I never saw either of your sisters Cicely answered gently they I think they had been married and had gone right away long before I knew any of you You see it is only six years since I married John Only six years And it is more than twenty years since both my sisters left the old home Both left it under a cloud both insisted on marrying men of whom my father and mother did not approve Ah it was a sad business altogether a sad business They both belonged to the order of women who go on caring for a man whatever follies or sins he may commit I confess I cannot understand the attitude of mind of such women No I daresay not Cicely answered her eyes thoughtfully fixed on his severe face I expect you feel that love and respect must always go hand in hand and that when a man has once lost a woman s respect he ought to lose her love as well Certainly I think so When respect goes everything had better go I have no patience with the sentimental clinging to a man who has forfeited all right to affection I suppose Cicely paused into her eyes there came a queer little gleam which neither of her companions could understand I suppose when a woman takes a man for better or worse the worse may mean evil doing and perhaps it is possible for her to hate the sin and yet to love the sinner Sir Arthur looked a trifle taken aback but he disliked being worsted in an argument and he would not ever own that he could be worsted by a woman Hence he begged the question Well well he said airily there is often a great deal of sentimental nonsense talked about love and I can answer for it my dear Cicely that my poor sisters paid very dearly for their sentimentality One vanished completely from our ken went down into the depths of poverty and obscurity and we could never hear of her again The other I have seen and remonstrated with times without number but all in vain and now she has got that miserable husband of hers in hiding somewhere and I am bent on finding them both and preventing worse scandals if I can I hope you will do as you wish Cicely was shaking hands now with little Lady Congreve who had taken no part in the conversation beyond giving occasional utterance to a faint ejaculation or a timid laugh I hope we shall all have a very happy Christmas together at Bramwell I will let you know about trains Till then au revoir CHAPTER XVI MY MOTHER GAVE IT TO ME Baba would like her doctor man to come to her Christmas tree Baba does love her doctor man At the sound of the pleading voice the sight of the appealing blue eyes Cicely put down her pen with a laugh and caught the child in her arms You most absurd and beguiling infant why do you want your doctor man as you call him Cos Baba does She loves him awful drefful much and to give her mother some glimmering idea of the depth of her affection Baba clasped her hands round her own small person and looked into Cicely s face with another appealing glance Christina do you imagine doctor Fergusson could be induced to come over here for Christmas Cicely questioned as Baba s nurse came into the cosy boudoir at Bramwell Castle this picanniny of mine wants him invited to her Christmas tree I should think it would depend on how busy he is just now The practice seemed to be a big one But perhaps at this time people will be considerate enough not to fall ill and will give the doctor a little rest Surely doctor Fergusson could motor over It can t be very far from here to Graystone Quite within a motor drive and he was so very good to Baba I should like to ask him to come if he will Rupert writes that as he feared he cannot be with us He has had to start off post haste to Naples That tiresome boy Jack Layton a mutual cousin of Rupert s and mine has gone and got typhoid there and of course Rupert being a sort of unattached universal fairy godfather has been sent for to look after him Is mister Mernside a fairy godfather Christina smiled at the quaint nomenclature I always think so He is ready to do any thing for any of his aggravating relations at any moment and as Jack has selected this particular moment to get typhoid Rupert will be away for Christmas I wonder whether doctor Fergusson would think it very odd and unconventional if I invited him here on our rather short acquaintance Cicely looked thoughtfully across her pretty room at Christina and the girl laughed and shook her head He is not so silly she answered doctor Fergusson is just one of those simple straightforward men who take things as they are meant and don t hunt round for ulterior motives He won t even begin to think whether your invitation is conventional or unconventional he will only think how good it is of you to ask him at all How wise you are Lady Cicely exclaimed where does that little dark head of yours get all its wisdom Christina laughed again In those days of her happy life with Baba and Baba s mother her bright young laugh rang out very often the laugh that seemed such a true index to her young bright soul She had put behind her all the misery and hardship of the past and with the wholesome philosophy natural to her lived in the full enjoyment of her present content and the few weeks of happiness good food and freedom from anxiety had changed the white faced hollow eyed girl who had perforce tried to pawn her mother s jewel into a charming and very pretty semblance of her former self I am not wise she said only I have had a good many rough times and I have learnt to do what one of my landladies called sizing up men and women I have had to size people up and try to get a just estimate of them And you have sized up doctor Fergusson I have found out that he is the very soul of simplicity and straightforwardness and that he is so kind that there is nothing he would not do for his fellow creatures she answered eagerly and as for worrying about the conventional I am sure it never enters his head to do such a thing It flashed across Cicely s mind to wonder whether Christina s praise of the doctor rose from any warmer feeling than that of friendly gratitude but the girl s eyes met hers so frankly her manner was so simple and the very outspokenness of her enthusiasm seemed to point to such a heart whole condition that the brief thought was dismissed I wish I could accept your most tempting invitation Fergusson wrote in reply to Cicely s letter but alas Christmas does not promise much diminution of the work here If however you will allow me to come to you for Miss Baba s tree on the afternoon of the twenty fourth I could manage to do that in my car It will give me great pleasure to see my small patient again As she folded up the letter Cicely felt that it would also give her pleasure to see the kindly faced doctor whose personality during Baba s illness had impressed her as being so helpful who in some dim and unexplained way made her think of the husband for whose loss her heart had never ceased to ache I am afraid I am very glad Cousin Arthur and Cousin Ellen cannot arrive before eight o clock dinner on Christmas Eve she said to Christina after receiving Fergusson s letter they mean so well poor dears but they are such sadly wet blankets Cousin Arthur would certainly send our spirits down to zero by telling us that the more we enjoyed ourselves the more wrath to come was being stored up for us You know he says he never sees any beautiful scenery without remembering that it will all be burnt some day How delicious I am afraid I am looking forward to seeing Sir Arthur he is at least original He won t approve of you or Baba or of anything any of us do Cicely answered his attitude of mind is disapproving He has got the kind of mind that always gets out of bed on the wrong side Perhaps at the back of her own mind her little ladyship was not sorry that Sir Arthur and Fergusson should have no opportunity of meeting for as her natural astuteness told her if Sir Arthur looked with disapproving eyes upon Rupert with how much more disapproval would he regard a stranger who was also a doctor Sir Arthur belonged to the old school of county magnates who looked upon men of medicine as on a level very little higher than a butcher or baker and entirely refused to entertain the notion that doctor and gentleman could ever be synonymous terms And Cicely was well aware that the old gentleman s disapproval might conceivably find voice and that she would be reproached for receiving such guests in poor dear John s house Fortunately for everyone s peace of mind the Congreves being unable to leave London until late on Christmas Eve were also unable to play the part of kill joys at Baba s Christmas tree and the little party which assembled in the big hall of the Castle was composed of congenial and friendly folk who were ready to become little children again to play with a little child The hall oak panelled and hung with suits of armour and weapons handed down from war like Redesdale ancestors had long since been converted into a luxurious lounge where if comfortably upholstered chairs big palms masses of flowers and tables strewn with the latest books were incongruities the incongruity at least made the hall a most pleasant and sociable sitting room And so Fergusson thought it when from the sharpness of the grey winter day he passed through an outer vestibule into the well warmed well lighted place Only he himself knew with what an unaccountable sinking of the heart he had driven up the beech avenue leading to the Castle and realised what an imposing place it was to which he had been bidden Involuntarily and in sharp contrast the thought of his own modest house rose before his mental vision and the usually cheery doctor for perhaps the first time in his disciplined and philosophical existence felt disposed to curse the Fates for dividing rich and poor by gulfs of such appalling dimensions But that sinking of the heart and all the other unwonted sentiments stirred in him by the sight of the great pile of Bramwell its stately park and lordly surroundings were swept away by the cordial greeting bestowed upon him by the little lady of the house and by Baba s enthusiastic welcome Baba s doctor man the child cried with a small shriek of delight when he appeared and Baba monopolised her doctor man during the whole two hours he was able to spend with them But if to the larger number of the party assembled in the hall Fergusson seemed to have neither eyes nor ears for anyone but the child queen of the occasion Christina s observant eyes told her that his glance often rested upon Cicely s fair head and that whenever it did so a great tenderness crept into that glance As she had told Lady Cicely the rough school in which her life had lately been spent had taught her to study and understand her fellow beings and the doctor s secret unknown to himself was shared by Christina on that happy Christmas Eve She was a very safe and discreet guardian of secrets this girl with the sweet eyes but she gave a quick little sigh when she understood the meaning of Fergusson s glance for to her as to himself there seemed an unbridgeable gulf between the hard working doctor and the dainty chatelaine of Bramwell Castle Before he left Fergusson contrived to make his way to Christina s side and to say in an undertone I think you will be sorry to know that your beautiful lady of the lonely valley is in great trouble Oh Christina exclaimed softly her eyes darkening has the end come for him Yes five days ago She is wonderful but the heart break in her eyes is pitiful to see I sometimes doubt whether her strength will hold out she is very fragile and all the strain has told on her more than I like Was he buried at Christina was beginning when Fergusson finished the sentence quickly No not at Graystone I don t know where she took him but it was away from that part of the country altogether She and her faithful Elizabeth went with him and now she is back in that lonely house again I have tried to persuade her to leave it to go to London to go anywhere away but she answers me she is happier there and I cannot oppose her But it is all a tragedy an inexplicable tragedy He could say no more but what he had told Christina filled the girl s heart with sadness her beautiful lady had made a profound impression upon her and the thought of the sorrowful woman in that lonely house in the valley hurt the girl s tender soul I am glad we asked doctor Fergusson Cicely said to her when later on in the evening the two were alone together in Baba s day nursery there is something so cheering about him something she added with a wistful look into Christina s face that makes me think of my husband Is he like mister Redesdale Christina asked sympathetically No not in the least it is not that At least his eyes are brown and my husband had brown eyes but it is not exactly a likeness that can be defined feature for feature It is something subtly indefinable but when I see doctor Fergusson and when he talks to me it makes me think of John It makes me almost feel as if John were here again You are to come down to dinner to night and you are to wear the new frock Lady Cicely s tones were very decided her blue eyes shone her face was dimpling with smiles Oh but indeed I don t think I ought how can I It it wouldn t be suitable would it for Baba s nurse to dine downstairs Will you let Baba s mother decide what is best for the nurse to do Cicely answered laughing and patting Christina on the shoulder you are just to do what I tell you and I tell you you must come down to dinner to night and wear the new frock I don t know how to thank you for that Christina said with girlish eagerness I haven t ever had a frock like it in all my life You see when my father and mother were alive we never went to parties so I didn t have evening gowns And since I have been working for myself of course I haven t needed any but this one you have given me is much much too lovely Perhaps I am the best judge of that too I want you to look suitably dressed when you come downstairs and you must look your very best to night to disarm Cousin Arthur I am afraid already he doesn t approve of me Christina said ruefully he looked at me with such severe eyes after church this morning and began at once to ask me about my theories of education And I haven t got any A ripple of laughter broke from her I had to say so and he seemed so shocked But he is very easily shocked take heart of grace and remember that And dear old Miss Doubleday thinks you are managing Baba splendidly She is a competent judge because she had the managing of me Then I don t think there was anything wrong with her system of education Christina said quickly with a glance of shy admiration at her employer who had sunk into the nursery rocking chair and was swinging her daintily shod feet up and down before the fire if Baba grows up like her mother she need not wish for anything better I like kind old Miss Doubleday she is so friendly to me Miss Doubleday Cicely s old governess was spending Christmas at Bramwell and had shown appreciation of Christina and her ways You nice little enthusiast Cicely looked affectionately up at the girl who stood on the hearth beside her you idealise everybody don t you Christina I don t know about idealising Christina spoke thoughtfully but when I care about people I do see all the best in them And are blind to all the worst Yes I understand Cicely laughed if you liked Cousin Arthur you would even see him through rose coloured spectacles He is a very good man Christina answered sturdily there is something about that uncompromising puritan spirit that appeals to me His views may be narrow They certainly are Cicely murmured sotto voce but they are all on the side of loftiness and right I wish I could make out why there is something familiar to me about his face and manner I am sure I have never seen him before and yet I seem to have associations of some sort with him He looks so sad and worried too and that very look on his face is vaguely familiar Christina spoke thoughtfully her brows drawn together There has been some trouble about a brother in law Cicely answered I know I ought to have the story at my fingers ends but I can t remember one single detail of it and I don t like to tell Cousin Arthur so Nor do I like to ask any questions He and Cousin Ellen both look so much gloomier and more upset than they were in town I have been wondering whether any fresh developments have occurred However it isn t any real business of mine and we will try to give the poor dears a happy time here I must go and dress and you are to do as I told you put on your new frock and come down to the drawing room Janet is quite able to manage Baba for one evening Christina s fingers shook with eagerness as she drew from its tissue wrappings Lady Cicely s Christmas present to her the simple yet charming gown which to her girlish eyes seemed the acme of all that was most lovely Poor little girl she had never seen herself in a dress cut low at the neck before and though this gown was only cut in the most modest of squares her own reflection in the glass told her that the rounded lines of her throat and neck were enhanced by the delicate lace that trimmed the soft silk of the gown and that the dress itself in its severely simple lines suited admirably the slimness of her graceful young form Her eyes shone like stars there was a colour in her cheeks and she had piled her dusky hair into a loose and becoming knot on the top of her small well shaped head I do really believe I look very nearly pretty she said naively nodding to herself in the mirror I wish but she did not put her wish into words only as the colour deepened on her face and she turned away from the sight of her own confusion she found herself thinking that it was a pity mister Jack Layton had chosen this inopportune moment to fall ill with typhoid and that mister Mernside had not been able to make one of the house party this evening At sight of Christina Baba who was being prepared for bed by Janet danced about the nursery in her pink dressing gown clapping her hands and chanting in a shrill monotone Oh Baba s pretty lady Baba s pretty lady oh until her nurse caught the small soft creature in her arms cuddling her closely and covering her laughing rosy face with kisses But you is Baba s pretty lady to night the child said solemnly stroking Christina s neck and face with her dimpled hands I like you in a white frock and when the pink colour runs up your cheeks Put something round your neck she went on imperiously Mummy s got lots of sparkle things to put round her neck and you must have something sparkle on your pretty white neck Something sparkle on your pretty white neck Why should she not just for this once wear the only piece of jewellery she possessed As it was Christmas Day and everything was more than usually festive surely she might put on the lovely pendant her mother had given her Christina stood still in the middle of the nursery cogitating upon the momentous question whilst Baba danced round her holding the pink dressing gown well above her pink slippered feet and shaking her golden curls whilst she chanted again Oh Baba s pretty lady Baba s pretty lady oh Even though I am a nurse I am a lady too Christina reflected and Lady Cicely has given me this beautiful frock so that I may look my best downstairs and my pendant would be right with the white gown I think it wouldn t be wrong to wear it Her thought was quickly translated into action Going back to the night nursery she extracted from the bottom of her modest trunk the box in which she kept her treasure and drawing out the pendant on its slender chain held it up to catch the rays of light from the hanging lamp over the chest of drawers The great emerald shone brightly like some vividly green star Christina thought and the brilliants with which it was set sparkled and scintillated in the light It does look nice the girl whispered complacently as she clasped the chain and saw the exquisite jewel resting against the whiteness of her neck and I wonder what those twisted letters A V C mean Mother s first name was Mary her second name was Helen and not anything beginning with A or V and of course I don t know what was her surname I wonder why the initials are A V C But her speculations were of short duration and soon forgotten in the excitement of going downstairs to join the rest of the party in the hall after receiving Baba s bear like good night hug and parting words of admiration I am going to have such a very happy evening Christina said to herself as she went along the corridor and stood for a moment at the top of the wide staircase looking down into the hall below I didn t think I was ever in my life going to have such a happy time as Lady Cicely lets me have and to night will be lovely just lovely And how beautiful the hall looks Her face was bright with eagerness her eyes shining with excitement as she ran down the stairs quite unaware of what a charming picture she made against the background of dark oak in her simple white gown with her crown of dusky hair and the shining happiness of her eyes She was right in designating the hall as beautiful Lighted by myriads of candles the old walls reflected the bright armour and the leaping flames of the huge fire that burnt on the hearth the carpets and rugs were all of rich soft hues that harmonised with the black oak and the shining armour and pots of bright azaleas of roses and of tall lilies filled the place with colour and fragrance Christina drew a long breath of delight and the momentary shyness that had swept over her when the little group by the fireplace turned to watch her descend the stairs was dissipated when Lady Cicely put out a hand and said kindly Come close to the blaze dear and enjoy it Is that monkey of mine safely in bed She is on her way there but I left her dancing round the nursery singing improvised songs about my clothes and Her sentence was cut short by a sharp exclamation from Sir Arthur who as she came near the fire at Cicely s invitation cast a keenly enquiring glance at her taking in each detail of her person from the crown of her hair to the tip of the shoe just showing beneath her white gown And when that inquisitorial glance fell upon the jewel resting on her neck that sharp exclamation broke from him How did you come by that pendant he questioned the words jerked out with an abruptness totally lacking in courtesy Did it not strike you as rather rash to flaunt it here in my very face Illustration How did you come by that pendant he questioned To flaunt it here Christina said shakily her hand going instinctively to her treasure I don t understand Come come my dear young lady Sir Arthur answered curtly waving Cicely aside when she made an attempt to intervene You cannot you really cannot pretend to misunderstand my very simple question I asked you where did you get that pendant Christina s eyes wide with fright and bewildered with the shock of being questioned so brusquely and severely looked from Sir Arthur to Lady Cicely as though appealing for help and Cicely said quietly Cousin Arthur what does all this mean It means he said grimly that your child s nurse her lady nurse is wearing the pendant for which the police and I have been searching in vain It means No oh no Cicely broke in I can t believe what you are implying It couldn t be true Christina tell Sir Arthur he is making a mistake Tell him where your pendant comes from From my mother the girl faltered still too taken aback by the unexpected onslaught to be able to think clearly This pendant belonged to her she gave it to me and I Tut tut Sir Arthur interrupted irritably it is futile to try and throw dust in our eyes in this way That pendant is unmistakable quite unmistakable no one who had once seen it could be under any delusion about it It is unique an heirloom in our family The very letters above the emerald are initials of an ancestress of mine Christina stood there silently whilst the above words were hurled at her but her face grew paler and paler fear deepened in her eyes My mother gave it to me she said again when as Sir Arthur ended there was an expectant pause as though some explanation was demanded from her she gave it to me when she died it was hers Then you can of course tell us for what names the letters stand Sir Arthur said slowly a tinge of contempt in his voice and because of that note of contempt Cicely moved nearer to the shrinking girl whose frightened bewildered expression moved the little lady s heart to pity for her and indignation against the angry old man Cousin Arthur she said impulsively it is not fair to judge Christina before she has explained about the pendant Everybody in this land is innocent until he is proved guilty that is surely only the bare law and Cicely laughed a little nervously looking round for support to Miss Doubleday her kindly old governess who also moved by pity for the accused girl had drawn nearer to Christina I wish to do nothing unfair was Sir Arthur s chilly rejoinder if as Miss Moore tells us that pendant belonged to her mother she will be able to tell us too what the initials signify I don t know Christina faltered I have often wondered I Perhaps one of them is the initial of your mother s maiden name Miss Doubleday said gently anxious to do everything in her power to help the now trembling girl I don t know my mother s maiden name Christina was beginning when a short laugh broke from Sir Arthur You do not know your mother s maiden name he said slowly come come surely you cannot expect us to believe that I don t know whether you will believe it or not Christina answered with a sudden flash of defiance it is true And I don t know what the initials are but my mother gave me the pendant I am telling you the simple truth I cannot say more Perhaps you will tell us you never tried to sell or pawn that piece of jewellery at a pawnbroker s shop in Chelsea a few weeks ago Sir Arthur asked next his glance taking in the look of consternation that flashed over her face the new shrinking terror in her eyes Ah you cannot deny that fact No oh no Christina put out her hands as if to ward off an actual blow I did try to pawn it I was so dreadfully poor but the man frightened me I came away from the shop then Exactly they frightened you because they showed you plainly that they suspected you of having come by the pendant dishonestly You ran away from the shop The dreadful truth of every word spoken the dreadful difficulty nay so it seemed to Christina the impossibility of refuting the accusation levelled against her made her feel helpless tongue tied like some creature caught in a trap from which there was no way of escape She had no means none at all of proving her own story Her mother who had given her the jewel was dead She had never shown it to anyone she had never had occasion to show it to anybody as far as she knew there was not a living soul in the world who could come forward to declare that the pendant was hers Even missus Donaldson her late employer could not have vouched for her truth and honesty in this respect for missus Donaldson had not known that she possessed the beautiful thing she had only been her mother s acquaintance not even an intimate friend But surely the practical Miss Doubleday here intervened surely if Miss Moore were guilty of stealing the pendant she would not wear it here under your very eyes Sir Arthur It is not likely I understood Miss Moore to say she was ignorant of the meaning of the initials above the pendant the old gentleman answered coldly presumably therefore she is not aware that C stands for Congreve There is no reason to suppose that she knew from whose bag she was taking the pendant when she took it But I did not take it Christina cried indeed indeed I did not It is my own my very own all I have told you is true Sir Arthur ignored her words turning gravely to his cousin My dear Cicely I am very sorry to be unintentionally the cause of so much unpleasantness for you but I am afraid that in the interests of justice I shall be obliged to make this the subject of police investigation CHAPTER XVII WHO DO YOU MEAN BY SIR ARTHUR Boxing Day had dawned bright and sunny but before the afternoon rain began to fall and a rising wind was sweeping over the moor when between three and four o clock Denis Fergusson drove along the upland road A case of pneumonia in a desolate hamlet had suddenly taken a grave turn and as he sped across the open stretch of country his thoughts were concentrated on his patient and on the gravity of her condition Having threshed out in his mind all the possibilities with regard to this anxious charge he allowed his thoughts to drift back to his afternoon at Bramwell Castle two days before to Baba s winsome ways to the sweetness of Baba s mother to his own dream idyll the dreaming of which had he was convinced been such an absurdity and yet and yet the dream had seemed so wonderful People may scoff at the bare idea of love at first sight he mused as the car passed on its rapid way in the gathering twilight but sometimes it happens even to the most prosaic of us And out of the grey mists that crept over the brown expanse of heather and bracken he seemed to see Cicely s face smiling that fascinating smile of hers which was so childlike so appealing so sweet And her eyes are like the speedwell in the June hedges his thoughts ran on such a heavenly blue and when she looks up into your face and her eyes look at you with the wistfulness of a lovely child s eyes you want to take her in your arms and kiss her and kiss her By Jove my good fellow you are a fool he broke in upon his own inward colloquy an abject fool The little lady of the speedwell eyes is as far above you as the stars in heaven and you know it A struggling South London doctor might quite as well aspire to the planet Venus as to the lady of Bramwell Castle The less such ideas are encouraged the better Resolutely thrusting from him the thoughts that had obtruded themselves unbidden he drove rapidly on whilst the grey mists deepened upon the country side the rain that had begun in a fine drizzle began to come down in torrents and the wind rose gradually to the fury of a hurricane Across the open stretch of heathland the gale broke with terrific force the rain lashed Fergusson s face and ran in swift streams down his mackintoshed shoulders and arms and it was with a little sigh of relief that he turned out of the main road and into the lane at whose bottom stood the lonely house Here there was a certain amount of shelter from the high hedges and overshadowing trees though the great gusts of wind shook the trees until they creaked and groaned and bent beneath the blast and even in the depths of the desolate valley itself Fergusson found himself nearly lifted from his feet by the hurricane when he alighted at the green gate in the wall Elizabeth appeared quickly in answer to his ring and her grave face made him say sharply She is not worse She seems less like herself to night the servant answered a little catch in her voice she doesn t always know where she is or who is talking to her I think she has got to the end She can bear no more The expression used struck the doctor strangely I think she has got to the end The same feeling had been in his own mind when last he had visited the beautiful lonely lady it had seemed to him too as though she had come to the end of her powers of endurance as though having borne lash after lash from fortune she could bear no more When he entered her room he found her lying very still her face scarcely less white than the pillow against which it rested her great eyes fixed on the leaping flames of the fire her hands folded on the sheet in a way which he had noticed was peculiar to her the fingers of her right hand close clasped about the plain gold ring that rested on the third finger of her left Whatever the poor chap who has gone to his account was or did this woman loved him with an amazing love Fergusson thought as he had thought a hundred times before whilst he spoke gently to his patient seating himself beside her and observing her closely though he talked of everything and anything excepting her health Do you know she said presently her voice very low and dreamy I think I have come to the end This repetition of Elizabeth s words and of his own thoughts startled Fergusson but he did not betray his surprise only answering gently You are worn out now You have had a long strain and you were not quite fit to stand it She smiled up at him an infinitely pathetic smile It is not only that I don t want to be morbid I don t mean to be morbid But something seems to have snapped inside me some vitality some power has gone and I have come to the end You feel that now because of the shock and strain and because at the best of times you are not strong By and by Ah but I don t think there will be any by and by she interrupted quietly and I am not sorry Life has brought so much more pain than joy that I am not either sorry or afraid Only I wish I could have done more for my world before I went out of it she added half whimsically half sadly a little smile breaking over her face Perhaps what you have been has had even more influence over your world than what you have done Fergusson said quietly it is not always the most apparently active people who have the greatest effect on their fellows She smiled at him again but she did not continue the conversation allowing it to drift away to other topics until Fergusson having given her his orders and promised to send her a new medicine on the morrow took his departure What a baffling mystery the woman is he reflected as he walked across the garden to the door in the wall I am not more curious than the average man but I confess she has aroused my curiosity What has her life been And why has she At this point in his meditations he opened the door and was on the point of passing out into the road when he became aware of a figure leaning against the wall close to the door itself The last remnants of daylight had almost died away the rain was falling in pitiless torrents and Fergusson peering through the twilight gloom recognised with horror the face of Christina Moore looking terribly white and exhausted in the dimness Her crouching position seemed to indicate that she was tired out and when Fergusson went quickly to her side and put a hand on her shoulder she shrank back and shivered from head to foot lifting such frightened eyes to his that he peered this way and that thinking she must be fleeing from some dastardly pursuer But excepting for the moaning of the wind in the trees and the swishing of the rain no sound broke the silence and save the girl herself there was no sign of any other human being in the lane What has happened he asked speaking very quietly to calm her overmastering excitement come into the house out of the rain and tell me what is the matter Why you are wet through he added sharply as he put his hand through the girl s arm and drew her up the flagged path to the front door Yes I m wet through she answered in slow mechanical tones I I believe it has rained ever since I left the station The station Have you walked from the station They were standing in the hall now and by the light of a hanging lamp in its centre Fergusson could see that the wet was running from Christina s garments and dropping in small pools on the floor and that the look of exhaustion was deepening on her face Yes I walked she said I hadn t much money I was afraid I shouldn t have enough for the cab They might have called me a thief again and I am not a thief indeed indeed I am not Her eyes met his once more with so strange and dazed a look that he began to wonder whether some great shock had unhinged her brain but he only said more quietly than before I am quite sure you are not a thief I will call Elizabeth and she will take care of you Does missus Stanforth expect you Oh no no Christina spoke breathlessly only I was so frightened I didn t know what to do when they said I was a thief for I can t prove that I am not I can t prove anything I have only my bare word Everybody who could help me is dead Feeling more and more mystified by every word she spoke Fergusson rang the bell and when Elizabeth promptly answered his summons and stared in mute surprise at the dripping figure standing under the lamp he said tersely Miss Moore has arrived unexpectedly and she is very wet Will you put her to bed with hot bottles and give her something hot to drink Don t let her talk to night I will come round and see her in the morning Perhaps Elizabeth in the long years of her service with Margaret had learnt to accustom herself to surprises and she expressed no astonishment now but a look of compassion for the drenched and exhausted girl crossed her kindly face and with a comprehending nod to the doctor she took Christina s hand and led her upstairs the girl going with her as unresistingly as a little child might have done Worn out utterly worn out and frightened to death Fergusson commented inwardly now what can have happened to bring her here in this condition and to make her say such extraordinary things about not being a thief I must tell missus Stanforth what liberties I have taken with her house and come back as early as I can to morrow He ran lightly upstairs again to his patient s room and told her of Christina s unlooked for arrival finding to his relief that she was in no wise startled or upset by what she heard Poor little girl was her soft comment we will take great care of her Elizabeth loves having a young thing to mother we will do our best for her and perhaps in the morning she will be able to explain herself It is difficult to imagine what can have happened she seemed to be so happy in her work It is impossible to suppose that Lady Cicely can have been unkind to her Fergusson answered thoughtfully she could not be unkind to a living soul However speculation is a fruitless task we must wait till Miss Moore can tell us her own story I did not dare question her to night she was already completely overwrought And it was still a very wan and white Christina who was taken the next morning into Margaret s room by Elizabeth and Margaret s observant eyes saw at once that all the girl s nerves were on the stretch that she was in a condition of acute tension The wish to help this young thing in her hour of need the sudden necessity for stretching out a succouring hand to another human being acted as a trumpet call to Margaret s own strong character and she looked more herself this morning than she had done for many weeks You poor child she said to Christina a motherly tenderness in her accents have you slept properly and are you rested I woke rather often the girl answered with a nervous glance about her I kept on starting up and fancying they had come with the police Why should anyone come with the police Margaret asked gently tell me what has happened why are you afraid Surely Lady Cicely cannot have treated you unfairly or unkindly No o Christina faltered I think she believed in me but Sir Arthur Sir Arthur Margaret interrupted a sudden sharp note in her voice who do you mean by Sir Arthur Sir Arthur Congreve He is Lady Cicely s cousin her husband s cousin Margaret s white face flushed brightly but she did not speak It was he who accused me of being a thief and I was so frightened so dreadfully frightened that I ran away Ran away Oh my dear try to collect yourself and tell me quietly all about everything Why did Sir Arthur make such an accusation against you He saw a piece of jewellery I was wearing and he said it had belonged to his wife that Lady Congreve had been robbed and that I had robbed her He was sure of it quite quite sure and I had nothing but my bare word to give him I could prove nothing But I can t understand Why should Sir Arthur imagine you would wish to steal El I mean his wife s jewel Had she lost it at Bramwell Castle No she lost it some weeks ago in a train A young woman took it from her bag and they are sure I was the young woman You see when I came to Lady Cicely I only had references from people who were dead or much too far off to be got at like the solicitor who is I don t know where in Africa She took me on trust and there isn t anybody here who can say I am honest not anybody Christina s words ended in a little wail she put her head down upon the coverlet and Margaret s hands softly caressed her dusky hair But why did you run away she asked Surely it would have been better to face the difficulty They may think your running away is a sign of guilt I know the girl answered lifting her head and looking into Margaret s face with despairing eyes I thought of that so often as I was coming along in the train but I was afraid to go back I am afraid to try to face it out because you see I can prove nothing When did Sir Arthur make this accusation Yesterday I think it was yesterday Christina frowned with the effort of memory It was on Christmas evening yes that was yesterday And when Sir Arthur said he would send for the police I ran out of the hall and up to my room I think I was almost mad I tore off my frock my pretty frock that Lady Cicely had given me and when there came a knock at the door and I heard Lady Cicely s voice I would not let her in at first And then I opened the door and she came in and begged me to tell just the whole truth And I said I had told the truth I couldn t make it any different And she was so sad her eyes looked all hurt and she said she couldn t doubt me and yet Sir Arthur was determined to send for the police And then she said she would send up my dinner to the nursery It was Christmas Day you know the girl went on a wistful look in her eyes and I had been looking forward so very much to Christmas in a happy homely home like Bramwell Castle and my new frock was so sweet and then to think of having to eat my Christmas dinner alone in the nursery accused of being a thief a little sob caught her breath But I didn t eat the dinner at all she went on hurriedly After Lady Cicely had gone down again I thought and thought about the police coming until I couldn t bear it any more So I just put on my serge frock and my thick coat and hat and whilst dinner was going on in the dining room I slipped away and out of the house I felt like a wild thing mad with terror my only wish was to get right away as fast as I could I was afraid I was so afraid And I did not know where to go or what to do and when the thought of you came into my head I knew I must come straight to you But my dear Margaret s gentle voice broke in you say all this happened last night Where did you sleep How could you get away from Bramwell Castle on Christmas night I walked to one of the nearest stations not the one they generally use but another Hansley where no one knew me by sight and there was no train till early in the morning So I just stayed in the waiting room all night They let me though it wasn t really allowed but they let me do it because there was nowhere else for me to stay and in the morning I came away again and because it was Boxing Day the trains were very bad and very slow and I did not get to Merlands Station till ever so late and then I walked here Walked here From Merlands But my dear it must be seven miles It seemed like a hundred Christina answered wearily I didn t know how to get myself along at last and it blew and rained and I thought I should die on the road Only I wanted to get to you Margaret s caressing hand again stroked the girl s dark hair You poor little thing she said I am glad you came to me but I am sorry you came away at all It will make things so much worse for you But you will keep me here Christina pleaded a look of panic terror in her eyes You won t make me go back to Bramwell You won t let me be given up to the police We must talk it all over with doctor Fergusson was the gentle rejoinder I don t feel that I am quite strong enough to decide what is best for you to do but doctor Fergusson will know He has such a sound judgment and he judges rightly as well as soundly It was cowardly of me to run away the girl exclaimed clasping her hands together with a curiously childish gesture but I felt so alone so frightened and I had no proof that what I said was true I have no proofs now I can t even make it clear to you that I am not telling a pack of lies Can t you Margaret smiled I don t think I want proofs of your truthfulness you carry truth in your face All the same for your own sake and for the sake of justice I am sorry you can produce no proofs of your statement I can t do anything but give my word the girl said despairingly Mother gave me the jewel just before she died It was a great treasure of hers she valued it immensely I think she meant to tell me something more when she gave it me only the sentence she began was never finished The two last words she spoke the very last were Tell Arthur and then she died Tell Arthur The same startled look which the mention of that name had before brought into Margaret s eyes flashed into them again Who was Arthur I don t know I never knew anything about my mother s people I do not even know her maiden name And that sounds so improbable that it made my story about the jewel seem more than ever ridiculous when I told it at Bramwell Castle What a strange complication Margaret s dark eyes fixed themselves thoughtfully on Christina s face I wonder why your mother kept you in ignorance of her maiden name and of her family Have you any idea what made her so reticent No until lately it never struck me how odd and unusual it is that I should not know these things I never mixed with other girls We lived a very isolated life my father and mother and I and I accepted everything in it without question But now I realise that it was not ordinary and normal And I often wonder about it But I shall never know what it all meant They are dead my father and mother and the clergyman who knew us in Devonshire is dead and as I told you the solicitor went to Africa and I don t know where he is But these people with whom you lived the Donaldsons Surely they must know something of your history Oh no they would know nothing I only knew missus Donaldson at all because she was staying in the village near our home and mother was kind to her children when they were ill She was in no way an intimate friend of ours And the people the very few people we knew in the village were only acquaintances There is nobody in the whole world who could vouch for my innocence It is a curious predicament We can only ask doctor Fergusson s advice and act upon it I wish I could understand why there is something so oddly familiar about your face and voice Her own low voice was puzzled I believe I have asked you this before but are you sure quite sure we never met until you saw me here Quite sure Christina answered emphatically I couldn t have forgotten you But I think I must be very like somebody for last night she shivered just as I crossed the hall of the Castle I saw Lady Congreve give a big start and she said to Lady Cicely quite loud I couldn t help hearing her My dear Cicely who is she like I think I must have a double somewhere I think you must Margaret replied slowly It is very curious But to go back to the more vital matter of the moment Did you bring away the jewel which has caused all this trouble Why yes Christina answered simply It was on my neck when Sir Arthur saw it and I never took it off I can show it to you now Slipping her hand inside her frock the girl unfastened the slender gold chain drew out the pendant and handed it to the woman in the bed You see she said it is very beautiful and very unique that wonderful emerald with the twisted letters above it the letters Yes I see Margaret s voice was low and hoarse and Christina roused from her absorption in her own thoughts of the jewel and of all that had happened started when she saw the expression on the other s face I see Margaret repeated the emerald with brilliants round it and above it the twisted letters A V C But how comes it that your mother possessed this pendant with the letters A V C What does it mean My dear child what does it mean CHAPTER XVIII YOU ARE MY OWN SISTER S CHILD She has totally disappeared and of course her disappearance makes Cousin Arthur more sure than ever that she is guilty and oh Rupert it is just a horrid tangle and I wish you had come home sooner So do I Rupert standing by the fireplace in Cicely s boudoir in Bramwell Castle looked kindly down at his cousin but it is really a piece of good luck that I am here now I expected to have to spend some weeks in Naples but it turned out that young Jack had given us all a causeless scare He hadn t got typhoid only rather a good spurious imitation of it and he is doing perfectly well So having wiped off an old score with him I came away Wiped off an old score Cicely looked mystified Yes young ass He played a low down practical joke upon me a few weeks ago and I am glad to say he was convalescent enough to be able to receive the piece of my mind which I offered him before I left Naples Rupert laughed rather grimly then said quickly However Layton and his practical joke are immaterial now Tell me about Miss Moore You say Sir Arthur accuses her of stealing It sounds a preposterous notion My dear Rupert Cousin Arthur is nothing if not preposterous and the worst of it is that this time he has some sort of method in his madness It seems perfectly obvious that Christina was wearing a pendant that had belonged to Cousin Ellen and they accuse her of having stolen it Cicely next proceeded to tell in full the story of the accusation and its results and Rupert listened in silence until she had finished Then he said slowly But no girl in her senses would flaunt a stolen thing in the faces of the people from whom she stole it Common sense might have told Sir Arthur that elementary fact He doesn t know the meaning of common sense Cicely exclaimed He made up his mind Christina was the young woman who was in the train and stole the pendant from Cousin Ellen s bag and you might as well try to shake Mont Blanc down as alter Cousin Arthur s fixed convictions He frightened Christina out of her wits with threats of the police and she ran away Pity she did that Rupert said tersely She would have been wiser to face it out and I can t believe she can be guilty It is impossible to connect guilt with her As he spoke he saw a mental picture of a low fire lit room a girlish face uplifted to his in the dancing light of the flames sweet eyes full of sympathy a mouth just curved into a smile that made him think vaguely of the way his mother had smiled at him though the girl herself was such a bit of a thing and so young I can t think of her as guilty he repeated Of course you can t Cicely said impatiently I should as soon believe I was a thief myself as believe Christina to be one Don t imagine I doubt her I never doubted her for a moment Only I wish she hadn t gone away and I wish I knew where she had gone Rupert s face grew grave Has she any friends or relations to whom she would be likely to go I am afraid not You know she was rather a waif and stray when I first engaged her as Baba s nurse You were doubtful then about my wisdom in taking her with practically no references But she has been invaluable with Baba and I have learnt to care for her too She is such a dear soul A restful soul Rupert said dreamily and as Cicely stared at him in surprise a little look of embarrassment crossed his face I saw her at Graystone when I went to call upon Baba he said trying to speak lightly because of the surprise in Cicely s glance she seemed to be just the sort of restful cheery nurse you would want for a child Yes Cicely answered wondering why Rupert s first dreamy words a restful soul seemed to have no connection with the latter part of his sentence She suits Baba admirably The poor baby is utterly woebegone without her Baba calls Christina her pretty lady and she has been crying her small heart out over her loss Miss Moore went away on Christmas night you say Yes two nights ago She took nothing with her in the way of luggage She must have walked to the station She went to Hansley We have discovered that much and she sat all night in the waiting room because there was no train till the early morning Then you know to what place she booked Rupert questioned She booked to Torne Junction beyond there we cannot trace her Cousin Arthur ramped all yesterday and talked a great deal of bombastic nonsense To day to my great relief he and Cousin Ellen departed But he still threatens the police I am only hoping he may let the police question lapse for a day or two he is very busy hunting down a derelict brother in law My dear Cicely what do you mean a derelict brother in law I know nothing about the poor thing Cicely spread out her hands and laughed Cousin Arthur takes it for granted that I have his family history at my finger ends and I can t remember that John ever told me whether Cousin Arthur ever had a brother in law But the dear old man throws out mysterious hints about the derelict who has evidently done something terrible and he sighs and groans over his poor sister the derelict s wife but I don t know what has happened to either the sister or her husband Meanwhile Meanwhile we have no right to let a young girl like Miss Moore lose herself or get into difficulties if we can possibly prevent it Rupert said Her running away was an undoubted blunder but it is our business to find her and try to set things straight The difficulty is to know where to begin to look for her Scotland Yard suggests itself as the place to which in common sense one should apply for help I don t want publicity and fuss if it can be avoided Cicely said doubtfully Cousin Arthur s rigid sense of justice makes him declare with unwavering obstinacy that it is a case for the police the whole police and nothing but the police But being an ordinary silly fluffy little woman I have the ordinary woman s horror of the law You are so entirely typical of the silly fluffy woman Rupert said drily but looking at his cousin with affectionate laughing eyes However without bringing the majesty of the law to bear upon the theft or rather supposed theft for I don t myself believe in it there is no reason why Scotland Yard should not help us to find Miss Moore Perhaps I can induce Sir Arthur to hold his hand for the present about the accusation against her He must be amenable to The sentence was broken off short as the door opened and a footman entered and handed a telegram to his mistress For Cousin Arthur she said glancing from the orange coloured envelope to Rupert I wonder whether I had better just open it or have it re telegraphed straight on to him Open it I should think Rupert answered carelessly it may be some trivial matter which you can answer and acting upon his words Cicely drew out the pink paper from its orange cover and read the lines written upon it read them slowly and with a puzzled frown that changed suddenly to an expression of delight What an extraordinary coincidence You need not wait James I will send the answer down to the telegraph boy in a few minutes Look at this Rupert she went on as the footman left the room Isn t it extraordinary that this telegram should have come in the very middle of our conversation Rupert took the flimsy paper from her hand and as he read the words his cousin saw an extraordinary change flash over his face a dusky colour mounted to his forehead a strange brightness leapt to his eyes and having read the words to himself he read them aloud Come here at once Wire to post office Graystone and any train shall be met Christina Moore with me Have made important discovery MARGARET STANFORTH At last he murmured under his breath as with curious deliberation he folded up the telegram and handed it back to Cicely At last I have found her The low spoken words reached Cicely s ears and she stared at her cousin s transformed face saying almost involuntarily But Rupert I can t understand Are you really so pleased to have found Christina Rupert looked at her with a sudden confusion in his glance Did I speak my thoughts aloud he said look here Cicely I am afraid I was not thinking of Miss Moore at that moment though I am glad very glad to hear she is safe And she is in such good hands too he added softly the light in his eyes making Cicely realise all at once that there was a Rupert she had never known besides the Rupert who had always been so steadfast a rock upon which to lean It isn t fair to have said so much and not to say more he added quickly This lady who telegraphs Margaret Stanforth is a friend of mine a most noble and dear friend I had lost sight of her and I am glad to know where she is Although the words were bald to the point of coldness Cicely saw that the usually self controlled man was deeply stirred by an emotion that almost overmastered him and she tactfully refrained from directly answering his words saying only I am very glad Christina is in such good hands I must telegraph this message on to Cousin Arthur at once It is evidently most important Evidently Rupert replied absently but he roused himself to re write the telegram for Cicely and only when it had been despatched did he turn to her and say I wonder whether it would be wrong of me to take advantage of the information this telegram has given me whether I might go to Graystone too But you see there is no actual address on the message Cicely answered her quicker woman s wit having discovered the omission Graystone post office is mentioned but it is obvious that for some reason the lady s own address has been left out I don t feel that I can give any advice when I know none of the circumstances but it seems like taking an unfair advantage to to act on this telegram which you are not supposed to have seen at all And some fools in this world declare a woman has no sense of honour Rupert exclaimed with a short laugh You can give me points about honour that s certain Of course you are right he laughed again a rueful rather bitter little laugh I can t go and hunt her out on the strength of a telegram I was never meant to see But my God it is hard to keep away He turned from Cicely and putting his arms upon the mantelpiece leant his head upon them for a moment only for a moment then he straightened himself and said quietly After all I have got to forget this telegram ignore it and make myself feel that things are as they were I am so sorry Rupert Cicely said gently answering the look on his face rather than his actual speech Is there nothing anybody can do for you You dear and kind little person he answered No there is nothing missus Stanforth is my friend the best friend man ever had and if just now she finds it best that there should be silence between us I am ready to accept her decision Only silence is the very devil he ended with again a rueful laugh That telegram to Sir Arthur Congreve would have been despatched on the previous day but for Margaret s sudden and startling collapse during her conversation with Christina The girl s mention of the pendant which she asserted had been given her by her mother and the sight of the pendant itself had produced in the elder woman a terrible excitement which had ended in her sinking back amongst her pillows in a dead faint The words she had spoken before she became unconscious had seemed to Christina like the incoherent ramblings of a delirious person and in the alarm caused by Margaret s unconsciousness she had set them aside and to all intents and purposes forgotten them Indeed so little importance had she attached to them that when doctor Fergusson came to see his patient Christina only accounted for Margaret s sudden collapse by the long and interesting conversation in which they had been engaged and she added in accents of self reproach I think I ought not to have come here at all and certainly I ought not to have shown her how upset and frightened I was Your coming and even the telling of your story ought not to be enough to account for missus Stanforth s collapsing in this way the doctor answered a puzzled look in his eyes She is such a singularly sane well balanced woman that one feels there must have been something quite unusual to account for her fainting so suddenly As far as you know she had no shock No none Christina replied I mean I know of no shock I was just sitting by her bed telling her about Sir Arthur and his accusation and she was very much interested and asked if I had the pendant with me And directly she saw it she got quite white and she said something I could not understand about the initials over the emerald and then all at once she dropped back and was unconscious in a few seconds Fergusson looked keenly at the speaker missus Stanforth had never seen this pendant before No never it was Christina s turn to look puzzled I had never seen her until the day she came out to the gate to ask me to fetch a doctor To all intents and purposes she and I are strangers It seems rather incomprehensible like a good many things connected with this house Fergusson said under his breath He and Christina stood in what was evidently the drawing room of the house a long low room furnished with the rather heavy and uninteresting furniture of the early Victorian period the light coloured chintzes on the chairs and sofas and the pale grey of the walls giving the only relief to the dinginess of the apartment I am not more inquisitive than the rest of mankind Fergusson went on his eyes glancing round the room into which he had never before penetrated but I confess this establishment and its mistress do arouse my curiosity However her affairs are no affair of ours he wound up briskly and my business now is to make her he broke off abruptly and looked keenly at Christina a great sadness in his eyes No I can t say make her well there is no hope of that but I ve got to make her better Do you mean Christina asked do you mean that she can t get really well Fergusson shook his head She is worn out something has worn her out whether a long strain or a great sorrow I cannot say But she has no more resisting power she has come to the end of it all And she is too ill now to be able to right herself again It seems so dreadful Christina whispered So much in life seems so dreadful he answered kindly but when some day we learn the reason for all that made things so impossible to understand we shall know that the pattern has been worked out exactly right by Hands far more skilful than ours We can see only such a little bit of the pattern now By and by we shall see the whole missus Stanforth is asking for the young lady Elizabeth s voice sounded from the door She seems more like herself now and she wants the young lady to come to her at once The doctor and Christina moved quickly away together to the bedroom where Margaret lay with her face towards the door her dark eyes full of wistful eagerness Christina thought she had never seen anyone who looked so fragile so ethereal it seemed to the girl as though a breath might have power to blow her away Yet her voice was curiously strong and the eagerness in her eyes was apparent too in her voice It was stupid of me to faint she said putting out her hands to the girl I expect I am not very strong and all that suddenly flashed upon me when you showed me the pendant came as a great shock When I showed you the pendant Christina repeated and there was unfeigned surprise in her glance But did you know had you seen Yes I think I know all about the pendant came the slow reply though I am not sure that I have actually seen it before I think I know all about it I believe I can clear up the mystery that has puzzled Arthur Sir Arthur and I hope I can prove to him that you are not a thief But how strange Christina faltered whilst doctor Fergusson standing at the end of the bed looked intently at his patient wondering whether by any possibility she could be wandering and deciding that her eyes and manner were too sane and quiet to allow such a possibility to be considered Not really strange a smile illuminated the beautiful face in the bed in real life these coincidences happen oftener than people think and I only wonder I was so foolish as not to see the truth before What truth Christina asked feeling more than ever puzzled Why my dear that you and I have a real tie to one another I think no I am almost sure that you are my own sister s child Oh It was the only word that Christina could utter for a long long moment then she exclaimed under her breath But how could such a wonderful thing be true Why do you think it is possible Could I really really belong to you Oh She spoke breathlessly her colour coming and going her eyes bright and Margaret smiled again I believe you could really belong to me she said and it was that beautiful pendant of yours which gave me the clue which made me realise why I had so constantly felt as if I must have known you before I am sure your mother was my dear elder sister and there is so much in you like her little ways of looking and speaking little gestures oh I don t know why I did not see long ago that you must be Helen s daughter Mother s name was Helen the girl said and she often talked to me about her lovely sister but she always spoke of her as Peg That name makes me remember myself as very young indeed Margaret answered tremulously her eyes suddenly misty with tears When I was just a wild girl with my hair all down my back Helen called me Peg And Arthur always thought a nickname rather infra dig Arthur Christina said quickly Yes Arthur my brother Arthur Ah I forgot You do not understand the wheels within wheels of all this strange discovery Sir Arthur Congreve is my brother and Your brother Christina s tone rang with amazement and the doctor started My brother and if my surmises are correct which I am sure they are he is your uncle How funny Christina said a little twinkle in her eyes and he very nearly handed his own niece over to the police if it is all really true Only it seems like some sort of wonderful fairy tale that couldn t possibly be true How do you account for the pendant which according to Sir Arthur belongs to his wife Lady Congreve being in Miss Moore s possession Fergusson here put in I do not doubt Miss Moore for an instant not for a single instant but why was Sir Arthur so sure she was wearing his wife s jewel Because the pendant Miss Moore wears is an exact replica of the one belonging to Lady Congreve Margaret answered composedly but I do not suppose either Arthur or his wife have the least idea that the pendant was ever copied Copied Christina echoed Yes The pendant belonging to Arthur s wife is an heirloom in our family passing always to the wife of the eldest son But Helen your mother dear I am quite sure she was your mother was the eldest of we three Helen first next Arthur and then me I was the baby And because Helen was her firstborn and I think her favourite child our mother had the family pendant copied for her after she went away The initials are the initials of an ancestor of ours to whom the pendant belonged A V C Amabel Veronica Congreve But my mother never saw her own mother or any of her people after she first left them Christina said They were angry with her for marrying my father She never saw them again No she never saw them again Both she and I married against their wishes and after I left my old home I never went back to it any more But I think our mother s heart must have yearned over Helen for she had that pendant copied just as I said and she sent it to Helen She told me so herself I did not leave home till three years later than Helen Then your mother and missus Moore corresponded doctor Fergusson asked No not quite that My father was terribly angry at Helen s marriage as he was afterwards about mine But Helen wrote to my mother when her baby was born and it was then that the pendant was copied and sent No one but I knew that my mother had had it done my father was a very stern man He would have been terribly angry with my mother if he had known of this and she told no one but me Arthur never knew The whole thing seems to be growing clearer and clearer Fergusson said slowly and you will be able to make it plain to Sir Arthur A shiver ran through Margaret s frame It means that I must see Arthur she said and for the first time since she had begun speaking her voice shook I must see him and tell him all the story of the pendant all the real necessity for hiding is over she added under her breath it is only cowardice to avoid Arthur now There is one thing that puzzles me the doctor left his post at the foot of the bed and coming to his patient s side laid a finger on her wrist I do not want you to worry yourself now with any more thoughts and questionings Only answer me this one thing If you knew your sister s married name why did you never connect Miss Moore with her I did not know her real name was the reply she married a singer She met him in town I was a young girl at home in the country and I never saw him In the singing world he was known as Signor Donaldo and we only knew of him by that name My father s name was Donald Christina exclaimed And I knew that once he had sung but before I can remember anything he had lost his voice he played the organ in the village church and he taught music too and singing as well But he was never called anything but Moore I never knew him by any other name Mother has often told me he could not bear to remember the time when he had a beautiful voice and I think he must have dropped his singing name when he lost his voice And he and Helen were happy The words seemed to break involuntarily from Margaret s lips I think father and mother never stopped being lovers Christina answered simply They were just the whole world to one another just the whole whole world CHAPTER XIX PER INCERTAS CERTA AMOR Sir Arthur glanced round the bleak little wayside station with disapproval The December day was grey and raw the December wind blustered along the exposed platform in chilling tempestuous gusts and the upland country that stretched to right and left of the line wore a highly uninviting aspect Now what is Margaret doing in this desolate part of the world he reflected irritably and why does she send me such a ridiculously mysterious telegram Women have no sense of proportion they must always indulge in subtleties and mysteries These irascible meditations brought him to the station exit before which stood a closed brougham the only conveyance of any sort within sight Beyond the tiny station a white road wound away over the moors but excepting for two cottages on the brow of the first hill there was no sign to be seen of any human habitation Has that carriage been sent to meet Sir Arthur Congreve the old gentleman enquired of the one porter lounging by the gate and the man nodded before replying with bucolic slowness That carriage be come from t White Horse up to Graystone to fetch Sir Arthur Congreve Driver he told me so hisself Very well very well Sir Arthur said impatiently making his way to the carriage door and opening it before the porter now engaged in thoughtfully scratching his head had collected his wits sufficiently to perform this act of courtesy for the traveller I conclude you know where I am to be driven he added speaking to the man on the box Yes sir to the house in the valley the house where the gentleman That will do as long as you know where you are to go Sir Arthur said cutting short the coachman s volubility and entering the brougham glad to sit back amongst the cushions and shut the window against the sweeping blast The uplands looked their very greyest and worst on that December day A low grey sky stooped to meet the hill sides on which brown heather and brown bracken made a depressing tone of colour to mingle with the greyness of the clouds and of the mists that crept up from the valleys The bareness of the wide stretch of moor was broken here and there by a clump of fir trees which showed dark and sombre against the grey background and the fogginess of the atmosphere obscured the great view which was usually the chief charm of the uplands Sir Arthur was at no time an admirer of scenery and to day he turned his gaze shudderingly from the barren landscape and drawing a paper from his pocket proceeded to bury himself in its contents and to thrust the outer world as far as possible away from his consciousness By nature an unimaginative man he had ruthlessly stamped out any germ of imagination or poetry which might have been latent within him setting himself with grim resolution to thrust away the beautiful as a snare and to regard everything about him as merely temporal and destructible He forgot or perhaps he deliberately chose not to recognise that the eternal is set around the temporal not as a thing apart but encompassing it permeating it so that temporal and eternal are one He had sternly set his face against all the softer aspects of life doing his duty grimly and with stiff back disinclined at any time to any relaxation in discipline either for himself or his fellow sinners more ready to rule by fear than by love a man who would have made an equally excellent Ironside or Grand Inquisitor according to the peculiar turn of his religious convictions As he drove now along the lonely white road his thoughts chiefly centred themselves upon Margaret his beautiful sister Margaret who in spite of her sins and follies as he considered them to be had always held a place in her brother s heart He gave her the place grudgingly he would have gone to the stake rather than confess that her beauty made or ever had made any appeal to him And yet as he was driven quickly onwards under the lowering skies it was his sister s beautiful face that rose persistently before him her face as he had last seen it when she was a radiant girl in the glory of her happy girlhood It was odd it was even annoying to him that just this particular vision out of the past should fill his mind now but for once in his grim and well disciplined life he was unable to drive away the haunting vision The garden of the old house made the setting of the picture the garden that was now his own and the sunk lawn with the sun dial amongst the rose trees that had been his father s pride Margaret had stood beside the sun dial on that far off June day her fingers lightly tracing the motto that ran round the dial s face her laughing eyes lifted to her brother Ah but you don t believe in the motto you see The words came echoing back to him across the years until he almost felt as though he could actually hear the low voice again and Margaret s voice had always had such unspeakable charm You think a motto like this just silly and sentimental don t you Arthur And once more her fingers had traced the faint lettering whilst she slowly read the words aloud Per incertas certa amor Through uncertainty certain is love I mean that to be my motto as well as the motto of the sun dial just a tiny ring of defiance seemed to creep into her voice with the last words Sir Arthur remembered it even now and he had answered her gravely out of the depths of his convictions He had spoken with solemnity of duty as higher than love and she had laughed again her deep soft laugh though the look in her eyes had belied her laughter Love is the greatest thing in the world she had said very slowly very quietly but the words rang with the sureness of a great certainty Love is the only thing that matters in all the world because to love properly is to be perfect Duty right goodness they all follow upon love real love Love is the greatest thing in the world Through all uncertainty love is sure Well she had acted up to her creed She had loved and suffered for a man who was not worthy to touch the hem of her garment in his Sir Arthur s opinion but women as he had before reflected women had no sense of proportion they were incomprehensible Margaret no less incomprehensible than all the rest of her sex He had reached this point in his reflections when he observed that the carriage was no longer bowling along the smooth high road but had turned into a steep and rather rough lane which wound downwards between high hedges that presently merged themselves into dense woods ending abruptly at last in a small clearing upon which stood a house surrounded by a wall Before the green gate in this wall the carriage stopped Sir Arthur s keen eyes noted with approval the quietly respectful manner of the old servant who admitted him he had been more than half expecting to find himself in some kind of dread and unwonted Bohemia the very thought of which sickened his soul and Elizabeth with that air of the old fashioned maid who has only lived in the right sort of house impressed him favourably My mistress wished me to take you straight to her room sir she said and the doctor asked me to say that any great agitation would be very bad for her Is she ill then The question came with sharpness Yes sir very ill The doctor is anxious to keep her as quiet as possible but he thought it best she should see you her heart is so set upon it Those words made Sir Arthur s own heart contract a little and before his mental vision there flashed again the beautiful radiant face of the girl in the white gown the girl who had stood beside the sun dial saying in her deep sweet voice Love is the greatest thing in the world The words still rang in his brain as Elizabeth ushered him into a big bedroom and his eyes fell upon the woman propped up with pillows her face turned towards the door The radiant face of the girl beside the sun dial seemed to fade slowly from his mind whilst he stood silently looking at the woman in the bed the woman who put out her hand to him with a faint smile and said softly It was good of you to come Arthur You will let us meet now as friends after all these years The words were a question rather than an assertion but he did not answer the question He stood as though rooted to the floor staring at her in an astonishment too great at first for words Then he said slowly But I shouldn t have known you I shouldn t have known you Margaret I can t believe He broke off abruptly a tremor in his voice and Margaret said gently I daresay I am very much changed since you last saw me In those days I was only a girl now I am a woman who has known so much of life so very much of life It seems as though my irresponsible girlhood belongs to another existence and life has set its marks upon my face Yes he answered vaguely still staring at her I am afraid your life There has been very much sorrow and very much joy she interrupted as gently as she had spoken before and now I am within sight of the end and I am glad He came close to her and for the first time touched her hand Why do you say that he asked his usually grim voice curiously softened You are ill now but I hope with care in time She interrupted him again a smile on her face No it is not a question of care or time I am glad it is not It is only a question of how long my strength will hold out You know Max is dead She said the words as simply as though she were merely saying that somebody had gone into the next room and her brother started Dead he exclaimed No I did not know I heard he was in England heard it vaguely and undecidedly and I have been trying to find you both I wanted to prevent any any talk any scandal There need never be any talk now He came to England only a few weeks before he died He had been wandering about Europe and then he came to England to die She spoke quietly but the pauses in her sentence seemed to show what a mental strain she was enduring Marion helped him to get here I was too ill to do it and I did not dare to do too much lest through me any clue to his whereabouts should be given I do not think he was ever safe not safe for a single instant But he is out of their reach now safe at last Sir Arthur s mouth set tightly there was a gleam of indignation in his eyes but he remembered the doctor s orders and refrained from uttering the biting speech upon his lips Marion who is Marion he said She was English maid to Max s mother a faithful soul such a faithful soul All our letters to one another passed through her hands She took this house she brought Max here she sent for me and then the long strain told She had borne so much she could bear no more It was all very dreadful she lost her reason she went suddenly mad and the doctors do not think she can ever be well again She is quite happy now quite peaceful they tell me like a little child but her mind has gone And you Margaret surely now you must regret Sir Arthur began impetuously the natural man asserting itself in spite of all the doctor s warnings But again his sister s low voice broke the thread of his speech Regret she said Oh no It hurts me to think that I hurt our father and mother but for myself I cannot be sorry I love him so and for all our lives together I had his love he was always mine But do what he would Sir Arthur felt impelled to give voice to the flood of thought within him he was not worthy of you Margaret You can t pretend that he was worthy of your love A great rush of colour poured over her white face her thin hands trembled Worthiness or unworthiness do not seem to come into it at all she answered her voice all shaken and low When one loves one loves in spite of everything in spite of everything Something in her tone and in the strange illumination of her eyes momentarily silenced Sir Arthur he dimly felt himself to be in the presence of a force infinitely greater than anything that had ever come into his own experience He would not have owned that he had limitations to a man of his type the difficulty of owning to limitations is almost insuperable but far down in the depths of his mind he vaguely realised that Margaret had reached a height to which he had never attained And after all Arthur whatever you may feel Margaret went on more quietly the colour ebbing from her face doesn t it still seem fairer to say De mortuis Sir Arthur bent his head and before his mind rose the half defaced letters of that other Latin proverb which Margaret had traced with her finger on the sun dial out amongst the roses in the sunshine of June Per incertas certa amor And she was still certain of her love in spite of everything Silence fell between them after those last words of hers and it was she who presently broke it speaking with an effort and in more ordinary and matter of fact tones But I did not telegraph to you to come here in order to worry you with any of my own affairs I thought I ought to ask you to come because a strange thing has happened a most curious coincidence Bring that chair nearer to the bed and sit down You look so judicial standing over me Sir Arthur meekly obeyed feeling within himself a faint wonder at his own unquestioning obedience yet compelled to do what that low voice commanded There was a certain queenliness about this woman a dignified aloofness which had a curiously compelling effect upon those about her The man who so obediently drew up a chair and seated himself felt it hard to realise that this was his own sister his younger sister Margaret whom in the days of their unregenerate youth some people had called Peg It had been almost impossible to see in her changed face the features of the beautiful girl who had laughed amongst the roses by the sun dial and yet in spite of the change wrought by sorrow and suffering and the ploughshares of life she was regally beautiful even more beautiful than in the days of her girlhood I understood from your telegram that you wanted to see me about Ellen s pendant though I cannot conceive why you should know anything about its whereabouts I am afraid I don t know anything about Ellen s pendant was the answer But I do know something about the pendant you mistook for Ellen s on Christmas Day The ornament Christina Moore was wearing was not Ellen s but her own Nonsense my dear Margaret Sir Arthur answered testily The jewel is unique and I know every detail of it I hope you have not brought me here to try to persuade me not to prosecute that wretched nurse of Cicely s Cicely herself is also trying to make me act against my better judgment and refrain from calling in the police I think you won t want to prosecute when you hear why I sent for you was the gentle rejoinder It was a very weighty reason that made me ask you to come Arthur Why did you telegraph to me he asked Tell me those weighty reasons A very strange coincidence has happened one of those coincidences which are more common in real life than people think I have discovered beyond all possibilities of doubt that Christina Moore is our own niece She is Helen s daughter For a long moment Sir Arthur said no single word he only looked at his sister blankly with a stare of incredulous astonishment Then he said slowly Our our niece Helen s daughter Impossible quite quite impossible My dear Margaret you have been taken in by an impostor Such an idea is incredible And what proofs have you There is no question of being deceived The discovery was not forced upon my attention I made it for myself Christina had no idea that there was any relationship between us She was taken completely by surprise when I told her she was my sister s child You have let your imagination run away with you Margaret How can you be sure of what you say Where are your proofs I don t believe for a moment that Miss Moore had any connection with Helen I don t believe it at all And as Sir Arthur s lips went into a determined line Margaret smiled faintly remembering the days of their youth when her brother had set his mouth in just such obstinate curves if he were in disagreement with any of his family Very quietly but very firmly Margaret made herself heard dominating the man by that strength of personality of which he had already become strangely aware forcing him against his own inclinations to hear her story from beginning to end At present I have as you say no proofs she said No legal proofs But those should be the least difficult to find We must get Helen s marriage certificate and Christina s birth and baptismal certificates I have been thinking it all out when I lay awake at night And we must make all necessary enquiries at Staveley the village where Christina lived with her father and mother Unfortunately the clergyman she knew there is dead and the solicitor who seems to have done Helen s business for her is in Africa and Christina does not know his address But the pendant the emerald pendant was certainly sent to Helen by our mother and before Helen died she tried to send you a message She sank into unconsciousness with your name on her lips Tell Arthur those were the very last words she spoke Sir Arthur s severe face softened some of the hardness in his eyes died away it was in a shaken and softened voice that he said It is difficult even now to believe that all this can be true and yet there is a certain ring of truth about it I should like to see this Miss Moore I cannot understand why if she was innocent of theft she ran away from Bramwell She is very young she was very frightened She knew she could produce no proof of her innocence And you must remember Arthur that I am the only person living who knows there was a replica of Ellen s pendant Christina s coming to me was providential I think she was sent into my care Sir Arthur was silent indeed he spoke no more until Christina summoned by Margaret s bell came into the room her face flushing and paling by turns when she saw the upright figure seated beside the bed I wished to see you Sir Arthur said in the magisterial tones which were wont to strike terror into the hearts of guilty offenders My sister tells me a very remarkable story and although pending much more absolute proof I suspend judgment I should like to hear your own view of this strange thing I don t know what to think about it all the girl answered a little shrinking fear in her eyes as they met those piercing blue ones I have told everything I know to to her she faltered glancing at Margaret I can only say it all over again to you It is all true I have never in all my life said anything that wasn t true she added proudly Your mother never mentioned any of her relations to you by name Never spoke of her old home She spoke of her home and always as if she had loved it dearly as if it had broken her heart to leave it But she never told me where it was she never said any name until the day she died until she gave me the and said Tell Arthur I think perhaps she could not bear to speak of her people because she loved them all so much that it hurt her to talk about them The whole matter must be carefully investigated I can accept nothing without proof but naturally if it can be proved that you are our sister s child suitable care will be taken of you And for the present he still spoke in the judicial tones to which the Bench was accustomed for the present I shall waive the matter of the pendant Meanwhile Meanwhile my own strong feeling is that Christina should go back to Bramwell Margaret put in it is not fair to put Lady Cicely to inconvenience and Christina feels with me that she had no right to run away and leave such a kind and considerate employer in the lurch If Lady Cicely would like to have her back Christina is sure she ought to go Yes indeed Christina said eagerly a little shamed look in her eyes I know I ought never to have come away but I was so frightened so dreadfully frightened and she clasped her hands together with an unconsciously childlike gesture that stirred the latent humanity in Sir Arthur Beneath his crust of frigidity there was a certain kindliness of heart and Christina s appealing eyes and suddenly clasped hands moved him to say not ungently Well well there is no occasion to be frightened now I will look into the whole of this strange business and nothing more shall be said about the pendant until I have found out whatever there is to be found I shall leave the pendant here Christina said quickly her eyes meeting those of the old man with a flash of pride that seemed to give man and girl a sudden curious likeness to one another I will fetch it now and give it to her and then you will know that I am honest that I shall not run away with it I will fetch it directly and give it to Aunt Margaret CHAPTER XX SHE HAS A SWEET STRONG SOUL There was never another man in my world but Max There never could have been another Some women are made that way They can only give their best once But I would take the second best I would be thankful even for the crumbs from the rich man s table Only let me have the right to take care of you to give you To give me everything and to receive nothing in return No Rupert I could not let you do that even if Even if he repeated after her his eyes fastened hungrily on her face his voice deep and appealing Can t you understand that I don t want to worry you for anything in return I only want to be near you to do all that man can do for you And I am grateful more grateful than I can ever express in words Sometimes I am sorry you ever chanced to meet me on that oasis in the desert I think I have been a hindrance in your life not the help I should like to have been No wait don t contradict me for a minute and Margaret held up her hand with a smile as the man on the low chair beside her couch bent forward in eager disclaimer Because of me you have never married when you ought to have had a wife and a home and children of your own Do you think I could look at another woman after I had once seen you he exclaimed vehemently and she answered gently Some day I hope you will have a woman in your life a woman who will bring you all the happiness you have missed who I want no woman but you he cried a note of sullen passion in his voice Margaret you say he was the only man in your world Can t I make you understand that you are what you have been ever since I first saw you the only woman in mine She put out her hand to him the transparent hand whose only ornament was its heavy wedding ring and he stooped down and kissed it with a curiously reverent gesture that made her eyes misty You have been such a good friend she said but believe me there cannot ever be anything but friendship between us two and there is such a little time now left for anything What do you mean he asked with a sudden catch in his breath his eyes fixed on her thin face which seemed all at once to have become so ethereal in its whiteness why do you speak as if As if an end were coming Because the end is very near His eyes did not leave her face but a look of pain leapt into them a look of such intolerable pain that Margaret exclaimed quickly I cannot bear to hurt you but it is better to tell you just the plain truth even if it hurts you The end is going to be very soon doctor Fergusson thinks it can t be far off now and I am glad Rupert I don t think I can tell you how glad He made some inarticulate sound dropping his head into his hands and her soft voice went on with soothing monotony There was a great deal of hardship and trouble in my early married life and I never managed to get over it all I have been ill almost ever since you knew me and in the last few months I have come to the end of my tether When Max went away her voice broke all that was left of my life and vitality seemed to go too I have tried to live and I wanted to live but the disease has got the better of me and I am glad the end is in sight Did you send for me because he lifted his head and looked at her I sent for you because I wanted to make everything clear to you and because I did not want to go right away for ever without seeing my friend again And I wanted to help you about your own future if I could My own future Rupert laughed drearily Do you think my own future and anything about me matters two straws when you when you his voice trailed away into silence He sat very still his face turned towards the window through which the trees in the wood beyond the house were already showing a veil of delicate green My friendship will have been a very poor thing if it spoils your life Margaret said gently her gaze following his to the April trees and the dappled April sky A poor thing He turned back to her a great light in his eyes Do you think I regret loving you Do you think I regret for a single second having known and loved you When I first met you I had the sort of contemptuous tolerance for women which I had found in other men It was you who taught me what a good woman can be to a man Even now I am not fit to touch the hem of your gown but since I knew you I have at least lived straight I can look you in the face and say that my hands and heart are clean I am glad she said simply her deep eyes shining You don t know how glad I am if I have helped you ever so little And some day I am speaking very plainly because I am a dying woman and dying people can speak the direct truth some day I want you to give a woman your heart I want you to take her hands in your hands I want you to find the happiness which for my sake you have missed in all these years Impossible he said passionately You are asking too much How could I ever think of another woman when I have been your friend Some day she answered her wonderful smile flashing over her face and I am developing into a matchmaker Rupert she added lightly I have even chosen the woman You did not credit me with gifts as a matchmaker did you Don t talk of such things in such a way he exclaimed almost roughly How can you laugh and talk lightly when When I ought to be thinking only of graves and epitaphs she quoted whimsically No don t look so hurt and sorry Let me still be whimsical even if I am going to die Leave me my sense of humour to the end And let me match make for you It pleases me to picture you happy with a wife I have chosen for you Don t he said actual anger in his voice but once again her hand touched his hand and the touch quieted him You must not be hurt or angry with me she said I asked you to come to see me because I wanted to thank you for your loyal friendship and a sort of instinct made me long to tell you of someone who some day I think will comfort you Comfort me he exclaimed bitterly Yes comfort you eyes and voice were very steady Rupert you know of course you know all about my little niece my dear little niece Christina You know by what a strange coincidence I discovered who she was and you know how Arthur found all the proofs of identity and showed beyond the possibility of doubt that she is the daughter of my own sister Helen You know all that Yes I know all that I have often seen Miss Moore she is a very charming girl and I liked her for insisting on staying with Baba for the present so that Cicely should not be left stranded It seemed to show grit and a fine character She has grit and a fine character She has more she has a most lovable character and Rupert she would make a man who cared for her a most tender and loving wife A man who cared for her Rupert repeated with emphasis not a man whose whole heart was given to another woman Some day when the other woman has gone right away remember what I said That is all It is not a thing to be discussed even between two friends Only remember that my little Christina is worthy to be loved She has a sweet and a strong soul More than once on that April afternoon Rupert tried to take Margaret s conversation back to his own deep love for her but just as her brother Arthur had found four months earlier so he found now that some dominating force in her personality kept him at bay mastered him in spite of himself It was she who finally gave him a gentle word of dismissal so gentle that he could not be hurt even though the parting from her seemed to him to tear his heart in two I may come again he said his speech sounding terse and abrupt because of his very excess of feeling and she smiled into his face a strange smile which he could not understand Yes she answered you may come again and Rupert forgive me if by being your friend I have only hurt you I have done nothing for you excepting give you pain I think she paused and her eyes turned to the soft sky behind the delicate April leaves I think I have done so little so terribly little with my life But you have been so much he answered his hand holding hers closely in a long warm clasp and it is what you are that matters and that influences your fellow beings what you are so much more than what you do And what you are lives for ever he added in a burst of inspiration very rare in the man who so seldom gave expression to his thoughts There is no end to a good influence it never dies it could not ever die What you are has helped everyone who knows and loves you But this is not good bye he said a moment later before he left the room You say I may come again this is only au revoir Au revoir then she answered that inexplicable smile breaking over her face again But she whispered under her breath as the door closed behind him it will be au revoir in a land where there will not be any more heart breaks or good byes the land that is not very far off but near so very near She had known the truth when she told Rupert he might come again knowing that her days were actually numbered that the end of which she had told him was very close at hand And so it was that when Rupert Mernside next journeyed down to the lonely house in the valley where the touch of spring lay on woodland and copse where primroses lifted starry eyes under the hazels and wind flowers swung in the April breeze he came to follow Margaret to the quiet churchyard on the hill side Christina had chosen the place where her grave should be Christina who had been with her at the end who had seen the amazing radiance of her face when the end came All night she had lain in a state of profound unconsciousness from which they had not thought she would ever rally But as morning broke as the sunlight shone in through the uncurtained window Margaret s eyes opened and that amazing radiance flashed into them the smile on her face making the girl who watched her draw a swift breath of wonder It was evident that the dying woman knew nothing of what passed in the room about her her eyes looked not at surrounding objects but at something beyond and away from them all something that was coming towards her or towards which she was going Max she said her voice grown suddenly strong Ah Max I knew you would wait for me I knew you would be there and with that wonderful radiance in her eyes that wonderful smile upon her face she had passed out into the Rest that lies about our restless world I think she would like to lie just here Christina said when walking round the churchyard with Sir Arthur and doctor Fergusson they came to a halt under a low wall from which the ground sloped abruptly away in a series of terraces In that sunny corner violets nestled against the grey stones their fragrance drifting out upon the April breeze and on the wall itself a robin sat and sang of spring time of resurrection of life She would like this place the girl repeated softly It is so still and sunny and the great view is so beautiful like herself so beautiful and restful she added under her breath so that only Fergusson heard the words Sir Arthur a more quiet and subdued Sir Arthur looked across the sloping churchyard to the great sweep of country whose horizon was bounded by far blue hills and perhaps some faint perception of Christina s meaning filtered into his narrow soul although he only said I wonder why she wished to be buried here I should have thought she would have liked to be near her husband I don t think she felt she was ever far away from him Christina answered carried out of herself for the moment and forgetting her usual awe of her grim uncle She knew that wherever their bodies might be she and he would be together She knew they could not ever be really apart he and she Sir Arthur looked at her without replying His silence was a strange testimony to Margaret s power for he was kept silent by the unaccustomed feeling a feeling experienced for the first time in his self sufficient existence that in his sister and in the new niece who looked at him with such certainty in her eyes he had come face to face with forces of which he was ignorant Perhaps he could not or would not have put this feeling into words nevertheless it was there far down in his heart a new factor to be reckoned with if ever he chose to reckon with it The day of Margaret s funeral was one of those perfect spring days which come to us sometimes as a foretaste of summer Beyond the little churchyard the wide expanse of moorland lay flooded with sunshine spikes of young bracken showing vividly green amongst the brown of the heather clumps of gorse shining golden in the sunlight a soft mist of green upon the hazel copses at the moorland s foot Larks sprang singing to the April sky and upon the stone wall close against the open grave a robin sat once more and sang his song of resurrection of life of love The group that gathered in that sunny corner fragrant with the sweetness of violets was a very small one Sir Arthur and Christina Rupert Mernside Lady Cicely doctor Fergusson and Elizabeth these were the six mourners who followed Margaret to her last resting place and as Christina s eyes wandered round the little group she felt that she knew upon which of the six the beautiful woman s death had fallen as the most heavy blow Her heart contracted when her fleeting glance rested for a second on Rupert s stricken face and she glanced away again quickly feeling that to look into his face meant also to look into his stricken soul and that she had no right to read so much of the inmost being of another human creature Cicely had insisted upon coming to Graystone for the funeral Although I never knew your sister she said to Sir Arthur I want to do this one small thing to show how much I reverenced her Christina has told me of her and I know how beautiful she was body and soul Thus it came about that Cicely sat next to Denis Fergusson in the tiny village church where the first part of the funeral service was said stood next to Fergusson beside the grave by the sunny wall and when all was over moved away down the steep churchyard path by Fergusson s side He looked down at her tiny form with a delicious sense of having a right at least in this moment to protect and watch over her and as they went out of the lych gate she turned to him with a grateful look in her eyes Thank you for taking care of me she said with that pretty impulsiveness that constituted one of her greatest charms I am glad I came to day even though it has made me remember she hesitated and Fergusson saw that her eyes swam with tears They were walking slowly along the upland road in the wake of the rest of the party and Fergusson slackened his pace a little to give her time to recover her composure whilst he said gently I understand I quite understand I think you are a very understanding person she answered the falter in her voice making his heart contract with an almost unbearable longing to comfort her I have not heard that service we have just heard since it was said over John my husband It has made me remember that day and all it meant to me Fergusson looked away from her sweet face aquiver with emotion out across the wide moorland where the larks sang in the sunshine to the far line of blue hills then he said slowly The words hold wonderful comfort The triumphant sense of a sure and certain hope always seems to me to be the keynote of the whole Those were the words that stayed in my mind penetrating through everything else she said softly and though John had gone away into what seemed unbreakable silence I knew that he had not really gone I had the sure and certain hope oh and more than hope that he was very safe and very near me all the time The naive expression the simplicity of the words spoken from the depths of a simple and sincere heart flooded Fergusson s heart again with a sense of reverent love that almost amounted to adoration but no opportunity to answer her was given him for Sir Arthur turned back to join Cicely and a few minutes further walk brought them to the inn at Graystone where they were to lunch before their drive to the railway station Rupert parted from the rest at the door of the inn Perhaps Christina was the only member of the party who realised that he had come to the end of his tether that an imperative necessity for solitude was upon him that his power of endurance was nearly at an end She was standing behind Sir Arthur when Rupert bade them all good bye it was with her that he shook hands last of all and as she looked up into his face her eyes held some strange comfort for him He did not put it into words he could not have explained even to himself had he tried to do so why it was that the glance of those sweet eyes sent a little restful feeling into his troubled heart but as he went away some of the tension of misery seemed to relax the numbness of his pain grew less in some dim way his hurt had been salved Your cousin seems to have been a most devoted friend to my poor sister Sir Arthur said after lunch when he and the two ladies and Fergusson were seated in the small sitting room of the inn awaiting their carriage I cannot conceive why in the world she could not have married a man like that instead of the poor miserable fellow who made her life and his own a burden to them both She loved her husband very much Christina put in gently Oh she loved him she loved him far too much Sir Arthur answered testily I cannot understand I never shall be able to understand how a woman can throw away all her heart and life on a man who is totally unworthy of her Back into Christina s mind flashed the remembrance of words Margaret had spoken long before You don t know what it is to care so much for a man that no matter what he is or does he is your world your whole world but it was Cicely not she who answered sagely I don t believe a man can ever really understand the way a woman loves A woman s love is made up of so many ingredients she herself can hardly analyse it and no man could ever begin to get near its true analysis Sir Arthur looked at her with the kindly smile of one who listens to the prattling of a child then resumed his own train of thought and words as if she had not spoken at all My brother in law was a perpetual source of anxiety to me he said not that I knew him I only saw him once and I was not favourably impressed on that occasion but I can honestly say that until I heard he was in his grave I had no really quiet moments I know nothing of the story Cicely said I have only heard you speak of your brother in law as if the subject was a painful one I do not even know his name He was a Russian by birth no don t go there need be no secret about the matter certainly not from you who were so good to my poor sister Sir Arthur said as Fergusson showed signs of leaving the room Max Petrovitch was his real name and my sister originally met him at the house of friends in town He was then closely connected with the Young Russia movement or rather to call things by their true names he was a red hot Nihilist Margaret went with him to Siberia you know Cicely uttered an exclamation but Sir Arthur went on without pause Yes she went to Siberia with him I don t know on what precise count he was exiled but he was always on the side of revolutionary methods as against those of law and order and although I believe I do firmly believe that he never had a hand in any scheme of assassination still he was tarred with the pitch black brush of anarchy There is no doubt that the time in Siberia sowed the seeds of Margaret s ill health it sapped her strength and vitality it was the beginning of the end Her maid Elizabeth has told me the truth about it all He was silent for a few seconds before resuming Then Max escaped and for a long time I understand Margaret knew nothing of his whereabouts but she herself by his wish left Siberia and went to Paris and there after what vicissitudes God only knows he joined her for a time But here the inherent weakness of the man appeared God forbid that I should be unfair to the dead but he was a coward and because he was afraid because he was afraid of being recaptured and sent back to Siberia he gave up the party to which he belonged he sold himself to the Secret Police And from the moment that was known he must have led a life of horror His footsteps were dogged he was tracked down from place to place he was a doomed man and he knew it Certainly he was guarded to an extent by the Secret Police but those who wanted his life cared very little for that I believe he wandered over Europe seeking a place of safety in vain and at last ill worn out and despairing he came to England to die in that lonely house in the valley where Margaret has also died Her illness sent her back to her own land she could not travel about with him but when they got him there they sent for her and she was with him to the last Poor soul oh poor soul Cicely said softly And she loved him through it all She loved him with a most amazing love Fergusson put in speaking for the first time I was there during his last illness and at his death and as I said before I say it again God grant to every man when death comes to have such a woman and such a woman s love with him at the last He spoke gravely and as his words ended he looked at Cicely and their eyes met in a long involuntary glance which as Christina caught it seemed to her full of some strange meaning that set her own heart athrob CHAPTER XXI IF YOU GO ACROSS THE SEA Such money as Margaret had she has left to you Christina and in telling you this I should like to make a final protest against your remaining in Lady Cicely s household in a subordinate and dependent position How dear of Aunt Margaret how very very dear of her to give me her money Christina said and with that money I shouldn t be dependent any more should I and she looked into Sir Arthur s grim face with a smile whose inner meaning that worthy did not feel quite able to fathom Was it merely the smile of guileless simplicity or was she in a mild way presuming to chaff him In the stricter sense of the word no you would not be dependent But that is a mere shuffling of words You would still be in a subordinate position here and the position is a false one Christina standing by the window in Cicely s great London drawing room devoutly wished that somebody would come in or that something would happen to end this interview with her uncle who never failed to have one of two disastrous effects upon her either he made her feel angry really viciously angry as she expressed it or he made her hopelessly inclined to giggle And to day I want to giggle she said to herself and if I do he will never forgive me or forget Aloud she said with a gravity she was far from feeling I don t want to be rude and contradict you Uncle Arthur but I cannot feel I am in a false position here Cicely really needs me for herself as well as for Baba this is a very happy home for me and because I still take care of Baba just as I did before I don t feel I am doing anything beneath my dignity or subordinate I wish I could make you understand the fitness of things Sir Arthur answered with a grieved air which never failed to amuse his niece Your Aunt Ellen and I would gladly offer you a home but I fear that at the bottom of your heart this Babylon this Vanity Fair makes an appeal to you I do like London was the frank response and though it is very good of you to ask me to come to your house I think I am really wanted here Cicely would miss me Baba would miss me and I like doing all I can for them Cicely has been so good to me all through Wilful woman Sir Arthur said with a shrug of the shoulders you often remind me of your poor Aunt Margaret You have her set obstinacy of character She was never able to see any other point of view but her own and you are very like her I should like to be like Aunt Margaret the girl answered and if she did like her own points of view I think they were always very beautiful views I have never met anybody like her She was a good woman Sir Arthur said smitten with sudden compunction I had no business to say a word against her she was a good woman but the thought of her wasted life hurts me Not wasted Christina said I don t think her life was wasted Her influence can t die away even now It was such a wonderful influence like herself so beautiful Yes he repeated poor Margaret She was a good woman and it hurts me to think of all the trouble of her life You are like her in many ways God grant that your life may not hold the sorrows her life held Uncle and niece were silent for a few moments after those solemnly uttered words and Christina stood looking out across the square where the trees waved delicate green leaves against a background of May sky her thoughts full of the beautiful woman who had entered so strangely into her life through whose instrumentality so vast a change had come to her From first to last Margaret s personality had made a great appeal to Christina and looking out now into the May sunshine across the fragrant window boxes of geranium and mignonette a vivid recollection came to her of that December afternoon when Margaret had stood in the lane pleading with her to fetch a doctor What apparent inconsequence had led her to drive past that lonely house in the lane and how strange had been the outcome of that inconsequent drive What big results had rested upon such a seemingly small event Her relationship to Sir Arthur and his sister Margaret would probably never have been discovered but for that meeting in the lane and no one but Margaret would ever have been able to elucidate the mystery about the emerald pendant It was strange so strange as to be like some story book happening instead of an event in real everyday life Sir Arthur s voice brought her back from her thoughts of the past I am sorry my dear Christina that you have made up your mind to stay here in the very anomalous position you now occupy But I quite see that it is useless to argue further with you If however you should at some future date see things differently your Aunt Ellen and I will still be willing to offer you a home under our roof Christina s thanks were none the less warm because in her heart of hearts she decided that no power on earth would ever induce her to make a home with her uncle and aunt But I couldn t live with them could I she said to Cicely an hour later when the two sat together in the rose coloured boudoir which at Christina s first visit to the house had aroused her deep admiration Uncle Arthur is so so very kind but But he moves along like a horse in blinkers and he cannot see anything on either side of him and not much in front He says I am like Aunt Margaret and that she only saw one point of view Christina answered demurely Then my dear it is evidently a family failing Cicely retorted but never mind what Cousin Arthur says You are to stay with me and be as happy as you can and because you are sweet enough still to look after Baba that does not lower you in anyone s eyes One argument Uncle Arthur used to try and induce me not to stay here was that you might marry again and then he said I should be stranded The colour flew into Cicely s face but she answered collectedly Why should Cousin Arthur think absurdities of that kind I He said you were very young and very attractive Christina laughed a low mischievous laugh as the colour deepened on the other s face and he would have it too that people would want to marry you for your money and position I have no intention of marrying again Cicely said firmly and if I did I hope I should have sense enough to know whether I was wanted for my stupid position or for myself There are some people Christina said the words coming from her lips almost involuntarily who would be afraid to ask you to marry them just because of your money and position I don t see why a man s silly pride should stand in the way of his love Cicely retorted but Christina shook her head sagely Ah but men do let their pride spoil their love she said and they let their pride spoil other people s lives too she added with a wisdom beyond her years A man might easily think it would be dishonourable to ask you to marry him a man who was not rich or distinguished She spoke very slowly in some odd way it seemed even to herself as though the words were put into her mouth to speak and as she uttered them she was looking so intently out of the window that she did not observe the varying expressions of emotions that flitted over Cicely s face One would not know how to beat down the sort of pride you describe she answered after a pause during which Christina s eyes fixed themselves upon a flock of pigeons wheeling about the plane trees in the square A woman is so tied so handicapped she can only possess her soul in patience and wait I don t believe I should wait again it seemed to Christina as though the words were being forced from her If I knew that only pride silly ridiculous pride was holding a man back a man who loved me and I him well I don t believe I would wait I think there s a limit to possessing one s soul in patience But Christina surely Cicely s blue eyes opened wide she looked into the girl s animated face with wondering incredulity Surely yes Christina answered with an audacious little laugh If the man cared for me and I knew it I would not let his pride spoil his life and mine If he was too proud to ask me why then I should ask him that is all With the laughing words she turned and left the room murmuring that it was time she attended to Baba s tea but after she had gone Cicely sat very still her mind haunted by the words the other had just spoken I would not let his pride spoil his life and mine If he was too proud to ask me why then I should ask him that is all But such a big all Cicely reflected her eyes like Christina s following the wheeling flight of the wood pigeons about the plane trees tops it is such an impossible thing even to contemplate doing and yet And yet Sitting there alone she reviewed the past happy years when John had been her safeguard her protector the shadow of a great rock in her life shielding her from everything that could hurt or vex her And after those years of full content had come the lean years of sorrow the blank desolation of her widowhood the loneliness the overpowering loneliness which no kindly friends nor kindred could really lessen or assuage And now new possibilities of happiness seemed to be opening before her if but again it was such a big if How could she put out her hand to snatch at what had not been offered to her what might never be offered to her but which nevertheless she knew with a woman s sure knowledge was hers I don t think it is being unfaithful to John she thought it does not make me love John less because I know that other could bring me a measure of joy again For a few moments she gave free rein to her thoughts letting them range over the past few months allowing her memory to bring back Denis Fergusson s kindly shrewd face with the brown eyes that held so much both of tenderness and humour and the mouth that could smile so cheerily and set itself into lines of such strength and steadfastness During those anxious days of Baba s illness at Graystone she had of necessity seen Fergusson constantly and perhaps it had been borne in upon her then that he too was of the nature of a great rock strong to lean upon and very steadfast and perhaps she had been drawn to him in that mysterious drawing together of one particular man to one particular woman which must always be a wonder of the universe Whenever she and Fergusson had met she had been conscious of her own power over him conscious also that something was holding him back And now as it seemed to her Christina had given her the clue to what had often sorely puzzled her Her own outlook upon life was an eminently simple one and she had never dreamed that her rank or wealth could make a bar to the friendship and the something deeper than friendship of such a man as Denis Fergusson Christina s words had given her food for thought and they had also brought her face to face with the knowledge of herself and of all that Denis was beginning to mean to her He possessed that same steadfast quality which had been one of her husband s noblest characteristics and the one perhaps that had made the chief appeal to her more yielding nature And Fergusson s cheery strength and unfailing optimism had gone far also towards drawing her to him But instinctively she had been aware of a barrier between them of something which he was rearing up against her and though the instinctive knowledge of the barrier had wounded and puzzled her it was only now with Christina s words ringing in her ears that she understood the meaning of all the puzzle The doctor was a poor man or at any rate comparatively poor whilst she had more than enough and to spare of this world s goods and a title into the bargain and because the man was proud as well as poor he had erected that barrier of which she had been confusedly conscious Well Christina straightforward Christina with her almost boyish love for all that was most natural most frank and simple had said I would not let his pride spoil his life and mine If he was too proud to ask me then I should ask him But Cicely rose from her chair and crossed the room to the window but of course any such step as that was out of the question for her impossible and out of the question She could never overcome her pride to such an extent as that never doctor Fergusson has called my lady and desired me to say that if you were disengaged he would be very glad if he could see you for a few minutes James the footman stood in the doorway and even upon James s slow intelligence it dawned that his mistress looked unusually lovely and unusually young But his dense mind did not especially connect the youth or loveliness with anything or anybody he only dimly saw and wondered whilst for the fraction of a second Cicely hesitated Should she order James to bring the doctor up to the boudoir to this dainty room in which she made a point of only receiving those who were her most intimate friends Or should she go down to the drawing room and receive him as she received acquaintances The two questions revolved in her mind and they were quickly answered I will come down to the drawing room she said scarcely knowing herself why she came to this decision coming to it more by instinct than by any power of reasoning She paused yet another moment to collect her forces then went slowly down the great staircase and opened the drawing room door without lingering on the threshold as she was more than half inclined to do Fergusson came forward quickly to greet her and she saw that though he smiled and spoke in his customary cheery manner his eyes held a troubled look and there was a worn expression on his face which she had never seen there before His manner too had a nervousness very foreign to it and he talked rapidly as though he were afraid of silence and must continue speaking at all costs I must apologise for troubling you he said and Cicely noted the formality of his speech but I felt I should like to come and ask about my little friend Baba before I go away Go away Cicely could frame no other words than those two bare ones because for a second her heart seemed to stop beating then raced on again at headlong speed Yes Fergusson still spoke fast and nervously I have come to rather a sudden decision but I feel it is a wise one I have made up my mind to go abroad to begin life in a new country The old one is over crowded we are all finding that fact out more and more and I am proposing to go to the Far West It has always appealed to me that free life in a big new country But your poor people your people in South London Cicely interrupted a sick pain gnawing at her heart surely they want you He shrugged his shoulders a little and smiled I am not indispensable to them or to anyone the last words he spoke under his breath and I believe there is plenty of work waiting for me on the other side of the world I have not made up my mind to this hurriedly but it seems the best and wisest thing to do I wonder why Cicely began slowly her blue eyes looking full into those troubled brown ones It seems she broke off leaving her sentence unfinished her eyes dropping suddenly because of what she read in those other eyes Does it seem to you a mad idea an act of impulse he asked his glance travelling hungrily over her down bent face I have not come to the decision impulsively It is the best the only thing to do The last part of the speech dropped hurriedly from his lips he drew in his breath sharply almost as if he were being tried to the limits of his strength I could not go away without coming to say good bye to you and Miss Moore and Baba he added jerkily We should have been very angry with you if you had done such a horrid thing Cicely answered lightly so lightly that a hurt look crept into the brown eyes watching her He had not dared to hope she could by any remote possibility care for him so he said to himself He had never dreamt such wildly improbable dreams but he had thought she would be a little sorry to lose a friend for ever and when he left England he intended to leave it for ever to cut adrift from all old friendships all old ties And yet she looked up at him with laughter in her eyes and talked brightly of being angry with him if he had gone without a farewell He felt oddly hurt and ruffled and Cicely as keenly aware of the hurt as she had been a moment before of the significant look in his eyes only knew that her own heart was beating with an excess of joy that frightened her only realised that the game lay in her own small hands if only she could play the game as it should be played You have not given up your house and practice yet she questioned and her tone was still brisk almost business like and there was a hurt note in his voice as he answered My house is in an agent s hands for letting and I am only going on with the work until I can find someone to take it over as soon as everything is settled here I shall be off To tell you the honest truth I shall be glad to go Cicely s heart leapt in an insane way because of the sudden ring of bitterness in his accents she moved a step nearer to him they had both remained standing since her entrance she had even uttered the words I wish when the door was flung wide open and James announced missus Deane Cicely was not quite sure whether she most wished to laugh or cry when this very ordinary little acquaintance a walking mass of platitudes propriety and dullness walked into the room Too well she knew that missus Deane once established in her drawing room would not be quickly dislodged and with an inward sigh she resigned herself to her fate whilst Fergusson held out his hand in farewell I must be getting on my way he said perhaps I might just go up to the nursery to say good bye to Miss Moore and Miss Baba Of course Cicely answered with her pretty smile Baba would bitterly resent it if her dear doctor went across the sea without saying good bye to her If you go across the sea she mentally ejaculated as the door closed behind his tall form and she settled herself down to listen to missus Deane s totally uninteresting conversation If you go across the sea CHAPTER XXII I CAME TO DAY TO TELL YOU SO If Fergusson had left the great house in the square with his spirits at zero they had travelled many degrees below that point on the following morning He sat alone in the room he used as study and general sitting room and spread on the table before him were two letters one from a house agent informing him that a possible client was in treaty for his house the other from a medical practitioner in the north of England who expressed a desire to come in person and learn all particulars about the practice Burning my boats with a vengeance Fergusson muttered looking round the room which he had learnt to love and smiling a troubled smile that had no joy behind it That glance round the room brought back to his remembrance in an odd flash of memory Christina s first visit to him when he was occupying doctor Stokes s house in the country There was real humour in his smile when he recalled the girl s look of surprise and her naive acknowledgment of the discrepancy she saw between his appearance and that of the house in which he was Looking round the study of his South London abode he wondered whether Christina would consider his present surroundings more in keeping with his personality than those in which she had first seen him Certainly there was nothing here of the smug respectability which had characterised doctor Stokes s well kept establishment No two chairs matched one another but they were all comfortable and restful the walls were distempered a soft rich yellow that gave an effect of sunlight even on the greyest days and the few pictures hanging against the sunny background were excellent photographs framed in oak and representing some of the best Old Masters of the Italian School Bookcases covered a considerable amount of the wall space books covered the tables and were even piled upon a corner of the rather faded Turkey carpet The box outside the open window was filled with wallflowers and their penetrating fragrance made the room sweet The view was not a wholly uninspiring one for a narrow strip of garden lay behind the house and glimpses of waving boughs were visible against the blue sky of May The roar of traffic from the main road a few paces away the distant hum of humanity these were sounds dear to the ears of the doctor to whom human beings made so deep an appeal he even had a weakness for the raucous street cries audible now and again above the persistent roar that was like the noise of Atlantic breakers on a rock bound coast He was sorry to be leaving the teeming London world in which he had spent so much of his busy life more sorry than anyone else could realise he reflected grimly Possibly to the rest of mankind a practice in South London might not appear the acme of bliss a practice that dealt almost exclusively with the sordid the poor even the criminal but he loved his work he loved his people it was intolerably hard to tear himself away from them all and yet the tearing was inevitable I can t stay here within measurable reach of her and of temptation and play the man his reflections ran on so so I must run away He laughed shortly as he picked up the two letters from his table and re read them feeling absurdly disinclined to reply to either He knew he must go With the unwavering directness of an upright man when making a decision he had seen what he conceived to be the right path clearly marked for him and having seen it he had no thought of drawing back from following it But with all his strength and decision of character he nevertheless felt at this juncture a deep repugnance to writing those letters which would as he expressed it to himself have the effect of burning his boats behind him He knew that good work awaited him in that far western land where he had determined to begin a new life he knew too that to remain in England within call as it were of a temptation which his sense of what was right and honourable bade him resist was merely dallying with that sense of right and yet the human man within him cried out against the necessity which he had faced and acknowledged to be inevitable Although he already actually knew the contents of those two letters by heart he read both through again then deliberately folded and set them aside with another short laugh If they are answered by to night s post it is time enough he exclaimed They shall be answered to night these few hours of delay will make no difference He was half amused half ashamed of his own cowardice as he called it in postponing the inevitable but a weight seemed to be lifted off his heart when those letters were set aside unanswered when he turned away from the writing table to go to his downstairs surgery feeling that the conflagration of those boats of his had not yet begun The busy morning of attending to the motley collection of fellow creatures who thronged to his surgery door was only half over and he was waiting in his tiny consulting room for the next patient when a tap on the door was followed by the entrance of Thompson his caretaker and general factotum Indeed Thompson and his wife constituted the entire staff of Fergusson s household being the doctor s devoted admirers as well as his faithful servants and when he had broached to them his proposed change of life they had simultaneously announced their intention of going with him to the West and sharing his fortunes in the new land and new labours Upon Thompson s face now as he entered his master s little consulting room there was an expression of mingled bewilderment and pleasure which made Fergusson look at him sharply Yes Thompson what is it he asked for it was seldom indeed that any call from the house was allowed to interfere with the surgery work There s a lady called to see you sir the man answered When she heard you was busy she wanted to call again but I didn t feel it would be right to let a lady like her go away and call again Fergusson smiled Thompson was the worthiest soul on earth but his powers of discrimination were not great and a lady like her was in all probability a suburban Miss hoping to obtain a consultation at surgery rates Where is the lady he asked In your study sir Thompson answered mild amazement in his voice I couldn t show a lady like her nowhere else could I sir Again Fergusson smiled He knew them so well those ladies who made such an appeal to Thompson s aesthetic soul the ladies of rather abnormally sized hats garments they called stylish with lace blouses out of which rose an unnecessary length of neck encircled by artificial pearls Oh he knew precisely what sort of a lady he would find in his study and the knowledge did not make him hasten his steps as he went up the staircase to the sitting room Long before opening the door he had decided to make short shrift of the lady he knew precisely how he should frame his terse speech and there was a distinctly grim look upon his usually kindly face when he entered the room But when he saw who it was that stood in the May sunlight close to the open window the grim expression died away unbounded astonishment took its place and he caught his breath suddenly standing stock still on the threshold and staring at his visitor as if she was an apparition from another world You he said and it seemed as though that single word were the only one that he could bring himself to utter You he repeated as he moved slowly across the room his eyes riveted upon Lady Cicely s face She stood very still just where she had been when he first entered the sunlight falling upon the pure gold of her hair and on the exceeding fairness of her face her eyes very blue and very deep looking up at Fergusson with a strange mixture of embarrassment and sweetness which set his heart beating fast In all the time of his acquaintance with her she had never looked younger or fairer than on this May morning Her gown of some pale grey material exactly suited the pale pure tints of her hair and complexion and the great pink rose fastened against the soft feathers of her grey boa harmonised with the delicate colour that had risen to her cheeks as Fergusson entered I promised I would come some day to see your house and your surgery she said hesitating a little between the words but speaking firmly nevertheless and I thought I would come to day What made you come to day he asked an odd abruptness that almost amounted to roughness in his voice Why to day of all days I don t know she answered I believe I acted on impulse It just came into my head that I must come this morning and you know I am rather a creature of impulse and I came straight away It is so curious you should have come to day he persisted still with that odd abruptness of voice and manner You have come in time to see my boats burnt Your boats burnt her voice was puzzled she looked into his face with less of embarrassment because in some indefinite way she felt that he was more embarrassed than she and it gave her courage Why are you burning boats Because as I told you when I came to see you I am giving up the life here giving it up altogether irrevocably for always There is to be no turning back No turning back she repeated softly her eyes watching the changing expressions on his face Why no turning back Why Because I have made up my mind to begin a new life in a new world and when I make up my mind a thing must be done I generally carry it through Ah she said You generally carry it through Yes he spoke almost harshly The boats will be burnt to day finally burnt She stood very still in the sunlight her pretty head bent down her hands slowly moving over the knob of the dainty sunshade she carried a little smile lurking about the corners of her mouth her eyes fixed on the faded colours of the Turkey carpet I think I should like to be here for the burning of the boats she said It sounds so subversive so final It is subversive it is final was the short reply and a flame of anger against her shot up within him Why did she come here to torture him What had possessed her to come and stand here in his room in the sunlight stand here amongst all his most cherished belongings just as in some of his mad dreams he had pictured she might stand looking so fair so young so sweet Why had she done it It was cruel not just to a man who was trying to follow his code of honour to its bitterest consequences So his thoughts ran whilst Cicely still stood there moving her hands over the knob of her sunshade the little smile still hovering upon her lips I wonder she said slowly after a moment s silence and Fergusson watching her intently saw that a deeper colour crept into her face I wonder whether the burning is really necessary Quite necessary His tone was abrupt to the point of rudeness I have made up my mind And you never change your mind She shot one swift glance at him from her pretty eyes lowering them again instantly whilst her hands moved more nervously and her voice shook Not when I am sure I am acting rightly he answered And in this case I have no doubts She was silent again for what seemed to the man who watched her many many minutes though only a few seconds had ticked by before she said gently I wonder why you are so very sure Because there is no room for doubt was the terse response and again there was silence until Cicely said softly I think you are wrong I believe there is great room for doubt Why do you say that he exclaimed that almost rough note in his voice again How can you tell how can you know what I He broke off with significant abruptness and Cicely moved a few steps nearer to him doctor Fergusson she said her voice very low her words hurried I don t know how to explain what makes me say that I am sure you are wrong to to burn your boats I came this morning on purpose to tell you To tell me what he questioned his own voice more gentle because of the nervousness in hers To tell you you are wrong to give up your work here and go away Wrong Why For the life of him Fergusson could not utter another syllable he could only stand and stare and stare at the bent golden head wishing desperately that she would go away before he was conquered by his overmastering desire to seize her hands in his and draw her close against his breast Quite quite wrong she answered firmly lifting her eyes again and looking into his face you mustn t go away I came this morning to tell you that you mustn t go away Baba and I can t spare you The last words were spoken so softly as to be almost inaudible but they reached Fergusson s ears and he looked at the speaker as though he could hardly believe the evidence of his senses Baba and you he repeated Baba and I she whispered Oh perhaps I ought not to have come but there seemed no other way to show you what a dreadful mistake you were going to make and Rupert says I am always a creature of impulse she ended with a little laugh I came on impulse because because I had to come She came closer to his side and laid one of her hands upon his coat sleeve her blue eyes looking into his with the wistful appealing eagerness of a child s eyes I don t know what Cousin Arthur would say if he knew she ended inconsequently But I can t quite understand even now Fergusson said with a not very successful effort to speak quietly I do not think I can be of any use to you and little Baba There are plenty of other doctors who Plenty of other doctors she answered a quiver in her voice but only one you and and are all men always so dense Please understand Baba and I ask you to stay We are very bold and brazen Baba and I She did not look up at him now She did not see the look of radiant joy that swept across his face she only felt his arms go suddenly round her she only realised what a relief it was to hide her burning cheeks against his rough coat whilst he bent his head to hers and murmured passionate inarticulate little words that would not frame themselves into sentences and yet seemed to flood her world with happiness I can t understand it he said presently putting his hand softly under her chin and lifting her face so that he could look deep into her eyes you can t mean that you would stoop to me I didn t know how to make you understand without telling you in plain English that I that you She broke off again her eyes dropping before the look in his the colour deepening in her cheeks That you and Baba want me he quoted softly Yes we don t think we can do without you Baba and I We can t let you go to the Far West or anywhere very far away from us Only Only he whispered his lips close to hers Only I didn t think I could ever be so horribly brazen as to ask a man to You haven t asked me anything he answered whimsically a smile on his lips a humorous twinkle in the eyes that looked so tenderly at her rosy face You haven t asked me anything yet Don t make me more ashamed she whispered It is dreadful to have come to have said to To have played the part of a gracious and lovely queen whose Prince Consort dares not speak until she gives him the right His voice was a caressing whisper his arm held her more closely And even now I do not know whether I have any business to accept the right you give me You and I are such poles asunder Are we she answered softly her hand touching his Are we really poles asunder just because I happen to have a little more money than you have Aren t we just a man and woman who Who he echoed gently as she paused and his face was bent very near to hers to hear her answer Who care for each other she whispered confusedly I don t think you ought to make me say all the difficult things Is it so difficult to say you care for me he answered with a low laugh of triumphant gladness I have got dozens of patients waiting downstairs for me but I don t want to do anything except go on telling you how much I care for you so much that I could not stay in England and not tell you the truth And why didn t you tell me she said reproachfully lifting her head to look again into his radiant face Because your rank and money and surroundings oh everything about you put you far out of my reach he answered with a sudden return to his old abruptness Even now I have not the smallest right to take advantage of the wonderful thing you have done to day What will your people say What will the world say What Need you and I mind what the rest of mankind thinks or says she answered a little flash of defiance in her eyes Perhaps in coming here to day I have been unwomanly and horrible and yet I had to come because I knew that happiness is too big a thing to be sacrificed to pride or to other people s opinions And this is your happiness His voice was strangely softened Do you really mean me to know that you could be happy with me with a rough sort of fellow like me With a rough sort of fellow like you she answered laughing a tender mockery in her words I can t be happy without you and I came to day to tell you so CHAPTER XXIII THE KING OF MY KINGDOM The afternoon was very still Overhead the sky of October was mistily blue the autumn sunshine flooded upland and valley with a golden glory in the air was that quietness that sense of waiting and brooding which marks an autumn day From the cottages in the valley thin trails of blue smoke mounted straight into the veiled softness of the sky The touch of autumn s hand was already visible upon the trees In the copse over the brow of the hill the hazels were yellowing the beech trees showed orange and gold amongst their leaves the hawthorns wore a brave array of crimson and yellow leaves and bright red berries Long ago the heather had faded a soft dun colour had taken the place of the royal purple which earlier in the year had carpeted the uplands and the bracken blazed golden and brown upon the moorland slopes From the place where Christina sat she could see the white road that wound away across the heather to Graystone and to those far blue hills about which the afternoon sun was weaving a veil of light In the valley to her right the trunks of the pine trees were turning crimson in the sun s level beams the birches delicate branches outlined against the blue of the sky the soft amber of the larches contrasting with the sombre green of the pines and beneath the trees the carpet of bright bracken touched to gold by the sunshine From far away across the moor came the sound of chiming bells from the copse across the road a robin sang his wonderful song of spring that will follow winter of life that will come after death and from somewhere amongst the trees of the valley a thrush was fluting the first notes of his next year s song that he had yet to learn The world was a very peaceful world on that October afternoon and Christina sitting on a hummock of dry heather rested her chin on her hands and looked over the wide landscape with a great sense of its abiding restfulness The chiming bells the robin s song the occasional soft murmur of the little breeze in the pines harmonised with the brooding peace of autumn that seemed to be over all the land and the girl smiled as she let the sense of restful peace sink deep into her soul She and Baba were spending a week with missus Nairne at Graystone and on this Sunday afternoon leaving the child in missus Nairne s charge she had walked over the hill to the little churchyard to visit Margaret s grave In that sunny corner of the churchyard close to the old grey wall she had found violets in bloom filling the air with their sweetness just as they had filled it on the April day when Margaret had been laid to rest and Christina held some of the purple fragrant blossoms in her hand whilst she sat looking out over the great sweep of country to the golden sky behind the hills Her thoughts were very full of the beautiful woman whose life had so strangely crossed her own and from her thoughts of Margaret by a natural transition her mind wandered on to the remembrance of the man who had stood by her side at Margaret s funeral She recalled the look of heartbreak in Rupert Mernside s eyes when they had met hers she remembered that glimpse she had had into the man s tortured soul How many times since that day had Cicely speculated about Rupert s friendship with Margaret wondering whether he had cared for her more deeply than as a friend discussing the why and wherefore of his disappearance from the midst of his own circle whilst all the time Christina knew in her heart that she could if she would have answered all these questions She knew that Rupert s feeling for Margaret was not merely that of friendship never had been friendship only and she knew intuitively that his usual round of life had become intolerable to him after Margaret s death She felt an odd sense of triumph in her knowledge of him of triumph and of awe as well For to Christina s simple and straightforward nature there was something awe inspiring in this strange intimate understanding of another human being s soul Seated there upon the heather she was so wrapped up in her thoughts that she did not observe a figure moving slowly across the valley and not until the figure had detached itself from amongst the trees and was walking along the high road in her direction did she see that the object of her thoughts was coming towards her That he should have come at that particular moment struck her first as so extraordinary a coincidence that she could hardly believe the evidence of her own eyes But as the figure came a few paces nearer she knew that she had made no mistake it was Rupert s face into which she looked as she sprang to her feet Rupert s grey eyes that met hers with a smile despite their expression of haunting sadness I never dreamt of seeing you here were his first unconventional words of greeting and yet it seems natural to find you Perhaps he was hardly aware himself why he spoke the last half of his sentence and although Christina s heart leapt as she heard it something within her seemed to respond to the spirit of his words To her too it seemed natural that they should meet out here on the heather in the sunlight close to Margaret s grave For the little churchyard lay only just over the brow of the hill and Rupert s explanation of his presence on the moorland was not needed by the girl who knew without any words of his that he had come to visit that corner by the sunny wall where the violets scented the air with their fragrance After that brief greeting he made Christina sit down again upon the heather and flung himself beside her his face turned like hers to the western horizon I am glad they put those words on the stone he said abruptly whose thought were they I think I thought of them first Christina answered they seemed the fittest and most beautiful words for her Love never faileth he quoted slowly his thoughts going back to the white cross upon which the words were engraved Love never faileth yes you could not have chosen a better epitaph for her Her soul was built up of love and her love never failed never for a single moment It is a wonderful thing the love of such a woman Perhaps in all the world there is nothing more wonderful than a woman s love He seemed to be speaking his thoughts aloud rather than addressing her directly and she did not answer his speech only sat very still her hands folded in her lap her eyes looking out towards the golden west a little smile on her lips You know I have been wandering over the earth since that day Rupert went on speaking with singular abruptness I felt like that man who went out seeking rest and finding none I have found none The ring of bitterness in his voice hurt the girl She turned a little and looked down into his face I am sorry she said so very sorry Are you he answered It is not worth while being sorry for a man who has made a mess of things as I have done Why do you say that she said quickly You made the most of a beautiful friendship you did Aunt Margaret no wrong in loving her You were always her helpful friend And now Now he echoed when she paused Perhaps you will think me impertinent for saying what I was going to say she answered the colour creeping into her face but I was going to say now you will not waste your life in regretting what is past and over You are not the sort of person to waste life in regrets I should think you would take all the best of the love and friendship and work them into your life to make it better The words were as simply spoken as they were simple in themselves Their very simplicity made an appeal to the man who heard them for like all the best men Rupert man of the world though he was had a very simple nature Weave the past into the future he answered thoughtfully Not sweep it away and try to forget it but let it be woven into my life Is that what you mean Yes that is what I mean only you have put it into better words I never think it is quite right to try and sweep away a past even if it has hurt us It always seems as if it must be so much better to use all that was good in the past and let it help to make the future better I don t think I believe in stamping things out and burying them and being ruthless over them Isn t it better to take the good from them and bury the rest Rupert s eyes were fixed on the girl s face which had grown eager and intent over the thoughts she was trying to express and as he watched her a smile broke up the ruggedness of his own features She was quite unconscious of his gaze but a soft colour had come into her cheeks as she spoke her eyes were very deep and bright and the man who looked at her realised that hers was more than mere girlish prettiness She had taken off her hat and the sunlight fell upon the dusky masses of her hair showing golden gleams in its dark threads Her eyes green and deep and very soft made Rupert think of a stream in Switzerland beside which he had stood only a few weeks back a stream whose waters shone in the sunbeams showing dark and green and soft in the shade The colour that had crept into the pure whiteness of her cheeks tinted them as a white rose is sometimes tinted and for the first time Rupert was aware of a faint yet definite likeness between the girl at his side and the woman he had loved Perhaps it was in her expression more than in any actual resemblance between the two women s faces that the likeness lay for something of Margaret s nobility and serenity seemed to be reflected on the younger countenance and with that flashing thought there flashed into his mind too the words Margaret had spoken to him before she died He had never remembered those words again until now and they recurred to him with extraordinary force She would make a man who cared for her a most tender and loving wife She has a sweet strong soul A sweet strong soul Those words rang in his brain with odd persistence whilst his eyes watched Christina s profile as she sat silently looking out again across the moorlands A sweet strong soul And there was such a strange restfulness too about the personality of the girl young though she was he remembered how conscious he had been of that restfulness on the day when he had sat and talked to her in missus Nairne s parlour That same restfulness stole over him now and some of the haunting misery within him died away So you don t believe in a ruthless chopping away of the past he asked going back to her last words Oh no she exclaimed vehemently I am sure we are meant to use the past as a foundation stone for the future Each thing in turn comes into our lives joy sorrow pain difficulty and they all have to help together to build it up into perfection But I have no business to be sitting here preaching sermons she added lightly I must go home and relieve missus Nairne of Baba and write to Cicely and No wait here a little longer he interrupted imperiously laying a hand on her arm as she attempted to rise I am a returned traveller and you are to tell me all the news before you go back to Baba who I am morally convinced is supremely happy with missus Nairne Supremely Christina laughed She was going to help warm the scones for tea perhaps you will come and help us eat them she added shyly Baba would be so pleased if you came to have tea with us again And you Would you be pleased Of course but she looked away from him as she spoke and the soft rose tints on her face deepened ever so slightly Baba and I were very proud of giving you tea in the little parlour last December I liked that parlour I have pleasant recollections of it he answered I liked the low ceiling and the oak panelled walls and the queer old fashioned furniture Yes I will come and have tea with you and Baba to day but first tell me all about everybody You know Cicely has married doctor Fergusson I saw it in a chance paper I have heard no details I have simply drifted over Europe where my fancy or the demon of unrest led me and I let nobody know where I was I know practically nothing Why did Cicely marry the doctor He is a thorough good fellow but There isn t any but Christina answered firmly Denis Fergusson is one of the very best men in the world and Cicely has been radiant ever since they were engaged They were only married three weeks ago and I wish you could have seen her face when she walked down the church You would not have said but then Were her people annoyed A little but only a little and only at first I think they recognised how completely the marriage was for Cicely s happiness After all Denis is a gentleman an absolute and perfect gentleman and a good man and those two things are all that matter Yes those things are all that matter It is only sheer worldliness that demands more And if Cicely is happy why let worldliness go hang Poor little Cicely certainly needed a man to take care of her and Baba and that big property but is Fergusson willing to give up his work Cicely won t hear of his giving it up The surgery in South London is to go on as usual and Cicely has insisted on having an assistant there to do the work when Denis cannot go himself so that as she expresses it she is not depriving a poor man of his living in allowing a rich man to profit by the surgery and its practice I confess to being a little surprised that Fergusson ever got himself up to the scratch of asking a rich woman to marry him Rupert said with some hesitation It doesn t seem quite like the man It wasn t in the least like the man Christina answered demurely And I m afraid I made myself into a kind of of matchmaker or god in the machine or something of that sort Rupert laughed outright It was all your doing was it he questioned looking at her with smiling kindliness Did you I don t think I can exactly tell you how I I worked the trick she laughed a little confusedly But Cicely says it wouldn t ever have happened but for me And I am glad So am I very glad Fergusson is a lucky man A man who gets a woman like Cicely to take care of him may consider a part of every day well spent if he spends it in singing a Te Deum of his own And Sir Arthur s lost pendant was it ever found Yes eventually the police traced the woman who had been in the railway carriage with Lady Congreve s bag and she confessed to having stolen the jewel After these words silence again fell between them until Christina once more made an attempt to rise I ought to go back she said when Rupert s detaining hand again fell on her arm Baba Why should you go back when I want you here was the audacious response I want you much more than Baba does The hand he had laid on her arm lingered there over the latter half of his sentence his voice had sunk almost to a whisper and the rose tints on Christina s cheeks brightened I believe I have been wanting you for quite a long time he went on deliberately his eyes watching how the colour came and went on her face his hand still resting on her arm Would you like to know how often when I was wandering about the byways of Europe I thought of that evening in missus Nairne s oak panelled parlour when I told you so many things about myself Would you like to know how often you came into my mind Christina s dark head was a little bent her eyes were fastened on a clump of bracken blazing golden in the level sun rays her voice was very low and a little shaky I shouldn t have thought you would remember me at all she said the touch of his hand upon her arm filling her with a sensation of strange gladness On that afternoon I told you I am sure I told you how restful you were Rupert continued speaking with an eagerness that gave him an oddly boyish manner something in your personality rested me then and I have never forgotten it You rest me now he added suddenly his hand slipping from her arm and folding itself over her hand I came here to day feeling as if the world were a sorry enough place and I a poor fool who had messed up my life and was at the end of my tether But when I saw you sitting here in the sunshine I felt as if some day the sunlight might come back to my life Could I bring it back Her voice still shook but she lifted her eyes bravely to look into his face and he bent nearer to her and gathered both her hands into his Little Christina he said I don t know whether it is fair even to think of asking you to spend your fresh young life in bringing sunshine back to mine but because I am a selfish brute because I want you I am going to ask you what I believe I have no right to ask you And yet it was Margaret s thought too Margaret s wish he added under his breath Aunt Margaret s wish the girl exclaimed That I that you She broke off confusedly trying instinctively to draw her hands from his but feeling his clasp tighten over them Shall I tell you what she said to me about you the very last time I saw her he asked I think she knew I was going to be very lonely and she spoke of you I have not forgotten the actual words she used they came back to me just now as I sat here beside you she said She would make a man who cared for her a most tender and loving wife She has a sweet strong soul More and more vividly the colour deepened on Christina s face and she did not answer because speech at that moment was a physical impossibility Only her hands lay passive in his grasp she no longer tried to draw them away I think Margaret knew how I should learn to need you Rupert went on his voice vibrating along the girl s nerves and sending little thrills of happiness through her whole being She understood how much you could help me if you would If I would she echoed a tremulous gladness in her voice But I am so young so ignorant not a bit worthy of of all you say she ended incoherently Could you some day learn to care for me if I tried to make you care was his answer Could you some day care for an old fellow like me who hasn t even the best of his life and love to offer you Could you do that little girl I don t call you an old fellow she said indignantly and I don t think I have got to learn to care I think I have learnt already Very gently with a sort of tender reverence he drew her into his arms and kissed her then put her away from him again and said quietly Is it fair to you I wonder is it fair to you to take all your best and give you only the second best in return But if I would rather have your second best than the best from any other man in the world she said quickly What then If it is a greater joy to me to think of being your rest and sunshine than to be anything else in the world what then She put her hands upon his shoulders pushing him a little further from her that she might look fully into his eyes I don t believe any man really ever understands a woman she added inconsequently with a laugh Where have you learnt your knowledge of mankind he questioned and what makes you say we don t understand the other half of the world Because if you did you would know that when a woman cares for a man she would rather just be a servant in his house than go altogether out of his life Perhaps we all prefer the best but a woman who cares would rather have the second best than nothing at all And are you a woman who cares he whispered drawing her back into his arms with a sudden sense of her sweetness her desirableness would you rather be You haven t asked me yet to be anything she answered with a touch of audacity that sat charmingly upon her at least you only mentioned rest and sunshine and and intangible things of that sort And if I asked you to be my wife His lips were very near to hers his voice in itself was a caress and Christina s heart beats nearly choked her If I want you for my wife little girl Her answer was quite inarticulate if indeed she answered him at all but she allowed him to kiss her lips and Rupert knew that her answer was given him with that kiss You would not let any man kiss your lips unless you loved him well enough to marry him he said after a moment s pause and Christina looked at him with happy laughing eyes I would not let any man kiss me at all unless I wanted to marry him she answered and You want to marry me Rupert interrupted with a boyishly spontaneous laugh such as she had never heard from him before Yes I want to marry you she said demurely drawing herself away from him again and looking mischievously into his face and do you know this isn t the first time I I have thought of marrying you What do you mean Rupert s mystified expression brought a dimpling
