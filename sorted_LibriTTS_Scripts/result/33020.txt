came into fashion with this form of top boots in seventeen ninety nine and was called a Jean de Bry Notice the commencement of the whisker fashion INTRODUCTION The world if we choose to see it so is a complicated picture of people dressing and undressing The history of the world is composed of the chat of a little band of tailors seated cross legged on their boards they gossip across the centuries feeling as they should very busy and important Someone made the coat of many colours for Joseph another cut into material for Elijah s mantle Baldwin from his stall on the site of the great battle has only to stretch his neck round to nod to the tailor who made the toga for Julius Caesar has only to lean forward to smile to Pasquino the wittiest of tailors John Pepys the tailor gossips with his neighbour who cut that jackanapes coat with silver buttons so proudly worn by Samuel Pepys his son mister Schweitzer who cut Beau Brummell s coat talks to mister Meyer who shaped his pantaloons Our world is full of the sound of scissors the clipping of which with the gossiping tongues drown the grander voices of history As you will see I have devoted myself entirely to civil costume that is the clothes a man or a woman would wear from choice and not by reason of an appointment to some ecclesiastical post or to a military calling or to the Bar or the Bench Such clothes are but symbols of their trades and professions and have been dealt with by persons who specialize in those professions I have taken the date of the Conquest as my starting point and from that date a very simple period of clothes I have followed the changes of the garments reign by reign fold by fold button by button until we arrive quite smoothly at Beau Brummell the inventor of modern clothes the prophet of cleanliness I have taken considerable pains to trace the influence of one garment upon its successor to reduce the wardrobe for each reign down to its simplest cuts and folds so that the reader may follow quite easily the passage of the coat from its birth to its ripe age and by this means may not only know the clothes of one time but the reasons for those garments To the best of my knowledge such a thing has never been done before most works on dress try to include the world from Adam to Charles Dickens lump a century into a page and dismiss the ancient Egyptians in a couple of colour plates So many young gentlemen have blown away their patrimony on feathers and tobacco that it is necessary for us to confine ourselves to certain gentlemen and ladies in our own country A knowledge of history is essential to the study of mankind and a knowledge of history is never perfect without a knowledge of the clothes with which to dress it A man in a sense belongs to his clothes they are so much a part of him that to take him seriously one must know how he walked about in what habit with what air I am compelled to speak strongly of my own work because I believe in it and I feel that the series of paintings in these volumes are really a valuable addition to English history To be modest is often to be excessively vain and having made an exhaustive study of my subject from my own point of view I do not feel called upon to hide my knowledge under a bushel Of course I do not suggest that the ordinary cultured man should acquire the same amount of knowledge as a painter or a writer of historical subjects or an actor but he should understand the clothes of his own people and be able to visualize any date in which he may be interested One half of the people who talk glibly of Beau Brummell have but half an idea when he lived and no idea that for example he wore whiskers Hamlet they can conjure up but would have some difficulty in recognising Shakespeare because most portraits of him are but head and shoulders Napoleon has stamped himself on men s minds very largely through the medium of a certain form of hat a lock of hair and a gray coat In future years an orchid will be remembered as an emblem I have arranged as far as it is possible that each plate shall show the emblem or distinguishing mark of the reign it illustrates so that the continuity of costume shall be remembered by the arresting notes As the fig leaf identifies Adam so may the chaperon twisted into a cockscomb mark Richard II As the curled and scented hair of Alcibiades occurs to our mind so shall Beau Nash manage his clouded cane Elizabeth shall be helped to the memory by her Piccadilly ruff square Henry VIII by his broad toed shoes and his little flat cap Anne Boleyn by her black satin nightdress James be called up as padded trucks Maximilian as puffs and slashes D Orsay by the curve of his hat Tennyson as a dingy brigand Gladstone as a collar and even more recent examples as the Whistlerian lock and the Burns blue suit And what romantic incidents may we not hang upon our clothes line The cloak of Samuel Pepys Dapper Dick as he signed himself to a certain lady sheltering four ladies from the rain Sir Walter Raleigh spreading his cloak over the mud to protect the shoes of that great humorist Elizabeth I never think of her apart from the saying Ginger for pluck Mary Queen of Scots ordering false attires of hair during her captivity all these scenes clinched into reality by the knowledge of the dress proper to them And what are we doing to help modern history the picture of our own times that it may look beautiful in the ages to come I cannot answer you that Some chapters of this work have appeared in the Connoisseur and I have to thank the editor for his courtesy in allowing me to reproduce them I must also thank mister Pownall for his help in the early stages of my labours One thing more I must add I do not wish this book to go forth and be received with that frigid politeness which usually welcomes a history to the shelves of the bookcase there to remain unread The book is intended to be read and is not wrapped up in grandiose phrases and a great wind about nothing I would wish to be thought more friendly than the antiquarian and more truthful than the historian and so have endeavoured to show in addition to the body of the clothes some little of their soul DION CLAYTON CALTHROP Contents PAGE WILLIAM THE FIRST one WILLIAM THE SECOND ten HENRY THE FIRST twenty one STEPHEN twenty nine HENRY THE SECOND forty six RICHARD THE FIRST

of Flanders THE MEN Illustration Why France should always give the lead in the matter of dress is a nice point in sartorial morality a morality which holds that it takes nine tailors to make a man and but one milliner to break him a code in fact with which this book will often have to deal Sartorially then we commence with the fourteenth of October ten sixty six upon which day fatal to the fashions of the country the flag of King Harold sumptuously woven and embroidered in gold bearing the figure of a man fighting studded with precious stones was captured William of Norse blood and pirate traditions landed in England and brought with him bloodshed devastation new laws new customs and new fashions Principal among these last was the method of shaving the hair at the back of the head which fashion speedily died out by reason of the parlous times and the haste of war besides the utter absurdity of the idea Fashion however has no sense of the ridiculous and soon replaced the one folly by some other extravagance William I found the Saxons very plainly dressed and he did little to alter the masculine mode He found the Saxon ladies to be as excellent at embroidery as were their Norman sisters and in such times the spindle side was content to sit patiently at home weaving while the men were abroad ravaging the country William was not of the stuff of dandies No man could draw his bow he helped with his own hands to clear the snowdrift on the march to Chester Stark and fierce he was loving the solitudes of the woods and the sight of hart and hind Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF WILLIAM I ten sixty six ten eighty seven Cloak buckled at the shoulder Leather thongs crossed on his legs Shoes of leather Tunic fitting to his body like a jersey When some kind of order was restored in England many of the Saxons who had fled the country and gone to Constantinople came back bringing with them the Oriental idea of dress The Jews came with Eastern merchandise into England and brought rich coloured stuffs and as these spread through the country by slow degrees there came a gradual change in colour and material and finer stuffs replaced the old homespun garments The Jews were at this time very eminent as silk manufacturers and makers of purple cloth The Britons had been very famous for their dyed woollen stuffs Boadicea is said to have worn a tunic of chequered stuff which was in all probability rather of the nature of Scotch plaids The tunics worn by the men of this time were roughly speaking of two kinds those that fitted close to the body and those that hung loose being gathered into the waist by a band The close fitting tunic was in the form of a knitted jersey with skirts reaching to the knee it was open on either side to the hips and fell from the hips in loose folds The neck was slit open four or five inches and had an edging of embroidery and the sleeves were wide and reached just below the elbows These also had an edging of embroidery or a band different in colour to the rest of the tunic Illustration The other form of tunic was made exactly in shape like the modern shirt except that the neck opening was smaller It was loose and easy with wide sleeves to the elbow and was gathered in at the waist by a band of stuff or leather The skirts of the tunics were cut square or V shaped in front and behind There were also tunics similar in shape to either of those mentioned except that the skirts were very short and were tucked into wide short breeches which reached to the knee or into the trousers which men wore Under this tunic was a plain shirt loosely fitting the sleeves tight and wrinkled over the wrist the neck showing above the opening of the tunic This shirt was generally white and the opening at the neck was sometimes stitched with coloured or black wool Upon the legs they wore neat fitting drawers of wool or cloth dyed or of natural colour or loose trousers of the same materials sometimes worn loose but more generally bound round just above the knee and at the ankle Illustration They wore woollen socks and for footgear they wore shoes of skin and leather and boots of soft leather shaped naturally to the foot and strapped or buckled across the instep The tops of the boots were sometimes ornamented with coloured bands The cloak worn was semicircular in shape with or without a small semicircle cut out at the neck It was fastened over the right shoulder or in the centre by means of a large round or square brooch or it was held in place by means of a metal ring or a stuff loop through which the cloak was pushed or it was tied by two cords sewn on to the right side of the cloak which cords took a bunch of the stuff into a knot and so held it the ends of the cords having tags of metal or plain ornaments One may see the very same make and fashion of tunic as the Normans wore under their armour being worn to day by the Dervishes in Lower Egypt a coarse wool tunic well padded made in the form of tunic and short drawers in one piece the wide sleeves reaching just below the elbow Illustration The hats and caps of these men were of the most simple form plain round topped skull caps flat caps close to the head without a brim and a hat with a peak like the helmet Hoods of course were worn during the winter made very close to the head and they were also worn under the helmets Thus in such a guise may we picture the Norman lord at home eating his meat with his fingers his feet in loose skin shoes tied with thongs his legs in loose trousers bound with crossed garters his tunic open at the neck showing the white edge of his shirt his face clean shaven and his hair neatly cropped THE WOMEN Illustration Nothing could be plainer or more homely than the dress of a Norman lady Her loose gown was made with ample skirts reaching well on to the ground and it was gathered in at the waist by a belt of wool cloth silk or cloth of gold web The gown fitted easily across the shoulders but fell from there in loose folds The neck opening was cut as the man s about five inches down the front and the border ornamented with some fine needlework as also were the borders of the wide sleeves which came just below the elbows Often the gown was made short so that when it was girded up the border of it fell only to the knees and showed the long chemise below The girdle was perhaps the richest portion of their attire and was sometimes of silk diapered with gold thread but such a girdle would be very costly More often it would be plain wool and be tied simply round the waist with short ends which did not show The chemise was a plain white garment with tight sleeves which wrinkled at the wrists that is to say they were really too long for the arm and so were caught in small folds at the wrist The gown opening at the neck in the same way as did the men s tunics showed the white of the chemise the opening being held together sometimes by a brooch Illustration Towards the end of the reign the upper part of the gown that is from the neck to the waist was worn close and fitted more closely to the figure but not over tightly much as a tight jersey would fit Over all was a cloak of the semicircular shape very voluminous about three feet in diameter which was brooched in the centre or on the shoulder Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF WILLIAM I ten sixty six ten eighty seven A twist of wool holds the gown at the waist Under the gown the chemise shows The neck of the gown is embroidered On the head where the hair was closely coiled with a few curls at the forehead a wimple was worn which was wound about the head and thrown over the shoulder not allowing the hair to show These wimples were sometimes very broad and were almost like a mantle so that they fell over the shoulders below the breast Tied round the wimple they sometimes had a snood or band of silk The shoes were like those worn by the men These ladies were all housewives cooking preparing simples doing embroidery and weaving They were their own milliners and dressmakers and generally made their husbands clothes although some garments might be made by the town tailors but as a rule they weaved cut sewed and fitted for their families and then after the garments were finished to satisfaction they would begin upon strips of embroidery to decorate them In such occupation we may picture them and imagine them sitting by the windows with their ladies busily sewing looking up from their work to see hedged fields in lambing time while shepherds in rough sheepskin clothes drove the sheep into a neat enclosure and saw to it that they lay on warm straw against the cold February night WILLIAM THE SECOND Reigned thirteen years ten eighty seven eleven hundred Born c ten sixty THE MEN Illustration About this time there came to England a Norman who settled near by the Abbey of Battle Baldwin the Tailor by name whom one might call the father of English tailoring Baldwin the Tailor sat contentedly cross legged on his bench and plied his needle and thread and snipped and cut and sewed watching the birds pick worms and insects from the turf of the battleground Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF WILLIAM II ten eighty seven eleven hundred Shows the wide drawers with an embroidered hem Under them can be seen the long woollen drawers bound with leather thongs England is getting a little more settled The reign opens picturesquely enough with William Rufus hastening to England with his father s ring and ends with the tragedy of the New Forest and a blood stained tunic Clothes begin to play an important part Rich fur lined cloaks and gowns trail on the ground and sweep the daisies so lately pressed by mailed feet and sopped with blood where the Saxons fell Illustration The Cloak pushed through a Ring Times have changed since Baldwin was at the coronation at Westminster on Christmas Day twenty years ago Flemish weavers and farmers arrive from overseas and are established by William II in the North to teach the people pacific arts causing in time a stream of Flemish merchandise to flow into the country chiefly of rich fabrics and fine cloths The men adopt longer tunics made after the same pattern as before split up either side and loose in the sleeve but in many cases the skirts reach to the ground in heavy folds and the sleeves hang over the hands by quite a yard The necks of these tunics are ornamented as before with coloured bands or stiff embroidery The cuffs have the embroidery both inside and out so that when the long sleeve is turned back over the hand the embroidery will show The fashion in cloaks is still the same of a semicircular pattern The shoes are the same as in the previous reign that is of the shape of the foot except in rare cases of dandyism when the shoes were made with long narrow toes and these being stuffed with moss or wool were so stiffened and curled up at the ends that they presented what was supposed to be a delightfully extravagant appearance They wore a sort of ankle garter of soft leather or cloth which came over the top of the boot and just above the ankle The hair beard and moustaches were worn long and carefully combed in fact the length of the beard caused the priests to rail at them under such terms as filthy goats But they had hardly the right to censorship since they themselves had to be severely reprimanded by their Bishops for their extravagance in dress Many gentlemen and especially the Welsh wore long loose trousers as far as the ankle leaving these garments free from any cross gartering These were secured about the waist by a girdle of stuff or leather Illustration The ultra fashionable dress was an elongation of every part of the simple dress of the previous reign Given these few details it is easy for anyone who wishes to go further to do so in which case he must keep to the main outline very carefully but as to the actual length of sleeve or shoe or the very measurements of a cloak they varied with the individual folly of the owner So a man might have long sleeves and a short tunic or a tunic which trailed upon the ground the sleeves of which reached only to the elbow I have noticed that it is the general custom of writers upon the dress of this early time to dwell lovingly upon the colours of the various parts of the dress as they were painted in the illuminated manuscripts This is a foolish waste of time insomuch as the colours were made the means of displays of pure design on the part of the very early illuminators and if one were to go upon such evidence as this by the exactness of such drawings alone then every Norman had a face the colour of which nearly resembled wet biscuit and hair picked out in brown lines round each wave and curl These woollen clothes cap tunic semicircular cloak and leg coverings have all been actually found in the tomb of a Briton of the Bronze Age So little did the clothes alter in shape that the early Briton and the late Norman were dressed nearly exactly alike When the tomb of William II was opened in eighteen sixty eight it was found as had been suspected that the grave had been opened and looted of what valuables it might have contained but there were found among the dust which filled the bottom of the tomb fragments of red cloth of gold cloth a turquoise a serpent s head in ivory and a wooden spear shaft perhaps the very spear that William carried on that fatal day in the New Forest Also with the dust and bones of the dead King some nutshells were discovered and examination showed that mice had been able to get into the tomb So if you please you may hit upon a pretty moral THE WOMEN Illustration And so the lady began to lace A moralist a denouncer of the fair sex a satirist would have his fling at this What thundering epithets and avalanche of words should burst out at such a momentous point in English history However the lady pleased herself Not that the lacing was very tight but it commenced the habit and the habit begat the harm and the thing grew until it arrived finally at that buckram square built cardboard and tissue figure which titters and totters through the Elizabethan era Our male eyes trained from infancy upwards to avoid gazing into certain shop windows nevertheless retain a vivid impression of an awesome affair therein which we understood by hints and signs confined our mothers figures in its deadly grip That the lady did not lace herself overtight is proved by the many informations we have of her household duties that she laced tight enough for unkind comment is shown by the fact that some old monk pictured the devil in a neat laced gown It was at any rate a distinct departure from the loosely clothed lady of ten sixty six towards the neater figure of eleven thirty five The lacing was more to draw the wrinkles of the close woven bodice of the gown smooth than to form a false waist and accentuated hips the beauty of which malformation I must leave to the writers in ladies journals and the condemnation to health faddists However the lacing was not the only matter of note A change was coming over all feminine apparel a change towards richness which made itself felt in this reign more in the fabric than in the actual make of the garment Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF WILLIAM II ten eighty seven eleven hundred This shows the gown which is laced behind fitting more closely to the figure The sleeves are wider above the wrist The gown was open at the neck in the usual manner was full in the skirt and longer than heretofore was laced at the back and was loose in the sleeve The sleeve as worn by the men that is the over long sleeve hanging down over the hand was also worn by the women and hung down or was turned back according to the freak of the wearer Not only this but a new idea began which was to cut a hole in the long sleeve where the hand came and pushing the hand through to let the rest of the sleeve droop down This developed as we shall see later Illustration Then the cloak which had before been fastened by a brooch on the shoulder or in the centre of the breast was now held more tightly over the shoulders by a set of laces or bands which ran round the back from underneath the brooch where they were fastened thus giving more definition to the shoulders You must remember that such fashions as the hole in the sleeve and the laced cloak were not any more universal than is any modern fashion and that the good dame in the country was about a century behind the times with her loose gown and heavy cloak There were still the short gowns which being tucked in at the waist by the girdle showed the thick wool chemise below and the unlaced gown fitting like a jersey The large wimple was still worn wrapped about the head and the hair was still carefully hidden Illustration Shall we imagine that it is night and that the lady is going to bed She is in her long white chemise standing at the window looking down upon the market square of a small town The moon picks out every detail of carving on the church and throws the porch into a dense gloom Not a soul is about not a light is to be seen not a sound is to be heard The lady is about to leave the window when she hears a sound in the street below She peers down and sees a man running towards the church he goes in and out of the shadows From her open window she can hear his heavy breathing Now he darts into the shadow of the porch and then out of the gloom comes a furious knocking and a voice crying Sanctuary The lady at her window knows that cry well Soon the monks in the belfry will awake and ring the Galilee bell The Galilee bell tolls and the knocking ceases A few curious citizens look out A dog barks Then a door opens and closes with a bang There is silence in the square again but the lady still stands at her window and she follows the man in her thoughts Now he is admitted by the monks and goes at once to the altar of the patron saint of the church where he kneels and asks for a coroner The coroner an aged monk comes to him and confesses him He tells his crime and renounces his rights in the kingdom and then in that dark church he strips to his shirt and offers his clothes to the sacrist for his fee Ragged mud stained clothes torn cloak all fall from him in a heap upon the floor of the church Now the sacrist gives him a large cloak with a cross upon the shoulder and having fed him gives him into the charge of the under sheriff who will next day pass him from constable to constable towards the coast where he will be seen on board a ship and so pass away an exile for ever The night is cold The lady pulls a curtain across the window and then stripping herself of her chemise she gets into bed HENRY THE FIRST Reigned thirty five years eleven hundred eleven thirty five Born ten sixty eight Married to Matilda of Scotland eleven hundred to Adela of Louvain eleven twenty one THE MEN Illustration The Father of Popular Literature Gerald of Wales says It is better to be dumb than not to be understood New times require new fashions and so I have thrown utterly aside the old and dry methods of some authors and aimed at adopting the fashion of speech which is actually in vogue to day Vainly perhaps I have endeavoured to follow this precept laid down by Father Gerald trying by slight pictures of the times to make the dry bones live to make the clothes stir up and puff themselves into the shapes of men It is almost a necessity that one who would describe paint stage or understand the costume of this reign should know the state of England at the time For there is in this reign a distinction without a difference in clothes the shapes are almost identical to the shapes and patterns of the previous reigns but everybody is a little better dressed The mantles worn by the few in the time of William the Red are worn now by most of the nobility fur lined and very full One may see on the sides of the west door of Rochester Cathedral Henry and his first wife and notice that the mantle he wears is very full one may see that he wears a supertunic which is gathered round his waist This tunic is the usual Norman tunic reaching to the knee but now it is worn over an under tunic which reaches to the ground in heavy folds One may notice that the King s hair is long and elegantly twisted into pipes or ringlets and that it hangs over his shoulders Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY I eleven hundred eleven thirty five His hair is curled in ringlets he wears a long cloak The shirt shows at the neck of the tunic The small design in the corner is from a sanctuary door knocker No longer is the priestly abuse of filthy goat applicable for Henry s beard is neatly trimmed and cut round his face These two things are the only practical difference between the two dates the end of the eleventh century and the beginning of the twelfth The under tunic was made as a perfectly plain gown with tight sleeves ending at the wrist it hung loose and full upon the figure Over this was worn the short tunic with wide sleeves ending at the elbow Both tunics would have broad borders of embroidered work or bands of coloured material The supertunic would be brooched by one of those circular Norman brooches which was an ornamental circle of open gold work in which stones and jewels were set The brooch was fastened by a central pin The extravagances of the previous reign were in some measure done away with even the very long hair was not fashionable in the latter half of this reign and the ultra long sleeve was not so usual So we may give as a list of clothes for men in this reign A white linen shirt A long tunic open at the neck falling to the ground with tight sleeves to the wrist A short tunic reaching only to the knees more open at the neck than the long tunic generally fastened by a brooch Tight well fitting drawers or loose trousers Bandages or garters crossed from the ankle to the knee to confine the loose trousers or ornament the tights Boots of soft leather which had an ornamental band at the top Socks with an embroidered top Shoes of cloth and leather with an embroidered band down the centre and round the top Shoes of skin tied with leather thongs Caps of skin or cloth of a very plain shape and without a brim Belts of leather or cloth or silk Semicircular cloaks fastened as previously described and often lined with fur The clothes of every colour but with little or no pattern the patterns principally confined to irregular groups of dots And to think that in the year in which Henry died Nizami visited the grave of Omar Al Khayyam in the Hira Cemetery at Nishapur Illustration A CHILD OF THE TIME OF HENRY I It is only in quite recent years that there have been quite distinct dresses for children fashions indeed which began with the ideas for the improvement in hygiene For many centuries children were dressed with slight modifications after the manner of their parents looking like little men and women until in the end they arrived at the grotesque infants of Hogarth s day powdered and patched with little stiff skirted suits and stiff brocade gowns with little swords and little fans and no doubt many pretty airs and graces One thing I have never seen until the early sixteenth century and that is girls wearing any of the massive head gear of their parents in all other particulars they were the same THE WOMEN Illustration The greatest change in the appearance of the women was in the arrangement of the hair After a hundred years or more of headcloths and hidden hair suddenly appears a head of hair Until now a lady might have been bald for all the notice she took of her hair now she must needs borrow hair to add to her own so that her plaits shall be thick and long It is easy to see how this came about The hair for convenience had always been plaited in two plaits and coiled round the head where it lay concealed by the wimple One day some fine lady decides to discard her close and uncomfortable head covering She lets her plaits hang over her shoulders and so appears in public Contempt of other ladies who have fine heads of hair for the thinness of her plaits competition in thick and long hair anger of ladies whose hair is not thick and long enormous demand for artificial hair failure of the supply to meet the ever increasing demand invention of silken cases filled with a substitute for hair these cases attached to the end of the plaits to elongate them in this manner do many fashions arrive and flourish until such time as the common people find means of copying them and then my lady wonders how she could ever have worn such a common affair The gowns of these ladies remained much the same except that the loose gown without any show of the figure was in great favour this gown was confined by a long girdle The girdle was a long rope of silk or wool which was placed simply round the waist and loosely knotted or it was wound round above the waist once crossed behind and then knotted in front and the ends allowed to hang down The ends of the girdle had tassels and knots depending from them The silk cases into which the hair was placed were often made of silk of variegated colours and these cases had metal ends or tassels The girdles sometimes were broad bands of silk diapered with gold thread of which manufacture specimens remain to us Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY I eleven hundred eleven thirty five This shows the pendant sleeve with an embroidered hem The long plaits of hair ended with metal or silk tags At the neck and wrists the white chemise shows The sleeves of the gowns had now altered in shape and had acquired a sort of pendulent cuff which hung down about two hands breadth from the wrist The border was as usual richly ornamented Illustration Then we have a new invention the pelisse It is a loose silk coat which is brooched at the waist or buttoned into a silk loop The sleeves are long that is they gradually increase in size from the underarm to the wrist and sometimes are knotted at the ends and so are unlike the other gown sleeves which grow suddenly long near to the wrist This pelisse reaches to the knees and is well open in front The idea was evidently brought back from the East after the knights arrived back from the First Crusade as it is in shape exactly like the coats worn by Persian ladies We may conceive a nice picture of Countess Constance the wife of Hugh Lufus Earl of Chester as she appeared in her dairy fresh from milking the cows which were her pride No doubt she did help to milk them and in her long under gown with her plaits once more confined in the folds of her wimple she made cheeses such good cheeses that Anselm Archbishop of Canterbury rejoiced in a present of some of them What a change it must have been to Matilda free of the veil that she hated from the Black Nuns of Romsey and the taunts and blows of her aunt Christina to become the wife of King Henry and to disport herself in fine garments and long plaited hair Matilda the very royal the daughter of a King the sister to three Kings the wife of a King the mother of an Empress STEPHEN Reigned nineteen years eleven thirty five eleven fifty four Born ten ninety four Married eleven twenty four to Matilda of Boulogne THE MEN Illustration When one regards the mass of material in existence showing costume of the tenth and eleventh centuries it appears curious that so little fabric remains of this particular period The few pieces of fabric in existence are so worn and bare that they tell little whereas pieces of earlier date of English or Norman material are perfect although thin and delicate There are few illuminated manuscripts of the twelfth century or of the first half of it and to the few there are all previous historians of costume have gone so that one is left without choice but to go also to these same books The possibilities however of the manuscripts referred to have not been exhausted and too much attention has been paid to the queer drawing of the illuminators so that where they utilized to the full the artistic license others have sought to pin it down as accurate delineation of the costume of the time In this I have left out all the supereccentric costumes fearing that such existed merely in the imagination of the artist and I have applied myself to the more ordinary and understandable As there are such excellent works on armour I have not touched at all upon the subject so that we are left but the few simple garments that men wore when they put off their armour or that the peasant and the merchant habitually wore Ladies occupied their leisure in embroidery and other fine sewing in consequence of which the borders of tunics of cloaks the edgings of sleeves and bands upon the shoes were elegantly patterned The more important the man the finer his shoes Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF STEPHEN eleven thirty five eleven fifty four He is wearing a cloak with hood attached it is of skin the smooth leather inside He has an ankle gaiter covering the top of his shoes On the arm over which the cloak hangs can be seen the white sleeve of the shirt As will be seen from the drawings the man wore his hair long smoothly parted in the centre with a lock drawn down the parting from the back of his head As a rule the hair curled back naturally and hung on the shoulders but sometimes the older fashion of the past reign remained and the hair was carefully curled in locks and tied with coloured ribbon Besides the hood as covering for the head men wore one or other of the simple caps shown made of cloth or of fur or of cloth fur lined Illustration Illustration Next to his skin the man of every class wore a shirt of the pattern shown the selfsame shirt that we wear to day excepting that the sleeves were made very long and tight fitting and were pushed back over the wrist giving those wrinkles which we notice on all the Bayeux tapestry sleeves and which we see for many centuries in drawings of the undergarment The shape has always remained the same the modes of fastening the shirt differ very slightly so little in fact that a shirt of the fourth century which still remains in existence shows the same button and loop that we notice of the shirts of the twelfth century The richer man had his shirt embroidered round the neck and sometimes at the cuffs Over this garment the man wore his tunic of wool or cloth or rarely of silk the drawing explains the exact making of it The tunic as will be seen was embroidered at the neck the cuffs and round the border One drawing shows the most usual of these tunics while the other drawings will explain the variations from it either a tight sleeve made long and rolled back a sleeve made very wide at the cuff and allowed to hang or a sleeve made so that it fell some way over the hand It was embroidered inside and out at the cuff and was turned back to allow free use of the hand Over the tunic was worn the cloak a very simple garment being a piece of cloth cut in the shape of a semicircle embroidered on the border or not according to the purse and position of the owner Sometimes a piece was cut out to fit the neck Another form of cloak was worn with a hood This was generally used for travelling or worn by such people as shepherds It was made for the richer folk of fine cloth fur lined or entirely of fur and for the poorer people of skin or wool The cloak was fastened by a brooch and was pinned in the centre or on either shoulder most generally on the right or it was pushed through a ring sewn on to the right side of the neck of the cloak The brooches were practically the same as those worn in the earlier reigns or were occasionally of a pure Roman design As will be seen in the small diagrams of men wearing the clothes of the day the tunic the shirt and the cloak were worn according to the season and many drawings in the MSS of the date show men wearing the shirt alone On their legs men wore trousers of leather for riding bound round with leather thongs and trousers of wool also bound with coloured straps of wool or cloth Illustration Stockings of wool were worn and cloth stockings also and socks There was a sock without a foot jewelled or embroidered round the top which was worn over the stocking and over the top of the boot in the manner of ankle gaiters The country man wore twists of straw round his calf and ankle For the feet there were several varieties of boots and shoes made of leather and stout cloth now and again with wooden soles As has been said before the important people rejoiced in elegant footgear of all colours All the shoes buttoned with one button above the outside ankle The boots were sometimes tall reaching to the bottom of the calf of the leg and were rolled over showing a coloured lining Sometimes they were loose and wrinkled over the ankle They were both boot and shoe made to fit the foot for in this reign nearly all the extravagances of the previous reign had died out and it is rare to find drawings or mention of long shoes stuffed with tow or wool During the reign of Stephen the nation was too occupied in wars and battles to indulge in excessive finery and few arts flourished although useful improvements occurred in the crafts There is in the British Museum a fine enamelled plate of this date which is a representation of Henry of Blois Stephen s brother who was the Bishop of Winchester Part of the inscription translated by mister Franks says that Art is above gold and gems and that Henry while living gives gifts of brass to God Champleve enamel was very finely made in the twelfth century and many beautiful examples remain notably a plaque which was placed on the column at the foot of which Geoffrey Plantagenet was buried It is a portrait of him and shows the Byzantine influence still over the French style This may appear to be rather apart from costume but it leads one to suppose that the ornaments of the time may have been frequently executed in enamel or in brass such ornaments as rings and brooches It is hard to say anything definite about the colours of the dresses at this time All that we can say is that the poorer classes were clothed principally in self coloured garments and that the dyes used for the clothes of the nobles were of very brilliant hues But a street scene would be more occupied by the colour of armour One would have seen a knight and men at arms the knight in his plain armour and the men in leather and steel a few merchants in coloured cloaks and the common crowd in brownish yellow clothes with occasional bands of colour encircling their waists The more simply the people are represented the more truthful will be the picture or presentation Few pictures of this exact time are painted and few stories are written about it but this will give all the information necessary to produce any picture or stage play or to illustrate any story The garments are perfectly easy to cut out and make In order to prove this I have had them made from the bare outlines given here without any trouble THE WOMEN Illustration Though many parts of England were at this time being harassed by wars still the domestic element grew and flourished The homes of the English from being bare and rude began to know the delights of embroidery and weaving The workroom of the ladies was the most civilized part of the castle and the effect of the Norman invasion of foreign fashions was beginning to be felt As the knights were away to their fighting so were the knights ladies engaged in sewing sleeve embroideries placing of pearls upon shoes making silk cases for their hair and otherwise stitching cutting and contriving against the return of their lords Illustration It is recorded that Matilda escaped from Oxford by a postern in a white dress and no doubt her women sympathizers made much of white for dresses The ladies wore a simple undergarment of thin material called a sherte or camise this was bordered with some slight embroidery and had tightish long sleeves pushed back over the wrist The garment fell well on to the ground This camise was worn by all classes The upper garment was one of three kinds made from the neck to below the breast including the sleeves of soft material from the breast to the hips it was made of some elastic material as knitted wool or thin cloth stiffened by criss cross bands of cloth and was fitted to the figure and laced up the back the lower part was made of the same material as the sleeves and bust Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF STEPHEN eleven thirty five eleven fifty four Her dress fits to her figure by lacing at the back Her long sleeves are tied up to keep them from trailing upon the ground Her hair is fastened at the end into silken cases She has a wimple in her hands which she may wind about her head The second was made tight fitting in the body and bust all of one elastic material and the skirt of loose thin stuff The third was a loose tunic reaching half way between the knees and feet showing the camise and tied about the waist and hips by a long girdle The sleeves of these garments showed as many variations as those of the men but with the poor folk they were short and useful and with the rich they went to extreme length and were often knotted to prevent them from trailing on the ground The collar and the borders of the sleeves were enriched with embroidery in simple designs In the case of the loose upper garment the border was also embroidered In winter a cloak of the same shape as was worn by the men was used i e cut exactly semicircular with embroidered edges The shoes of the ladies were fitted to the foot in no extravagant shape and were sewn with bands of pearls or embroidery The poorer folk went about barefoot The hair was a matter of great moment and most carefully treated it was parted in the centre and then plaited sometimes intertwined with coloured ribbands or twists of thin coloured material it was added to in length by artificial hair and was tied up in a number of ways Either it was placed in a tight silk case like an umbrella case which came about half way up the plait from the bottom and had little tassels depending from it or the hair was added to till it reached nearly to the feet and was bound round with ribbands the ends having little gold or silver pendants The hair hung as a rule down the front on either side of the face or occasionally behind down the back as was the case when the wimple was worn When the ladies went travelling or out riding they rode astride like men and wore the ordinary common hooded cloak Brooches for the tunic and rings for the fingers were common among the wealthy The plait was introduced into the architecture of the time as is shown by a Norman moulding at Durham Compared with the Saxon ladies these ladies of Stephen s time were elegantly attired compared with the Plantagenet ladies they were dressed in the simplest of costumes No doubt there were as in all ages women who gave all their body and soul to clothes who wore sleeves twice the length of anyone else who had more elaborate plaits and more highly ornamented shoes but taking the period as a whole the clothes of both sexes were plainer than in any other period of English history One must remember that when the Normans came into the country the gentlemen among the Saxons had already borrowed the fashions prevalent in France but that the ladies still kept in the main to simple clothes indeed it was the man who strutted to woo clad in all the fopperies of his time to win the simple woman who toiled and span to deck her lord in extravagant embroideries Illustration The learning of the country was shared by the ladies and the clergy and the influence of Osburgha the mother of Alfred and Editha the wife of Edward the Confessor was paramount among the noble ladies of the country The energy of the clergy in this reign was more directed to building and the branches of architecture than to the more studious and sedentary works of illumination and writing so that the sources from which we gather information with regard to the costume in England are few and also peculiar as the drawing of this date was although careful extremely archaic Picture the market town on a market day when the serfs were waiting to buy at the stalls until the buyers from the abbey and the castle had had their pick of the fish and the meat The lady s steward and the Father Procurator bought carefully for their establishments talking meanwhile of the annual catch of eels for the abbey Picture Robese the mother of Thomas the son of Gilbert Becket weighing the boy Thomas each year on his birthday and giving his weight in money clothes and provisions to the poor She was a type of the devout housewife of her day and the wife of a wealthy trader The barons were fortifying their castles and the duties of their ladies were homely and domestic They provided the food for men at arms the followers and for their husbands saw that simples were ready with bandages against wounds and sickness looked no doubt to provisions in case of siege sewed with their maidens in a vestiary or workroom and dressed as best they could for their position What they must have heard and seen was enough to turn them from the altar of fashion to works of compassion Their houses contained dreadful prisons and dungeons where men were put upon rachentegs and fastened to these beams so that they were unable to sit lie or sleep but must starve From their windows in the towers the ladies could see men dragged prisoners up to the castle walls through the hall up the staircase and cast perhaps past their very eyes from the tower to the moat below Such times and sights were not likely to foster proud millinery or dainty ways despite of which innate vanity ran to ribbands in the hair monstrous sleeves jewelled shoes and tight waists The tiring women were not overworked until a later period when the hair would take hours to dress and the dresses months to embroider In the town about the castle the merchants wives wore simple homespun clothes of the same form as their ladies The serfs wore plain smocks loose over the camise and tied about the waist and in the bitter cold weather skins of sheep and wolves unlined and but roughly dressed Illustration Cases for the Hair In eleven fifty four the Treaty of Wallingford brought many of the evils to an end and Stephen was officially recognised as King making Henry his heir Before the year was out Stephen died I have not touched on ecclesiastical costume because there are so many excellent and complete works upon such dress but I may say that it was above all civil dress most rich and magnificent I have given this slight picture of the time in order to show a reason for the simplicity of the dress and to show how enclosed in their walls the clergy were increasing in riches and in learning how despite the disorders of war the internal peace of the towns and hamlets was growing with craft gilds and merchant gilds The lords and barons fighting their battles knew little of the bond of strength that was growing up in these primitive labour unions but the lady in her bower in closer touch with the people receiving visits from foreign merchants and pedlars with rare goods to sell or barter saw how underlying the miseries of bloodshed and disaster the land began to bloom and prosper to grow out of the rough place it had been into the fair place of market town and garden it was to be Meanwhile London s thirteen conventual establishments were added to by another the Priory of saint Bartholomew raised by Rahere the King s minstrel HENRY THE SECOND Reigned thirty five years eleven fifty four eleven eighty nine Born eleven thirty three Married eleven fifty two to Eleanor of Guienne THE MEN Illustration The King himself is described as being careless of dress chatty outspoken His hair was close cropped his neck was thick and his eyes were prominent his cheek bones were high and his lips coarse The costume of this reign was very plain in design but rich in stuffs Gilt spurs were attached to the boots by red leather straps gloves were worn with jewels in the backs of them and the mantles seem to have been ornamented with designs Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY II eleven fifty four eleven eighty nine He wears the short cloak and his long tunic is held by a brooch at the neck and is girdled by a long tongued belt There are gloves on his hands The time of patterns upon clothes began The patterns were simple as crescents lozenges stars William de Magna Villa had come back from the Holy Land with a new fabric a precious silk called imperial which was made in a workshop patronized by the Byzantine Emperors The long tunic and the short supertunic were still worn but these were not so frequently split up at the side High boots reaching to the calf of the leg were in common use That part of the hood which fell upon the shoulders was now cut in a neat pattern round the edge Silks into which gold thread was sewn or woven made fine clothes and cloth cloaks lined with expensive furs even to the cost of a thousand pounds of our money were worn The loose trouser was going out altogether and in its stead the hose were made to fit more closely to the leg and were all of gay colours they were gartered with gold bands crossed the ends of which had tassels which hung down when the garter was crossed and tied about the knee Henry despite his own careless appearance was nicknamed Court Manteau or Short Mantle on account of a short cloak or mantle he is supposed to have brought into fashion The shirts of the men which showed at the opening of the tunic were buttoned with small gold buttons or studs of gold sewn into the linen The initial difference in this reign was the more usual occurrence of patterns in diaper upon the clothes The length of a yard was fixed by the length of the King s arm With the few exceptions mentioned the costume is the same as in the time of Stephen It is curious to note what scraps of pleasant gossip come to us from these early times saint Thomas a Becket dining off a pheasant the day before his martyrdom the angry King calling to his knights How a fellow that hath eaten my bread a beggar that first came to my Court on a lame horse dares to insult his King and the Royal Family and tread upon my whole kingdom and not one of the cowards I nourish at my table not one will deliver me of this turbulent priest the veins no doubt swelling on his bull like neck the prominent eyes bloodshot with temper the result of that angry speech to end in the King s public penance before the martyr s tomb Picture the scene at Canterbury on August twenty three eleven seventy nine when Louis VII King of France dressed in the manner and habit of a pilgrim came to the shrine and offered there his cup of gold and a royal precious stone and vowed a gift of a hundred hogsheads of wine as a yearly rental to the convent A common sight in London streets at this time was a tin medal of saint Thomas hung about the necks of the pilgrims And here I cannot help but give another picture Henry II passing through Wales on his way to Ireland in eleven seventy two hears the exploits of King Arthur which are sung to him by the Welsh bards In this song the bards mention the place of King Arthur s burial at Glastonbury Abbey in the churchyard When Henry comes back from Ireland he visits the Abbot of Glastonbury and repeats to him the story of King Arthur s tomb One can picture the search the King talking eagerly to the Abbot the monks or lay brothers digging in the place indicated by the words of the song the knights in armour their mantles wrapped about them standing by Then as the monks search seven feet below the surface a spade rings upon stone Picture the interest the excitement of these antiquarians It is a broad stone which is uncovered and upon it is a thin leaden plate in the form of a corpse bearing the inscription HIC JACET SEPULTUS INCLYTUS REX ARTURIUS IN INSULA AVALONIA They draw up this great stone and with greedy eyes read the inscription The monks continue to dig Presently at the depth of sixteen feet they find the trunk of a tree and in its hollowed shape lie Arthur and his Queen Arthur and Guinevere two names which to us now are part of England part of ourselves as much as our patron saint George Here they lie upon the turf and all the party gaze on their remains The skull of Arthur is covered with wounds his bones are enormous The Queen s body is in a good state of preservation and her hair is neatly plaited and is of the colour of gold Suddenly she falls to dust They bury them again with great care So lay our national hero since he died at the Battle of Camlan in Cornwall in the year five hundred forty two and after death was conveyed by sea to Glastonbury and all traces of his burial place lost except in the songs of the people until such day as Henry found him and his Queen THE WOMEN Illustration About this time came the fashion of the chin band and again the glory of the hair was hidden under the wimple To dress a lady s hair for this time the hair must be brushed out and then divided into two parts these are to be plaited and then brought round the crown of the head and fastened in front above the forehead The front pieces of hair are to be neatly pushed back from the forehead to show a high brow Now a cloth of linen is taken folded under the chin and brought over the top of the head and there pinned Then another thin band of linen is placed round the head and fastened neatly at the back and over all a piece of fine linen is draped and so arranged that it shall just cover the forehead band and fall on to the shoulders This last piece of linen is fastened to the chin band and the forehead strap by pins Illustration This fashion gave rise in later times to a linen cap the forehead strap was increased in height and stiffened so that it rose slightly above the crown of the head and the wimple instead of hanging over it was sewn down inside it and fell over the top of the cap Later the cap was sewn in pleats The gown of this time was quite loose with a deep band round the neck and round the hem of the skirts which were very full So far as one can tell it was put on over the head having no other opening but at the neck and was held at the waist by an ornamental girdle The chemise showed above the neck of the gown which was fastened by the usual round brooch Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY II eleven fifty four eleven eighty nine There is a chin band to be seen passing under the wimple this band is pinned to hold it round the head The sleeves were well fitting rather loose at the elbow and fell shaped over the wrist where there was a deep border of embroidery It is quite possible that the cuffs and hem may have been made of fur The shoes were as usual to the last two reigns rather blunt at the toe and generally fitting without buckle button or strap round the ankle where they were rolled back Above the waist the tied girdle was still worn but this was being supplanted by a broad belt of silk or ornamented leather which fastened by means of a buckle The tongue of the belt was made very long and when buckled hung down below the knee The cloaks from the light way in which they are held appear to have been made of silk or some such fine material as fine cloth They are held on to the shoulders by a running band of stuff or a silk cord the ends of which pass through two fasteners sewn on to the cloak and these are knotted or have some projecting ornament which prevents the cord from slipping out of the fastener In this way one sees the cloak hanging from the shoulders behind and the cord stretched tight across the breast or the cord knotted in a second place and so bringing the cloak more over the shoulders The effigy of the Queen at Fontevraud shows her dress covered with diagonal bars of gold in the triangles of which there are gold crescents placed from point to point and no doubt other ladies of her time had their emblems or badges embroidered into their gowns RICHARD THE FIRST Reigned ten years eleven eighty nine eleven ninety nine Born eleven fifty seven Married eleven ninety one to Berengaria of Navarre THE MEN Illustration The King had but little influence over dress in his time seeing that he left England as soon as he was made King and only came back for two months in eleven ninety four to raise money and to be crowned again The general costume was then as plain as it had ever been with long tunics and broad belts fastened by a big buckle The difference in costume between this short reign and that of Henry II is almost imperceptible if any difference may be noted it is in the tinge of Orientalism in the garments There is more of the long and flowing robe more of the capacious mantle the wider sleeve No doubt the many who came from the Crusades made a good deal of difference to English homes and actual dresses and tunics from the East of gorgeous colours and Eastern designs were one must suppose to be seen in England Cloth of gold and cloth of gold and silks that is warf of silk and weft of gold were much prized and were called by various names from the Persian as ciclatoun siglaton Such stuff when of great thickness and value so thick that six threads of silk or hemp were in the warf was called samite Later when the cloth of gold was more in use and the name had changed from ciclatoun to bundekin and from that to tissue to keep such fine cloth from fraying or tarnishing they put very thin sheets of paper away between the folds of the garments so to this day we call such paper tissue paper Leaf gold was used sometimes over silk to give pattern and richness to it Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF RICHARD I eleven eighty nine eleven ninety nine A curious survival of this time which has a connection with costume was the case of Abraham Thornton in eighteen eighteen Abraham Thornton was accused of having drowned Mary Ashford but he was acquitted by the jury This acquittal did not satisfy popular feeling and the brother of Mary Ashford appealed Now Thornton was well advised as to his next proceeding and following the still existent law of this early time of which I write he went to Westminster Hall where he threw down as a gage of battle an antique gauntlet without fingers or thumb of white tanned skin ornamented with silk fringes and sewn work crossed by a narrow band of leather the fastenings of leather tags and thongs This done he declared himself ready to defend himself in a fight and so to uphold his innocence saying that he was within his rights and that no judge could compel him to come before a jury This was held to be good and within the law so Abraham Thornton won his case as the brother refused to pick up the gauntlet The scandal of this procedure caused the abolishment of the trial by battle which had remained in the country s laws from the time of Henry II until eighteen nineteen It was a time of foreign war and improvement in military armour and arms Richard I favoured the cross bow and brought it into general use in England to be used in conjunction with the old four foot bow and the great bow six feet long with the cloth yard arrow a bow which could send a shaft through a four inch door For some time this military movement together with the influence of the East kept England from any advance or great change in costume indeed the Orientalism reached a pitch in the age of Henry III which so far as costume is concerned may be called the Age of Draperies To recall such a time in pictures one must then see visions of loose tuniced men with heavy cloaks of men in short tunics with sleeves tight or loose at the wrists of hoods with capes to them the cape edge sometimes cut in a round design of soft leather boots and shoes the boots reaching to the calf of the leg To see in the streets bright Oriental colours and cloaks edged with broad bands of pattern to see hooded heads and bared heads on which the hair was long to see many long bearded men to see old men leaning on tan handled sticks the sailor in a cap or coif tied under his chin the builder stonemason and skilled workman in the same coif to see as a whole a brilliant shifting colour scheme in which armour gleamed and leather tunics supplied a dull fine background Among these one might see at a town by the shore a thief of a sailor being carried through the streets with his head shaven tarred and feathered THE WOMEN Illustration It is difficult to describe an influence in clothes It is difficult nowadays to say in millinery where Paris begins and London accepts The hint of Paris in a gown suggests taste the whole of Paris in a gown savours of servile imitation No well dressed Englishwoman should or does look French but she may have a subtle cachet of France if she choose The perfection of art is to conceal the means to the end the perfection of dress is to hide the milliner in the millinery The ladies of Richard I s time did not wear Oriental clothes but they had a flavour of Orientalism pervading their dress rather masculine Orientalism than feminine The long cloak with the cord that held it over the shoulders the long loose gown of fine colours and simple designs the soft low heelless shoes the long unbound hair or the hair held up and concealed under an untied wimple these gave a touch of something foreign to the dress Away in the country there was little to dress for and what clothes they had were made in the house Stuffs brought home from Cyprus from Palestine from Asia Minor were laboriously conveyed to the house and there made up into gowns Local smiths and silver workers made them buckles and brooches and ornamental studs for their long belts or clasps for their purses A wreck would break up on the shore near by and the news would arrive perhaps that some bales of stuff were washed ashore and were to be sold Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF RICHARD I eleven eighty nine eleven ninety nine Her very full cloak is kept in place by the cord which passes through loops A large buckle holds the neck of the gown well together The gown is ornamented with a simple diaper pattern the hem and neck are deeply embroidered The female anchorites of these days were busy gossips and from their hermitage or shelter by a bridge on the road would see the world go by and pick up friends by means of gifts of bandages or purses made by them despite the fact that this traffic was forbidden to them So the lady in the country might get news of her lord abroad and hear that certain silks and stuffs were on their way home The gowns they wore were long flowing and loose they were girded about the middle with leathern or silk belts which drew the gown loosely together The end of the belt after being buckled hung down to about the knee These gowns were close at the neck and there fastened by a brooch the sleeves were wide until they came to the wrist over which they fitted closely The cloaks were ample and were held on by brooches or laces across the bosom The shoes were the shape of the foot sewn embroidered elaborate The wimples were pieces of silk or white linen held to the hair in front by pins and allowed to flow over the head at the back There were still remaining at this date women who wore the tight fitting gown laced at the back and who tied their chins up in gorgets JOHN Reigned seventeen years eleven ninety nine twelve sixteen Born eleven sixty seven Married in eleven eighty nine to Hadwisa of Gloucester whom he divorced married in twelve hundred to Isabella of Angouleme THE MEN There was a garment in this reign which was the keynote of costume at the time and this was the surcoat It had been worn over the armour for some time but in this reign it began to be an initial part of dress Take a piece of stuff about nine or ten yards in length and about twenty two inches wide cut a hole in the centre of this wide enough to admit of a man s head passing through and you have a surcoat Illustration Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF JOHN eleven ninety nine twelve sixteen Under this garment the men wore a flowing gown the sleeves of which were so wide that they reached at the base from the shoulder to the waist and narrowed off to a tight band at the wrist These two garments were held together by a leather belt buckled about the middle with the tongue of the belt hanging down Broad borders of design edged the gowns at the foot and at the neck and heraldic devices were sewn upon the surcoats King John himself the quick social humorous man dressed very finely He loved the company of ladies and their love but in spite of his love for them he starved and tortured them starved and beat children was insolent selfish and wholly indifferent to the truth He laughed aloud during the Mass but for all that was superstitious to the degree of hanging relics about his neck and he was buried in a monk s cowl which was strapped under his chin Silk was becoming more common in England and the cultivation of the silkworm was in some measure gaining hold In twelve thirteen the Abbot of Cirencester Alexander of Neckham wrote upon the habits of the silkworm Irish cloth of red colour was largely in favour presumably for cloaks and hoods The general costume of this reign was very much the same as that of Henry II and Richard I the long loose gown the heavy cloak the long hair cut at the neck the fashion of beards the shoes belts hoods and heavy fur cloaks all much the same as before the only real difference being in the general use of the surcoat and the very convenient looseness of the sleeves under the arms Illustration There is an inclination in writing of a costume one can visualize mentally to leave out much that might be useful to the student who knows little or nothing of the period of dress in which one is writing so perhaps it will be better to now dress a man completely First long hair and a neatly trimmed beard over this a hood and cape or a circular cap with a slight projection on the top of it Second a shirt of white like a modern soft shirt Third tights of cloth or wool Fourth shoes strapped over the instep or tied with thongs or fitting at the ankle like a slipper or boots of soft leather turned over a little at the top at the base of the calf of the leg Illustration Fifth a gown loosely fitting buckled at the neck with sleeves wide at the top and tight at the wrist or quite loose and coming to just below the elbow or a tunic reaching only to the knees both gown and tunic fastened with a belt Sixth a surcoat sometimes at others a cloak held together by a brooch or made for travelling with a hood This completes an ordinary wardrobe of the time THE WOMEN As may be seen from the plate no change in costume took place The hair plaited and bound round the head or allowed to flow loose upon the shoulders Over the hair a gorget binding up the neck and chin Over all a wimple pinned to the gorget A long loose gown with brooch at the neck Sleeves tight at the wrist The whole gown held in at the waist by a belt with one long end hanging down Shoes made to fit the shape of the foot and very elaborately embroidered and sewn A long cloak with buckle or lace fastening In this reign there were thirty English towns which had carried on a trade in dyed cloths for fifty years Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF JOHN eleven ninety nine twelve sixteen One may just see the purse beneath the cloak where it hangs from the belt The cloak itself is of fine diaper patterned material HENRY THE THIRD Reigned fifty six years twelve sixteen twelve seventy two Born twelve oh seven Married twelve thirty six to Eleanor of Provence THE MEN Illustration Despite the fact that historians allude to the extravagance of this reign there is little in the actual form of the costume to bear out the idea Extravagant it was in a large way and costly for one who would appear well dressed but the fopperies lay more in the stuffs than in the cut of the garments worn It was an age of draperies This age must call up pictures of bewrapped people swathed in heavy cloaks of cloth of Flanders dyed with the famous Flemish madder dye of people in silk cloaks and gowns from Italy of people in loose tunics made of English cloth This long reign of over fifty years is a transitional period in the history of clothes as in its course the draped man developed very slowly towards the coated man and the loose hung clothes very gradually began to shape themselves to the body The transition from tunic and cloak and Oriental draperies is so slow and so little marked by definite change that to the ordinary observer the Edwardian cotehardie seems to have sprung from nowhere man seems to have on a sudden dropped his stately wraps and mantles and discarded his chrysalis form to appear in tight lines following the figure a form infinitely more gay and alluring to the eye than the ponderous figure that walks through the end of the thirteenth century Up to and through the time from the Conquest until the end of Henry III s reign the clothes of England appear that is they appear to me to be lordly rich fine but never courtier like and elegant Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY III twelve sixteen twelve seventy two Heavy cloak and fulness of dress characteristic of this time If one may take fashion as a person one may say Fashion arrived in ten sixty six in swaddling clothes and so remained enveloped in rich cloaks and flowing draperies until twelve forty when the boy began to show a more active interest in life this interest grew until in twelve seventy it developed into a distaste for heavy clothes but the boy knew of no way as yet in which to rid himself of the trailings of his mother cloak Then in about twelve seventy two he invented a cloak more like a strange long tunic through which he might thrust his arms for freedom on this cloak he caused his hood to be fastened and so made himself three garments in one and gave himself greater ease Then dawned the fourteenth century the youth of clothes and our fashion boy shot up dropped his mantles and heaviness and came out from thence slim and youthful in a cotehardie Of such a time as this it is not easy to say the right and helpful thing because given a flowing gown and a capacious mantle imagination does the rest Cut does not enter into the arena Imagine a stage picture of this time a mass of wonderful brilliant colours a crowd of men in long loose gowns or surcoats a crowd of ladies in long loose gowns both men and women hung with cloaks or mantles of good stuffs and gay colours A background of humbler persons in homespun tunics with cloth or frieze hoods over their heads Here and there a fop out of his date a quarter century before his time in a loose coat with pocket holes in front and a buttoned neck to his coat his shoes very pointed and laced at the sides his hair long curled and bound by a fillet or encompassed with a cap with an upturned brim Illustration The beginning of the coat was this the surcoat which up till now was split at both sides from the shoulder to the hem was now sewn up leaving only a wide armhole from the base of the ribs to the shoulder This surcoat was loose and easy and was held in at the waist by a belt In due time a surcoat appeared which was slightly shaped to the figure was split up in front instead of at the sides and in which the armholes were smaller and the neck tighter and fastened by two or three buttons In front of this surcoat two pocket holes showed This surcoat was also fastened by a belt at the waist In common with the general feeling towards more elaborate clothes the shoes grew beyond their normal shape and now no longer conforming to the shape of the foot they became elongated at the toes and stuck out in a sharp point this point was loose and soft waiting for a future day when men should make it still longer and stuff it with tow and moss Of all the shapes of nature no shape has been so marvellously maltreated as the human foot It has suffered as no other portion of the body has suffered it has endured exceeding length and exceeding narrowness it has been swelled into broad club like shapes it has been artificially raised from the ground ended off square pressed into tight points curved under and finally as to day placed in hard shining tight leather boxes All this has been done to one of the most beautiful parts of the human anatomy by the votaries of fashion who have in turn been delighted to expose the curves of their bodies the round swelling of their hips the beauties of their nether limbs the whiteness of their bosoms the turn of their elbows and arms and the rotundity of their shoulders but who have for some mysterious reasons been for hundreds of years ashamed of the nakedness of their feet Let me give a wardrobe for a man of this time A hood with a cape to it the peak of the hood made full but about half a hand s breadth longer than necessary to the hood the cape cut sometimes at the edge into a number of short slits A cap of soft stuff to fit the head with or without an upturned brim A fillet of silk or metal for the hair A gown made very loose and open at the neck wide in the body the sleeves loose or tight to the wrist The gown long or short on the ground or to the knee and almost invariably belted at the waist by a long belt of leather with ornamental studs A surcoat split from shoulder to hem or sewn up except for a wide armhole A coat shaped very slightly to the figure having pocket holes in front small armholes and a buttoned neck A great oblong shaped piece of stuff for a cloak or a heavy round cloak with an attached hood Tights of cloth or sewn silk that is pieces of silk cut and sewn to the shape of the leg Shoes with long points about two inches beyond the toes fastened by a strap in front or laced at the sides or made to pull on and fit at the ankle the last sometimes with a V shaped piece cut away on either side There was a tendency to beads and a universal custom of long hair In all such clothes as are mentioned above every rich stuff of cloth silk wool and frieze may be used and fur linings and fur hats are constant as also are furred edges to garments There was a slight increase of heraldic ornament and a certain amount of foreign diaper patterning on the clothes THE WOMEN Now the lady must needs begin to repair the ravages of time and touch the cheek that no longer knows the bloom of youth with rouge This in itself shows the change in the age Since the Britons poor simple souls had sought to embellish Nature by staining themselves blue with woad and yellow with ochre no paint had touched the faces of the fashionable until this reign Perhaps discreet historians had left that fact veiled holding the secrets of the lady s toilet too sacred for the black of print but now the murder came out The fact in itself is part of the psychology of clothes Paint the face and you have a hint towards the condition of fashion Again as in the case of the men no determined cut shows which will point to this age as one of such and such a garment or such an innovation but and this I would leave to your imagination there was a distinction that was not great enough to be a difference The gowns were loose and flowing and were gathered in at the waist by a girdle or rather a belt the tongue of which hung down in front but as the end of the reign approached the gowns were shaped a little more to the figure A lady might possess such clothes as these the gowns I have mentioned above the sleeves of which were tight all the way from the shoulder to the wrist or were loose and cut short just below the elbow showing the tight sleeves of the under gown Shoes very elaborately embroidered and pointed at the toes A rich cloak made oblong in shape and very ample in cut A shaped mantle with strings to hold it together over the shoulders Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY III twelve sixteen twelve seventy two This will show how very slight were the changes in woman s dress a plain cloak a plain gown and a wimple over the head For the head a wimple made of white linen or perhaps of silk this she would put above her head leaving the neck bare A long belt for her waist and if she were a great lady a pair of gloves to wear or stick into her belt THE COUNTRY FOLK From the Conquest to the reign of Edward I Illustration Until the present day the countryman has dressed in a manner most fitted to his surroundings now the billycock hat a devil derived offspring from a Greek source the Sunday suit of shiny black with purple trousers the satin tie of Cambridge blue and the stiff shirt have almost robbed the peasant of his poetical appearance Civilization seems to have arrived at our villages with a pocketful of petty religious differences a bagful of public houses a bundle of penny and halfpenny papers full of stories to show the fascination of crime and these Sunday clothes The week s workdays still show a sense of the picturesque in corduroys and jerseys or blue shirts but the landscape is blotted with men wearing out old Sunday clothes so that the painter of rural scenes with rural characters must either lie or go abroad As for the countrywoman she I am thankful to say still retains a sense of duty and beauty and except on Sunday remains more or less respectably clad Chivalry prevents one from saying more Illustration In the old days from the Conquest until the end of the thirteenth century the peasant was dressed in perfect clothes The villages were self providing they grew by then wool and hemp for the spindles From this was made yarn for materials to be made up into coats and shirts The homespun frieze that the peasant wore upon his back was hung by the nobleman upon his walls The village bootmaker made besides skin sandals to be tied with thongs upon the feet leather trousers and belts The mole catcher provided skin for hats Hoods of a plain shape were made from the hides of sheep or wolves the wool or hair being left on the hood Cloaks lined with sheepskin served to keep away the winter cold To protect their legs from thorns the men wore bandages of twisted straw wrapped round their trousers or leather thongs cross gartered to the knee The fleece of the sheep was woven in the summer into clothes of wool for the winter Gloves were made at the beginning of the thirteenth century of wool and soft leather these were shaped like the modern baby s glove a pouch for the hand and fingers and a place for the thumb A coarse shirt was worn over which a tunic very loosely made was placed and belted at the waist The tunic hardly varied in shape from the Conquest to the time of Elizabeth being but a sack like garment with wide sleeves reaching a little below the elbow The hood was ample and the cloak wide The women wore gowns of a like material to the men loose gowns which reached to the ankles and gave scope for easy movement They wore their hair tied up in a wimple of coarse linen Illustration A PEASANT OF EARLY ENGLAND WILLIAM I HENRY III His hood is made from sheepskin the wool outside the hem trimmed into points His legs are bound up with garters of plaited straw His shoes are of the roughest make of coarse leather He has the shepherd s horn slung over his shoulder The people of the North were more ruggedly clothed than the Southerners and until the monks founded the sheep farming industry in Yorkshire the people of those parts had no doubt to depend for their supply of wool upon the more cultivated peoples Illustration Picture these people then in very simple natural wool coloured dresses going about their ordinary country life attending their bees their pigs sheep and cattle eating their kele soup made of colewort and other herbs See them ragged and hungry being fed by Remigius Bishop of Lincoln after all the misery caused by the Conquest or despairing during the Great Frost of twelve oh five which began on saint Hilary s Day January eleven and lasted until March twenty two and was so severe that the land was like iron and could not be dug or tilled When better days arrived and farming was taken more seriously by the great lords when Grosseteste the Bishop of Lincoln wrote his book on farming and estate management for Margaret the Dowager Countess of Lincoln then clothes and stuffs manufactured in the towns became cheaper and more easy to obtain and the very rough skin clothes and undressed hides began to vanish from among the clothes of the country and the rough gartered trouser gave way before cloth cut to fit the leg On lord and peasant alike the sun of this early age sets and with the sunset comes the warning bell the couvre feu so on their beds of straw covered floors let them sleep EDWARD THE FIRST Reigned thirty five years twelve seventy two thirteen oh seven Born twelve thirty nine Married twelve fifty four Eleanor of Castile twelve ninety nine Margaret of France MEN AND WOMEN Until the performance of the Sherborne Pageant I had never had the opportunity of seeing a mass of people under proper open air conditions dressed in the peasant costume of Early England For once traditional stage notions of costume were cast aside and an attempt was made which was perfectly successful to dress people in the colours of their time The mass of simple colours bright reds blues and greens was a perfect expression of the date giving as nothing else could give an appearance of an illuminated book come to life One might imagine that such a primary coloured crowd would have appeared un English and too Oriental or Italian but with the background of trees and stone walls the English summer sky distressed with clouds the moving cloud shadows and the velvet grass these fierce hard colours looked distinctly English undoubtedly of their date and gave the spirit of the ages from a clothes point of view as no other colours could have done In doing this they attested to the historical truth of the play It seemed natural to see an English crowd one blazing jewel work of colour and by the excellent taste and knowledge of the designer the jewel like hardness of colour was consistently kept It was interesting to see the difference made to this crowd by the advent of a number of monks in uniform black or brown and to see the setting in which these jewel like peasants shone the play of brilliant hues amid the more sombre browns and blacks the shifting of the blues and reds the strong notes of emerald green all like the symmetrical accidents of the kaleidoscope settling into their places in perfect harmony The entire scene bore the impress of the spirit of historical truth and it is by such pageants that we can imagine coloured pictures of an England of the past Again we could observe the effect of the light reflecting armour cold shimmering steel coming in a play of colour against the background of peasants and thereby one could note the exact appearance of an ordinary English day of such a date as this of which I now write the end of the thirteenth century The mournful procession bearing the body of Queen Eleanor of Castile resting at Waltham would show a picture in the same colours as the early part of the Sherborne Pageant Colour in England changed very little from the Conquest to the end of the reign of Edward I the predominant steel and leather the gay simple colours of the crowds the groups of one colour as of monks and men at arms gave an effect of constantly changing but ever uniform colours and designs of colour exactly as I said before like the shifting patterns of the kaleidoscope It was not until the reign of Edward II that the effect of colour changed and became pied and later with the advent of stamped velvets heavily designed brocades and the shining of satins we get that general effect best recalled to us by memories of Italian pictures we get as it were a varnish of golden brown over the crude beauties of the earlier times It is intensely important to a knowledge of costume to remember the larger changes in the aspect of crowds from the colour point of view A knowledge of history by which I do not mean a parrot like acquirement of dates and Acts of Parliament but an insight into history as a living thing is largely transmitted to us by pictures and as pictures practically begin for us with the Tudors we must judge of coloured England from illuminated books In these you will go from white green red and purple to such colours as I have just described more vivid blues reds and greens varied with brown black and the colour of steel into the chequered pages of pied people and striped dresses into rich coloured people people in black and as you close the book and arrive at the wall picture back to the rich coloured people again Illustration The men of this time it must be remembered were more adapted to the arts of war than to those of peace and the knight who was up betimes and into his armour and to bed early was not a man of so much leisure that he could stroll about in gay clothes of an inconvenient make His principal care was to relieve himself of his steel burden and get into a loose gown belted at the waist over which if the weather was inclement he would wear a loose coat This coat was made with a hood attached to it very loose and easy about the neck and very wide about the body its length was a matter of choice but it was usual to wear it not much below the knees The sleeves were also wide and long having at a convenient place a hole cut through which the arms could be placed The men wore their hair long and brushed out about the ears long that is to the nape of the neck They also were most commonly bearded with or without a moustache Upon their heads they wore soft small hats with a slight projection at the top the brim of the hat turned up and scooped away in front Fillets of metal were worn about the hair with some gold work upon them to represent flowers or they wore now and again real chaplets of flowers There was an increase of heraldic ornament in this age and the surcoats were often covered with a large device These surcoats as in the previous reign were split from shoulder to bottom hem or were sewn up below the waist for these thin silk thick silk called samite and sendal or thick stuff was used as also for the gowns The shoes were peaked and had long toes but nothing extravagant and they were laced on the outside of the foot The boots came in a peak up to the knee The peasant was still very Norman in appearance hooded cloaked with ill fitting tights and clumsy shoes his dress was often of bright colours on festivals as was the gown and head handkerchief of his wife Thus you see that for ordinary purposes a man dressed in some gown which was long loose and comfortable the sleeves of it generally tight for freedom so that they did not hang about his arm and his shoes hat cloak everything was as soft and free as he could get them The woman also followed in the lines of comfort her under gown was full and slack at the waist the sleeves were tight and were made to unbutton from wrist to elbow they stopped short at the wrist with a cuff Her upper gown had short wide sleeves was fastened at the back and was cut but roughly to the figure The train of this gown was very long They sought for comfort in every particular but one for though I think the gorget very becoming I think that it must have been most distressing to wear This gorget was a piece of white linen wrapped about the throat and pinned into its place the ends were brought up to meet a wad of hair over the ears and there fastened in this way half framing the face Illustration The hair was parted in the middle and rolled over pads by the ears so as to make a cushion on which to pin the gorget This was the general fashion Now the earlier form of head dress gave rise to another fashion The band which had been tied round the head to keep the wimple in place was enlarged and stiffened with more material and so became a round linen cap wider at the top than at the bottom Sometimes this cap was hollow crowned so that it was possible to bring the wimple under the chin fasten it into place with the cap and allow it to fall over the top of the cap in folds sometimes the cap was solidly crowned and was pleated sometimes the cap met the gorget and no hair showed between them Illustration A MAN AND WOMAN OF THE TIME OF EDWARD I twelve seventy two thirteen oh seven The sleeves of the man s overcoat through which he has thrust his arms are complete sleeves and could be worn in the ordinary manner but that they are too long to be convenient hence the opening What we know as the true lovers knot was sometimes used as an ornament sewn on to dresses or gowns You may know the effigy of Queen Eleanor in Westminster Abbey and if you do you will see an example of the very plainest dress of the time She has a shaped mantle over her shoulders which she is holding together by a strap the long mantle or robe is over a plain loosely pleated gown which fits only at the shoulders her hair is unbound and she wears a trefoil crown upon her head Illustration The changes in England can best be seen by such monuments as Edward caused to be erected in memory of his beloved wife The arts of peace were indeed magnificent and though the knight was the man of war he knew how to choose his servant in the great arts Picture such a man as Alexander de Abyngdon le Imaginator who with William de Ireland carved the statues of the Queen for five marks each such a man with his gown hitched up into his belt his hood back on his shoulders watching his statue put into place on the cross at Charing He is standing by Roger de Crundale the architect of that cross and he is directing the workmen who are fixing the statue A little apart you may picture Master William Tousell goldsmith of London a very important person who is making a metal statue of the Queen and one of her father in law Henry III for Westminster Abbey At the back men and women in hoods and wimples in short tunics and loose gowns A very brightly coloured picture though the dyes of the dresses be faded by rain and sun they are the finer colours for that Master Tousell no doubt in a short tunic for riding with his loose coat on him the heavy hood back a little cap on his head the workmen with their tunics off a twist of coloured stuff about their waists their heads bare It is a beautiful love story this of fierce Edward the terror of Scotland for Eleanor whom he cherished tenderly and whom dead we do not cease to love The same man who could love so tenderly and well who found a fantastic order of chivalry in the Round Table of Kenilworth could there swear on the body of a swan the death of Comyn Regent of Scotland and could place the Countess of Buchan who set the crown upon the head of Bruce in a cage outside one of the towers of Berwick Despite the plain cut of the garments of this time and the absence of superficial trimmings it must have been a fine sight to witness one hundred lords and ladies all clothed in silk seated about the Round Table of Kenilworth EDWARD THE SECOND Reigned twenty years thirteen oh seven thirteen twenty seven Born twelve eighty four Married thirteen oh eight Isabella of France MEN AND WOMEN Whether the changes in costume that took place in this reign were due to enterprising tailors or to an exceptionally hot summer or to the fancy of the King or to the sprightliness of Piers Gaveston it is not possible to say Each theory is arguable and no doubt in some measure each theory is right for although men followed the new mode ladies adhered to their earlier fashions Take the enterprising tailor call him an artist The old loose robe was easy of cut it afforded no outlet for his craft it cut into a lot of material was easily made at home it was in fact a baggy affair that fitted nowhere Now is it not possible that some tailor artist working upon the vanity of a lordling who was proud of his figure showed how he could present this figure to its best advantage in a body tight garment which should reach only to his hips Illustration Take the hot summer You may or may not know that a hot summer some years ago suddenly transformed the City of London from a place of top hats and black coats into a place of flannel jackets and hats of straw so that it is now possible for a man to arrive at his City office clad according to the thermometer without incurring the severe displeasure of the Fathers of the City It seems that somewhere midway between thirteen oh seven and thirteen twenty seven men suddenly dropped their long robes loosely tied at the waist and appeared in what looked uncommonly like vests and went by the name of cotehardies It must have been surprising to men who remembered England clothed in long and decorous robes to see in their stead these gay debonair tight vests of pied cloth or parti coloured silk Piers Gaveston the gay the graceless but graceful favourite clever at the tournament warlike and vain may have instituted this complete revolution in clothes with the aid of the weak King Illustration Illustration Sufficient perhaps to say that although long robes continued to be worn cotehardies were all the fashion There was a general tendency to exaggeration The hood was attacked by the dandies and instead of its modest peak they caused to be added a long pipe of the material which they called a liripipe Every quaint thought and invention for tying up this liripipe was used they wound it about their heads and tucked the end into the coil they put it about their necks and left the end dangling they rolled it on to the top of their heads Illustration The countryman not behindhand in quaint ideas copied the form of a Bishop s hood and appeared with his cloth hood divided into two peaks one on either side of his head Illustration This new cotehardie was cut in several ways Strictly speaking it was a cloth or silk vest tight to the body and close over the hips the length was determined by the fancy of the wearer It also had influence on the long robes still worn which although full below the waist to the feet now more closely fitted the body and shoulders The fashionable sleeves were tight to the elbow and from there hanging and narrow showing a sleeve belonging to an undergarment The cloak also varied in shape The heavy travelling cloak with the hood attached was of the old pattern long shapeless with or without hanging sleeves loose at the neck or tightly buttoned Then there was a hooded cloak with short sleeves or with the sleeves cut right away a sort of hooded surcoat Then there were two distinct forms of cape one a plain circular cape not very deep which had a plain round narrow collar of fur or cloth and two or three buttons at the neck and there was the round cape without a collar but with turned back lapels of fur This form of cape is often to be seen The boots and shoes were longer at the toes and were sometimes buttoned at the sides The same form of hats remain but these were now treated with fur brims Round the waist there was always a belt generally of plain black leather from it depended a triangular pouch through which a dagger was sometimes stuck Illustration A MAN AND WOMAN OF THE TIME OF EDWARD II thirteen oh seven thirteen twenty seven Notice the great length of liripipe on the man s hood also his short tunic of rayed cloth his hanging sleeve and his under sleeve The woman has her hair dressed in two side plaits to which the gorget or neckcloth is pinned The time of parti coloured clothes was just beginning and the cotehardie was often made from two coloured materials dividing the body in two parts by the colour difference it was the commencement of the age which ran its course during the next reign when men were striped diagonally vertically and in angular bars when one leg was blue and the other red Illustration Illustration You will note that all work was improving in this reign when you hear that the King paid the wife of John de Bureford one hundred marks for an embroidered cope and that a great green hanging was procured for King s Hall London for solemn feasts a hanging of wool worked with figures of kings and beasts The ladies made little practical change in their dress except to wear an excess of clothes against the lack of draperies indulged in by the men It is possible to see three garments or portions of them in many dresses First there was a stuff gown with tight sleeves buttoned to the elbow from the wrist this sometimes showed one or two buttons under the gorget in front and was fitted but not tightly to the figure It fell in pleated folds to the feet and had a long train this was worn alone we may suppose in summer Second there was a gown to go over this other which had short wide sleeves and was full in the skirts One or other of these gowns had a train but if the upper gown had a train the under one had not and vice versa Third there was a surcoat like to a man s not over long or full with the sleeve holes cut out wide this went over both or either of the other gowns Illustration Upon the head they wore the wimple the fillet and about the throat the gorget The arrangement of the wimple and fillet were new for the hair was now plaited in two tails and these brought down straight on either side of the face the fillet was bound over the wimple in order to show the plait and the gorget met the wimple behind the plait instead of over it The older fashion of hair dressing remained and the gorget was pinned to the wads of hair over the ears without the covering of the wimple Sometimes the fillet was very wide and placed low on the head over a wimple tied like a gorget in this way the two side plaits showed only in front and appeared covered at side face while the wimple and broad fillet hid all the top hair of the head Very rarely a tall steeple head dress was worn over the wimple with a hanging veil but this was not common and indeed it is not a mark of the time but belongs more properly to a later date However I have seen such a head dress drawn at or about this time so must include it The semicircular mantle was still in use held over the breast by means of a silk cord It may seem that I describe these garments in too simple a way and the rigid antiquarian would have made comment on courtepys on gamboised garments on cloth of Gaunt or cloth of Dunster I may tell you that a gambeson was the quilted tunic worn under armour and for the sake of those whose tastes run into the arid fields of such research that you may call it wambasium gobison wambeys gambiex gaubeson or half a dozen other names but to my mind you will get no further with such knowledge Falding is an Irish frieze cyclas is a gown courtepy is a short gown kirtle again if we know too much we cannot be accurate kirtle may be a loose gown or an apron or a jacket or a riding cloak The tabard was an embroidered surcoat that is a surcoat on which was displayed the heraldic device of the owner Let us close this reign with its mournful end when Piers Gaveston feels the teeth of the Black Dog of Warwick and is beheaded on Blacklow Hill when Hugh le Despenser is hanged on a gibbet when the Queen lands at Orwell conspiring against her husband and the King is a prisoner at Kenilworth Here at Kenilworth the King hears himself deposed Edward once King of England is hereafter accounted a private person without any manner of royal dignity Here Edward in a plain black gown sees the steward of his household Sir Thomas Blount break his staff of office done only when a King is dead and discharge all persons engaged in the royal service Parliament decided to take this strong measure in January in the following September Edward was murdered in cold blood at Berkeley Castle EDWARD THE THIRD Reigned fifty years thirteen twenty seven thirteen seventy seven Born thirteen twelve Married thirteen twenty eight Philippa of Hainault THE MEN Kings were Kings in those days they managed England as a nobleman managed his estates Edward I during the year twelve ninety nine changed his abode on an average three times a fortnight visiting in one year seventy five towns and castles Edward II increased his travelling retinue until in the fourth year of the reign of Edward III the crowd who accompanied that King had grown to such proportions that he was forced to introduce a law forbidding knights and soldiers to bring their wives and families with them Edward III with his gay company would not be stopped as he rode out of one of the gates of London to pay toll of a penny a cart and a farthing a horse nor would any of his train This toll which included threepence a week on gravel and sand carts going in or out of the City was raised to help pay for street repairs the streets and roads of that time being in a continual state of slush mud and pits of water Let us imagine Edward III and his retinue passing over Wakefield Bridge before he reduced his enormous company The two priests William Kaye and William Bull stand waiting for the King outside the new Saint Mary s Chapel First come the guard of four and twenty archers in the King s livery then a Marshal and his servants the other King s Marshal has ridden by some twenty four hours ago then comes the Chancellor and his clerks and with them a good horse carrying the Rolls this was stopped in the fourth year of Edward s reign then they see the Chamberlain who will look to it that the King s rooms are decent and in order furnished with benches and carpets next comes the Wardrobe Master who keeps the King s accounts and riding beside the King the first personal officer of the kingdom the Seneschal after that a gay company of knights and their ladies merchants monks dressed as ordinary laymen for travelling soldiers of fortune women beggars minstrels a motley gang of brightly clothed people splashed with the mud and dust of the cavalcade Illustration Remembering the condition of the day the rough travelling the estates far apart the dirty inns one must not imagine this company spick and span The ladies are riding astride the gentlemen are in civil garments or half armour Let us suppose that it is summer and but an hour or so after a heavy shower The heat is oppressive the men have slung their hats at their belts and have pushed their hoods from their heads their heavy cloaks which they donned hastily against the rain are off now and hanging across their saddles These cloaks vary considerably in shape Here we may see a circular cloak split down the right side from the neck it buttons on the shoulder Here is another circular cloak jagged at the edge this buttons at the neck One man is riding in a cloak parti coloured which is more like a gown as it has a hood attached to it and reaches down to his feet Illustration Nearly every man is alike in one respect clean shaven with long hair to his neck curled at the ears and on the forehead Illustration Most men wear the cotehardie the well fitting garment buttoned down the front and ending over the hips There is every variety of cotehardie the long one coming nearly to the knees the short one half way up the thigh Some are buttoned all the way down the front and others only with two or three buttons at the neck Round the hips of every man is a leather belt from which hangs a pouch or purse Some of these purses are beautiful with stitched arabesque designs some have silver and enamel clasps some are plain black cloth or natural coloured leather nearly all however are black The hoods over the men s heads vary in a number of ways some are very full in the cape which is jagged at the hem some are close about the neck and are plain some have long liripipes falling from the peak of the hood and others have a liripipe of medium length There are two or three kinds of hat worn and felt and fur caps of the usual shape round with a rolled up brim and a little peak on the top Some of the hats are tall crowned round hats with a close thick brim these have strings through the brim so that the hat may be strung on the belt when it is not in use other hats are of the long peaked shape and now and again one may see a feather stuck into them a third variety shows the brim of a high crowned hat castellated Among the knights you will notice the general tendency to parti coloured clothes not only divided completely into halves of two colours but striped diagonally vertically and horizontally so giving a very diverse appearance to the mass of colour Here and there a man is riding in his silk surcoat which is embroidered with his coat of arms or powdered with his badge Here are cloth velvet silk and woollen stuffs all of fine dyes and here is some fine silk cotehardie with patterns upon it gilt in gold leaf and there is a magnificent piece of stuff rich in design from the looms of Palermo Among the merchants we shall see some more sober colours and quieter cut of clothes the archers in front are in leather tunics and these quiet colours in front and the respectable merchants behind enclose the brilliant blaze of colour round the King Behind all come the peasants minstrels mummers and wandering troupes of acrobats here is a bearward in worn leather cloak and hood his legs strapped at the ankle his shoes tied on with thongs here is a woman in a hood open at the neck and short at the back she wears a smocked apron here is a beggar with a hood of black stuff over his head a hood with two peaks one on either side of his head and again here is a minstrel with a patched round cloak and a mummer with a two peaked hood the peaks stuffed out stiff with bells jangling on the points of them Again among this last group we must notice the old fashioned loose tunics the coif over the head tied under the chin wooden soled shoes and pouch gloves Illustration There are some Norfolk merchants and some merchants from Flanders among the crowd and they talk as best they can in a sort of French Latin English jargon among themselves they speak of England as the great wool producing country the tax on which produced Lthirty thousand in one year they talk of the tax its uses and abuses and how Norfolk was proved the richest county in wool by the tax of thirteen forty one The people of England little thought to hear artillery used in a field of battle so soon as thirteen forty six when on August twenty six it was used for the first time nor did they realize the horrors that were to come in thirteen forty nine when the Great Plague was to sweep over England and kill half the population Illustration There is one man in this crowd who has been marked by everybody He is a courtier dressed in the height of fashion His cotehardie fits him very well the sleeves are tight from elbow to wrist as are the sleeves of most of his fellows some however still wear the hanging sleeve and show an under sleeve and his sleeve is buttoned from wrist to elbow He wears the newest fashion upon his arm the tippet a piece of silk which is made like a detachable cuff with a long streamer hanging from it his cotehardie is of medium length jagged at the bottom and it is of the finest Sicilian silk figured with a fine pattern round his hips he wears a jewelled belt His hood is parti coloured and jagged at the edge and round his face and his liripipe is very long His tights are parti coloured and his shoes buttoned up the front are long toed and are made of red and white chequered leather By him rides a knight also in the height of fashion but less noticeable he has his cotehardie skirt split up in front and turned back he has not any buttons on his sleeves and his belt about his waist holds a large square pouch his shoes are a little above his ankles and are buckled over the instep His hair is shorter than is usual and it is not curled Illustration As we observe these knights a party of armed knights come riding down the road towards the cavalcade they have come to greet the King These men have ridden through the rain and now as they come closer one can see that their armour is already red with rust Illustration So the picture should remain on your mind as I have imagined it for you the knights in armour and surcoats covered with their heraldic device the archers the gay crowd of knights in parti coloured clothes the King in his cotehardie of plain black velvet and his black beaver hat just as he looked after Calais in later years the merchants the servants in parti coloured liveries of their masters colours the tattered crowd behind and with the aid of the drawings you should be able to visualize the picture Meanwhile Edward will arrive at his destination and to soothe him before sleep he will read out of the book of romances illustrated by Isabella the nun of Aumbresbury for which he had paid Lsixty six thirteens fourd which sum was heavy for those days when Lsix would buy twenty four swans Lsixty six thirteens fourd is about Leight hundred of our money to day THE WOMEN I looked on my left half as the lady taught me And was aware of a woman worthily clothed Trimmed with fur the finest on earth Crowned with a crown the King had none better Handsomely her fingers were fretted with gold wire And thereon red rubies as red as any hot coal And diamonds of dearest price and double manner of sapphires Orientals and green beryls Her robe was full rich of red scarlet fast dyed With bands of red gold and of rich stones Her array ravished me such richness saw I never Piers the Plowman There are two manuscripts in existence the illuminations in which give the most wonderfully pictorial idea of this time they are the manuscript marked MS Bodl Misc two hundred sixty four in the Bodleian Library at Oxford and the Loutrell Psalter in the British Museum The Loutrell Psalter is indeed one of the most notable books in the world it is an example of illumination at the height of that art it has for illustrator a person not only of a high order of intelligence but a person possessed of the very spirit of Gothic humour who saw rural England not only with the eyes of an artist but with the eyes of a gossiping philosopher Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF EDWARD III thirteen twenty seven thirteen seventy seven Round his arms you will see the curious tippet the jagged ends of which hang down these are the remains of the pendant sleeves His shoes are buttoned in front Both this book and the book in the Bodleian Library were illustrated by persons who were charged to the brim with the spirit of their age they were Chaucerian in their gay good humour and in their quaint observation and they have that moral knowledge and outspoken manner which characterize William Langland whose Piers the Plowman I have quoted above With Chaucer Langland and these illuminators we have a complete exhibition of English life of these times The pulse of rural England is felt by them in a most remarkable way the religion language thought politics the whole trend of rural provincial and Court life may be gathered from their books The drawings in the Loutrell Psalter were completed before the year thirteen forty and they give us all that wonderful charm that intimate knowledge which we enjoy in the Canterbury Pilgrims and the Vision of Piers Plowman There seems to be something in road travelling which levels all humanity there is no road in England which does not throb with history there is no poem or story written about roads in England which does not in some way move the Englishness in us Chaucer and Langland make comrades of us as they move along the highway and with them we meet on terms of intimacy all the characters of the fourteenth century With these illuminators of the Loutrell Psalter and the Bodleian MS we see actually the stream of English life along a crowded thoroughfare In these books we may see drawings of every form of agricultural life and manorial existence we see the country sports the bear baiting and the cock fighting we see the harvesters with straw hats scythes and reaping hooks we see carters carriers and great carriages all depicted in a manner which we can only compare in later years to the broad humour of Hogarth and as we turn the priceless pages over the whole fourteenth century world passes before our eyes japers and jugglers disours and jesters monk priest pilgrim and pardoner spendthrift and wench hermits good and evil lords ladies and Kings I have written of the men and their dress how they were often very often dirty dusty and travel stained of the red rusted armour and the striped and chequered clothes and now I must write of the women and the manner of their dress Of the time you must remember that it was the time of chivalry when there was a Round Table of Knights at Windsor founded in thirteen forty five when the Order of the Garter was founded when tiltings and all manner of tournaments were at their height and you listen to the minstrels of King Edward s household playing upon the trumpet the cytole the pipe the taberet the clarion and the fiddle saint George the Primate of Egypt in the fourth century had now risen to public esteem and notice so that he became in this time not only the patron saint of chivalry but the tutelar saint of England Boys were taken from the care of the ladies of the household at the age of seven when they became pages to knights and were sworn to devote themselves to the graces and favours of some girl At fourteen the boy became a squire and at twenty one if he were possessed of a rental of Ltwenty a year in land he made his fast and vigil and was afterward dubbed knight and given his spurs Illustration The noteworthy point about a woman of this reign was her hair The Queen herself wore an elaborate mode of coiffure for that time she wore a metal fillet round her head to which was attached two cases circular in shape of gold fretwork ornamented with precious stones She wore her hair unplaited and brought in two parts from the back of her head and as far as one can see pushed into the jewelled cases Illustration The most general form of hair dressing was an excess on the mode of the previous reign a richness of jewel work an abundance of gold wire It was usual to divide the hair into two plaits and arrange these on either side of the face holding them in their place by means of a fillet they might be worn folded straight up by the face or at an angle but they were never left hanging if hair was left loose it was not plaited but flowing The gorget or throat cloth was still in general use and it was attached to the hair by very elaborate headed pins Sometimes the hair dressed with the gorget was divided into four plaits two on either side of the face and fastened horizontally The wimple of silk or linen was very generally worn A caul of gold net came into fashion but not until the end of the reign The ladies were great upon hunting and hawking and this must have been a convenient fashion to keep the hair in order Some wore a white silk or linen cap so shaped as to include and cover the two side plaits and combine a gorget and wimple in one Pointed frontals of pearls were worn across the forehead and fillets of silk or linen were so tied that long ends hung down the back Illustration Yellow hair was much esteemed and ladies who were not favoured by Nature brought saffron to their aid and by such efforts brought Nature into line with Art There was the general custom of wearing the surcoat in imitation of the men a garment I have described frequently a slightly fitting garment without sleeves you will see how this grew later into a gorgeous affair These surcoats were sometimes of fine cloth of gold covered with an intricate delicate pattern in which beasts birds and foliage mingled in arabesque Under this surcoat was a plainer better fitting garment made sometimes of the barred and rayed material so common to the men or of velvet cloth or silk in plain colours green and red being then very favourite ermines and many other furs were used to border these gowns Sometimes you may see that this gown had sleeves short at the elbow exposing a different coloured under sleeve buttoned from elbow to wrist at other times in fact among all fashionable persons the curious fashion of the tippet or long streamer was worn I have carefully described this fashion in the previous chapter Illustration The plain gown with tight sleeves was most in use and the skirts of this gown were very voluminous and had either pockets or holes in the front of them the holes enabled the wearer to reach the purse hanging from a girdle which encircled the waist of the under dress These gowns were generally buttoned in front from neck to waist or they were laced They also wore a heavier gown which reached just below the knee showing the skirts of the under gown the heavy gowns were often fur lined and had loose wide sleeves to the elbow There was at this time a curious fur or cloth cape in use longer behind than in front in fact it varied with the taste of the owner It was cut in even scallops all round I say even to show that they were sewn edged not jagged and rough edged Any pair of these scallops might be longer than any other pair Ladies wore these capes for hunting and ornamented the ends with bells The shoes of the women were not very exaggerated in length but as a rule fitted well to the foot and came out in a slight point You may use for this reign shoes buckled across the instep laced at the side or buttoned up the front For riding and sport the ladies wore the hood and sometimes a broad round hat over it or the peaked hat The countrywoman wore an ill fitting gown with tight sleeves an apron and an open hood Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF EDWARD III thirteen twenty seven thirteen seventy seven You will notice that the woman also wears the tippet on her arm The gorget is high about her neck and is held up by pins to her plaited hair Imagine London in the year of the third great pestilence thirteen sixty nine It is October and the worst of the pestilence is over John Chichester the Mayor is riding through the streets about some great affairs many knights and ladies pass by It is raining hard after the long drought of the summer but despite the rain many citizens are abroad to see the doings in the City and one may see the bright parti coloured clothes of the lords and ladies and here and there as a cloak is blown back a glimpse of rich patterned cloth of gold Perhaps Will Langland Long Will a gaunt man of thirty seven is brushing past a young man of twenty nine Chaucer going to his work Silk dresses and frieze gowns velvet and homespun hurry along as the rain falls more heavily and after a while the street becomes quite deserted Then nothing but the dreary monotony of the rain falling from the gables will come to the room of the knight s lady as she lies sick of small pox John de Gaddesden the King s doctor has prescribed for her that she must lie clothed in scarlet red in a room of that colour with bed hangings of that same colour and so she must lie without much comfort while the raindrops falling down the wide chimney drip on the logs in the fire and make them hiss RICHARD THE SECOND Reigned twenty two years thirteen seventy seven thirteen ninety nine Born thirteen sixty six Married thirteen eighty one Anne of Bohemia thirteen ninety five Isabella of France THE MEN The King himself was a leader of fashion he had by grace of Nature the form face and manner which go to make a dandy The nobles followed the King the merchants followed the nobles after their kind the peasants were still clothed in the simplest of garments having retained the Norman tunic with the sleeves pushed back over the wrist kept the loose boots and straw gaiters and showed the improvement in their class by the innovation of gloves made as a thumb with a pouch for the fingers and pouches for money of cloth and leather hung on a leather belt This proved the peasant to be a man of some substance by need of his wallet Everyone wore the chaperon a cap and cape combined We have now arrived at the reign which made such a difference to the labourer and workman such as the blacksmith and miller and in consequence altered and improved the character of his clothes The poll tax of thirteen eighty brought the labourer into individual notice for the first time and thus arose the free labourer in England and the first labour pamphlets We have two word pictures of the times of the greatest value for they show both sides of the coin the one by the courtly and comfortable Chaucer the other by Long Will William Langland or Piers the Plowman Picture the two along the Strand Long Will singing his dirges for hire and Chaucer his hand full of parchments bustling past One must remember that as always many people dressed out of the fashion that many men still wore the cotehardie a well fitting garment reaching half way down the thigh with tight sleeves coming over the hand decorated with buttons under the sleeve from the elbow to the little finger This garment had a belt which was placed round the hips and this was adorned in many ways principally it was composed of square pieces of metal joined together either of silver or enamel in copper or of gold set with precious stones Illustration Illustration The cotehardie was generally made of a pied cloth in horizontal or diagonal bars in silk or other rich fabric With this garment the chaperon to be more fully described was worn as a hood the legs were in tights and the feet in pointed shoes a little longer than the foot A pouch or wallet depended from the belt and a sheath containing two daggers an anelace and a misericorde The pouch was a very rich affair often of stamped gilded leather or sewn velvet ornamented in fact according to the purse of the wearer In winter such a man as he of the cotehardie would wear an overcoat with an attached hood This coat was made in various forms one form with wide sleeves the same width all the way down under which were slits in the coat to enable the wearer to place his hands inside as in the modern Raglan coat pocket Another form was made very loose and without sleeves but with the same slits at the side it was buckled round the waist on occasion by a broad leather belt very plain The common heavy travelling coat was made in this way and it was only the very fashionable who wore the houppelande for riding or travelling Sometimes such a man would wear in winter about the town a cloak fastened over the right shoulder with three or four buttons leaving the right arm free such a cloak is seen in the brass of Robert Attelathe Mayor of Lynn Illustration In travelling our gentleman would wear often in addition to his chaperon a peaked hat of cloth high in the crown with a brim turned up all round ending in a long peak in front the same hat that we always associate with Dick Whittington His gloves would be of leather often ornamented with designs on the back or if he were a knight with his badge On this occasion he would wear his sword in a baldric a long belt over his right shoulder and under his left arm from which hung also his daggers Although I am not dealing even with personal arms one must remember in representing these people that daggers were almost as necessary a part of dress as boots or shoes and that personal comfort often depended upon a skilful use of that natty weapon the misericorde was used to give the coup de grace The farmer in harvest time wore if he did not wear a hood a peaked hat or a round large brimmed straw hat Illustration The Houppelande or Pelicon We may now arrive at the fashionable man whose eccentricities in clothes were the object of much comment How the houppelande or pelicon actually was originated I do not know but it came about that men suddenly began to clothe themselves in this voluminous and awkward garment It was a long loose fitting robe made to fit on the shoulders only having very long loose sleeves varying according to the whim of the owner These sleeves were cut at the edges into the forms of leaves or other designs and were lined as the houppelande with fur or silk It will be seen that such a garment to suit all weathers and temperatures must be made of various materials and lined accordingly These materials were almost invariably powdered with badges or some other device sometimes with a flowing pattern embracing an heraldic design or motto The sleeves turned back disclosed the sleeve of a cotehardie underneath with the little buttons running from the elbow to the first knuckle of the little finger The houppelande had a very high collar coming well up to the middle of the back of the head it was buttoned up to the chin in front and the collar was often turned down half way the two top buttons being left undone It was fastened about the middle by a thin leather belt very long this was buckled and the long end turned under and brought over to hang down the end was ornamented with many devices figures of saints heraldic figures or other ornaments Sometimes the entire belt was sewn with small devices in precious metal or enamels Now to be in the height of fashion one either wore the houppelande extremely long in the skirt or extremely short so short in fact as to leave but a frill of it remaining below the waist leaving the sleeves still their abnormal length Pretty fads as tying a dagger round the neck or allowing it to hang low between the legs or placing it in the small of the back were much in vogue Illustration Every form of beard or moustache was used and the hair was worn long to the nape of the neck By the dandy it was elaborately pressed and curled at the ends Bands of real or artificial flowers encircled the heads of the dandies the artificial flowers made in enamels or gold Rings were worn of great size on thumb and finger long staffs with elaborate heads were carried Under the houppelande was the skirt and the cotehardie of thin material and on the legs hose pied or powdered made of silk or cloth cut to the form and sewn Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF RICHARD II thirteen seventy seven thirteen ninety nine His chaperon or hood is twisted and tied about his head with the liripipe the elongated peak of his hood thrown over his shoulders The shoes were of great length with long points rarely we find examples of the absurd fashion of wearing the points so long that they were tied back to the knees but often they were so long that the points came out six inches beyond the toe They were made of every material sewn with pearls on cloth or velvet stamped with gold on leather or the leather raised The toes were sometimes stuffed hard sometimes allowed to hang limp For walking in the streets high clogs of wood were used made with long pointed ends to support the shoes I may add that the hose were gartered below the knee to hold them taut with rich garters but if a man were a Garter Knight he wore but the garter of his Order Illustration Much in favour with this court of gallants were rich chains about the neck having for pendant their badge or some saint s figure in gold or silver Illustration Now we come to the most interesting and universal fashion of wearing the chaperon which I am anxious to show in its various stages It began with a cape and a hood worn separately these were joined for convenience so that a man might put on both at once This fashion held for many years and then the fashionable man in search of novelty caused the peak of the hood to be lengthened until it grew to reach to his feet Then he cast about for a fresh mode for his head wear and so he twisted the whole affair about his head leaving the end of the cape which was jagged at the edge protruding like a cockscomb Time went on and he avoided the trouble of tying this himself so he had the hat made up all ready tied much in the manner of a turban Finally the chaperon grew into disuse and it remains to day a curious reminder in the cockade worn by coachmen it is almost a replica in miniature with the round twist and the jagged edge sticking up above the hat and on the cloaks of the Knights of the Garter where it is carefully made and forms a cape on the right shoulder and in the present head dress of the French lawyer a relic of the Middle Ages The chains worn about the neck remain as badges of office in Mayors and Judges and in various Orders The button worn by the members of the Legion of Honour and other foreign Orders is I believe an idea resulting from the cockade which of course was at the beginning the chaperon in the colours of the servant s lord Illustration When one knows a custom so well one is apt to leave out many things in describing it For example the houppelande was open from the bottom of the skirt to the knee in front or at the side and this opening was often cut or jagged into shapes also it was open all the way up the side of the leg and from the neck to the breast and buttoned over I have not remarked on the jester a member of many households who wore an exaggeration of the prevalent costume to which bells were attached at all points So was much good cloth wasted in vanity and much excellent time spent upon superfluities to the harm of the people perhaps useful enough to please the eye which must have been regaled with all these men in wonderful colours strutting peacockwise Illustration The poor peasant who found cloth becoming very dear cared not one jot or tittle for the feast of the eye feeling a certain unreasonable hunger elsewhere And so over the wardrobe of Dandy Richard stepped Henry backed by the people THE WOMEN If ever women were led by the nose by the demon of fashion it was at this time Not only were their clothes ill suited to them but they abused that crowning glory their hair No doubt a charming woman is always charming be she dressed by woad or worth but to be captivating with your eyebrows plucked out and with the hair that grows so prettily low on the back of the neck shaved away was it possible I expect it was Illustration The days of high hennins was yet to come the day of simple hair dressing was nearly dead and in the interval were all the arts of the cunning devoted to the guimpe the gorgieres the mentonnieres the voluminous escoffions Illustration At this time the lady wore her hair long and hanging freely over her shoulders her brows were encircled by a chaplet or chapel of flowers real or artificial or by a crown or plain circlet of gold or she tucked all her hair away under a tight caul a bag of gold net enriched with precious stones To dress hair in this manner it was first necessary to plait it in tight plaits and bind them round the head then to cover this with a wimple which fell over the back of the neck and over this to place the caul or as it was sometimes called the dorelet Now and again the caul was worn without the wimple and this left the back of the neck exposed from this all the hair was plucked Illustration For outdoor exercises the lady would wear the chaperon explained in the previous chapter and upon this the peaked hat The poorer woman wore always the hood the wimple tied under the chin or plain plaited hair One must remember always that the advance of costume only affected the upper classes in the towns and that the knight s lady in the country was often fifty years behind the times in her gowns As an instance of this I give the fur tippet hung with bells used when hawking Illustration In the early part of the reign the cotehardie was the universal woman s garment It was made in two ways the one a simple well fitting garment skirts and bodice in one buttoned in front with neck well open the skirts ample and long the sleeves over the hands to the first joints of the fingers and ornamented with buttons from the elbow to the little finger this was the general form of the garment for all degrees of rank The lady enriched this with a belt like a man s narrow in width round the waist with hanging end or broad round the hips and richly ornamented The other form of cotehardie was exactly as the man s ending short below the hips under which was worn the petticoat Illustration The winter addition to these was the surcoat as usually worn by a knight over his armour this was often lined with fur The surcoat was a long garment without sleeves and with a split down the sides from the shoulder to the top of the thigh through this split was seen the cotehardie and the hip belt The edges were trimmed with fur and very frequently ornamental buttons were worn down the front Over the shoulders was the cloak left open in front and fastened by means of a cord of rich substance passing through two loops in the backs of large ornamental studs this cord was as a rule knotted at the waist the ends hanging down as tassels Illustration Later in the reign when the second Queen of Richard had brought over many rich fashions the ladies adopted the houppelande with its heavy collar and wide hanging sleeves Every lady and most women carried a purse in the hand or on the girdle ornamented according to their station The merchant s wife wore in common with her maids a white apron The child who was spinning a peg top in the street was simply dressed in a short skirted cotehardie Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF RICHARD II thirteen seventy seven thirteen ninety nine Her loose surcoat is cut away to show her under dress Her hair is completely hidden by her jewelled caul For riding and sport the woman was dressed almost exactly as a man with houppelande or heavy cloak buttoned on the right shoulder hawking glove on her left hand with a bell or metal ball depending from it She wore boots laced up at the side or long boots of soft leather fastened with hook and eye shoes like a man s but not so pointed and extreme Sometimes for riding a big round hat was worn over a hood In many cases the dresses were powdered with the monogram of the Blessed Virgin with badges of the family or some small device or they were ornamented with a simple flowing pattern or were plain All the fripperies of fashion lay in pins for the wimple the head made as a figure of a patron saint or girdles rich with precious stones or mirror cases on whose ivory fronts were carved the Castle of Love or hunting scenes or Calvary The clasps of purses were rich in design and rings of every kind were worn on every finger and upon the thumb Charms against evil were hung about the neck or sewn into the clothes No matter who wrote passed and practised the many sumptuary laws still one may know it to have been frequent for persons owning less than Ltwenty a year to wear gold and silver ornaments although expressly forbidden and ladies of a lower estate than wives of knights banneret wore cloth of gold and velvet and gowns that reached and trailed upon the ground while their husbands braved it in ermine and marten lined sleeves which swept the road The custom of wearing crowns was common to all people of rank as heraldic distinction of crowns did not commence until the sixteenth century What a magnificent time for colour was this reign the rich houppelandes the furs the long piked shoes with pearls and gold upon them the massive chains about men s necks ladies whose heads shone with rich caps and cauls of pearl embroidered gold the rich sheathed baselard stuck in the girdle or hanging from it on a silver chain Even the poor begging friar was touched by all this finery and forgetful of the rules of Saint Francis he made great haste to convert his alms into a furred cote cutted to the knee and quaintly buttoned hose in hard weather fastened at the ankle and buckled shoes Imagine that amazing woman the Wife of Bath in her great hat and pound weight kerchief the carpenter s wife in her gored apron at her girdle a purse of leather hanging decorated with silk tassels and buttons of metal It is almost impossible to describe clearly the head dresses the great gold net bags which encased the hair for they were ornamented in such different ways always or nearly always following some pattern in diaper in contrast to the patterns which came later when the design followed such lines as are formed by wire netting while later still the connecting thread of the patterns was done away with and the inside decoration alone remained Well Richard the King no longer can whistle to Matthew his favourite greyhound and Anne the Queen lies stately in the Abbey at Westminster without solace of her little lap dog but we are not all modern in our ways and ladies hang charms about them from scarabs to queer evil eye coral hands from silver shoes to month stones Crowns of flowers have been worn and crowns of jewels too just as men and women wore them then except on Fridays and the eves of fetes These things we do and other ancient things beside but let us hope that Fashion has lost her cruel mood and deems it wise to leave our ladies eyebrows where they be nor schemes to inspire her faithful devotees with mad desires to hide their hair and shave their napes The crinoline is threatened let it come sandals are here with short hair and the simple life but leave me I pray thee royal dame an eyebrow on my lady if only to give occupation to the love lorn sonneteer THE END OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY Illustration Chaucer In the last year of the fourteenth century there were still living two men whose voices have made the century live for us One of them Chaucer remains to day the father of English poetry the forerunner of Shakespeare the other Gower less known to most of us was the author of three long poems Speculum Meditantis in French Vox Clamantis in Latin Confessio Amantis in English Boccaccio had written his Decameron and it was this method of writing a series of poems or stories by means of connecting links of narrative that should run through the series that inspired the form of the Confessio Amantis and the Canterbury Tales indeed many stories in both of these works are retold out of the Decameron Gower wrote of his age as a man giving advice philosophically he did not attempt character studies but framed his poems as narratives with morals fit for application to his times Chaucer drew his characters clearly so clearly that they have become as living as have Uncle Toby or missus Gamp symbolic people embracing a type of national character A third writer Langland pictured his age from the poor man s point of view and the three writers together with the artist of the Loutrell Psalter bring the age most vividly to our eyes Of course in these days of hasty work it seems hardly feasible to suggest that artists who would illustrate these times should read the works of these three men and go to the British Museum to look at the Psalter but any writer must do this and can do this considering that the works of the poets are cheap to obtain and the British Museum is free to all Anyone wishing to picture these times will find that Chaucer has written very carefully of the costume of his Pilgrims They will find the pith of the costume in this book of mine but since no book is complete in every sense they should see for themselves how men of the day drew the costume they saw about them It will give them a sense of the spirit of the age which so many modern drawings lack I give you Gower s picture of an exquisite no words of mine could show so well the manner of the man And therof thenketh he but a lite For all his lust is to delite In newe thinges proude and veine Als ferforth as he may atteine I trowe if that he mighte make His body newe he wolde take A newe form and leve his olde For what thing that he may behold The which to common use is straunge Anone his olde guise chaunge He woll and falle therupon Lich unto the camelion Whiche upon every sondry hewe That he beholt he mote newe His coloun and thus unavised Full ofte time he stand desguised More jolif than the brid in Maie He maketh him ever fressh and gaie And doth all his array desguise So that of him the newe guise Of lusty folke all other take Now if I have described the costume of these times clearly and I think I have done so these lines should conjure up a gay fellow with his many changes of dress If the vision fails then allow me to say that you are at fault and have taken no pains with the description Because the coloured drawing to the chapter of Richard II shows a long houppelande and a chaperon tied in a certain way you will very possibly forget that this dandy would have also a short houppelande differently jagged sleeves more ruffle about the twisting of his chaperon more curve to the points of his shoes You may see the image of Gower for yourself in saint Mary Overies Church now called saint Saviour s on the Southwark side of London Bridge He is dressed in his sober black his head resting upon his three books In thirteen ninety seven Gower retired from active life and resigned his Rectory of Great Braxted Essex he was seventy years of age and at that age he married Agnes Groundolf in a chapel of his own under the rooms where he lived in the Priory of saint Mary Overies In fourteen hundred his friend Chaucer died and Gower went blind He died in fourteen oh eight Chaucer whose eyes saw England in her greatness after the Battle of Crecy in thirteen forty six and in her pitiful state at the downfall of Richard II saw such a pageant of clothes pass before him that in describing those wonderful national types his Canterbury Pilgrims he marks each one with some hint of array that we may know what manner of habit was proper to them Here then is a list of the clothes he pictured them as wearing Illustration THE KNIGHT wears a fustian doublet all rust stained by his coat of mail It is interesting to note how old fashioned is the character of this verray parfit gentil knight for he belongs more rightly to the chivalrous time of the first half of Edward III s reign rather than to the less gentle time of Richard Illustration THE SQUIRE His locks were curled as they were leyed in presse His short gown with wide sleeves was covered with embroidery of red and white flowers THE YEOMAN is in a coat and hood of green He has a sheaf of peacock arrows in his belt across his shoulder is a green baldrick to carry a horn There is a figure of saint Christopher in silver hanging on his breast THE PRIORESS is in a handsome cloak she wears coral beads gauded with green and a brooch of gold On which was first write a crowned A And after Amor vincit omnia THE MONK wears his gown but has his sleeves trimmed with gray squirrel To fasten his hood he has a curious gold pin wrought at the greater end with a love knot THE FRIAR has his cape stuck full of knives and pins for to yeven faire wyves THE MERCHANT is in a motley of colours parti coloured His beard is forked upon his head is a Flaunderish beaver hat His boots are elegantly clasped THE CLERK wears a threadbare tunic Illustration THE MAN OF LAW is in a coat of parti colours his belt of silk with small metal bars on it THE FRANKELEYN OR COUNTRY GENTLEMAN has a white silk purse and a two edged dagger or akelace at his girdle Then come the HABERDASHER the CARPENTER the WEAVER the DYER and the TAPESTRY WORKER all in the livery of their companies They all carry pouches girdles and knives mounted in silver THE SHIPMAN is in a gown of falding a coarse cloth reaching to his knees A dagger is under his arm on a lace hanging round his neck THE DOCTOR wears a gown of red and blue pers was a blue cloth lined with taffeta and sendal Illustration THE WIFE OF BATH Her wimples of fine linen I dorste swere they weyeden ten pound That on a Sonday were upon hir heed Her hose was of fine scarlet red her shoes were moist and new Her hat was as broad as a buckler and she wore a foot mantle about her hips THE PLOUGHMAN wears a tabard a loose smock without sleeves THE REVE OR STEWARD wears a long surcoat of blue cloth pers THE SOMNOUR an officer who summoned persons before the ecclesiastical courts wears on his head a garland as greet as it were for an ale stake Illustration THE PARDONER has long yellow hair falling about his shoulders his hood is turned back and he wears a tall cap on which is sewn a Vernicle This is the handkerchief of saint Veronica on which there was an impression of our Lord s face This completes the list of Pilgrims but it will be useful to give a few more descriptions of dress as described by Chaucer The Carpenter s wife in the Miller s Tale is described Fair was this yonge wyf and ther with al As any wesele hir body gent slim and small A ceynt belt she werede barred al of silk A barneclooth apron eek as whyt as morne milk Upon hir lendes loins ful of many a gore Whyt was hir smok and brouded al before And eek behinde on hir coler aboute Of colonel blak silk within and eek withoute The tapes of his whyte voluper a cap Were of the same suyte of hir coler Hir filet broad of silk and set ful hye And by hir girdel heeng a purs of lether Tasseld with silk and perked with latoun a compound of copper and zinc A brooch she bare upon hir lowe coler As broad as is the bos of a buckler Her shoes were laced on hir legges hye Here also from the Parson s Tale is a sermon against the vain clothing of his time that will serve to show how you may best paint this age and to what excess of imagination you may run I have reduced the wording into more modern English As to the first sin that is in superfluitee of clothing which that maketh it so dere to the harm of the people not only the cost of embroidering the elaborate endenting or barring ornamenting with waved lines paling winding or bending and semblable waste of cloth in vanity but there is also costly furring in their gowns so muche pounching of chisels to make holes so much dagging of shears forthwith the superfluity in the length of the foresaid gowns trailing in the dung and the mire on horse and eek on foot as well of man as of woman that all this trailing is verily as in effect wasted consumed threadbare and rotten with dung rather than it is given to the poor to great damage of the aforesaid poor folk Upon the other side to speak of the horrible disordinate scantiness of clothing as be this cutted sloppes or hainselins short jackets that through their shortness do not cover the shameful members of man to wicked intent After this the good Parson rising to a magnificent torrent of wrathful words makes use of such homely expressions that should move the hearts of his hearers words which in our day are not seemly to our artificial and refined palates Further Chaucer remarks upon the devices of love knots upon clothes which he calls amorettes on trimmed clothes as being apyked on nearly all the fads and fashions of his time It is to Chaucer and such pictures as he presents that our minds turn when we think vaguely of the Middle Ages and it is worth our careful study if we wish to appreciate the times to the full to read no matter the hard spelling the Vision of Piers the Plowman by Langland I have drawn a few of the Pilgrims in order to show that they may be reconstructed by reading the chapters on the fourteenth century HENRY THE FOURTH Reigned fourteen years thirteen ninety nine fourteen thirteen Born thirteen sixty six Married thirteen eighty Mary de Bohun fourteen oh three Joan of Navarre THE MEN AND WOMEN The reign opens sombrely enough Richard in prison and twenty five suits of cloth of gold left among other of his butterfly raiment in Haverford Castle We are still in the age of the houppelande the time of cut edges jagging big sleeves and trailing gowns Our fine gentlemen take the air in the long loose gown or the short edition of the same with the skirts cut from it They have invented or the tailor has invented or necessity has contrived a new sleeve It is a bag sleeve very full and fine enormous at the elbow tight at the wrist where it may fall over the hand in a wide cuff with dagged edges or it may end in a plain band Illustration A MAN AND WOMAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY IV thirteen ninety nine fourteen thirteen Very little change in dress the man in the loose gown called the houppelande The woman also in a houppelande Let us take six gentlemen met together to learn the old thirteenth century part song the round entitled Sumer is icumen in Illustration The first maybe is in the high collared houppelande with the long skirts his sleeves are of a different colour to his gown and are fastened to it under cut epaulettes at his shoulders he wears a baldrick hung with bells over his shoulder his houppelande is split on one side to show his parti coloured hose beyond his knee his shoes are long and very pointed his hair is cut short and he wears a twisted roll of stuff round his head The second is in the latest mode he wears the voluminous sleeves which end in a plain band at his wrist and these sleeves are of a different colour to his houppelande the skirts of which are cut short at the knee and then are cut into neat dags This garment is not so full as that of the first gentleman which is gathered in at the waist by a long tongued belt but is buttoned down the front to the waist and is full in the skirt also it has no collar This man wears his hair long and curled at the nape of his neck Illustration A third of these gentlemen a big burly man is in a very short tunic with wide sleeves his tights are of two colours his left leg red his right blue Over his tunic he wears a quilted waistcoat the collar and armholes of which are trimmed with fur Illustration A fourth wears a loose houppelande one half of which is blue and the other half black it is buttoned from throat to foot the sleeves are wide His hair is long and his beard is brushed into two points Illustration Illustration The fifth gentleman wears a houppelande of middle length with a very high collar buttoned up the neck the two top buttons being undone the top of the collar rolls over He has the epaulette but instead of showing the very full bag sleeves he shows a little loose sleeve to the elbow and a tight sleeve from the elbow to the hand where it forms a cuff He wears a very new fashioned cap like a stiff sugar bag with the top lopping over Illustration The sixth and last of this group is wearing an unbound houppelande that is he wears no belt He wears a plain hood which is over his head and a soft loose peaked hat Sumer is icumen in the six sing out and the shepherd who can hear them from outside is considering whether he can play the air upon his pipe He is dressed in a loose tunic a hood and a wide brimmed straw hat his pipe is stuck in his belt Let us suppose that the wives of the six gentlemen are seated listening to the manly voices of their lords The first wears a dress of blue which is laced from the opening to the waist where the laces are tied in a neat bow and hang down Her dress is cut fairly low it has tight sleeves which come over her hands to the knuckles in tight cuffs There is a wide border about a foot and a half of ermine on the skirt of her dress She wears a mantle over her shoulders Her hair is enclosed in a stiff square caul of gold wire over cloth of gold Illustration The second lady is wearing a houppelande with wide hanging sleeves all cut at the edge the cut of this gown is loose except that it fits across her shoulders she also wears a caul from the back of which emerges a linen wimple The third lady is in surcoat and cotehardie the surcoat has a pleated skirt and the borders of it are edged thickly with fur it is cut low enough at the sides to show a belt over the hips The cotehardie of a different colour to the surcoat has tight sleeves with buttons from elbow to little finger This lady has her hair cut short at the nape of her neck and bound about the brows with a golden circlet Illustration A fourth wears a very loose houppelande encircled about the waist with a broad belt the tongue of which hangs down and has an ornamented end This houppelande falls in great folds from the neck to the feet and is gathered into the neck it has loose but not wide sleeves falling just below the elbow The gown is worn over a cotehardie the sleeves of which show through the other sleeves and the skirt of which shows when the gown skirt is gathered up Illustration The fifth lady also wears a cotehardie with a skirt to it she wears over it a circular mantle buttoned by three buttons on the right shoulder and split from there to the edge on both sides showing the dress the front semicircle of the cloak is held to the waist by a belt so that the back hangs loose Her hair is in a caul The sixth is in a very plain dress tight fitting buttoned in front with full skirts She wears a white linen hood which shows the shape of the caul in which her hair is imprisoned So is this queer old round sung Sumer is icumen in Afterwards perhaps one of these ladies wishing to get some spite against one of the gentlemen will ride away in a heavy riding cloak the hood over her head and a peaked hat on that and she will call upon a witch The witch will answer the rapping at her humble door and will come out dressed in a country dress just an ill fitting gown and hood with some attempt at classical ornament on the gown or a cloak sewn with the sacred initials thrown over her back These two will bargain awhile for the price of a leaden image to be made in the likeness of the ill fated gentleman or rather a rough figure on which his name will be scratched then the puppet will be cast into the fire and melted while certain evil charms are spoken and the malicious accident required to befall him will be spoken aloud for the Devil s private ear Possibly some woman sought a witch near Evesham in the year fourteen ten and bought certain intentions against a tailor of that place Badby by name for this much is certain that the tailor was burnt for Lollardy ten years after the first victim for Lollard heresy William Sawtre HENRY THE FIFTH Reigned nine years fourteen thirteen fourteen twenty two Born thirteen eighty eight Married fourteen twenty Katherine of France THE MEN Illustration I think I may call this a transitional period of clothes for it contains the ragged ends of the time of Richard II and the old clothes of the time of Henry IV and it contains the germs of a definite fashion a marked change which came out of the chrysalis stage and showed itself in the prosperous butterflies of the sixth Henry s time We retain the houppelande its curtailments its exaggerations its high and low collar its plain or jagged sleeves We retain the long hair which busheth pleasauntlie and the short hair of the previous reign Also we see the new ideas for the priest cropped hair and the roundlet hat I speak of the men only It was as if in the press of French affairs man had but time to ransack his grandfather s and his father s chests and from thence to pull out a garment or two at a venture If the garment was a little worn in the upper part of the sleeve he had a slash made there and embroidered it round If the baldrick hung with bells was worn out in parts he cut those pieces away and turned the baldrick into a belt If the skirts of the houppelande were sadly frayed at the edge enter Scissors again to cut them off short perhaps the sleeves were good well leave them on perhaps the skirts were good and the sleeves soiled well cut out the sleeves and pop in some of his father s bag sleeves Mind you my honest gentleman had trouble brewing no sooner had he left the wars in Normandy and Guienne than the siege of Harfleur loomed to his vision and after that Agincourt Agincourt where unarmoured men prevailed over mailed knights at the odds of six to one Agincourt where archers beat the great knights of France on open ground Hear them hammer on the French armour with their steel mallets while the Frenchmen weighed down with their armour sank knee deep in the mud where we lost one hundred men against the French loss of ten thousand Illustration A Belt with Bells See the port of Le Havre with the English army landed there Henry in his full sleeved gown his hair cropped close and shaven round his head from his neck to an inch above his ears buskins on his feet for he wore buskins in preference to long boots or pointed shoes The ships in the harbour are painted in gay colours red blue in stripes in squares the sails are sewn with armorial bearings or some device Some of our gentlemen are wearing open houppelandes over their armour some wear the stuffed turban on their heads with a jewelled brooch stuck in it some wear the sugar bag cap which falls to one side some are hooded others wear peaked hats One hears By halidom I wonder if all the many many people who have hastily written historical novels of this age and have peppered them with By halidoms knew that By halidom means By the relics of the saints and that an harlote means a man who was a buffoon who told ribald stories Illustration The Turban Still among all these gentlemen clothed as it were second hand we have the fine fellow the dandy he to whom dress is a religion to whom stuffs are sonnets cuts are lyrical and tailors are the poets of their age Such a man will have his tunic neatly pleated rejecting the chance folds of the easy fitting houppelande the folds of which were determined by the buckling of the belt His folds will be regular and precise his collar will be very stiff with a rolled top his hose will be of two colours one to each leg or parti coloured His shoes will match his hose and be of two colours his turban hat will be cocked at a jaunty angle his sleeves will be of a monstrous length and width He will hang a chain about his neck and load his fingers with rings A fellow to him one of his own kidney will wear the skirt of his tunic a little longer and will cause it to be cut up the middle his sleeves will not be pendant like drooping wings but will be swollen like full blown bagpipes An inner sleeve very finely embroidered will peep under the upper cuff His collar is done away with but he wears a little hood with cut edges about his neck his hair is cropped in the new manner like a priest s without a tonsure his hat is of the queer sugar bag shape and it flops in a drowsy elegance over the stuffed brim As for his shoes they are two fingers long beyond his toes Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY V fourteen thirteen fourteen twenty two Notice the bag cap with a jewel stuck in it We shall see the fashions of the two past reigns hopelessly garbled cobbled and stitched together a sleeve from one a skirt from another Men at arms in short tunics of leather and quilted waistcoats to wear under their half armour beggars in fashions dating from the eleventh century a great mass of people in undistinguishable attire looking mostly like voluminous cloaks on spindle legs or mere bundles of drapery here and there a sober gentleman in a houppelande of the simplest kind with wide skirts reaching to his feet and the belt with the long tongue about his middle The patterns upon the dresses of these people are heraldry contortions heraldic beasts intertwined in screws and twists of conventional foliage griffins and black dogs held by floral chains to architectural branches martlets and salamanders struggling in grotesque bushes or very elaborate geometrical patterned stuffs There is a picture of the Middle Ages which was written by Langland in Piers the Plowman a picture of an alehouse where Peronelle of Flanders and Clarice of Cockeslane sit with the hangman of Tyburn and a dozen others It is a picture of the fourteenth century but it holds good until the time of Henry VIII when Skelton his tutor describes just such another tavern on the highroad where some bring wedding rings to pay their scot of ale and Some bryngeth her husband s hood Because the ale is good Both accounts are gems of description both full of that rich happy Gothic flavour that sense of impressionist portraiture of broad humour which distinguishes the drawings in the Loutrell Psalter Illustration The Sugar bag Cap Illustration A Hood I feel now as if I might be accused of being interesting and of overlaying my history with too much side comment and I am well aware that convention demands that such books as this shall be as dull as possible then shall the vulgar rejoice because they have been trained to believe that dullness and knowledge snore in each other s arms However wholeheartedly you may set about writing a list of clothes attributable to certain dates there will crop up spirits of the age who blur the edges of the dates and give a lifelike semblance to them which carries the facts into the sphere of fiction and fiction was ever on the side of truth No story has ever been invented by man but it has been beaten out of time by Nature and the police courts no romance has been penned so intricate but fact will supply a more surprising twist to life But whereas facts are of necessity bald and naked things fiction which is the wardrobe of fact will clothe truth in more accustomed guise I put before you some true facts of the clothes of this time clothed in a little coat of facts put fictionally I write the word cloak describe to you that such people wore circular cloaks split at one or both sides on one side to the neck on the other below the shoulder of semicircular cloaks of square cloaks of oblong cloaks all of which were worn I speak of these and you may cut them out with some thought but I wish to do more than that I wish to give you a gleam of the spirit in which the cloaks were worn A cloak will partake of the very soul and conscience of its owner become draggle tailed flaunting effeminate masterful pompous or dignified Trousers I think of all the garments of men fail most to show the state of his soul they merely proclaim the qualities of his purse Cloaks give most the true man and after that there is much in the cock of a hat and the conduct of a cane In later days one might tell what manner of man had called to find you away if he chanced to leave his snuff box behind This reasoning is not finicky but very profound accept it in the right spirit Now one more picture of the age The rich man at home dressed as I say in his father s finery with some vague additions of his own has acquired a sense of luxury He prefers to dine alone in a room with a chimney and a fire in it He can see through a window in the wall by his side into the hall where his more patriarchal forebears loved to take their meals The soiled rushes are being swept away and fresh herbs and rushes strewn in their place on these mattresses will in their turn be placed on which his household presently will lay them down to sleep THE WOMEN Every time I write the heading The Women to such chapters as these I feel that such threadbare cloak of chivalry as I may pin about my shoulders is in danger of slipping off Should I write The Ladies But although all ladies are women not all women are ladies and as it is far finer to be a sweet woman than a great dame I will adhere to my original heading The Women However in the remote ages of which I now write the ladies were dressed and the women wore clothes which is a subtle distinction I dare not bring my reasoning up to the present day As I said in my last chapter this was an age of medley of this and that wardrobe flung open and old fashions renovated or carried on Fashion that elusive goddess changes her moods and modes with such a quiet swiftness that she leaves us breathless and far behind with a bundle of silks and velvets in our arms How is a fashion born Who mothers it Who nurses it to fame and in whose arms does it die High collar low collar short hair long hair boot buskin shoe who wore you first Who last condemned you to the World s Great Rag Market of Forgotten Fads Now this I have said was a transitional age but I cannot begin to say who was the first great dame to crown her head with horns and who the last to forsake the jewelled caul It is only on rare occasions that the decisive step can be traced to any one person or group of persons Charles II and his frock coat Brummell and his starched stock are finger posts on Fashion s highroad but they are not quite true guides Charles was recommended to the coat and I think the mist of soap and warm water that enshrines Brummell as the Apostle of Cleanliness blurs also the mirror of truth It does not much matter No doubt and here there will be readers the first to correct me and the last to see my point there are persons living full of curious knowledge who diving yet more deeply into the dusty crevices of history could point a finger at the man who first cut his hair in the early fifteenth century manner and could write you the name and the dignities of the lady who first crowned her fair head with horns For myself I begin with certainty at Adam and the fig leaf and after that I plunge into the world s wardrobe in hopes Certain it is that in this reign the close caul grew out of all decent proportions and swelled into every form of excrescence and protuberance until in the reign of Henry VI it towered above the heads of the ladies and dwarfed the stature of the men This curious head gear the caul after a modest appearance as a mere close gold work cap in the time of Edward III grew into a stiffer affair in the time of Richard II but still was little more than a stiff sponge bag of gold wire and stuff and a little padding grew still more in the time of Henry IV and took squarer shapes and stiffer padding and in the reign of Henry V it became like a great orange with a hole cut in it for the face an orange which covered the ears was cut straight across the forehead and bound all round with a stiff jewelled band Then came the idea of the horn Whether some superstitious lady thought that the wearing of horns would keep away the evil eye or whether it was a mere frivol of some vain Duchess I do not know As this fashion came most vividly into prominence in the following reign I shall leave a more detailed description of it until that time letting myself give but a short notice of its more simple forms We see the caul grow from its circular shape into two box forms on either side of the head the uppermost points of the boxes are arranged in horns whose points are of any length from four to fourteen inches The top of this head dress is covered with a wimple which is sometimes stiffened with wires Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY V fourteen thirteen fourteen twenty two Her surcoat is stiffened in front with fur and shaped with a band of metal Her belt is low on the hips of the under dress The horns on her head carry the large linen wimple There is also a shape something like a fez or a flower pot over which a heavy wimple is hung attached to this shape outside the wimple are two horns of silk linen or stuff that is silk bags stuffed to the likeness of horns I should say that a true picture of this time would give but few of these very elaborate horn head dresses and the mass of women would be wearing the round caul Illustration The surcoat over the cotehardie is the general wear but it has more fit about it than formerly the form of the waist and bust are accentuated by means of a band of heavy gold embroidery shaped to the figure The edges of the surcoat are furred somewhat heavily and the skirt often has a deep border of fur Sometimes a band of metal ornament runs across the top of the breast and down the centre of the surcoat coming below the fur edging The belt over the hips of the cotehardie holds the purse and often a ballade or a rondel You will see a few of the old houppelandes with their varieties of sleeve and in particular that long loose double sleeve or rather the very long under sleeve falling over the hand This under sleeve is part of the houppelande All the dresses have trains very full trains which sweep the ground and those readers who wish to make such garments must remember to be very generous over the material The women commonly wear the semicircular mantle which they fasten across them by cords running through ornamental brooches They wear very rich metal and enamel belts round their hips the exact ornamentation of which cannot be described here but it was the ornament of the age which can easily be discovered In the country of course simpler garments prevail and plain surcoats and cotehardies are wrapped in cloaks and mantles of homespun material The hood has not fallen out of use for women and the peaked hat surmounts it for riding or rough weather Ladies wear wooden clogs or sandals besides their shoes and they have not yet taken to the horns upon their heads some few of them the great dames of the counties whose lords have been to London on King s business or returned from France with new ideas have donned the elaborate business of head boxes and wires and great wimples As one of the ladies rides in the country lanes she may pass that Augustine convent where Dame Petronilla is spiritual Mother to so many and may see her in Agincourt year keeping her pig tally with Nicholas Swon the swineherd They may see some of the labourers she hires dressed in the blood red cloth she has given them for the dyeing of which she paid sevens eightd for twenty seven ells The good dame s nuns are very neat they have an allowance of sixs eightd a year for dress This is in fourteen fifteen No doubt next year my lady riding through the lanes will meet some sturdy beggar who will whine for alms pleading that he is an old soldier lately from the field of Agincourt NOTE As there is so little real change for drawings of women s dress see the numerous drawings in previous chapter HENRY THE SIXTH Reigned thirty nine years fourteen twenty two fourteen sixty one Born fourteen twenty one Dethroned fourteen sixty one Died fourteen seventy one Married fourteen forty six Margaret of Anjou THE MEN Illustration What a reign Was history ever better dressed I never waver between the cardboard figures of the great Elizabethan time and this reign as a monument to lavish display but if any time should beat this for quaintness colour and variety it is the time of Henry VIII Look at the scenes and characters to be dressed John Duke of Bedford the Protector Joan of Arc Jack Cade a hundred other people Crevant Verneuil Orleans London Bridge Ludlow saint Albans and a hundred other historical backgrounds Yet in spite of all this in spite of the fact that Joan of Arc is one of the world s personalities it is difficult to pick our people out of the tapestries Now you may have noticed that in trying to recreate a period in your mind certain things immediately swing into your vision it is difficult to think of the Conquest without the Bayeux tapestry it is difficult to think of the dawn of the sixteenth century without the dreamy romantic landscapes which back the figures of Giorgione and it is not easy to think of these people of the Henry VI period without placing them against conventional tapestry trees yellow white castles with red pepper pot roofs grass luxuriant with needlework flowers and all the other accessories of the art Illustration The early times are easily imagined in rough surroundings or in open air knights in armour ride quite comfortably down modern English lanes Alfred may burn his cakes realistically and Canute rebuke his courtiers on the beach these one may see in the round Elizabeth rides to Tilbury Charles II casts his horoscope and George rings the bell each in their proper atmosphere but the Dark Ages are dark not only in modes of thought but in being ages of grotesque of ornamentation of anything but realism One has I think a conventional mind s eye for the times from Edward I to Richard III from twelve seventy two to fourteen eighty five and it is really more easy for a Chinaman to call up a vision of six hundred four A D when Laot sen the Chinese philosopher was born Laot sen the child old man he who was born with white hair lived till he was eighty one and having had five million followers went up to heaven on a black buffalo In China things have changed very little the costume is much the same the customs are the same the attitude towards life has not changed But here the semicivilized superstitious rather dirty fourteenth and fifteenth century person has gone Scratch a Russian they say and you will see a Tartar do the same office by an Englishman and you may find a hint of the Renaissance under his skin but no more The Middle Ages are dead and dust We will proceed with that congenial paradox which states that the seat of learning lies in the head and so discuss the most distinctive costumery of this time the roundlet Illustration Now the roundlet is one of those things which delight the clothes hunter or the costume expert It is the natural result of a long series of fashions for the head and its pedigree is free from any impediment or hindrance it is the great grandson of the hood which is derived from a fold in a cloak which is the beginning of all things I am about to run the risk of displeasure in repeating to some extent what I have already written about the chaperon the hood and the other ancestors and descendants of the roundlet A fashion is born not made Necessity is the mother of Art and Art is the father of Invention A man must cover his head and if he has a cloak it is an easy thing in rain or sunshine to pull the folds of the cloak over his head An ingenious fellow in the East has an idea he takes his eight feet or more of material he folds it in half and at about a foot and a half or some such convenient length he puts several neat and strong stitches joining one point of the folded material When he wraps this garment about him leaving the sewn point in the centre of his neck at the back he finds that he has directed the folds of his coat in such a manner as to form a hood which he may place on or off his head more conveniently than the plain unsewn length of stuff The morning sun rises on the sands of Sahara and lights upon the first burnoose By a simple process in tailoring some man who did not care that the peak of his hood should be attached to his cloak cut his cloth so that the cloak had a hood the peak of which was separate and so looser and yet more easy to pull on or off Now comes a man who was taken by the shape of the hood but did not require to wear a cloak so he cut his cloth in such a way that he had a hood and shoulder cape only From this to the man who closed the front of the hood from the neck to the edge of the cape is but a quick and quiet step By now necessity was satisfied and had given birth to art Man having admired his face in the still waters of a pool seeing how the oval framed in the hood vastly became him sought to tickle his vanity and win the approbation of the other sex so taking some shears cut the edge of his cape in scallops and leaves A more dandified fellow distressed at the success of his brother s plumage caused the peak of his hood to be made long Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY VI fourteen twenty two fourteen sixty one His hair is cropped over his ears and has a thick fringe on his forehead Upon the ground is his roundlet a hat derived from the twisted chaperon of Richard II s day This hat is worn to day in miniature on the shoulder of the Garter robes Need one say more The long peak grew and grew into the preposterous liripipe which hung down the back from the head to the feet The dandy spirit of another age seeing that the liripipe can grow no more and that the shape of the hood is common and not in the true dandiacal spirit whips off his hood and placing the top of his head where his face was he twists the liripipe about his head imprisons part of the cape and after a fixing twist slips the liripipe through part of its twined self and lets the end hang down on one side of his face while the jagged end of the hood rises or falls like a cockscomb on the other Cockscomb there s food for discussion in that fops beaux dandies coxcombs surely I shall not go into the matter of the hood with two peaks which was not I take it a true child of fashion in the direct line but a mere cousin a junior branch at that As to the dates on this family tree the vague mysterious beginnings B C goodness knows when in a general way the Fall the Flood and the First Crusade until the time of the First Edward the end of the thirteenth century when the liripipe budded the time of the Second Edward the first third of the fourteenth century when the liripipe was in full flower the time of the Third Edward the middle of the fourteenth century when the liripipe as a liripipe was dying the time of the Second Richard the end of the century when the chaperon became the twisted cockscomb turban Then after that until the twenty second year of the fifteenth century when the roundlet was born those are the dates Illustration We have arrived by now quite naturally at the roundlet I left you interested at the last phase of the hood the chaperon so called twisted up in a fantastical shape on man s head You must see that the mere process of tying and retying twisting coiling and arranging was tedious in the extreme especially in stirring times with the trumpets sounding in England and France Now what more likely for the artist of the tied hood than to puzzle his brains in order to reach a means by which he could get at the effect without so much labour Enter invention enter invention and exit art With invention the made up chaperon sewn so as to look as if it had been tied There was the twist round the head the cockscomb the hanging piece of liripipe Again this was to be simplified the twist made into a smooth roll the skull to be covered by an ordinary cap attached to the roll the cockscomb converted into a plain piece of cloth or silk the liripipe to become broader And the end of this a little round hat with a heavily rolled and stuffed brim pleated drapery hanging over one side and streamer of broad stuff over the other just such a hat did these people wear on their heads or slung over their shoulder being held in the left hand by means of the streamer There the honourable family of hood came to a green old age and was at the end of the fifteenth century allowed to retire from the world of fashion and was given a pension and a home in which home you may still see it on the shoulders of the Garter robe Also it has two more places of honourable distinction the roundlet is on the Garter robe the chaperon with the cut edge rests as a cockade in the hats of liveried servants and the minutest member of the family remains in the foreign buttons of honourable Orders Illustration We have the roundlet then for principal head gear in this reign but we must not forget that the hood is not dead it is out of the strict realms of fashion but it is now a practical country garment or is used for riding in towns There are also other forms of head wear tall conical hats with tall brims of fur some brims cut or scooped out in places again the hood may have a furred edge showing round the face opening then we see a cap which fits the head has a long loose back falling over the neck and over this is worn a roll or hoop of twisted stuff Then there is the sugar loaf hat like a circus clown s and there is a broad flat brimmed hat with a round top like Noah s hat in the popular representations of the Ark Illustration Besides these we have the jester s three peaked hood and one peaked hood the cape of which came divided into points to the knees and had arms with bell sleeves Let us see what manner of man we have under such hats almost without exception among the gentlemen we have the priestly hair that queer shaved tonsure like cut but without the circular piece cut away from the crown of the head Illustration The cut of the tunic in the body has little variation it may be longer or shorter an inch above or an inch below the knee but it is on one main principle It is a loose tunic with a wide neck open in front about a couple or three inches the skirt is full and may be cut up on one or both sides it may be edged with fur or some stuff different to the body of the garment or it may be jagged either in regular small scoops or in long fringe like jags The tunic is always belted very low giving an odd appearance to the men of this time as it made them look very short in the leg The great desire for variety is displayed in the forms of sleeve for this tunic you may have the ordinary balloon sleeve ending in a stuff roll or fur edge for cuff or you may have a half sleeve very wide indeed like shoulder capes and terminated in the same manner as the bottom of the tunics that is fur edged tunic fur edged sleeve and so on as described under this shows the tight sleeve of an undergarment the collar of which shows above the tunic collar at the neck The length of these shoulder cape sleeves varies according to the owner s taste from small epaulettes to heavy capes below the elbow There is also a sleeve tight from wrist to below the elbow and at that point very big and wide tapering gradually to the shoulder You will still see one or two high collars rolled over and there is a distinct continuance of the fashion for long pointed shoes There is an almost new form of overcoat which is really a tunic of the time unbelted and with the sleeves cut out also one with short but very full sleeves the body very loose and besides the ordinary forms of square oblong and round cloak there is a circular cloak split up the right side to the base of the biceps with a round hole in the centre edged with fur for the passage of the head Illustration Velvet was in common use for gowns tunics and even for bed clothes in the place of blankets It was made in all kinds of beautiful designs diapered and raised over a ground of gold or silk or double piled one pile on another of the same colour making the pattern known by the relief The massed effect of well dressed crowds must have been fine and rich in colour here and there a very rich lady or a magnificent gentleman in pall the beautiful gold or crimson web known also as bandekin the velvets the silks of marvellous colours and none too fresh or new I think that such a gathering differed most strongly from a gathering of to day by the fact that one is impressed to day with the new almost tinny newness of the people s clothes and that these other people were not so extravagant in the number of their dresses as in the quality so that then one would have seen many old and beautifully faded velvets and sun licked silks and rain improved cloths Among all this crowd would pass in a plain tunic and short shoes Henry the ascetic King THE WOMEN Illustration One is almost disappointed to find nothing upon the curious subject of horns in Sartor Resartus Such a flaunting Jovian spirit and poetry of abuse as might have been expected from the illustrious and iconoclastic author would have suited me at this present date most admirably I feel the need of a few thundering German words or a brass band at the end of my pen or purple ink in my inkwell or some fantastic and wholly arresting piece of sensationalism by which to convey to you that you have now stepped into the same world as the Duchess out of Alice in Wonderland Illustration Look out of your window and see upon the flower enamelled turf a hundred bundles of vanity taking the air The heads of these ladies are carried very erect as are all heads bearing weights The waists of these ladies are apparently under their bosoms their feet seem to be an ell long An assembly hour is after the manner of Lydgate s poem a dream of delicious faces surmounted by minarets towers horns excrescences of every shape enormous fat heart shaped erections covered with rich falling drapery or snow white linen or gold tissue gold wire boxes sewn with pearls and blazing with colours round flat topped caps from under which girls hair escapes in a river of colour crown shapes circular shapes mitre shapes turbans and shovel shaped linen erections wired into place Oh my lady my lady how did you ever hear the soft speeches of gallantry How did the gentle whispers of love ever penetrate those bosses of millinery Illustration And the moralists among whom Heaven forbid that I should be found painted lurid pictures for you of hell and purgatory in which such head dresses turned into instruments of torture you lifted your long fingered medieval hand and shook the finger with the toad stone upon it as if to dispel the poison of their words I think it is beyond me to describe in understandable terms the proper contortions of your towered heads for I have little use for archaic words for crespine henk and jacque for herygouds with honginde sleeves for all the blank cartridges of antiquarianism I cannot convey the triple curved crown the ear buttress the magnet shaped roll in adequate language but I can draw them for you Illustration I will attempt the most popular of the roll head dresses and the simpler of the stiff wired box Take a roll stuffed with hemp or tow of some rich material and twist it into the form of a heart in front and a V shape behind where join the ends or better make a circle or hoop of your rolled stuff and bend it in this way Then make a cap that will fit the head and come over the ears and make it so that this cap shall join the heart shaped roll at all points and cause it to appear without any open spaces between the head and the roll the point of the heart in front will be round and will come over the centre of the face By joining cap and roll you will have one complete affair over this you may brooch a linen wimple or a fine piece of jagged silk In fact you may twist your circle of stuff in any manner providing you keep a vague U shape in front and completely cover the hair behind For the box pattern it is necessary to make a box let us say of octagonal shape flat before and behind or slightly curved cut away the side under the face or leave but a thin strip of it to go under the chin Now stuff your box on either side of the face and cut away the central square except for three inches at the top on the forehead here in this cut away piece the face shows You will have made your box of buckram and stuffed the wings of it with tow now you must fit your box to a head and sew linen between the sides of the head and the tow to hold it firm and make it good to wear You have now finished the rough shape and you must ornament it Take a piece of thin gold web and cover your box then get some gold braid and make a diaper or criss cross pattern all over the box leaving fair sized lozenges in these put at regular intervals as a plain check small squares of crimson silk so that they fit across the lozenge and so make a double pattern Now take some gold wire or brass wire and knot it at neat intervals and then stitch it on to the edges of the gold braid after which pearl beads may be arranged on the crimson squares and at the cross of the braid then you will have your box patterned head dress complete It remains for you to enlarge upon this if you wish in the following manner take a stiff piece of wire and curve it into the segment of a circle so that you may bend the horns as much or as little as you will fasten the centre of this to the band across the forehead or on to the side boxes and over it place a large wimple with the front edge cut Again for further enhancement of this delectable piece of goods you may fix a low gold crown above all a crown of an elliptical shape and there you will have as much magnificence as ever graced lady of the fifteenth century Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY VI fourteen twenty two fourteen sixty one Her head dress is very high and over it is a coloured and jagged silk wimple a new innovation being a change from the centuries of white linen wimples Her waist is high after a long period of low waists September twenty eight fourteen forty three Margaret Paston writes to her husband in London I would ye were at home if it were your ease and your sore might be as well looked to here as it is where ye be now liefer than a gown though it were of scarlet Illustration My dear diplomatist I have forgotten if you got both your husband and the gown or the gown only but it was a sweetly pretty letter and worded in such a way as must have caused your good knight to smile despite his sore And what had you in your mind s eye when you wrote liefer than a gown though it were of scarlet It was one of those new gowns with the high waist and the bodice opening very low the collar quite over your shoulders and the thick fur edge on your shoulders and tapering into a point at your bosom You wanted sleeves like wings and a fur edge to the bottom of the gown besides the fur upon the edges of the sleeves those quaint sleeves thin to your elbows and then great and wide like a foresail I suppose you had an under gown of some wonderful diapered silk which you thought would go well with scarlet because as you knew the under gown would show at your neck and its long train would trail behind you and its skirt would fall about your feet and show very bravely when you bunched up the short upper gown all the mode and so you hinted at scarlet Illustration Now I come to think of it the sleeve must have been hard to arrive at the fashions were so many To have had them tight would have minimized the use of your undergarment to have had them of the same width from elbow to wrist would not have given you the newest of the new ideas to show in Norfolk then for some reason you rejected the bag sleeve which was also in the fashion No doubt you had a cotehardie with well fitting sleeves and good full skirts and a surcoat with a wide fur edge or perhaps in the latest fashion of these garments with an entire fur bodice to it You may have had also one of those rather ugly little jackets very full with very full sleeves which came tight at the wrist long waisted with a little skirt an inch or so below the belt A mantle with cords to keep it on I know you had Possibly I have just thought of it the sleeves of your under gown the tight sleeves were laced together from elbow to wrist in place of the old fashioned buttons Illustration I wonder if you ever saw the great metal worker William Austin one of the first among English artists to leave a great name behind him I mean the Austin who modelled the effigy of Earl Richard Beauchamp at Warwick Illustration You must have heard the leper use his rattle to warn you of his proximity You too may have thought that Joan of Arc was a sorceress and Friar Bungay a magician You may have I have not your wonderful letter here for reference heard all about Eleanor of Cobham and how she did penance in a shift in the London streets for magic against the King s person Some ladies I notice wore the long tongued belt buckled it in front and then pushed it round until the buckle came into the centre of the back and the tongue hung down like a tail but these ladies were not wearing the high waisted gown but a gown with a normal waist and with no train but a skirt of even fulness and of the same length all the way round Illustration There were striped stuffs piled velvet rich patterned silks and homespun cloths and wool to choose from Long peaked shoes of course and wooden clogs out of doors Illustration The town and country maids the merchants wives and the poor generally each and all according to purse and pride dressed in humbler imitation of the cut of the clothes of the high born in quite simple dresses with purse girdle and apron with heads in hoods or twisted wimples of coarse linen Well there you lie ladies on the tops of cold tombs stiff and sedate your hands uplifted in prayer your noses as often as not knocked off by later day schoolboys crop headed Puritans or Henry VIII s sacrilegious hirelings Lie still in your huge head dresses and your neat folded gowns a moral in marble or bronze of the pomps and vanities of this wicked world EDWARD THE FOURTH Reigned twenty two years fourteen sixty one fourteen eighty three Born fourteen forty one Married fourteen sixty four Elizabeth Woodville THE MEN Illustration I invite you to call up this reign by a picture of Caxton s shop you may imagine yourself in the almonry at Westminster where in a small enclosure by the west front of the church there is a chapel and some almshouses You will be able to see the rich come to look at mister Caxton s wares and the poor slinking in to receive alms If it please any man spiritual or temporal to buy any pyes of two or three commemorations of Salisbury use emprynted after the form of this present letter which be well and truly correct let him come to Westminster into the Almonry at the red pale and he shall have them good cheap This was Caxton s advertisement As you watch the people going and coming about the small enclosure you will notice that the tonsured hair has gone out of fashion and that whereas the merchants citizens and such people wear the roundlet hat the nobles and fine gentlemen are in black velvet caps or tall hats with long peaked brims or in round high hats with fur brim close to the crown of the hat or in caps with little rolled brims with a button at the top over which two laces pass from back to front and from under the brim there falls the last sign the dying gasp of the liripipe now jagged and now with tasselled ends We have arrived at the generally accepted vague idea of medieval costume which means really a hazy notion of the dress of this date a steeple head dress for ladies a short waist and a train a tall sugar loaf hat with a flat top for the men long hair very short and very long tunics long pointed shoes and wide sleeves this I think is the amateur s idea of costume in the Middle Ages You will notice that all or nearly all the passers by Caxton s have long hair that the dandies have extra long hair brushed out in a cloud at the back that the older men wear long very simple gowns which they belt in at the waist with a stuff or leather belt on which is hung a bag purse that these plain gowns are laced across the front to the waist over a vest of some coloured stuff other than the gown Illustration You will see that the poor are in very simple tunics just a loose stuff shirt with sleeves about eight inches wide and with the skirts reaching to the knees a belt about their middle rough shapeless leather shoes and woollen tights You will remember in the early part of the reign before the heraldic shield with the red pale Caxton s sign caught your eye that the fashionable wore very wide sleeves great swollen bags fitting only at shoulder and wrist and you may recall the fact that a tailor was fined twenty shillings in fourteen sixty three for making such wide sleeves Poulaines the very long shoes are now forbidden except that an esquire and anyone over that rank might wear them two inches beyond the toes but I think the dandies wore the shoes and paid the fine if it were enforced Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF EDWARD IV fourteen sixty one fourteen eighty three Notice the jagged ribbon falling from the brim of his hat this is the last of the liripipe See Caxton in a sober coloured gown long and laced in the front showing a plain vest under the lacing talking to some of his great customers The Duchess of Somerset has just lent him Blanchardine and Eglantine Earl Rivers the Queen s brother talks over his own translation of The Sayings of the Philosophers and Caxton is extolling that worshipful man Geoffrey Chaucer and singing praises in reverence for that noble poet and great clerke Vergyl Edward himself has been to the shop and has consented to become patron of an edition of Tully Edward with his very subtle face his tall handsome appearance his cold elegant manners He is dressed in a velvet gown edged with fur the neck of the gown is low and the silk vest shows above it Across his chest are gold laces tapering to his waist these are straight across the front of his gown opening His hair is straight and falls to the nape of his neck he wears a black velvet cap upon his head The skirts of his gown reach to his knees and are fur edged his sleeves are full at the elbows and tight over his wrists he is wearing red Spanish leather tall boots turned over at the top Illustration As he stands talking to Caxton one or two gentlemen who have also dismounted stand about him Three of them are in the height of the fashion The first wears a velvet tunic with fur edges The tunic is pleated before and behind and is full and slightly pursed in front the sleeves are long and are cut from shoulder to wrist where they are sewn together again cuff and border of the cut or opening are both edged with fur The neck is high but there is no collar The length of the tunic is quite short it comes well above the knees His under sleeves are full and are of rich silk his shoes are certainly over the allowed length his tights are well cut His peaked hat has gold bands round the crown The second gentleman is also in a very short tunic with very wide sleeves this tunic is pleated into large even folds and has a belt of its own material His hair is long and bushed behind his tights are in two colours and he wears an eighteen penny pair of black leather slops or shoes His hat is black tall but without a peak a long feather is brooched into one side of it Illustration The third man is wearing a low black cap with a little close brim a jagged piece of stuff about three feet long hangs from under the brim of his hat He is wearing long straight hair This man is wearing a little short tunic which is loose at the waist and comes but an inch or two below it the sleeves are very loose and wide and are not fastened at the wrist the tunic has a little collar The shortness of his tunic shows the whole of his tights and also the ribbon fastened cod piece in front His shoes are split at the sides and come into a peak before and behind Now our gentlemen of this time having cut open their baggy sleeves and made them to hang down and expose all the under sleeve must now needs lace them up again very loosely Then by way of change the tight sleeve was split at the elbow to show a white shirt Then came the broad shoulders when the sleeves were swelled out at the top to give an air of great breadth to the shoulders and a more elegant taper to the waist Some men had patterns sewn on one leg of their tights The gown or whatever top garment was being worn was sometimes cut into a low V shape behind at the neck to show the undergarment above which showed a piece of white shirt Illustration A long gown in shape like a monk s habit wide sleeves the same width all the way down a loose neck a garment indeed to put on over the head to slip on for comfort and warmth was quite a marked fashion in the streets as marked as the little tunic Illustration If you are remembering Caxton s shop and a crowd of gentlemen notice one in a big fur hat which comes over his eyes and see also a man who has wound a strip of cloth about his neck and over his head then letting one end hang down has clapped his round steeple crowned hat over it You will see high collars low collars and absence of collar long gown open to the waist long gown without opening short skirted tunic tunic without any skirt long short and medium shoes and at the end of the reign one or two broad toed shoes Many of these men would be carrying sticks most of them would have their fingers covered with rings Among the group of gentlemen about Edward some merchants have pressed closer to see the King and a girl or two has stolen into the front row The King turning to make a laughing remark to one of his courtiers will see a roguish pretty face behind him the face of a merchant s wife he will smile at her in a meaning way THE WOMEN Illustration France at this date shows us a sartorial Savonarola by name Thomas Conecte a preaching friar who held an Anti Hennin Crusade which ended in a bonfire of these steeple head dresses The flames of these peculiar hats lit up the inspired devotees and showed their heads wrapped in plain linen wimples or some little unaffected caps But the ashes were hardly cold before the gray light of the next day showed the figure of the dreaded preacher small upon the horizon and lit upon the sewing maids as they sat making fresh steeples for the adornment of their ladies heads Joan of Arc is dead and another very different apparition of womankind looms out of the mists of history Whilst Joan of Arc is hymned and numbered among the happy company of saints triumphant Jane Shore is roared in drinking songs and ballads of a disreputable order and is held up as an awful example She has for years been represented upon the boards of West End and Surrey side theatres in her prime as the mistress of Edward IV in her penance before the church door and in her poverty and starvation hounded from house to house in a Christian country where bread was denied to her I myself have seen her through the person of a stout melancholy and h less lady who dressed in a sort of burlesque fish wife costume has lain dying on the prompt side of the stage in a whirl of paper snow while to the edification of the twopenny gallery she has bewailed her evil life and has been allowed by a munificent management to die in the arms of white clad angels There is a gleam of truth in the representation and you may see the real Jane Shore in a high steeple head dress with a thin veil thrown over it with a frontlet or little loop of black velvet over her forehead in a high waisted dress open in a V shape from shoulder to waist the opening laced over the square cut under gown the upper gown having a collar of fur or silk a long train broad cuffs perhaps seven inches long from the base of her fingers with a broad coloured band about her waist a broader trimming of the same colour round the hem of her shirt and in long peaked shoes In person of mean stature her hair dark yellow her face round and full her eyes gray and her countenance as cheerful as herself The second real picture of her shows you a haggard woman with her hair unbound and falling about her shoulders shivering in a shift which she clutches about her with one hand while the other holds a dripping candle and the third picture shows an old woman in dirty wimple and untidy rags Illustration There are many ways of making the steeple head dress For the most part they are long black covered steeples resting at an angle of forty five degrees to the head the broad end having a deep velvet band round it with hanging sides which come to the level of the chin the point end has a long veil attached to it which floats lightly down or is carried on to one shoulder Sometimes this steeple hat is worn over a hood the cape of which is tucked into the dress Some of these hats have a jutting upturned piece in front and they are also covered with all manner of coloured stuffs but not commonly so All persons having an income of Lten a year and over will have that black velvet loop the frontlet sewn into their hats There is another new shape for hats varying in height from eight to eighteen inches It is a cylinder broader at the top than the bottom the crown sometimes flat and sometimes rounded into the hat itself this hat is generally jewelled and covered with rich material The veils are attached to these hats in several ways either they float down behind from the centre of the crown of the hat or they are sewn on to the base of the hat and are supported on wires so as to shade the face making a roof over it pointed in front and behind or flat across the front and bent into a point behind or circular Take two circles of wire one the size of the base of your hat and the other larger and dress your linen or thin silk upon them then you may pinch the wire into any variations of squares and circles you please Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF EDWARD IV fourteen sixty one fourteen eighty three She wears the high hennin from which hangs a wisp of linen On her forehead is the velvet frontlet and across her forehead is a veil stretched on wires The veil was sometimes worn all over the steeple hat coming down over the face but stiff enough to stand away from it Towards the end of the reign the hats were not so high or so erect Remember also that the horned head dress of the previous reign is not by any means extinct Illustration There remain two more forms of making the human face hideous one is the head dress closely resembling an enormous sponge bag which for some unknown reason lasted well into the reign of Henry VII as a variety to the fashionable head gear of that time and the other is very simple being a wimple kept on the head by a circular stuffed hoop of material which showed plain and severe across the forehead The simple folk wore a hood of linen with a liripipe and wide ear flaps Illustration The dresses are plain in cut they are all short waisted if at all fashionable The most of them have a broad waist belt and very deep borders to their skirts they have broad turned back cuffs often of black These cuffs on being turned down over the hand show the same colour as the dress they are in fact the old long cuff over the fingers turned back for comfort It is by the variety of openings at the necks of the gowns that you may get change First let me take the most ordinary that is an opening of a V shape from shoulders to waist the foot of the V at the waist the points on the top of the shoulders at the join of the arm Across this opening is seen cut square and coming up to the base of the bosom the under gown You may now proceed to vary this by lacing the V across but not drawing it together by having the V fur edged or made to turn over in a collar of black upon light material or its opposite by showing a vest of stuff other than that of the under gown which will then make a variety of colour when the skirt is held up over the arm Or you may have your dress so cut that it is high in front and square cut and over this you may sew a false V collar wither to or above the waist I have said that the whole neck opening may be covered by a gorget of cloth which was pinned up to the steeple hat or by a hood of thin stuff or silk the cape of which was tucked into the dress Illustration The lady I think is now complete down to her long pointed shoes her necklet of stones or gold chain with cross or heraldic pendant and it remains to show that the countrywoman dressed very plainly in a decent fitting dress with her waist in its proper place her skirt full the sleeves of her dress turned back like my lady s her head wrapped in a wimple or warmed in a hood her feet in plain foot shaped shoes and wooden clogs strapped on to them for outdoor use or kitchen work in fact she looked much like any old body to day who has lived in a village except that the wimple and the hood then worn are out of place to day more s the pity No doubt ladies were just human in those days and fussed and frittered over an inch or so of hennin or a yard or two of train One cut her dress too low to please the others and another wore her horned head dress despite the dictates of Fashion which said Away with horns and into steeples No doubt the tall hennins with their floating veils looked like black masts with silken sails and the ladies like a crowd of shipping with velvet trains for waves about their feet no doubt the steeples swayed and the silks rustled when the heads turned to look at the fine men in the days when hump shouldered Richard was a dandy EDWARD THE FIFTH Reigned two months April and June fourteen eighty seven RICHARD THE THIRD Reigned two years fourteen eighty three fourteen eighty five Born fourteen fifty Married fourteen seventy three Anne Neville THE MEN Illustration Fashion s pulse beat very weak in the spring of fourteen eighty three More attune to the pipes of Fate were the black cloaks of conspirators and a measured tread of soft shoed feet than lute and dance of airy millinery The axe of the executioner soiled many white shirts and dreadful forebodings fluttered the dovecots of high hennined ladies The old order was dying Medievalism which made a last spluttering flame in the next reign was now burnt low and was saving for that last effort When Richard married Anne Neville in the same year was Raphael born in Italy literature was beginning thought was beginning many of the great spirits of the Renaissance were alive and working in Italy the very trend of clothes showed something vaguely different something which shows however that the foundations of the world were being shaken so shaken that men and women coming out of the gloom of the fourteenth century through the half light of the fifteenth saw the first signs of a new day the first show of spring and with a perversity or an eagerness to meet the coming day they began to change their clothes It is in this reign of Richard III that we get for the men a hint of the peculiar magnificence of the first years of the sixteenth century we get the first flush of those wonderful patterns which are used by Memline and Holbein those variations of the pine apple pattern and of that peculiar convention which is traceable in the outline of the Tudor rose The men at first sight do not appear very different to the men of Edward IV s time they have the long hair the general clean shaven faces open breasted tunics and full pleated skirts But as a rule the man peculiar to his time the clothes post of his age has discarded the tall peaked hat and is almost always dressed in the black velvet stiff brimmed hat The pleated skirt to his tunic has grown longer and his purse has grown larger the sleeves are tighter and the old tunic with the split hanging sleeves has grown fuller longer and has become an overcoat being now open all the way down You will see that the neck of the tunic is cut very low and that you may see above it above the black velvet with which it is so often bound the rich colour or fine material of an undergarment a sort of waistcoat and yet again above that the straight top of a finely pleated white shirt Sometimes the sleeves of the tunic will be wide and when the arm is flung up in gesticulation the baggy white shirt tight buttoned at the wrist will show Instead of the overcoat with the hanging sleeves you will find a very plain cut overcoat with sleeves comfortably wide and with little plain lapels to the collar It is cut wide enough in the back to allow for the spread of the tunic Black velvet is becoming a very fashionable trimming and will be seen as a border or as under vest to show between the shirt and the tunic No clothes of the last reign will be incongruous in this the very short tunics which expose the cod piece the split sleeve tunic all the variations I have described Judges walk about looking like gentlemen of the time of Richard II a judge wears a long loose gown with wide sleeves from out of which appear the sleeves of his under tunic buttoned from elbow to wrist he wears a cloak with a hood the cloak split up the right side and fastened by three buttons upon the right shoulder A doctor is in very plain ample gown with a cape over his shoulders and a small round cap on his head His gown is not bound at the waist Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF RICHARD III fourteen eighty three fourteen eighty five Here one sees the first of the broad toed shoes and the birth of the Tudor costume the full pleated skirts and the prominence of white shirt The blunt shoes have come into fashion and with this the old long peaked shoe dies for ever Common sense will show you that the gentlemen who had leisure to hunt in these times did not wear their most foppish garments that the tunics were plain the boots high the cloaks of strong material They wore a hunting hat with a long peak over the eyes and a little peak over the neck at the back a broad band passed under the chin and buttoning on to either side of the hat kept it in place The peasant wore a loose tunic often open breasted and laced across he had a belt about his waist a hood over his head and often a broad brimmed Noah s Ark hat over the hood his slops or loose trousers were tied below the knee and at the ankles A shepherd would stick his pipe in his belt so that he might march before his flock piping them into the fold Illustration To sum up you must picture a man in a dress of Edward IV s time modified or rather expanded or expanding into the costume of Henry VII s time a reign in fact which hardly has a distinct costume to itself that is for the men but has a hand stretched out to two centuries the fifteenth and the sixteenth yet if I have shown the man to you as I myself can see him he is different from his father in fourteen sixty one and will change a great deal before fifteen hundred THE WOMEN Illustration Here we are at the end of an epoch at the close of a costume period at one of those curious final dates in a history of clothes which says that within a year or so the women of one time will look hopelessly old fashioned and queer to the modern woman Except for the peculiar sponge bag turban which had a few years of life in it the woman in Henry VII s reign would look back at this time and smile and the young woman would laugh at the old ideas of beauty The River of Time runs under many bridges and it would seem that the arches were low to the Bridge of Fashion in fourteen eighty three and the steeple hat was lowered to prevent contact with them The correct angle of forty five degrees changed into a right angle the steeple hat the hennin came toppling down and an embroidered bonnet perched right on the back of the head came into vogue It is this bonnet which gives from our point of view distinction to the reign It was a definite fashion a distinct halt It had travelled along the years of the fourteenth century from the wimple and the horns and the stiff turbans and the boxes of stiffened cloth of gold it had languished in the caul and blossomed in the huge wimple covered horns it had shot up in the hennin and now it gave as its last transformation this bonnet at the back of the head with the stiff wimple stretched upon wires Soon was to come the diamond shaped head dress and after that the birth of hair as a beauty In this case the hair was drawn as tightly as possible away from the forehead and at the forehead the smaller hairs were plucked away even eyebrows were a little out of fashion Then this cylindrical bonnet was placed at the back of the head with its wings of thin linen stiffly sewn or propped on wires These wires were generally of a V shape the V point at the forehead On some occasions two straight wires came out on either side of the face in addition to the V and so made two wings on either side of the face and two wings over the back of the head It is more easy to describe through means of the drawings and the reader will soon see what bend to give to the wires in order that the wings may be properly held out Beyond this head dress there was very little alteration in the lady s dress since the previous reign The skirts were full the waist was high but not absurdly so the band round the dress was broad the sleeves were tight and the cuffs often of fur were folded back to a good depth The neck opening of the dress varied as did that of the previous reign but whereas the most fashionable opening was then from neck to waist this reign gave more liking to a higher corsage over the top of which a narrow piece of stuff showed often of black velvet We may safely assume that the ladies followed the men in the matter of broad shoes For a time the old fashion of the long tongued belt came in and we see instances of such belts being worn with the tongue reaching nearly to the feet tipped with a metal ornament Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF RICHARD III fourteen eighty three fourteen eighty five The great erection on her head is made of thin linen stretched upon wires through this one may see her jewelled cap Not until night did these ladies discard their winged head erections not until the streets were dark and the brass basins swinging from the barbers poles shone but dimly and the tailors no longer sat cross legged on the benches in their shop fronts then might my lady uncover her head and talk in company with my lord over the strange new stories of Prester John and of the Wandering Jew then at her proper time she will go to her rest and sleep soundly beneath her embroidered quilt under the protection of the saints whose pictures she has sewn into the corners of it Matthew Mark Luke and John bless the bed that she lies on So we come to an end of a second series of dates from the First Edward to the Third Richard and we leave them to come to the Tudors and their follies and fantastics we leave an age that is quaint rich and yet fairly simple to come to an age of padded hips and farthingales monstrous ruffs knee breeks rag stuffed trunks and high heeled shoes With the drawings and text you should be able to people a vast world of figures dating from the middle of the thirteenth century twelve seventy two to nearly the end of the fifteenth fourteen eighty five and if you allow ordinary horse sense to have play you will be able to people your world with correctly dressed figures in the true inspiration of their time You cannot disassociate the man from his tailor his clothes must appeal to you historically and soulfully as an outward and visible sign to the graces and vices of his age and times HENRY THE SEVENTH Reigned twenty four years fourteen eighty five fifteen oh nine Born fourteen fifty six Married fourteen eighty six Elizabeth of York THE MEN Illustration Everyone has felt that curious faint aroma that sensation of lifting which proclaims the first day of Spring and the burial of Winter Although nothing tangible has taken place there is in the atmosphere a full charged suggestion of promise of green sickness there is a quickening of the pulse a thrumming of the heart and many an eager quick glance around for the first buds of the new order of things England s winter was buried on Bosworth Field England s spring as if by magic commenced with Henry s entry into London The first picture of the reign shows the mayor the sheriffs and the aldermen clothed in violet waiting at Shoreditch for the coming of the victor The same day shows Henry in saint Paul s hearing a Te Deum in the Cathedral church packed to its limit three new banners waved one bearing a figure of saint George another a dragon of red on white and green sarcenet and the third showed a dun cow on yellow tarterne Spring of course does not except in a poetic sense burst forth in a day there are long months of preparation hints signs in the air new notes from the throats of birds The springtime of a country takes more than the preparation of months Nine years before Henry came to the throne Caxton was learning to print in the little room of Collard Mansion he was to print his Facts of Arms joyous tales and pleasant histories of chivalry by especial desire of Henry himself Later still towards the end of the reign the first book of travel in the West began to go from hand to hand it was written by Amerigo Vespucci cousin to La Bella Simonetta Great thoughts were abroad new ideas were constantly under discussion the Arts rose to the occasion and put forth flowers of beauty on many stems long supposed to be dead or dormant and incapable of improvement It was the great age of individual English expression in every form but that of literature and painting both these arts being but in their cradles Chaucer and Gower and Langland had written but they lay in their graves long before new great minds arose The clouds of the Middle Ages were dispersed and the sun shone The costume was at once dignified and magnificent not that one can call the little coats great ideals of dignity but even they by their richness and by the splendour of the persons they adorned come into the category The long gowns of both men and women were rich beyond words in colour texture and design they were imposing exact and gorgeous Upon a fine day the streets must have glittered when a gentleman or lady passed by The fashions of the time have survived for us in the Court cards take the jacks knaves valets call them as you will and you will see the costume of this reign but slightly modified into a design the cards of to day and the cards of that day are almost identical Some years ago the modification was less noticeable I can remember playing Pope Joan with cards printed with full length figures just as the illustrations to Alice in Wonderland are drawn In the knave you will see the peculiar square hat which came in at this time and the petti cote the long coat the big sleeve and the broad toed shoes You will see the long hair undressed and flowing over the shoulders the professional classes as the lawyer cut their hair close so also did the peasant Over this flowing hair a dandy would wear a little cap with a narrow rolled up brim and over this on occasions an enormous hat of felt ornamented with a prodigious quantity of feathers Illustration There was indeed quite a choice of hats the berretino a square hat pinched in at the corners many round hats some with a high tight brim some with the least brim possible into these brims or into a band round the hat one might stick feathers or pin a brooch Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY VII fourteen eighty five fifteen oh nine The chaperon before described was still worn by Garter Knights at times and by official legal civic and college persons What a choice of coats the gentlemen had and still might be in the fashion Most common among these was the long coat like a dressing gown hanging upon the ground all round with a wide collar square behind and turning back in the front down to the waist this was the general shape of the collar and you may vary it on this idea in every way turn it back and show the stuff to the feet close it up nearly to the neck cut it off completely Now for the sleeves of such a coat I have shown in the illustrations many varieties the most common was the wide sleeve narrow at the shoulder and hanging over the hand in folds The slashes which show the white shirt are usual and of every order The shirt itself was often ornamented with fine gathers and fancy stitching and was gathered about the neck by a ribbon As the years went on it is easy to see that the shirt was worn nearer to the neck the gathers became higher and higher became more ornamented and finally rose in all extravagant finery to behind the ears and we have the Elizabethan ruff Illustration COATS HATS Next to the shirt a waistcoat or stomacher of the most gorgeous patterned stuff laced across the breast sometimes more often fastened behind This reached to the waist where it met long hose of every scheme of colour striped dotted divided in bands everything displaying the indelicate but universal pouch in front tied with coloured ribbons On the feet shoes of all materials from cloth and velvet to leather beautifully worked and of the most absurd length these also were slashed with puffs of white stuff Many of these shoes were but a sole and a toe and were tied on by thongs passing through the sole Of course the long coat would not alone satisfy the dandy but he must needs cut it off into a short jacket or petti cote and leave it open to better display his marvellous vest Here we have the origin of the use of the word petticoat now wrongly applied in Scotland to this day a woman s skirts are called her coats About the waists of these coats was a short sash or a girdle from which hung a very elaborate purse or a dagger Stick in hand jewel in your hat dandy extravagant exquisite dandy All ages know you from the day you choose your covering of leaves with care to the hour of your white duck motoring suit a very bird of a man rejoicing in your plumage a very human ass a very narrow individual you stride strut simper through the story of the universe a perfect monument of the Fall of Man a gorgeous symbol of the decay of manhood In this our Henry s reign your hair busheth pleasantly and is kembed prettily over the ear

rare disguise your coiffure hides a noble brow or your little neat rimmed coif a clever head less honour be to you who dress your limbs to imitate the peacock and hide your mind beneath the weight of scented clothes Illustration SLEEVES In the illustrations to this chapter and the next my drawings are collected and redrawn in my scheme from works so beautiful and highly finished that every student should go to see them for himself at the British Museum My drawings I hope make it quite clear what was worn in the end of the fifteenth century and the first nine years of the sixteenth and anyone with a slight knowledge of pictures will be able to supply themselves with a large amount of extra matter I would recommend MS Roy sixteen F two MS Roy nineteen C eight and especially Harleian MS four thousand four hundred twenty five Of the lower classes also these books show quite a number There are beggars and peasants whose dress was simply old fashioned and very plain they wore the broad shoes and leather belts and short coats worsted hose and cloaks of fair cloth Poverty the old woman with the spoon in her hat is a good example of the poor of the time When one knows the wealth of material of the time and has seen the wonder of the stuffs one knows that within certain lines imagination may have full scope Stuffs of silk embroidered with coupled birds and branches and flowers following out a prescribed line the embroideries edged and sewn with gold thread velvet on velvet short napped fustian damasked stuffs and diapered stuffs what pictures on canvas or on the stage may be made what marvels of colour walked about the streets in those days It was to the eye an age of elaborate patterns mostly large and all this broken colour and glitter of gold thread must have made the streets gay indeed Illustration Imagine shall we say Corfe Castle on a day when a party of ladies and gentlemen assembled to course a stagge when the huntsmen in green gathered in the outer ward and the grooms in fine coloured liveries held the gaily decked horses then from the walls lined with archers would come the blast of the horn and out would walk my lord and my lady with knights and squires and ladies and gallants over the bridge across the castle ditch between the round towers Behind them the dungeon tower and the great gray mass of the keep all a fitting and impressive background to their bravery The gentlemen in long coats of all wonderful colours and devices with little hats jewelled and feathered with boots to the knee of soft leather turned back in colours at the top on their left hands the thick hawking glove on which jessed and hooded sits the hawk for some who will not go with the hounds will fly the hawk on the Isle of Purbeck Illustration Below in the town over the moat a crowd is gathered to see them off merchants in grave colours and coats turned back with fur their ink horns slung at their waists with pens and dagger and purse beggars pilgrims from over seas landed at Poole Harbour in long gowns worn with penitence and dusty travels shells in their hats staffs in their hands wide eyed children in smocks butchers in blue men of all guilds and women of all classes The drawbridge is down the portcullis up and the party gleaming like a bed of flowers in their multi coloured robes pass over the bridge through the town and into the valley The sun goes in and leaves the grim castle gray and solemn standing out against the green of the hills And of Henry himself the great Tudor greater more farseeing than the eighth Henry a man who so dominates the age and fills it with his spirit that no mental picture is complete without him His fine humorous face the quizzical eye the firm mouth showing his character The great lover of art of English art soon to be pulverized by pseudo classic influences the man who pulled down the chapel at the west end of Westminster Abbey with the house by it Chaucer s house to make way for that superb triumph of ornate building his chapel beside which the mathematical squares and angles of classic buildings show as would boxes of bricks by a gorgeous flower The stories against him are in reality stories for him invented by those whom he kept to their work and whom he despoiled of their ill gotten gains He borrowed but he paid back in full he came into a disordered distressed kingdom ruled it by fear as had to be done in those days and left it a kingdom ready for the fruits of his ordered works to the fleshy beast who so nearly ruined the country What remained indeed was the result of his father s genius THE WOMEN Take up a pack of cards and look at the queen You may see the extraordinary head gear as worn by ladies at the end of the fifteenth century and in the first years of the sixteenth worn in a modified form all through the next reign after which that description of head dress vanished for ever its place to be taken by caps hats and bonnets The richest of these head dresses were made of a black silk or some such black material the top stiffened to the shape of a sloping house roof the edges falling by the face on either side made stiff so as to stand parallel these were sewn with gold and pearls on colour or white The end of the hood hung over the shoulders and down the back this was surmounted by a stole of stiffened material also richly sewn with jewels and the whole pinned on to a close fitting cap of a different colour the edge of which showed above the forehead Illustration The more moderate head dress was of black again but in shape nearly square and slit at the sides to enable it to hang more easily over the shoulders It was placed over a coif often of white linen or of black material was turned over from the forehead folded and pinned back often it was edged with gold On either side of the hood were hanging ornamental metal tipped tags to tie back the hood from the shoulders and this became in time that is at the end of the reign the ordinary manner of wearing them till they were finally made up so The ordinary head dress was of white linen crimped or embroidered in white made in a piece to hang over the shoulders and down the back folded back and stiffened in front to that peculiar triangular shape in fashion this was worn by the older women over a white hood The plain coif or close fitting linen cap was the most general wear for the poor and middle classes The hair was worn long and naturally over the shoulders by young girls and plainly parted in the centre and dressed close to the head by women wearing the large head dress Another form of head dress less common was the turban a loose bag of silk gold and pearl embroidered fitting over the hair and forehead tightly and loose above The gowns of the women were very simply cut having either a long train or no train at all these last cut to show the under skirt of some fine material the bodice of which showed above the over gown at the shoulders The ladies who wore the long gown generally had it lined with some fine fur and to prevent this dragging in the mud as also to show the elegance of their furs they fastened the train to a button or brooch placed at the back of the waistband This in time developed into the looped skirts of Elizabethan times Illustration The bodice of the gown was square cut and not very low having an ornamental border of fur embroidery or other rich coloured material sewn on to it This border went sometimes round the shoulders and down the front of the dress to below the knees Above the bodice was nearly always seen the V shaped opening of the under petticoat bodice and across and above that the white embroidered or crimped chemise The sleeves were as the men s tight all the way down from the shoulder to the wrist the cuffs coming well over the first joints of the fingers sometimes these cuffs are turned back to show elaborate linings or they were made tight at the shoulder and gradually looser until they became very full over the lower arm edged or lined with fur or soft silk or loose and baggy all the way from shoulder to hand Illustration At this time Bruges became world famed for her silken texture her satins were used in England for church garments and other clothes The damask silks were greatly in use and were nearly always covered with the peculiar semi Spanish pattern the base of which was some contortion of the pomegranate Some of these patterns were small and wonderfully fine depending on their wealth of detail for their magnificent appearance others were huge so that but few repeats of the design appeared on the dress Block printed linens were also in use and the samples in South Kensington will show how beautiful and artistic they were for all their simple design As Bruges supplied us with silks satins and velvets the last also beautifully damasked Ypres sent her linen to us and the whole of Flanders sent us painters and illuminators who worked in England at the last of the great illuminated books but this art died as printing and illustrating by wood blocks came in to take its place Nearly every lady had her own common linen and often other stuffs woven in her own house and the long winter evenings were great times for the sewing chambers where the lady and her maids sat at the looms To day one may see in Bruges the women at the cottage doors busy over their lace making and the English women by the sea making nets so in those times was every woman at her cottage door making coarse linens and other stuffs to earn her daily bread while my lady was sitting in her chamber weaving or embroidering a bearing cloth for her child against her time However the years of the Wars of the Roses had had their effect on every kind of English work and as the most elegant books were painted and written by Flemings as the finest linen came from Ypres the best silks and velvets from Bruges the great masters of painting from Florence Germany and Belgium so also the elaborate and wonderful embroidery for which we had been so famous died away and English work was but coarse at the best until in the early sixteen hundreds the new style came into use of raising figures some height above the ground work of the design and the rich embroidery of the Stuart times revived this art I have shown that this age was the age of fine patterns as some ages are ages of quaint cut and some of jewel laden dresses and some of dainty needlework A few ladies wore their gowns open to the waist to show the stomacher as the men did and open behind to the waist laced across the waist being embraced by a girdle of the shape so long in use with long ends and metal ornaments the girdle held the purse of the lady Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY VII fourteen eighty five fifteen oh nine Notice the diamond shaped head dress the wide fur edged gown with its full sleeves The illustrations given with this chapter show very completely the costume of this time and except in cases of royal persons or very gorgeously apparelled ladies they are complete enough to need no description The shoes it will be seen are very broad at the toes with thick soles sometimes made much in the manner of sandals that is with only a toecap the rest flat to be tied on by strings As this work is entirely for use it may be said that artists who have costumes made for them and costumiers who make for the stage hardly ever allow enough material for the gowns worn by men and women in this and other reigns where the heaviness and richness of the folds was the great keynote To make a gown of such a kind as these good ladies wore one needs at least twelve yards of material fifty two inches wide to give the right appearance It is possible to acquire at many of the best shops nowadays actual copies of embroidered stuffs velvets and damask silks of this time and of stuffs up to Early Victorian patterns and this makes it easy for painters to procure what in other days they were forced to invent Many artists have their costumes made of Bolton sheeting on to which they stencil the patterns they wish to use this is not a bad thing to do as sheeting is not dear and it falls into beautiful folds The older ladies and widows of this time nearly all dressed in very simple almost conventual garments many of them wearing the barbe of pleated linen which covered the lower part of the face and the chin a sort of linen beard it reached to the breast and is still worn by some religious orders of women Badges were still much in use and the servants always wore some form of badge on their left sleeve either merely the colours of their masters or a small silver or other metal shield Thus the badge worn by the servants of Henry VII would be either a greyhound a crowned hawthorn bush a red dragon a portcullis or the red and white roses joined together The last two were used by all the Tudors and the red rose and the portcullis are still used From these badges we get the signs of many of our inns either started by servants who used their master s badge for a device or because the inn lay on a certain property the lord of which carried chequers or a red dragon or a tiger s head I mentioned the silks of Bruges and her velvets without giving enough prominence to the fine velvets of Florence a sample of which a cope once used in Westminster Abbey is preserved at Stonyhurst College it was left by Henry VII to Our Monastery of Westminster and is of beautiful design a gold ground covered with boughs and leaves raised in soft velvet pile of ruby colour through which little loops of gold thread appear I imagine Elizabeth of York Queen to Henry VII of the subtle countenance gentle Elizabeth who died in child birth proceeding through London from the Tower to Westminster to her coronation the streets cleansed and the houses hung with tapestry arras and gold cloth the fine coloured dresses of the crowd the armoured soldiers all the rich estate of the company about her and the fine trappings of the horses Our Queen went to her coronation with some Italian masts paper flowers and some hundreds of thousands of yards of bunting and cheap flags the people mostly in sombre clothes the soldiers in ugly red stiff coats were the only colour of note passing down Whitehall past the hideous green stuck with frozen Members of Parliament to the grand wonderful Abbey which has seen so many Queens crowned HENRY THE EIGHTH Reigned thirty eight years fifteen oh nine fifteen forty seven Born fourteen ninety one Married fifteen oh nine Katherine of Aragon fifteen thirty two Anne Boleyn fifteen thirty six Jane Seymour fifteen forty Anne of Cleves fifteen forty Katherine Howard fifteen forty eight Katherine Parr THE MEN VERSES BY HENRY THE EIGHTH IN PRAISE OF CONSTANCY As the holy grouth grene with ivie all alone Whose flowerys cannot be seen and grene wode levys be gone Now unto my lady promyse to her I make From all other only to her I me betake Adew myne owne ladye adew my specyall Who hath my hart trewly be sure and ever shall So with songs and music of his own composition comes the richest man in Europe to the throne of England Gay brave tall full of conceit in his own strength Henry a king a Tudor a handsome man abounding in excellence of craft and art the inheritance from his father and mother figures in our pageant a veritable symbol of the Renaissance in England He had in common with the marvellous characters of that Springtime of History the quick intelligence and all the personal charm that the age brought forth in abundance In his reign the accumulated mass of brain all over the world budded and flowered the time gave to us a succession of the most remarkable people in any historical period and it is one of the triumphs of false reasoning to prove this in England to have been the result of the separation from the Catholic Church For centuries the Church had organized and prepared the ground in which this tree of the world s knowledge was planted had pruned cut back nursed the tree until gradually it flowered its branches spread over Christian Europe and when the flowering branch hanging over England gave forth its first fruits those men who ate of the fruit and benefited by the shade were the first to quarrel with the gardeners In these days there lived and died Botticelli Leonardo da Vinci Raphael Duerer Erasmus Holbein Copernicus Luther Rabelais and Michael Angelo to mention a few men of every shade of thought and in this goodly time came Henry to the English throne to leave at his death instead of the firm progress of order instituted by his father a bankrupt country with an enormously rich Government You may see for the later pictures of his reign a great bloated mass of corpulence with running ulcers on his legs and the blood of wives and people on his hands striding in his well known attitude over the festering slums his rule had produced in London Harry Grace a Dieu The mental picture from our costume point of view is widely different from that of the last reign No longer do we see hoods and cowls brown gray white and black in the streets no longer the throngs of fine craftsmen of church carvers gilders embroiderers candle makers illuminators missal makers all these served but to swell the ranks of the unemployed and caused a new problem to England never since solved of the skilled poor out of work The hospitals were closed that should bring a picture to your eyes where the streets had been thronged with the doctors of the poor and of the rich in their habits no monks or lay brothers were to be seen The sick the blind the insane had no home but the overhung back alleys where the foulest diseases might accumulate and hot beds of vice spring up while in the main streets Harry Tudor was carried to his bear baiting a quivering mass of jewels shaking on his corrupt body on his thumb that wonderful diamond the Regale of France stolen by him from the desecrated shrine of saint Thomas a Becket Illustration Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY VIII fifteen oh nine fifteen forty seven He wears the club toed shoes the white shirt embroidered in black silk the padded shoulders and the flat cap by which this reign is easily remembered Illustration There are two distinct classes of fashion to be seen the German Swiss fashion and the English fashion a natural evolution of the national dress The German fashion is that slashed extravagant looking creation which we know so well from the drawings of Albert Duerer and the more German designs of Holbein The garments which were known as blistered clothes are excessive growths on to the most extravagant designs of the Henry VII date The shirt cut low in the neck and sewn with black embroidery the little waistcoat ending at the waist and cut straight across from shoulder to shoulder tied with thongs of leather or coloured laces to the breeches leaving a gap between which showed the shirt the universal pouch on the breeches often highly decorated and jewelled From the line drawings you will see that the sleeves and the breeches took every form were of any odd assortment of colours were cut puffed and splashed all over so that the shirt might be pushed through the holes looking indeed blistered Illustration The shoes were of many shapes as I have shown agreeing in one point only that the toes should be cut very broad often indeed quite square Short or hanging hair both were the fashion and little flat caps with the rim cut at intervals or the large flat hats of the previous reign covered with feathers and curiously slashed were worn with these costumes Cloaks as you may see were worn over the dress and also those overcoats shaped much like the modern dressing gown It is from these blistered padded breeches that we derive the trunks of the next reign the slashings grown into long ribbon like slits the hose puffed at the knee Separate pairs of sleeves were worn with the waistcoats or with the petti cotes a favourite sleeve trimming being broad velvet bands The invention sprang as usual from necessity by vanity to custom In fourteen seventy seven the Swiss beat and routed the Duke of Burgundy at Nantes and the soldiers whose clothes were in rags cut and tore up his silk tents his banners all material they could find and made themselves clothes of these odd pieces clothes still so torn and ragged that their shirts puffed out of every hole and rent The arrival of the victorious army caused all the non fighters to copy this curious freak in clothes and the courtiers perpetuated the event by proclaiming blistering as the fashion The other and more usual fashion springs from the habit of clothes in bygone reigns Let us first take the shirt A It will be seen how in this reign the tendency of the shirt was to come close about the neck The previous reign showed us as a rule a shirt cut very low in the neck with the hem drawn together with laces these laces pulled more tightly together thus rucking the material into closer gathers caused the cut of the shirt to be altered and made so that the hem frilled out round the neck a collar in fact That this collar took all forms under certain limitations will be noticed also that thick necked gentlemen Henry himself must have invented this wore the collar of the shirt turned down and tied with strings of linen The cuffs of the shirt when they showed at the wrist were often as was the collar sewn with elaborate designs in black thread or silk Now we take the waistcoat B As you may see from the drawing showing the German form of dress this waistcoat was really a petti cote a waistcoat with sleeves This waistcoat was generally of richly ornamented material Henry in purple satin embroidered with his initials and the Tudor rose Henry in brocade covered with posies made in letters of fine gold bullion The material was slashed and puffed or plain and dependent for its effect on the richness of its embroidery or design of the fabric It was worn with or without sleeves in most cases the sleeves were detachable Illustration The coat C This coat was made with bases like a frock a skirted coat in fact the material used was generally plain of velvet fine cloth silk or satin The varieties of cut were numerous and are shown in the drawings open to the waist open all the way in front close to the neck every way where the coat was open in front it generally parted to show the bragetto or jewelled pouch It was a matter for choice spirits to decide whether or no they should wear sleeves to their coats or show the sleeves of their waistcoats No doubt Madame Fashion saw to it that the changes were rung sufficiently to make hay while the sun shone on extravagant tastes The coat was held at the waist with a sash of silk tied in a bow with short ends Towards the end of the reign foreshadowing the Elizabethan jerkin or jacket the custom grew more universal of the coat with sleeves and the high neck the bases were cut shorter to show the full trunks and the waistcoat was almost entirely done away with the collar grew in proportion and spread like the tail of an angry turkey in ruffle and folded pleat round the man s neck Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY VIII fifteen oh nine fifteen forty seven This is the extreme German English fashion In Germany and Switzerland this was carried to greater lengths The overcoat D is the gown of the previous reign cut for the dandy into a shorter affair reaching not far below the knee for the grave man it remained long but for all the collar had changed to a wide affair stretching well over the shoulders It was made this collar of such stuff as lined the cloak maybe it was of fur or of satin of silk or of cloth of gold The tremendous folds of these overcoats gave to the persons in them a sense of splendour and dignity the short sleeves of the fashionable overcoats puffed and swollen barred with rich applique designs or bars of fur reaching only to the elbow there to end in a hem of fur or some rich stuff the collar as wide as these padded shoulders all told in effect as garments which gave a great air of well being and richness to their owner Illustration Of course I suppose one must explain the sleeves varied in every way were long short full medium full according to taste Sometimes the overcoats were sleeveless Beneath these garments the trunks were worn loose little breeches which in the German style were bagged puffed rolled and slashed in infinite varieties Let it be noticed that the cutting of slashes was hardly ever a straight slit but in the curve of an elongated S or a double S curve Other slashes were squared top and bottom Illustration All men wore tight hose in some cases puffed at the knee in fact the bagging sagging and slashing of hose suggested the separate breeches or trunks of hose Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY VIII fifteen oh nine fifteen forty seven A plain but rich looking dress The peculiar head dress has a pad of silk in front to hold it from the forehead The half sleeves are well shown The shoes were very broad and were sometimes stuffed into a mound at the toes were sewn with precious stones and also were cut and puffed with silk Illustration The little flat cap will be seen in all its varieties in the drawings The Irish were forbidden by law to wear a shirt smock kerchor bendel neckerchor mocket a handkerchor or linen cap coloured or dyed with saffron or to wear in shirts or smocks above seven yards of cloth To wear black genet you must be royal to wear sable you must rank above a viscount to wear marten or velvet trimming you must be worth over two hundred marks a year Short hair came into fashion about fifteen twenty one Illustration So well known is the story of Sir Philip Calthrop and John Drakes the shoemaker of Norwich who tried to ape the fashion that I must here allude to this ancestor of mine who was the first of the dandies of note among persons not of the royal blood The story itself retold in every history of costume is to this effect Drakes the shoemaker seeing that the county talked of Sir Philip s clothes ordered a gown from the same tailor This reached the ears of Sir Philip who then ordered his gown to be cut as full of slashes as the shears could make it The ruin of cloth so staggered the shoemaker that he vowed to keep to his own humble fashion in future No doubt Sir Philip s slashes were cunningly embroidered round and the gown made rich and sparkling with the device of seed pearls so much in use This man s son also Sir Philip married Amy daughter of Sir William Boleyn of Blickling Norfolk She was aunt to Queen Anne Boleyn THE WOMEN One cannot call to mind pictures of this time without in the first instance seeing the form of Henry rise up sharply before us followed by his company of wives The fat uxorious giant comes straight to the front of the picture he dominates the age pictorially and as a fitting background one sees the six women who were sacrificed on the political altar to pander to his vanity Katherine of Aragon the fine and noble lady a tool of political desires cast off after Henry had searched his precious conscience after eighteen years of married life to find that he had scruples as to the spirituality of the marriage Anne Boleyn tainted with the life of the Court a pitiful figure in spite of all her odious crimes how often must a ghost in a black satin nightdress edged with black velvet have haunted the royal dreams And the rest of them clustered round the vain king while in the background the great figures of the time loom hugely as they play with the crowned puppets Illustration The note of the time as we look at it with our eyes keen on the picture is the final evolution of the hood Bit by bit inch by inch the plain fabric has become enriched each succeeding step in an elaboration of the simple form the border next to the face is turned back then the hood is lined with fine stuff and the turnover shows this to advantage then the sides are split and the back is made more full then a tag is sewn on to the sides by which means the cut side may be fastened off the shoulders The front is now stiffened and shaped at an angle this front is sewn with jewels and as the angle forms a gap between the forehead and the point of the hood a pad is added to fill in the vacant space At last one arrives at the diamond shaped head dress worn in this reign and in this reign elaborated in every way elaborated in fact out of existence In order to make the head dress in its fifteen oh nine state you must make the white lining with the jewelled turnover as a separate cap However I think that the drawings speak for themselves more plainly than I can write Illustration Every device for crowding jewels together was used criss cross in groups of small numbers in great masses Pendants were worn hung upon jewelled chains that wound twice round the neck once close to the neck the second loop loose and passed as a rule under the lawn shift Large brooches decorated the bodices brooches with drop ornaments the body of the brooch of fine gold workmanship many of them wrought in Italy The shift delicately embroidered with black silk had often a band of jewellery upon it and this shift was square cut following the shape of the bodice The bodice of the gown was square cut and much stiffened to a box like shape The sleeves of the gown were narrow at the shoulders and after fitting the arm for about six inches down from the shoulders they widened gradually until just below the elbow they became square and very full in this way they showed the false under sleeve This under sleeve was generally made of a fine rich patterned silk or brocade the same stuff which formed the under gown the sleeve was a binding for the very full lawn or cambric sleeve which showed in a ruffle at the wrist and in great puffs under the forearm The under sleeve was really more like a gauntlet as it was generally held together by buttoned tags it was puffed with other coloured silk slashed to show the shift or it might be plain Now the sleeve of the gown was subject to much alteration It was as I have described made very square and full at the elbow and over this some ladies wore a false sleeve of gold net you may imagine the length to which net will go studied with jewels crossed in many ways twisted into patterns sewn on to the sleeve in sloping lines but besides this the sleeve was turned back to form a deep square cuff which was often made of black or coloured velvet or of fur Illustration In all this I am taking no account of the German fashions which I must describe separately Look at the drawings I have made of the German fashion I find that they leave me dumb mere man has but a limited vocabulary when the talk comes to clothes and these dresses that look like silk pumpkins blistered and puffed and slashed sewn in ribs swollen and altogether so queer are beyond the furious dashes that my pen makes at truth and millinery The costumes of the people of this age have grown up in the minds of most artists as being inseparable from the drawings of Holbein and Duerer Illustration Surely I say to myself most people who will read this will know their Holbein and Duerer between whom there lies a vast difference but who between them show the one the estate of England and the other those most German fashions which had so powerful an influence upon our own Both these men show the profusion of richness the extravagant follies of the dress of their time how to use the words of Pliny We penetrate into the bowels of the earth digging veins of gold and silver and ores of brass and lead we seek also for gems and certain little pebbles Driving galleries into the depths we draw out the bowels of the earth that the gems we seek may be worn on the finger How many hands are wasted in order that a single joint may sparkle If any hell there were it had assuredly ere now been disclosed by the borings of avarice and luxury Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF HENRY VIII fifteen oh nine fifteen forty seven Notice the wide cuffs covered with gold network and the rich panel of the under skirt Illustration Or in the writings of Tertullian called by Sigismund Feyerabendt citizen and printer of Frankfort a most strict censor who most severely blames women Come now says Tertullian if from the first both the Milesians sheared sheep and the Chinese spun from the tree and the Tyrians dyed and the Phrygians embroidered and the Babylonians inwove and if pearls shone and rubies flashed if gold itself too came up from the earth with the desire for it and if now too no lying but the mirror s were allowed Eve I suppose would have desired these things on her expulsion from Paradise and when spiritually dead One sees by the tortured and twisted German fashion that the hair was plaited and so in curves and twists dropped into coarse gold web nets thrust into web nets with velvet pouches to them so that the hair stuck out behind in a great knob or at the side in two protuberances over all a cap like to the man s but that it was infinitely more feathered and jewelled Then again they wore those hideous barbes or beard like linen cloths over the chin and an infinite variety of caps of linen upon their heads caps which showed always the form of the head beneath Illustration In common with the men their overcoats and cloaks were voluminous and needed to be so if those great sleeves had to be stuffed into them fur collars or silk collars with facings to match were rolled over to show little or great expanses of these materials Here to show what dainty creatures were our lady ancestors to show from what beef and blood and bone we come I give you keep your eye meanwhile upon the wonderful dresses the daily allowance of a Maid of Honour Every morning at breakfast one chyne of beef from the kitchen one chete loaf and one maunchet at the pantry bar and one gallon of ale at the buttery bar For dinner a piece of beef a stroke of roast and a reward from the kitchen A caste of chete bread from the pantry bar and a gallon of ale at the buttery bar Afternoon should they suffer the pangs of hunger a maunchet of bread from the pantry bar and a gallon of ale at the buttery bar Supper a messe of pottage a piece of mutton and a reward from the kitchen A caste of chete bread from the pantry bar and a gallon of ale at the buttery bar After supper to insure a good night s rest a chete loaf and a maunchet from the pantry bar and half a gallon of ale from the seller bar Four and a half gallons of ale I wonder did they drink it all themselves All this and down in the mornings in velvets and silks with faces as fresh as primroses It is the fate of all articles of clothing or adornment naturally tied or twisted or folded and pinned by the devotees of fashion to become after some little time made up ready made into the shapes which had before some of the owner s mood and personality about them These hoods worn by the women these wide sleeves to the gowns these hanging sleeves to the overcoats the velvet slip of under dress all in their time became falsified into ready made articles With the hoods you can see for yourselves how they lend themselves by their shape to personal taste they were made up all ready sewn where pins had been used the folds of velvet at the back were made steadfast the crimp of the white linen was determined the angle of the side flap ruled by some unwritten law of mode In the end by a process of evolution the diamond shape disappeared and the cap was placed further back on the head the contour being circular where it had previously been pointed The velvet hanging piece remained at the back of the head but was smaller in one piece and was never pinned up and the entire shape gradually altered towards and finally into the well known Mary Queen of Scots head dress with which every reader must be familiar Illustration It has often occurred to me while writing this book that the absolute history of one such head dress would be of more help than these isolated remarks which have to be dropped only to be taken up in another reign but I have felt that after all the arrangement is best as it stands because we can follow if we are willing the complete wardrobe of one reign into the next without mixing the two up It is difficult to keep two interests running together but I myself have felt when reading other works on the subject that the way in which the various articles of clothing are mixed up is more disturbing than useful The wide sleeve to the gown once part and parcel of the gown was at last made separate from it as a cuff more than a sleeve naturally widening and in the next reign among the most fashionable left out altogether The upper part of the dress once cut low and square to show the under dress or a vest of other stuff was now made towards the end of the reign with a false top of other stuff so replacing the under dress Lacing was carried to extremes so that the body was pinched into the hard roll like appearance always identified with this time on the other hand many wiser women I should say were this the place for morals preferred to lace loose and show beneath the lacing the colour of the under dress Many were the varieties of girdle and belt from plain silk sashes with tasselled ends to rich jewelled chain girdles ending in heavy ornaments For detail one can do no better than go to Holbein the master of detail and to day when photographs of pictures are so cheap and lives of painters copiously illustrated are so easily attainable at low prices it is the finest education not only in painting but in Tudor atmosphere and in matters of dress to go straightway and study the master that master who touched without intention on the moral of his age when he painted a miniature of the Blessed Thomas More on the back of a playing card EDWARD THE SIXTH Reigned six years fifteen forty seven fifteen fifty three Born fifteen thirty seven THE MEN AND WOMEN Illustration Here we have a reign which from its very shortness can hardly be expected to yield us much in the way of change yet it shows by very slight movements that form of growth which preludes the great changes to come I think I may call a halt here and proceed to tell you why this volume is commenced with Henry VII called the Tudor and Stuart volume

none	none	 Fairholt who is very good in many ways puts down in his glossary Partlet A gorget for women Then he goes on to say that a partlet may be goodness knows what else Minshein says they are part of a man s attire as the loose collar of a doublet to be set on or taken off by itself without the bodies as the picadillies now a daies or as mens bands or womens neckerchiefs which are in some or at least have been within memorie called partlets Sir F Madden says The partlet evidently appears to have been the corset or habit shirt worn at that period and which so commonly occurs in the portraits of the time generally made of velvet and ornamented with precious stones Illustration A MAN AND WOMAN OF THE TIME OF EDWARD VI fifteen forty seven fifteen fifty three The change from the dress of the previous reign should be easily noticed especially in the case of the woman This dress is of course of the plainest in this time Hall the author of Satires fifteen ninety eight speaks of a man an effeminate dandy as wearing a partlet strip It appears to me who am unwillingly forced into judging between so many learned persons that from all I have been able to gather from contemporary records and papers the partlet is indeed as Minshein says the loose collar of a doublet in reality the same thing as a shirt band Illustration Henry VIII wore a band about his neck the forerunner of the ruff Some of his bands were of silver cloth with ruffs to them others as I have shown were wonderfully embroidered In this case then the partlet is head of the family tree to our own collar to be set on or taken off by itself and so by way of ruff valued at threescore pound price apiece 
5233-39051-0014	train-other-500	to plain bands to falling bands laced neckcloth stock to the nine pennyworth of misery we bolt around our necks Dress on the whole is much plainer sleeves are not so full of cuts and slashes and they fit more closely to the arm
5233-39051-0015	train-other-500	The materials are rich but the ornament is not so lavish the portrait of Edward by Gwillim Stretes is a good example of ornament rich but simple Shoes are not cut about at the toe quite with the same splendour but are still broad in the toe
5233-39051-0016	train-other-500	For the women it may be said that the change towards simplicity is even more marked The very elaborate head dress the folded diamond shaped French hood has disappeared almost entirely and for the rich
5233-39051-0017	train-other-500	the half hoop set back from the forehead with a piece of velvet or silk to hang down the back will best describe the head gear
none	none	 From that to the centre pointed hoop shows the trend of the shape This latest form of woman s head apparel was born I think out of the folds of the linen cap worn in the house and this being repeated in the velvet night caps became the extreme of fashion The drawing will show how the square end of the linen cap falling in the centre of the circular cap shape cut the semicircle and overlapped it thus giving the appearance later to become exaggerated into a form cut especially to that shape I try to be as lucid as I can manage but the difficulties of describing such evolutions in any but tangled language I leave the reader to imagine Illustration The women are also wearing cloth hoods rather baggy cap like hoods with a hanging piece behind The most notable change is the collar of the gown which suddenly springs into existence It is a high collar and very open in front showing a piece of the under dress On this collar is sewn what I shall call the woman s partlet 
5233-39051-0018	train-other-500	as the embroidery is often detachable and answers the same purpose as the man s partlet this later became a separate article and was under propped with wires to hold it out stiffly
none	none	 The same stiff bodied appearance holds good but in more simple dresses the skirts were not quite as voluminous as heretofore With overcoats in general the hanging sleeve is being worn the arm of the wearer coming out just below the puffed shoulder piece With these remarks we may safely go on to the reign of Mary another reign which does not yield us much in the way of clothes MARY Reigned five years fifteen fifty three fifteen fifty eight Born fifteen sixteen Married fifteen fifty four Philip of Spain THE MEN AND WOMEN I cannot do better than commence this chapter by taking you back to the evening of August three fifteen fifty three Mary with her half sister Elizabeth entered London on this date At Aldgate she was met by the Mayor of London who gave her the City sword From the Antiquarian Repertory comes this account First the citizens children walked before her magnificently dressed after followed gentlemen habited in velvets of all sorts some black others in white yellow violet and carnation others wore satins or taffety and some damasks of all colours having plenty of gold buttons afterwards followed the Mayor with the City Companies and the chiefs or masters of the several trades after them the Lords richly habited and the most considerable knights next came the ladies married and single in the midst of whom was the Queen herself mounted on a small white ambling nag the housings of which were fringed with gold thread about her were six lacqueys habited in vests of gold The Queen herself was dressed in violet velvet and was then about forty years of age and rather fresh coloured Before her were six lords bareheaded each carrying in his hand a yellow mace and some others bearing the arms and crown Behind her followed the archers as well of the first as the second guard She was followed by her sister named Madame Elizabeth in truth a beautiful Princess who was also accompanied by ladies both married and single In the crowds about the city waiting to stare at the new Queen as she passed by one could recognise the various professions by their colours The trained bands in white doublets with the City arms before and behind lawyers in black sheriffs and aldermen in furred gowns with satin sleeves citizens in brown cloaks and workers in cloth or leather doublets citizens servants in blue liveries gentlemen s servants in very gorgeous liveries of their masters colours Here is a description of a gentleman s page and his clothes One doublet of yelow million fustian th one halfe buttoned with peche colour buttons and the other half laced downwards one payer of peche colour laced with smale tawnye lace a graye hat with a copper edge rounde about it with a band p cell of the same hatt a payer of watchet blue stockings Likewise he hath twoe clokes th one of vessey colour garded with twoe yards of black clothe and twisted lace of carnacion colour and lyned with crymsone bayes and th other is a red shipp russet colour striped about th cape and down the fore face twisted with two rows of twisted lace russet and gold buttons afore and uppon the shoulder being of the clothe itself set with the said twisted lace and the buttons of russet silk and gold This will give some notion of the elaborate liveries worn and also it will show how having understood the forms of the garments and the material which may be used the rest ornament and fancy depend on the sense of the reader A change has come over the streets the town is full of Spaniards come over with Philip and these bring with them many innovations in dress The most noticeable is the high peaked Spanish hat a velvet bag with a narrow brim worn on one side of the head There is also a hard crowned hat round the crown base of which is a gold cord clasped by a jewel a feather is stuck into this hat Yet the mass of citizens wear the flat cap some of them the older men have a coif tied under their chins and over this the flat cap Again older men wear black velvet skull caps Illustration With these Spaniards comes also the first appearance of the ruff very neat and small Although the overcoats of Henry s and Edward s reigns still form the principal wear the short Spanish cloak has come in cut in full folds and reaching not far below the waist They also brought in the cloak with a turned up high collar and some had sleeves to their cloaks Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF MARY fifteen fifty three fifteen fifty eight The half way between the dress of fifteen thirty and fifteen sixty A cloak very much of the period and a tunic in the state of evolution towards the doublet One sees more beards and moustaches short clipped beards and beards with two points Shoes are now more to the shape of the foot and high boots strapped up over the knee also half boots with the tops turned over to be seen Often where the hose meet the trunks these are turned down Illustration The doublets become shaped more closely to the body all showing the gradual change towards the Elizabethan costume but still retaining the characteristics of earlier times as the long skirt to the doublet and the opening to show the collar of the shirt or partlet strip Ladies now show more hair parted as before in the centre but now puffed out at the sides The new shape of head dress becomes popular and the upstanding collar to the gown is almost universal The gowns themselves though retaining the same appearance as before full skirts no trains big sleeves and split to show the under gown have the top part of the gown covering the bosom made of a separate material as for instance a gown of fine cloth will have collar and yoke of velvet Women wear neat linen caps made very plain and close to the head with small ear pieces Illustration On the shoulders there is a fashion of wearing kerchiefs of linen or silk white as a rule white in fact is frequently used for dresses both for men and women The custom of carrying small posies of flowers comes in and it is interesting to see the Queen in her portrait by Antonio More carrying a bunch of violets arranged exactly as the penny bunches sold now in our streets There was in most dresses a great profusion of gold buttons and the wearing of gold chains was common in fact a gold chain about the neck for a man and a gold chain girdle for a woman were part of the ordinary everyday dress Illustration You will realize that to one born in the reign of Henry VIII the appearance of people now was very different and to anyone as far away as we are now the intervening reigns of Edward and Mary are interesting as showing the wonderful quiet change that could take place in those few years and alter man s exterior from the appearance of a playing card stiff square blob footed to the doublet and hose person with a cart wheel of a ruff which recalls to us Elizabethan dress Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF QUEEN MARY fifteen fifty three fifteen fifty eight The habit of wearing flowers in the opening of the dress was frequent at this time was in fact begun about this reign One can easily see in this dress the ground work of the Elizabethan fashion the earliest of which was an exaggeration of this costume ELIZABETH Reigned forty five years fifteen fifty eight sixteen oh three THE MEN Illustration Here we are in the middle of great discoveries with adventurers with Calvin and Michael Angelo living and dying and Galileo and Shakespeare seeing light in the very centre and heart of these things and we and they discussing the relations of the law to linen How they and we ask are breeches and slop hose cut in panes to be lined In such writings we are bound to concern ourselves with the little things that matter and in this reign we meet a hundred little things little fussy things the like of which we leave alone to day But this is not quite true To day a man whether he cares to admit it or no is for ever choosing patterns colours shades styles to suit his own peculiar personality From the cradle to the grave we are decked with useless ornaments bibs sashes frills little jackets neat ties different coloured boots clothes of ceremony clothes supposed to be in harmony with the country down at last to the clothes of an old gentleman keeping a vague reminder of twenty thirty years ago in their style and then grave clothes How well we know the Elizabethan He is a stock figure in our imagination he figured in our first schoolboy romances he strutted in the first plays we saw Because it was an heroic time we hark back to it to visualize it as best we may so that we can come nearer to our heroes Drake Raleigh and the rest The very names of the garments arouse associations ruff trunks jumper doublet jerkin cloak bone bobbin lace and lace of Flanders they almost take one s breath away Here comes a gentleman in a great ruff yellow starched an egg shaped pearl dangles from one ear One hand rests on his padded hip the other holds a case of toothpicks and a napkin he is going to his tavern to dine His doublet is bellied like a pea s cod and his breeches are bombasted his little hat is stuck on one side and the feather in it curls over the brim His doublet is covered with a herring bone pattern in silk stitches and is slashed all over He is exaggerated monstrous he is tight laced his trunks stick out a foot all round him and his walk is in consequence a little affected but for all that he is a gallant figure Illustration Behind him comes a gentleman in loose knee breeches barred with velvet at the knee he has a frill of lace His jerkin is not stuffed out and his ruff is not starched to stick up round his head His hair is cut in three points one over each ear and the third over the centre of his forehead where we see a twisted lock tied with ribbon We seem to know these people well very well The first whose clothes are of white silk sewn with red and blue whose trunk hose have clocks of silk sewn on them reminds us of whom And the second gentleman in green and red with heels of red on his shoes Suddenly there flashes across our memory the picture of a lighted stage a row of shops a policeman and then a well known voice calling Hello Joey here we are again Here we are again after all these centuries clown and pantaloon the rustic with red health on his face the old man in Venetian slops saint Pantaloone just as Elizabethan humour included as anything can well be Then enter Harlequin in his clothes of gorgeous patches the quick almost invisible thief the instigator of all the evil and magic His patches and rags have grown to symmetrical pattern his loose doublet has become this tight fitting lizard skin of flashing gold and colours but his atmosphere recalls the great days To these enter eighteen thirty Columbine an early Victorian lady who contrives to look sweetly modest in the shortest and frilliest of skirts she looks like a rose a rose on two pink stalks She being so different gives the picture just the air of magic incongruity Once years ago she was dressed in rags like Harlequin but I suppose that the age of sentiment clothed her in her ballet costume rather than see her in her costly tatters We are a conservative nation and we like our own old jokes so much that we have kept through the ages this extraordinary pleasing entertainment straight down clothes and all from the days of Queen Elizabeth Even as we dream of this and the harlequinade dazzles our eyes the dream changes a new sound is heard a sound from the remote past too We listen eagerly clown pantaloon harlequin and columbine vanish to the sound of the pan pipes and the voice of Punch Root ti toot rootity toot There by the corner of the quiet square is a tall box covered with checkered cloth Above a man s height is an opening and on a tiny stage are two figures one in a doublet stiffened out like a pea pod with a ruff hanging loose about his neck bands at his wrists a cap on his head Punch The other with a linen cap and a ruff round her neck Judy Below on the ground by the gentleman who bangs a drum and blows on the pan pipes stuck in his muffler is a dog with a ruff round his neck Toby And we know delightful to think of it that a box hidden by the check covering contains many curiously dressed figures all friends of ours The world is certainly curious and I suppose that an Elizabethan revisiting us to day would find but one thing the same the humour of the harlequinade and the Punch and Judy show Now let us get to the dull part If you wish to swim in a sea of allusions there are a number of books into which you may dive Microcynicon Pleasant Quippes for Upstart Newfangled Gentlewomen Hall s Satires Stubbes Anatomie of Abuses The Cobbler s Prophesie The Debate between Pride and Lowliness The Letting of Humours Blood in the Head Vaine The Wits Nurserie Euphues Golden Legacie Every Man out of his Humour If you do not come out from these saturated with detail then you will never absorb anything For the shapes the doublet was a close fitting garment cut if in the Italian fashion down to a long peak in front They were made without sleeves like a waistcoat and an epaulette overhung the armhole The sleeves were tied into the doublet by means of points ribbons with metal tags These doublets were for a long time stuffed or bombasted into the form known as pea s cod bellied or shotten bellied The jerkin was a jacket with sleeves and was often worn over the doublet The sleeves of the jerkin were often open from shoulder to wrist to show the doublet sleeve underneath These sleeves were very wide and were ornamented with large buttons Illustration The jornet was a loose travelling cloak The jumper a loose jerkin worn for comfort or extra clothing in winter Both doublet and jerkin had a little skirt or base Illustration The very wide breeches known as trunks were worn by nearly everybody in the early part of the reign until they vied with Venetian breeches for fashion They were sometimes made of a series of wide bands of different colours placed alternately sometimes they were of bands showing the stuffed trunk hose underneath They were stuffed with anything that came handy wool rags or bran and were of such proportions that special seats were put in the Houses of Parliament for the gentlemen who wore them The fashion at its height appears to have lasted about eight years Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF ELIZABETH fifteen fifty eight sixteen oh three He wears a double linen collar nearly as usual at this time as the ruff His trunk hose will be seen through the openings of his trunks His boots are held up by two leather straps His cloak is an Italian fashion The Venetian breeches were very full at the top and narrowed to the knee they were slashed and puffed or paned like lattice windows with bars of coloured stuffs or gold lace The French breeches were tight and ruffled in puffs about the thighs The stockings were of yarn or silk or wool They were gartered about the knee and pulled up over the breeches but the man most proud of his leg wore no garters but depended on the shape of his leg and the fit of his stocking to keep the position These stockings were sewn with clocks at the ankles and had various patterns on them sometimes of gold or silver thread Openwork stockings were known Illustration The stockings and breeches were called if the breeches were short and the stockings all the way up the leg trunk hose and trunks if the breeches came to the knee and the stockings just came over them they were known as upper stocks and nether stocks The shoes were shaped to the foot and made of various leathers or stuffs a rose of ribbon sometimes decorated the shoes There were shoes with high cork soles called moyles Of course there were gallants who did things no one else thought of doing wearing very square toed shoes for instance or cock feathers in their hair The sturtops were boots to the ankle Illustration As for the hair we have the love lock tied with ribbons the very same that we see caricatured in the wigs of clown and pantaloon We have also hair left fairly long and brushed straight back from the forehead and short cropped hair Beards and moustaches are worn by most They wore little cloaks covered with embroidery lace sometimes even with pearls For winter or for hard travelling the jornet or loose cloak was worn The older and more sedate wore long stuff gowns with hanging sleeves these gowns made to fit at the waist and over the trunks gave an absurd Noah s ark like appearance to the wearers Those who cared nothing for the fashions left their gowns open and wore them loose Illustration The common people wore simple clothes of the same cut as their lords trunks or loose trousers long hose and plain jerkins or doublets In the country the fashions alter as a rule but little however in this reign Corydon goes to meet Sylvia in somewhat fashionable clothes Lodge says His holiday suit marvellous seemly in a russet jacket welted with the same and faced with red worsted having a pair of blue camblet sleeves bound at the wrists with four yellow laces closed before very richly with a dozen pewter buttons His hose of gray kersey with a large slop barred all across the pocket holes with three fair guards stitched on either side with red thread His stockings are also gray kersey tied with different coloured laces his bonnet is green and has a copper brooch with the picture of saint Dennis And to want nothing that might make him amorous in his old days he had a fair shirt band of white lockeram whipt over with Coventry blue of no small cost Illustration The hats worn vary in shape from steeple crowned narrow brimmed hats to flat broad crowned hats others show the coming tendency towards the broad brimmed Jacobean hat Round these hats were hatbands of every sort gold chains ruffled lace silk or wool Illustration I think we may let these gallants rest now to walk among the shades a walking geography of clothes they are with French doublets German hose Spanish hats and cloaks Italian ruffs Flemish shoes and these with chalked faces fuzzed periwigs of false hair partlet strips wood busks to keep straight slim waists will make the shades laugh perhaps or perhaps only sigh for there are many in that dim wardrobe of fashions who are still more foolish still more false than these Elizabethans THE WOMEN Now this is the reign of the ruff and the monstrous hoop and the wired hair As a companion to her lord who came from the hands of his barber with his hair after the Italian manner short and round and curled in front and frizzed or like a Spaniard long hair at his ears curled at the two ends or with a French love lock dangling down his shoulders she his lady sits under the hands of her maid and tries various attires of false hair principally of a yellow colour Every now and again she consults the looking glass hanging on her girdle sometimes she dresses her hair with chains of gold from which jewels or gold work tassels hang sometimes she too allows a love lock to rest upon her shoulder or fall negligently on her ruff Even the country girl eagerly waits for news of the town fashions and follows them as best she may In the early part of the reign the simple costume of the previous reign was still worn and even the court ladies were quietly though richly dressed In the first two years the ruff remained a fairly small size and was made of holland which remained stiff and held the folds well but later there entered several Dutch ladies headed by Mistress Dingham Vander Plasse of Flanders in fifteen sixty four who taught her pupils the art of starching cambric and the art of folding cutting and pinching ruffs at five pounds a head and the art of making starch at the price of one pound First the lady put on her underpropper of wire and holland and then she would place with a great nicety her ruff of lace or linen or cambric One must understand that the ruff may be great or small that only the very fashionable wore such a ruff as required an underpropper and that the starched circular ruff would stand by itself without the other appliance Illustration Before the advent of the heavily jewelled and embroidered stomacher and the enormous spread of skirt the dress was a modification of that worn by the ladies in the time of Henry VIII First a gown cut square across the bosom and low over the shoulders full sleeves ending in bands of cambric over the hands these sleeves slit to show puffs of cambric from the elbow to the wrist the skirt full and long but without any train the whole fitted well to the figure as far as the waist and very stiff in front Over this a second gown generally of plain material split above in a V shape split below at the waist and cut away to show the under gown The sleeves of this gown were wide and were turned back or cut away just by the elbow Both gowns were laced up the back This second gown had as a rule a high standing collar which was lined with some rich silk or with lace Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF ELIZABETH fifteen fifty eight sixteen oh three Illustration This shape gave way to a more exaggerated form and finally to many varieties of exaggeration The lady might wear a jerkin like in shape to a man s except that often it was cut low and square over the bosom and was not stuffed quite so much in front every variety of rich material was used for this jerkin and the sleeves were as varied as were the man s split and tied with ribbons False sleeves attached at the shoulders and left to hang loose puffed slashed all over with or without bands of cambric or lace at the wrists these bands sometimes were frills sometimes stiffened and turned back No person except royalty might wear crimson except in under garments and the middle class were not allowed to wear velvet except for sleeves This jerkin was sometimes worn buttoned up like a man s to the neck and when the hoops came into fashion and were worn high up near the waist the basque or flounce at the bottom of the jerkin was made long and pleated full to the top of the hooped petticoat The plainer fashion of this was a gown buttoned high up to the ruff and opened from the waist to the feet to show a full petticoat of rich material this was the general wear of the more sober minded Sometimes a cape was worn over the head and shoulders not a shaped cape but a plain oblong piece of stuff The ladies sometimes wore the shaped cape with the high collar that the men wore The French hood with a short liripipe was worn by country ladies this covered the hair showing nothing but a neat parting in front The openwork lace bonnet of the shape so well known by the portraits of Queen Mary of Scotland is not possible to exactly describe in writing one variety of it may be seen in the line drawing given It is made of cambric and cut lace sewn on to wires bent into the shape required Illustration In such a time of extravagance in fashion the additions one may make to any form of dress in the way of ribbons bows sewn pearls cuts slashes and puffs are without number and I can only give the structure on which such ornamental fripperies can be placed The hair for example can be dressed with pearls rings of gold strings of pearls feathers or glass ornaments Men and women wore monstrous earrings but curiously enough this fashion was more common to men than women Hats were interchangeable more especially the trim hat with a feather in shape like those worn by the Yeoman of the Guard but smaller The shoulder pinions of the jerkins were puffed slashed and beribboned in every way The wing sleeves open from the shoulder all the way down were so long sometimes as to reach the ground and were left hanging in front or thrown back over the shoulders the better to display the rich under sleeve The ladies shoes were cork soled high heeled and round toed The girdles were of every stuff from gold cord curiously knotted to twisted silk from these hung looking glasses and in them were stuck the embroidered and scented gloves Ladies went masked about the streets and in the theatres or if they wished to be unconventional they sat in the playing booths unmasked their painted faces exposed to the public gaze The shoes with the high cork soles to which I have just alluded were in common use all over Europe and were of all heights from two inches to seven or eight and they were called chopines They were not such a foolish custom as might appear for they protected the wearer from the appalling filth of the streets The tall chopines that Hamlet mentions were really very high soled slippers into which the richly embroidered shoes were placed to protect them when the ladies walked abroad The shoes were made of leather and velvet stitched with silk embroidered with gold or stamped with patterns slashed sometimes and sometimes laced with coloured silk laces Some ladies wore bombazines or a silk and cotton stuff made at Norwich and bone lace made at Honiton both at that time the newest of English goods although before made in Flanders and they imported Italian lace and Venetian shoes stuffed their stomachers with bombast and wore a frontlet on their French hoods called a bongrace to keep their faces from sunburn Cambric they brought from Cambrai in France and calico from Calicut in India the world was hunted high and low for spoil to deck these gorgeous stiff buckramed people so that under all this load of universal goods one might hardly hope to find more than a clothes prop in fact one might more easily imagine the overdressed figure to be a marvellous marionette than a decent Englishwoman Illustration Illustration Falstaff will not wear coarse dowlas shirts dandies call for ostrich feathers ladies must have Coventry blue gowns and Italian flag shaped fans everybody is in the fashion from milkmaids to ladies of the court each as best as they may manage it The Jew moves about the streets in his long gaberdine and yellow cap the lady pads about her garden in tall chopines and the gentleman sits down as well as he may in his bombasted breeches and smokes Herbe de la Reine in a pipe of clay and the country woman walks along in her stamell red petticoat guarded or strapped with black or rides past to market in her over guard skirts Let us imagine by way of a picture of the times the Queen in her bedchamber under the hands of her tiring women She is sitting before a mirror in her embroidered chemise of fine Raynes linen in her under linen petticoat and her silk stockings with the gold thread clocks Over these she wears a rich wrap Slippers are on her feet In front of her on a table are rouge and chalk and a pad of cotton wool already she has made up her face and her bright bird like eyes shine in a painted mask her strong face her hawk like nose and her expressionless mouth reflect back at her from the mirror Beside the rouge pot is a Nuremberg egg watch quietly ticking in its crystal case One of the women brings forward a number of attires of false hair golden and red and from these the Queen chooses one It is a close periwig of tight red curls among which pearls and pieces of burnished metal shine With great care this wig is fastened on to the Queen s head and she watches the process with her bright eyes and still features in the great mirror Then when this wig is fixed to her mind she rises and is helped into the privie coat of bones and buckram which is laced tightly by the women at her back Now comes the moment when they are about to fasten on her whalebone hips the great farthingale over which her voluminous petticoats and skirts will fall The wheel of bone is tied with ribbons about her waist and there securely fastened After some delay in choosing an under gown she then puts on several linen petticoats one over another to give the required fulness to her figure and then comes the stiffly embroidered under gown in this case but a petticoat with a linen bodice which has no sleeves Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF ELIZABETH fifteen fifty eight sixteen oh three Compare this with the other plate showing the opposite fashion With great care she seats herself on a broad chair and a perfect army of ruffs is laid before her As the tire woman is displaying the ruffs she talks to the Queen and tells her that peculiar story then current of the Lady of Antwerp who was in a great way because she could not get her ruff to set aright and when in a passion she called upon the devil to take it as if in answer to the summons a young and handsome gentleman appeared Together they tried the ruff and the young gentleman suddenly strangled the lady and vanished Now when they came to carry away the coffin of the lady some days later it was found that no one could lift it so in the end it was opened and there to the surprise of everybody sat a great black cat setting a ruff The Queen s eyes twinkle on this story for she has a great fund of dry humour and so to the business of the ruffs First one and then another is discarded and finally the choice falls between one of great size shaped like a catherine wheel and starched blue and the other of three depths but not of such great circumference starched yellow after the receipt of missus Turner afterwards hung at Tyburn in a ruff of the same colour The Queen wavers and the tire woman recommends the smaller bands This madame is one of those ruffs made by mister Higgins the tailor near to saint James s where he has set up an establishment for the making of such affairs it is a picadillie and would The Queen stops her and chooses the ruff it is very much purled into folds and it bristles with points The women approach with a crimson over gown and slips it over the Queen s head it is open in front to show the rich petticoat and it has great stuffed wings epaulettes or mahoitres on the shoulders The tight fitting bodice of the gown is buttoned up to the throat and is stuffed out in front to meet the fall of the hoops it has falling sleeves but the real sleeves are now brought and tied to the points attached to the shoulders of the gown They are puffed sleeves of the same material as the under gown and the falling sleeves of the upper gown are now tied with one or two bows across them so that the effect of the sleeves is much the same as the effect of the skirts an embroidered stuff showing in the opening of a plain material These are called virago sleeves This done the strings of pearls are placed around the Queen s neck and then the underpropper or supportasse of wire and holland is fastened on her neck and the picadillie ruff laid over it The Queen exchanges her slippers for cork soled shoes stands while her girdle is knotted sees that the looking glass fan and pomander are hung upon it and then after a final survey of herself in the glass she calls for her muckinder or handkerchief and Queen Elizabeth is dressed So in this manner the Queen struts down to posterity a wonderful woman in ridiculous clothes and in her train we may dimly see mister Higgins the tailor who named a street without knowing it a street known in every part of the civilized world but nowadays one hardly thinks of connecting Piccadilly with a lace ruff SHAKESPEARE AND CLOTHES There are not so many allusions to Elizabethan dress in the plays of Shakespeare as one might suppose upon first thought One has grown so accustomed to Shakespeare put on the stage in elaborate dresses that one imagines or one is apt to imagine that there is a warrant for some of the dresses in the plays In some cases he confounds the producer and the illustrator by introducing garments of his own date into historical plays as for example Coriolanus Here are the clothes allusions in that play When you cast your stinking greasy caps You have made good work You and your apron men Go to them with this bonnet in your hand Enter Coriolanus in a gown of humility Matrons fling gloves ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers The kitchen malkin pins her richest lockram A bout her reechy neck A Lockram is coarse linen Our veiled dames Commit the war of white and damask in their nicely gawded cheeks to the wanton and spoil of Phoebus burning kisses Doublets that hangmen would bury with these that wore them I have not kept the lines in verse but in a convenient way to show their allusions In Pericles we have mention of ruffs and bases Pericles says I am provided of a pair of bases Certainly the bases might be made to appear Roman if one accepts the long slips of cloth or leather in Roman military dress as being bases but Shakespeare is really as in the case of the ruffs alluding to the petticoats of the doublet of his time worn by grave persons Bases also apply to silk hose In Titus Andronicus we have An idiot holds his bauble for his God Julius Caesar is mentioned as an Elizabethan He plucked ope his doublet The Carpenter in Julius Caesar is asked Where is thy leather apron and thy rule The mob have sweaty night caps Cleopatra in Antony and Cleopatra says I ll give thee an armour all of gold The Winter s Tale the action of which occurs in Pagan times is full of anachronisms As for instance Whitsun pastorals Christian burial an Emperor of Russia and an Italian fifteenth century painter Also Lawn as white as driven snow Cyprus B black as ere was crow Gloves as sweet as damask roses Masks for faces and for noses Bugle bracelet necklace amber Perfume for a lady s chamber Golden quoifs and stomachers Pins and polking sticks of steel B Thin stuff for women s veils So you see Autolycus the pedlar of these early times is spoken of as carrying polking sticks with which to stiffen ruffs Shylock in The Merchant of Venice should wear an orange tawny bonnet lined with black taffeta for in this way were the Jews of Venice distinguished in fifteen eighty one In The Tempest one may hear of rye straw hats of gaberdines rapiers and a pied fool s costume In The Two Gentlemen of Verona we hear Why then your ladyship must cut your hair No girl I ll tie it up in silken strings With twenty odd conceited true love knot To be fantastic may become a youth Of greater time than I shall show to be Also Since she did neglect her looking glass And threw her sun expelling mask away Many ladies at this time wore velvet masks The Merry Wives of Windsor gives us a thrummed hat a muffler or linen to hide part of the face gloves fans Falstaff says When Mistress Bridget lost the handle of her fan I took it up my honour thou had saint it not Also The firm fashion of thy foot would give an excellent motion to thy fait in a semicircled farthingale Twelfth Night is celebrated for us by Malvolio s cross garters Sir Toby who considers his clothes good enough to drink in says So be these boots too an they be not let them hang themselves in their own straps Sir Toby also remarks to Sir Andrew upon the excellent constitution of his leg and Sir Andrew replied that It does indifferent well in a flame coloured stock The Clown says A sentence is but a cheveril C glove to a good wit C Cheveril is kid leather In Much Ado About Nothing we learn of one who lies awake ten nights carving the fashion of his doublet Also of one who is in the shape of two countries at once as a German from the waist downwards all slops and a Spaniard from the hip upward no doublet Again of a gown Cloth of gold and cuts and laced with silver set with pearls down sides side sleeves and skirts round under borne with a bluish tinsel In As You Like It one may show a careless desolation by ungartered hose unbanded bonnet unbuttoned

cap moulded on a porringer Love s Labour s Lost tells of Your hat penthouse like o er the shop of your eyes with your arms crossed on your thin belly doublet like a rabbit on a spit or your hands in your pocket like a man after the old painting All s Well that Ends Well Why dost thou garter up thy arms o this fashion Dost make a hose of thy sleeves Yonder s my lord your son with a patch of velvet on s face whether there be a scar under t or no the velvet knows There s a dozen of em with delicate fine hats and most courteous feathers which bow the head and nod at every man In Henry IV Part II there is an allusion to the blue dress of Beadles Also About the satin for my short cloak and slops The smooth pates do now wear nothing but high shoes and bunches of keys at their girdles To take notice how many pair of silk stockings thou hast or to bear the inventory of thy shirts There are small and unimportant remarks upon dress in other plays as dancing shoes in Romeo and Juliet and in Henry VIII The remains of fool and feather that they got in France Tennis and tall stockings Short blistered breeches and those types of travel But in Hamlet we find more allusions than in the rest Hamlet is ever before us in his black Tis not alone my inky cloak good mother Nor customary suits of solemn black Lord Hamlet with his doublet all unbraced No hat upon his head his stockings fouled Ungartered and down goes to his ancle Pale as his shirt Your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the altitude of a chopine D D Shoes with very high soles O it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion into tatters With two provincial roses on my ragged shoes My sea gown scarfed about me Having read this I think it will be seen that there is no such great difficulty in costuming any play except perhaps this last There have been many attempts to put Hamlet into the clothes of the date of his story but even when the rest of the characters are dressed in skins and cross gartered trousers when the Viking element is strongly insisted upon still there remains the absolutely Elizabethan figure in inky black with his very Elizabethan thoughts the central figure almost the great symbol of his age JAMES THE FIRST Reigned twenty two years sixteen oh three sixteen twenty five Born fifteen sixty six Married fifteen eighty nine Anne of Denmark THE MEN This couplet may give a little sketch of the man we should now see before us His ruffe is set his head set in his ruff His reverend trunks become him well enough We are still in the times of the upstanding ruff we are watching like sartorial gardeners for the droop of this linen flower Presently this pride of man and of woman too will lose its bristling super starched air and will hang down about the necks of the cavaliers indeed if we look very carefully we see towards the end of the reign the first fruits of elegance born out of Elizabethan precision Now in such a matter lies the difficulty of presenting an age or a reign in an isolated chapter In the first place one must endeavour to show how a Carolean gentleman meeting a man in the street might say immediately Here comes one who still affects Jacobean clothes Or how an Elizabethan lady might come to life and meeting the same man might exclaim Ah these are evidently the new fashions The Carolean gentleman would notice at first a certain air of stiffness a certain padded arrangement a stiff hat a crisp ornament of feathers He would see that the doublet varied from his own in being more slashed or slashed in many more degrees He would see that it was stiffened into an artificial figure that the little skirt of it was very orderly that the cut of the sleeves was tight He would notice also that the man s hair was only half long giving an appearance not of being grown long for beauty but merely that it had not been cut for some time He would be struck with the preciseness the correct air of the man He would see unless the stranger happened to be an exquisite fellow that his shoes were plain that the roses on them were small and neat His trunks he would observe were wide and full but stiff Mind you he would be regarding this man with seventeenth century eyes eyes which told him that he was himself an elegant careless fellow dressed in the best of taste and comfort eyes which showed him that the Jacobean was a nice enough person in his dress but old fashioned grandfatherly To us meeting the pair of them I am afraid that a certain notion we possess nowadays of cleanliness and such habits would oppress us in the company of both despite the fact that they changed their linen on Sundays or were supposed to do so And we in our absurd clothes with hard hats on our heads and stiff collars tight about our necks creases in our trousers and some patent invention of the devil on our feet might feel that the Jacobean gentleman looked and was untidy to say the least of it and had better be viewed from a distance To the Elizabethan lady the case would be reversed The man would show her that the fashions for men had been modified since her day she would see that his hair was not kept in what she would consider order she would see that his ruff was smaller and his hat brim was larger She would I venture to think disapprove of him thinking that he did not look so smart For ourselves I think we should distinguish him at once as a man who wore very large knickerbockers tied at the knee and in looking at a company of men of this time we should be struck by the padding of these garments to a preposterous size Illustration There has come into fashion a form of ruff cut square in front and tied under the chin which can be seen in the drawings better than it can be described indeed the alterations in clothes are not easy to describe except that they follow the general movement towards looseness The trunks have become less like pumpkins and more like loose wide bags The hats some of them stiff and hard show in other forms an inclination to slouch Doublets are often made loose and little sets of slashes appear inside the elbow of the sleeves which will presently become one long slash in Cavalier costumes We have still Morisco gowns Barbarian sleeves Polonian shoes with divers far fetcht trifles Such as the wandering English galant rifles Strange countries for But we have not for all that the wild extravaganza of fashions that marked the foregoing reign Indeed says another writer giving us a neat picture of a man His doublet is So close and pent as if he feared one prison Would not be strong enough to keep his soul in But his taylor makes another And trust me for I knew it when I loved Cupid He does endure much pain for poor praise Of a neat fitting suit To wear something abnormally tight seems to be the condition of the world in love from James I to David Copperfield Naturally a man of the time might be riding down the street across a Scotch plaid saddle cloth and pass by a beggar dressed in clothes of Henry VIII s time or pass a friend looking truly Elizabethan but he would find generally that the short swollen trunks were very little worn and also another point that a number of men had taken to walking in boots tall boots instead of shoes Illustration As he rides along in his velvet cloak his puffed and slashed doublet his silken hose his hands gloved with embroidered gloves or bared to show his rings smelling of scents a chain about his neck he will hear the many street cries about him Will you buy any sand mistress Brooms brooms for old shoes Pouch rings boots or buskings Will ye buy any new brooms New oysters new oysters New new cockles Fresh herrings cockels nye Will you buy any straw Hay yee any kitchen stuff maids Pippins fine Cherrie ripe ripe ripe Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF JAMES I sixteen oh three sixteen twenty five He shows the merging of the Elizabethan fashion into the fashion of Charles I The stiff doublet and the loose breeches the plain collar and the ribbons at the knees On his hawking glove is a hawk hooded and jessed Illustration And he will pass apprentices most of them still in flat caps blue doublets and white cloth breeches and stockings sewn all in one piece with daggers on their backs or at their sides And then travelling with his man he will come to his inn For the life of me though it has little to do with dress I must give this picture of an inn from Fynes Moryson which will do no harm despite the fact that Sir Walter Besant quoted some of it As soon as a passenger comes to an Inn the servants run to him these would be in doublet and hose of some plain colour with shirt collars to the doublets turned down loose the trunks would be wide and to the knee and there buttoned and one takes his horse and walks him till he be cool then rubs him and gives him meat yet I must say that they are not much to be trusted in this last point without the eye of the Master or his servant to oversee them Another servant gives the passenger his private chamber and kindles his fire the third pulls off his boots and makes them clean these two servants would be wearing aprons Then the Host or Hostess visits him and if he will eat with the Host or at a common table with the others his meal will cost him sixpence or in some places but fourpence yet this course is less honourable and not used by Gentlemen but if he will eat in his chamber he will retain his hat within the house he commands what meats he will according to his appetite and as much as he thinks fit for him and his company yea the kitchen is open to him to command the meat to be dressed as he likes best and when he sits at table the Host or Hostess will accompany him if they have many guests will at least visit him taking it for courtesy to be bid sit down while he eats if he have company especially he shall be offered music which he may freely take or refuse and if he be solitary the musicians will give him good day with music in the morning It is the custom and in no way disgraceful to set up part of supper for his breakfast Lastly a Man cannot more freely command at home in his own house than he may do in his Inn and at parting if he give some few pence to the Chamberlin and Ostler they wish him a happy journey Beyond this and the drawings I need say no more The drawings will show how the points of a doublet may be varied the epaulette left or taken away the little skirts cut or left plain They show you how a hat may be feathered and the correct shape of the hat how breeches may be left loose at the knee or tied or buttoned of the frills at the wrist and the ruffs at the neck of everything I hope that is necessary and useful Illustration THE WOMEN What fashion will make a woman have the best body tailor A short Dutch waist with a round Catherine wheel fardingale a close sleeve with a cartoose collar or a pickadell I think with a little imagination we can see the lady add to our picture a feather fan a man s beaver hat with a fine band round it stuck with a rose or a feather shoes with ribbons or roses and jewels in the hair and I think the lady walks Yet so difficult do I find it to lead her tripping out of the wardrobe into the world I would remind myself of the laws for servants in this time And no servant may toy with the maids under pain of fourpence It is a salutary warning and one that must be kept in the mind s eye and as I pluck the lady from the old print hold her by the Dutch waist and twirl her round until the Catherine wheel fardingale is a blurred circle and the pickadell a mist of white linen I feel for my prying like one who has toyed under pain of fourpence Illustration There are many excellent people with the true historical mind who would pick up my lady and strip her in so passionless a way as to leave her but a mass of Latin names so many bones tissues and nerves and who would then label and classify her wardrobe under so many old English and French Dutch and Spanish names bringing to bear weighty arguments several pages long over the derivation of the word cartoose or pickadell write in notebooks of her little secret fineries bear down on one another with thundering eloquence upon the relation of saint Catherine and her wheel upon seventeenth century dressmaking and so confuse and bewilder the more simple and less learned folk that we should turn away from the Eve of the seventeenth century and from the heap of clothes upon the floor no whit the wiser for all their pains Not that I would laugh even smile at the diligence of these learned men who in their day puzzled the father of Tristram Shandy over the question of breeches but as it is in my mind impossible to disassociate the clothes and the woman I find it difficult to follow their dissertations however enlightening upon Early English cross stitch And now after I have said all this I find myself doing very nearly the same thing You will find if you look into the lady s wardrobe that she has other fashions than the close sleeve she has a close sleeve as an under sleeve with a long hanging sleeve falling from the elbow she has ruffs at her wrist of pointed lace more cuffs than ruffs indeed She does not always follow the fashion of the short Dutch waist as she has we can see a dress with a long waist and a tapering front to the bodice Some dresses of hers are divided in the skirts to show a barred petticoat or a petticoat with a broad border of embroidery Sometimes she is covered with little bows and at others with much gold lacing and now and again she wears a narrow sash round her waist tied with a bow in front She is taking more readily to the man s hat feathered and banded and in so doing is forced to dress her hair more simply and do away with jewellery on her forehead but as is often the case she dresses her hair with plumes and jewels and little linen or lace ruffs and atop of all wears a linen cap with side wings to it and a peak in the centre Her ruff is now most generally in the form of an upstanding collar to her dress open in front finishing on her shoulders with some neat bow or other ornament It is of lace of very fine workmanship edged plain and square or in all manner of fancy scallops circles and points Sometimes she will wear both ruff and collar the ruff underneath to prop up her collar at the back to the required modish angle Sometimes her bodice will finish off in a double Catherine wheel Her maid is a deal more simple her hair is dressed very plainly a loop by the ears a twist at the nape of the neck She has a shawl over her shoulders or a broad falling collar of white linen She has no fardingale but her skirts are full Her bodice fits but is not stiffened artificially her sleeves are tight and neat and her cuffs plain Upon her head is a broad brimmed plain hat Illustration She has a piece of gossip for her mistress at Chelsea they are making a satin dress for the Princess of Wales from Chinese silkworm s silk On another day comes the news that the Constable of Castile when at Whitehall subscribed very handsomely to the English fashion and kissed the Queen s hands and the cheeks of twenty ladies of honour The fashion for dresses of pure white either in silk cloth or velvet has affected both men and women and the countries which gave a name to the cuts of the garments are evidenced in the literature of the time How a man s breeches or slops are Spanish his waist like the lady s Dutch his doublet French his and her sleeves and wings on the shoulders French their boots Polonian cloaks German hose Venetian hats from everywhere These spruce coxcombs with looking glasses set in their tobacco boxes so that they may privately confer with them to see How his band jumpeth with his piccadilly Whether his band strings balence equally Which way his feather wags strut along on their high heeled shoes and ogle any lady as she passes Another fashion common to those in the high mode was to have the bodice below the ruff cut so low as to show all the breast bare and this together with the painting of the face gave great offence to the more sober minded The ruffs and collars of lace were starched in many colours purple goose green red and blue yellow being completely out of the fashion since the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury by missus Anne Turner the friend of the Countess of Somerset and this because missus Turner elected to appear at the gallows in a yellow ruff Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF JAMES I sixteen oh three sixteen twenty five Here is seen the wide fardingale or farthingale the elaborate under skirt and the long hanging sleeves of the gown Also the very tall upstanding ruff or collar of lace Illustration As for the fardingale it was having its last fling This absurd garment had its uses once so they say who write scandal of a Spanish Princess and served to conceal her state upon a certain time but when ladies forsook the fashion they wore a loose almost shapeless gown open from the waist to the feet and a plain unstiffened jerkin or jacket underneath Such a conglomeration is needed if you remember we are looking over a lady s wardrobe to make a lady of the time such stuffs as rash taffeta paropa novats shagge filizetta damask mochado Rash is silk and stuff taffeta is thin silk mochado is mock velvet There again one may fall into an antiquarian trap whereas mochado is a manufacture of silk to imitate velvet mokkadoe is a woollen cloth and so on there is no end to it Still some may read and ask themselves what is a rebatoe It is the collar like ruff worn at this time In this medley of things we shall see purles falles squares buskes tires fans palisadoes this is a wire to hold the hair next to the first or duchess knot puffs ruffs partlets frislets fillets pendulets bracelets busk points shoe ties shoe roses bongrace bonnets and whalebone wheels Eve All this for what purpose To turn out one of those extraordinary creatures with a cart wheel round the middle of their persons As the reign died so did its fashions die also padded breeches lost some of their bombast ruffs much of their starch and fardingales much of their circumference and the lady became more Elizabethan in appearance wore a roll under her hair in front and a small hood with a jewelled frontlet on her forehead It was the last of the Tudor dress and came as the last flicker of a candle before the new mode Fashion s next footstep CHARLES THE FIRST Reigned twenty four years sixteen twenty five sixteen forty nine Born sixteen hundred Married sixteen twenty five Henrietta of France THE MEN Illustration This surely is the age of elegance if one may trust such an elegant and graceful mind as had Vandyck In all the wonderful gallery of portraits he has left these silvery graceful people pose in garments of ease The main thing that I must do is to show how gradually the stiff Jacobean dress became unfrozen from its clutch upon the human form how whalebones in men s jackets melted away breeches no longer swelled themselves with rags and bran collars fell down and shirts lounged through great open spaces in the sleeves It was the time of an immaculate carelessness the hair was free or seemed free to droop in languid tresses on men s shoulders curl at pretty will on men s foreheads Shirts were left open at the neck breeches were loosed at the knee Do I revile the time if I say that the men had an air a certain supercilious air of being dukes disguised as art students Illustration We know all of us the Vandyck beard the Carolean moustache brushed away from the lips we know Lord Pembroke s tousled carefully tousled hair Kiligrew s elegant locks From the head to the neck is but a step a sad step in this reign and here we find our friend the ruff utterly tamed pickadillies now out of request writes one tamed into the falling band the Vandyck collar which form of neck dress has never left the necks and shoulders of our modern youthful prodigies indeed at one time no youthful genius dare be without one The variations of this collar are too well known of such lace as edged them and of the manner of their tying it would waste time to tell except that in some instances the strings are secured by a ring Illustration Such a change has come over the doublet as to make it hardly the same garment the little slashes have become two or three wide cuts the sleeves are wide and loose with as a rule one big opening on the inside of the arm with this opening embroidered round The cuffs are like little collars turned back with point lace edges The actual cut of the doublet has not altered a great deal the ordinary run of doublet has the pointed front it is tied round the waist with a little narrow sash but there has arrived a new jacket cut round left open from the middle of the breast sometimes cut so short as to show the shirt below bulged out over the breeches Sometimes you will see one of these new short jackets with a slit in the back and under this the man will be wearing the round trunks of his father s time Illustration The breeches are mostly in two classes the long breeches the shape of bellows tied at the knee with a number of points or a bunch of coloured ribbons or the breeches cut the same width all the way down loose at the knee and there ornamented with a row of points ribbons tied in bows with tags on them A new method of ornamentation was this notion of coloured ribbons in bunches on the breeches in front at the sides at the knees almost anywhere and also upon the coats For some time the older fashioned short round cape or cloak prevailed but later large silk cloaks used as wraps thrown across the shoulders were used as well The other cloaks had straps like the modern golf cape by which the cloak might be allowed to fall from the shoulders A custom arrived of wearing boots more frequently and there was the tall square toed high heeled boot fitting up the leg to just below the knee without a turnover the stiff thick leather blacking boot with broad stiff tops also not turned back and there was also the result of the extraordinary melting crumpled dismissal of all previous stiffness whereby the old tall boot drooped down until it turned over and fell into a wide cup all creases and wrinkles nearly over the foot while across the instep was a wide shaped flap of leather This last falling boot top was turned in all manner of ways by those who cared to give thought to it Illustration Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF CHARLES I sixteen twenty five sixteen forty nine He has wrapped his blue cloak over his arm a usual method of carrying the cloak He is simply dressed without bunches of ribbons or points The insides of the tops of these boots were lined with lace or silk and the dandy turned them down to give full show to the lining this turning of broad tops was such an inconvenience that he was forced to use a straddled walk when he wore his boots thus Canes were carried with gold silver or bone heads and were ornamented further by bunches of ribbon Coming again to the head we find ribbon also in use to tie up locks of hair delicate shades of ribbon belonging to some fair lady were used to tie up locks to show delicate shades of love Some men wore two long love locks on either side of the face others wore two elaborately curled locks on one side only The hats as the drawings will show are broad in the brim and of an average height in the crown but a dandy here and there wore a hat with next to no brim and a high crown Most hats were feathered There is a washing tally in existence of this time belonging I think to the Duke of Rutland which is very interesting It is made of beech wood covered with linen and is divided into fifteen squares In the centre of each square there is a circle cut and in the circle are numbers Over the number is a plate with a pin for pivot in the centre a handle to turn and a hole to expose a number Above each circle are the names of the articles in this order Ruffs Bandes Cuffes Handkercher Cappes Shirtes Halfshirts Boote Hose Topps Sockes Sheetes Pillowberes Table Clothes Napkins Towells Topps are linen boot frills and halfshirts are stomachers There remains little to be said except that black was a favourite dress for men also light blue and cream coloured satin Bristol paste diamonds were in great demand and turquoise rings were very fashionable For the rest Vandyck s pictures are available to most people or good reproductions of them and those with a knowledge of how such dress came into being are all that can be needed THE WOMEN There is one new thing you must be prepared to meet in this reign and that will best be described by quoting the title of a book written at this time A Wonder of Wonders or a Metamorphosis of Fair Faces into Foul Visages an invective against black spotted faces By this you may see at once that every humour was let loose in the shapes of stars and moons crowns slashes lozenges and even a coach and horses cut in black silk ready to be gummed to the faces of the fair Knowing from other histories of such fads that the germ of the matter lies in a royal indisposition we look in vain for the conceited history of the Princess and the Pimple but no doubt some more earnest enquirer after truth will hit upon the story this toy tragedy of the dressing table For the dress we can do no better than look at the Ornatus Muliebris Anglicanus that wonderfully careful compilation by Hollar of all the dresses in every class of society It is interesting to see how the Jacobean costume lost by degrees its formal stiffness and first fardingale and then ruff vanished Early in the reign the high dressed hair was abandoned and to take its place the hair was dressed so that it was gathered up by the ears left parted on the crown and twisted at the back to hold a plume or feather Time went on and hair dressing again altered the hair was now taken in four parts first the hair was drawn well back off the forehead then the two side divisions were curled neatly and dressed to fall over the ears the fourth group of hair was neatly twisted and so made into a small knot holding the front hair in its place Later on came the fringe of small curls as in the portrait of Queen Henrietta at Windsor by Vandyck We see at first that while the ruff or rather the rebatoe that starched lace high collar remained the fardingale having disappeared left for the upper gown an enormous quantity of waste loose material that had previously been stretched over the fardingale and parted in front to show the satin petticoat From this there sprung firstly a wide loose gown open all the way down and tied about the middle with a narrow sash the opening showing the boned bodice of the under dress with its pointed protruding stomacher the woman s fashion having retained the form of the man s jerkin Below this showed the satin petticoat with its centre strip or band of embroidery and the wide border of the same In many cases the long hanging sleeves were kept Then there came the fall of the rebatoe and the decline of the protruding figure and with this the notion of tying back the full upper skirt to show more plainly the satin petticoat which was now losing the centre band of ornament and the border With this revolution in dress the disappearing ruff became at first much lower and then finally vanished and a lace collar falling over the shoulders took its place This gave rise to two distinct fashions in collars the one as I have described the other a collar from the neck like a large edition of the man s collar of that time This collar came over the shoulders and in two points over the breast sometimes completely hiding the upper part of the dress The stiff boned bodice gave place to one more easily cut shorter with in place of the long point a series of long strips each strip ornamented round the hem At this time the sleeves different from the old fashioned tight sleeves were very full indeed and the sleeve of the loose over gown was made wider in proportion and was tied across the under sleeve above the elbow by a knot of ribbons the whole ending in a deep cuff of lace Then the over gown disappeared the bodice became a short jacket laced in front openly so as to show the sleeveless bodice of the same material and colour as the petticoat the sleeves were not made so wide and they were cut to come just below the elbow leaving the wrists and forearm bare In winter a lady often wore one of those loose Dutch jackets round and full with sleeves just long enough to cover the under sleeves the whole lined and edged with fur or she might wear a short circular fur lined cape with a small turned over collar In summer the little jacket was often discarded and the dress was cut very simply but very low in the bust and they wore those voluminous silk wraps in common with the men The little sashes were very much worn and ornaments of knots of ribbon or points that is a ribbon with a metal tag at either end were universal The change of fashion to short full sleeves gave rise to the turned back cuff of the same material as the sleeve and some costumes show this short jacket with its short sleeves with cuffs while under it shows the dress with tight sleeves reaching to the wrists where were linen or lace cuffs a combination of two fashions Part of the lady s equipment now was a big feather fan and a big fur muff for winter also the fashion of wearing long gloves to reach to the elbow came in with the advent of short sleeves Naturally enough there was every variety of evolution from the old fashion to the new as the tight sleeves did not of course become immediately wide and loose but by some common movement so curious in the history of such revolutions the sleeve grew and grew from puffs at the elbow to wide cuffs to wide shoulders until the entire sleeve became swollen out of all proportion and the last little pieces of tightness were removed The form of dress with cuffs to the jackets lacing sashes bunches of ribbon and looped up skirts lasted for a great number of years It was started by the death of the fardingale and it lived into the age of hoops These ladies wore shoe roses upon their shoes and these bunches of ribbon very artificially made up cost sometimes as much as from three to thirty pounds a pair these very expensive roses being ornamented with jewels From these we derive the saying Roses worth a family In the country the women wore red gray and black cloth homespun and for riding they put on safeguards or outer petticoats The wide brimmed beaver hat was in general wear and a lady riding in the country would wear such a hat or a hood and a cloak and soft top boots Women s petticoats were called plackets as well as petticoats With the careless air that was then adopted by everybody which was to grow yet more carefully careless in the reign of Charles II the hair was a matter which must have undivided attention and centuries of tight dressing had not improved many heads so that when the loose love locks and the dainty tendrils became the fashion many good ladies and gentlemen had recourse to the wigmaker From this time until but an hundred years ago from the periwig bought for Sexton the fool of Henry VIII down to the scratches and bobs of one s grandfather s youth the wigmaker lived and prospered To day more secretly yet more surely does the maker of transformations live and prosper but in the days when to be wigless was to be undressed the perruquier was a very great person Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF CHARLES I sixteen twenty five sixteen forty nine Notice the broad collar and deep cuffs The dress is simple but rich The bodice is laced with the same colour as the narrow sash The hair is arranged in a series of elaborate curls over the forehead This was the day then of satins loosened hair elbow sleeves and little forehead curls The stiffness of the older times will pass away but it had left its clutch still on these ladies how far it vanished how entirely it left costume will be seen in the next royal reign when Nell Gwynne was favourite and Sir Peter Lely painted her ENGRAVINGS BY HOLLAR These excellent drawings by Hollar need no explanation They are included in this book because of their great value as accurate contemporary drawings of costume Illustration Illustration Illustration Illustration Illustration Illustration Illustration Illustration THE CROMWELLS sixteen forty nine sixteen sixty THE MEN AND WOMEN I left my pure mistress for a space And to a snip snap barber straight went I I cut my hair and did my corps uncase Of parel s pride that did offend the eye My high crowned hat my little beard also My pecked band my shoes were sharp at toe Gone was my sword my belt was laid aside And I transformed both in looks and speech My parel plain my cloak was void of pride My little skirts my metamorphosed breech My stockings black my garters were tied shorter My gloves no scent thus marched I to her porter Illustration It is a question in this time of restraint of formalism where anything could be made plain cut in a cumbrous fashion rendered inelegant it was done The little jackets were denuded of all forms of frippery the breeches were cut straight and the ornaments if any were of the most severe order Hats became broader in the brim boots wider in the tops in fact big boots seemed almost a sign of heavy religious feeling The nice hair love locks ordered negligence all vanished and plain crops or straight hair not over long marked these extraordinary people It was a natural revolt against extravagance and in some more sensible minds it was not carried to excess points and bows were allowable though of sombre colours Sashes still held good but of larger size ruffs at the wrists were worn but of plain linen The bands or collars varied in size according to the religious enthusiasm of the wearers but all were plain without lace edgings and were tied with plain strings Black dark brown and dull gray were the common colours relieved sometimes if the man was wearing a sleeveless coat by the yellow and red barred sleeves of the under jacket or possibly by coloured sleeves sewn into the coat under the shoulder wings Overcoats were cut as simply as possible though they did not skimp the material but made them wide and loose Illustration A CROMWELLIAN MAN sixteen forty nine sixteen sixty Notice the careful plainness of his dress and his very wide topped boots Illustration The women dressed their hair more plainly the less serious retained the little bunches of side curls but the others smoothed their hair away under linen caps or black hoods tied under their chins Another thing the women did was to cut from their bodices all the little strips but the one in the middle of the back and this they left like a tail behind Some of course dressed as before with the difference in colour and in ornament that made for severity It had an effect on the country insomuch as the country people ceased to be extravagant in the materials for garments and in many like ways and so lay by good fortunes for their families these families coming later into the gay court of Charles II had all the more to lavish on the follies of his fashions Illustration The Puritan is as well known a figure as any in history an intelligent child could draw you a picture or describe you a Puritan as well as he could describe the Noah of Noah s Ark He has become part of the stock for an Academy humourist a thousand anecdote pictures have been painted of him very often his nose is red generally he has a book in his hand laughing maids bring him jacks of ale jeering Cavaliers swagger past him his black cloak board shoes wide Geneva bands are as much part of our national picture as Punch or Harlequin Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF THE CROMWELLS sixteen forty nine sixteen sixty This is not one of the most Puritanical dresses but shows how the richness of the reign of Charles I was toned down She carries a muff in her hand wears a good wide collar and cuffs and neat roses on her shoes Illustration The Puritaness is also known She is generally represented as a sly bird in sombre clothes her town garments full skirts black hood deep linen collar are shown to hide a merry eyed lady her country clothes apron striped petticoat bunched up skirt linen cap her little flaunt of curls show her still mischievous The pair of them in reality religious fanatics prepared a harvest that they little dreamt of a harvest of extravagant clothes and extravagant manners when the country broke loose from its false bondage of texts scriptural shirts and religious petticoats and launched into a bondage equally false of low cut dresses and enormous periwigs In the next reign you will see an entirely new era of clothes the doublet and jerkin the trunks and ruffs have their last eccentric fling they become caricatures of themselves they do all the foolish things garments can do and then all of a sudden they vanish never to be taken up again Hair long neglected is to have its full sway wigs are the note for two centuries so utterly different did the man become in the short space of thirty five years that the buck of the Restoration and the beau of the Jacobean order would stare helplessly at each other wondering each to himself what manner of fool this was standing before him Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF THE CROMWELLS sixteen forty nine sixteen sixty This shows the modification of the dress of the time of Charles I Not an extreme change but an endeavour towards simplicity CHARLES THE SECOND Reigned twenty five years sixteen sixty sixteen eighty five Born sixteen thirty Married sixteen sixty two Katherine of Portugal THE MEN AND WOMEN Illustration England apparently with a sigh of relief lays aside her hair shirt and proves that she has been wearing a silk vest under it Ribbon makers and wig makers lace makers tailors and shoemakers pour out thankful offerings at the altar of Fashion One kind of folly has replaced another it is only the same goddess in different clothes The lamp that winked and flickered before the stern black figure in Geneva bands and prim curls is put to shame by the flare of a thousand candles shining on the painted face the exposed bosom the flaunting love locks of this Carolean deity Illustration We have burst out into periwigs monstrous bushy we have donned petticoat breeches ruffled like a pigeon we have cut our coats till they are mere apologies serving to show off our fine shirts and we have done the like with our coat sleeves leaving a little cuff glittering with buttons and above that we have cut a great slit all to show the marvel of our linen Those of us who still wear the long wide breeches adorn them with heavy frills of deep lace and sew bunches of ribbons along the seams We tie our cravats in long stiff bows or knot them tight and allow the wide lace ends to float gracefully Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF CHARLES II sixteen sixty sixteen eighty five This shows the dress during the first half of the reign The feature of groups of ribboning is shown with the short sleeve the full shirt and the petticoat Our hats broad brimmed and stiff are loaded with feathers our little cloaks are barred with silk and lace and gold cord our shoes are square toed and high heeled and are tied with a long ended bow of ribbon Illustration Ribbon reigns triumphant it ties our periwigs into bunches at the ends it hangs in loops round our waists it ties our shirt sleeves up in several places it twists itself round our knees It is on our hats and heads and necks and arms and legs and shoes and it peers out of the tops of our boots Divines rave moralists rush into print to no purpose The names seem to convey a sense of luxury dove coloured silk brocade Rhingrave breeches white lutestring seamed all over with scarlet and silver lace sleeves whipt with a point lace coat trimmed and figured with silver twist or satin ribbon canvas camblet galloon and shamey vellam buttons and taffety ribbons The cannons those bunches of ribbons round our knees and the confidents those bunches of curls by our ladies cheeks do not shake at the thunderings of mister Baxter or other moral gentlemen who regard a Maypole as a stinking idol mister Hall writes on The Loathsomeness of Long Hair mister Prynne on The Unloveliness of Lovelocks and we do not care a pinch of rappe Little moustaches and tiny lip beards grow under careful treatment and the ladies wear a solar system in patches on their cheeks The ladies soon escaped the bondage of the broad Puritan collars and all these had hid was exposed The sleeves left the arms bare to the elbow and being slit above and joined loosely by ribbons showed the arm nearly to the shoulder The sleeves of these dresses also followed the masculine fashion of little cuffs and tied up linen under sleeves The bodices came to a peak in front and were round behind The skirts were full satin being favoured and when held up showed a satin petticoat with a long train The ladies for a time indulged in a peculiar loop of hair on their foreheads called a fore top which gave rise to another fashion less common called a taure or bull s head being an arrangement of hair on the forehead resembling the close curls of a bull The loose curls on the forehead were called favorites the long locks arranged to hang away from the face over the ears were called heart breakers and the curls close to the cheek were called confidents Ladies wore cloaks with baggy hoods for travelling and for the Mall the same hats as men loaded with feathers Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF CHARLES II sixteen sixty sixteen eighty five This is the change which came over men s dress on or about October sixteen sixty six It is the new fashioned vest or body coat introduced to the notice of Charles by John Evelyn Illustration Illustration I am going to leave the change in dress during this reign to the next chapter in which you will read how it struck mister Pepys This change separates the old world of dress from the new it is the advent of frocked coats the ancestor of our frock coat It finishes completely the series of evolutions beginning with the old tunic running through the gown stages to the doublet of Elizabethan times lives in the half coat half doublet of Charles I and ends in the absurd little jackets of Charles II who sartorially steps from the end of the Middle Ages into the New Ages closes the door on a wardrobe of brilliant eccentricity and opens a cupboard containing our first frock coat PEPYS AND CLOTHES It is not really necessary for me to remind the reader that one of the best companions in the world Samuel Pepys was the son of a tailor Possibly I say possibly because the argument is really absurd he may have inherited his great interest in clothes from his father You see where the argument leads in the end that all men to take an interest in clothes must be born tailors sons This is no more true of Adam who certainly did interest himself than it is of myself Pepys was educated at saint Paul s School went to Trinity College Cambridge got drunk there and took a scholarship He married when he was twenty two a girl of fifteen the daughter of a Huguenot He was born in sixteen thirty three three years after the birth of Charles II of outrageous but delightful memory and he commenced his Diary in sixteen sixty the year in which Charles entered London ending it in sixteen sixty nine owing to his increasing weakness of sight He was made Secretary to the Admiralty in sixteen seventy two in sixteen seventy three he became a member of Parliament was sent to the Tower as a Papist in sixteen seventy nine and released in sixteen eighty In sixteen eighty four he became President of the Royal Society and he died in seventeen oh three and is buried in saint Olave s Crutched Friars Pepys mentions in sixteen sixty his coat with long skirts fur cap and buckles on his shoes The coat was doubtless an old fashioned Cromwellian coat with no waist Later he goes to see mister Calthrop and wears his white suit with silver lace having left off his great skirt coat He leaves mister Calthrop to lay up his money and change his shoes and stockings He mentions his scarlet waistclothes presumably a sash and regards mister John Pickering as an ass because of his feathers and his new suit made at the Hague He mentions his linning stockings and wide cannons This mention of wide cannons leads me to suppose that at this time any ornament at the knee would be called cannons whether it was a part of the breeches or the stockings or a separate frill or bunch of ribbons to put on On July one still in the same year comes home his fine camlett cloak and gold buttons also a silk suit Later he buys a jackanapes coat with silver buttons Then he and mister Pin the tailor agree upon a velvet coat and cap the first I ever had He buys short black stockings to wear over silk ones for mourning Illustration On October seven he says that long cloaks being out of fashion he must get a short one He speaks of a suit made in France for My Lord costing Ltwo hundred He mentions ladies masks In sixteen sixty two his wife has a pair of peruques of hair and a new fashioned petticoat of sancenett with black broad lace Smocks are mentioned and linen petticoats He has a riding suit with close knees His new lace band is so neat that he is resolved they shall be his great expense He wears a scallop In sixteen sixty three he has a new black cloth suit with white linings under all as the fashion is to appear under the breeches Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF CHARLES II sixteen fifty sixteen eighty five You will notice her hair in ringlets tied with a ribbon and dressed over a frame at the sides The Queen wears a white laced waistcoat and a crimson short petticoat Ladies are wearing hats covered with feathers Illustration God willing he will begin next week to wear his three pound periwig He has spent last month October Ltwelve on Miss Pepys and Lfifty five on his clothes He has silk tops for his legs and a new shag gown He has a close bodied coat light coloured cloth with a gold edge He sees Lady Castlemaine in yellow satin with a pinner on In sixteen sixty four his wife begins to wear light coloured locks In sixteen sixty five there is a new fashion for ladies of yellow bird s eye hood There is a fear of the hair of periwigs during the Plague Even in the middle of the Plague Pepys ponders on the next fashion In sixteen sixty six women begin to wear buttoned up riding coats hats and periwigs On October eight the King says he will set a thrifty fashion in clothes At this momentous date in history we must break for a minute from our friend Pepys and hear how this came about Evelyn had given the King his pamphlet entitled Tyrannus or the Mode The King reads the pamphlet and is struck with the idea of the Persian coat A long pause may be made here in which the reader may float on a mental cloud back into the dim ages in the East and there behold a transmogrified edition of his own frock coat gracing the back of some staid philosopher Evelyn had also published Mundus Muliebris or the Ladies Dressing Room Unlocked Illustration So only one month after the Great Fire of London only a short time before the Dutch burnt ships in the Medway only a year after the Plague King Charles decides to reform the fashion By October thirteen the new vests are made and the King and the Duke of York try them on On the fifteenth the King wears his in public and says he will never change to another fashion It is says Pepys a long cassocke close to the body of black cloth and pinked with white silk under it and a coat over it and the legs ruffled with black ribband like a pigeon s legs Illustration The ladies to make an alteration are to wear short skirts Nell Gwynne had a neat ankle so I imagine she had a hand in this fashion On October seventeen the King seeing Lord saint Alban in an all black suit says that the black and white makes them look too much like magpies He bespeaks one of all black velvet Sir Philip Howard increases in the Eastern fashion and wears a nightgown and a turban like a Turk On November two Pepys buys a vest like the King s On November twenty two the King of France Louis XIV who had declared war against England earlier in the year says that he will dress all his footmen in vests like the King of England However fashion is beyond the power of royal command and the world soon followed in the matter of the Persian coat and vest even to the present day Illustration Next year sixteen sixty seven Pepys notes that Lady Newcastle in her velvet cap and her hair about her ears is the talk of the town She wears a number of black patches because of the pimples about her mouth she is naked necked no great peculiarity and she wears a just au corps which is a close body coat Illustration Pepys notices the shepherd at Epsom with his wool knit stockings of two colours mixed He wears a new camlett cloak The shoe strings have given place to buckles and children wear long coats In sixteen sixty eight his wife wears a flower tabby suit everybody in love with it He is forced to lend the Duke of York his cloak because it rains His barber agrees to keep his periwig in order for Lone a year He buys a black bombazin suit In sixteen sixty nine his wife wears the new French gown called a sac he pays fifty fives for his new belt His wife still wears her old flower tabby gown So ends the dress note in the Diary JAMES THE SECOND Reigned four years sixteen eighty five sixteen eighty nine Born sixteen thirty three Married sixteen sixty one Anne Hyde sixteen seventy three Mary of Modena THE MEN AND WOMEN Illustration In such a short space of time as this reign occupies it is not possible to show any great difference in the character of the dress but there is a tendency shown over the country at large to discard the earlier beribboned fashions and to take more seriously to the long coat and waistcoat There is a tendency even to become more buttoned up to present what I can only call a frock coat figure The coat became closer to the body and was braided across the front in many rows the ends fringed out and held by buttons The waistcoat with the pockets an arm s length down was cut the same length as the coat Breeches were more frequently cut tighter and were buttoned up the side of the leg The cuffs of the sleeves were wide and were turned back well over the wrist Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF JAMES II sixteen eighty five sixteen eighty nine The body coat has now become the universal fashion as have also the wide knee breeches Buckles are used on the shoes instead of strings Illustration Of course the change was gradual and more men wore the transitional coat than the tight one By the coat in its changing stages I mean such a coat as this the short coat of the early Charles II period made long and following the old lines of cut correspondingly loose The sleeves remained much the same well over the elbow showing the white shirt full and tied with ribbons The shoe strings had nearly died out giving place to a buckle placed on a strap well over the instep There is a hint of growth in the periwig and of fewer feathers round the brim of the hat indeed little low hats with broad brims merely ornamented with a bunch or so of ribbons began to become fashionable Illustration Swords were carried in broad baldricks richly ornamented The waistclothes of mister Pepys would by now have grown into broad sashes with heavily fringed ends and would be worn round the outside coat for riding this appears to have been the fashion together with small peaked caps like jockey caps and high boots The ladies of this reign simplified the dress into a gown more tight to the bust the sleeves more like the men s the skirt still very full but not quite so long in the train Black hoods with or without capes were worn and wide collars coming over the shoulders again came into fashion The pinner noticed by Pepys was often worn Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF JAMES II sixteen eighty five sixteen eighty nine Notice the broad collar again in use also the nosegay The sleeves are more in the mannish fashion But the most noticeable change occurs in the dress of countryfolk and ordinary citizens The men began to drop all forms of doublet and take to the long coat a suit of black grogram below the knees a sash and a walking stick for the cold a short black cloak In the country the change would be very noticeable The country town the countryside was until a few years back distinctly Puritanical in garb there were Elizabethan doublets on old men and wide Cromwellian breeches patched doubtless walked the market place Hair was worn short Now the russet brown clothes take a decided character in the direction of the Persian coat and knickerbockers closed at the knee The good wife of the farmer knots a loose cloth over her head and pops a broad brimmed man s hat over it She has the sleeves of her dress made with turned back cuffs like her husband s ties her shoes with strings laces her dress in front so as to show a bright coloured under bodice and as like as not wears a green pinner an apron with bib which was pinned on to the dress and altogether brings herself up to date Illustration One might see the farmer s wife riding to market with her eggs in a basket covered with a corner of her red cloak and many a red cloak would she meet on the way to clep with on the times and the fashions The green apron was a mark of a Quaker in America and the Society of Friends was not by any means sad in colour until late in their history Most notable was the neckcloth in this unhappy reign which went by the name of Judge Jeffreys hempen cravat WILLIAM AND MARY Reigned thirteen years sixteen eighty nine seventeen oh two The King born in sixteen fifty the Queen born in sixteen sixty two married in sixteen seventy seven THE MEN Illustration First and foremost the wig Periwig peruke campaign wig with pole locks or dildos all the rage all the thought of the first gentlemen Their heads loaded with curl upon curl long ringlets hanging over their shoulders and down their backs some brown some covered with meal until their coats looked like millers coats scented hair almost hiding the loose tied cravat most agreeably discoloured with snuff from top to bottom Illustration My fine gentleman walking the street with the square cut coat open to show a fine waistcoat his stick hanging by a ribbon on to his wrist and rattling on the pavement as it dragged along his hat carefully perched on his wig the crown made wide and high to hold the two wings of curls which formed a negligent central parting His pockets low down in his coat show a lace kerchief half dropping from one of them One hand is in a small muff the other holds a fine silver gilt box filled with Vigo snuff He wears high heeled shoes red heeled perhaps and the tongue of his shoe sticks up well above the instep Probably he is on his way to the theatre where he will comb his periwig in public and puff away the clouds of powder that come from it The fair lady in a side box who hides her face behind a mask is delighted if Sir Beau will bow to her Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF WILLIAM AND MARY sixteen eighty nine seventeen oh two Strings again in use on the shoes Cuffs much broader wigs more full skirts wider Coat left open to show the long waistcoat We are now among most precise people One must walk here with just such an air of artificiality as will account one a fellow of high tone The more enormous is our wig the more frequently we take a pinch of Violet Strasburg or Best Brazil Orangery Bergamotte or Jassamena the more shall we be followed by persons anxious to learn the fashion We may even draw a little silver bowl from our pocket place it on a seat by us and in meditative mood spit therein We have gone completely into skirted coats and big flapped waistcoats we have adopted the big cuff buttoned back we have given up altogether the wide knee breeches and wear only breeches not tight to the leg but just full enough for comfort The hats have altered considerably now they are cocked up at all angles turned off the forehead turned up one side turned up all round some are fringed with gold or silver lace others are crowned with feathers We hear of such a number of claret coloured suits that we must imagine that colour to be all the rage and in contrast to other times not long gone by we must stiffen ourselves in buckram lined skirts These powdered Absaloms could change themselves into very fine fighting creatures and look twice as sober again when occasion demanded They rode about the country in periwigs certainly but not quite so bushy and curled many of them took to the travelling or campaign wig with the dildos or pole locks These wigs were full over the ears and at the sides of the forehead but they were low in the crown and the two front ends were twisted into single pipes of hair or the pipes of hair at the side were entirely removed and one single pipe hung down the back The custom of thus twisting the hair at the back and there holding it with a ribbon gave rise to the later pigtail The periwigs so altered were known as short bobs the bob being the fullness of the hair by the cheeks of the wig Illustration The cuffs of the coat sleeve varied to the idea and taste of the owner of the coat sometimes the sleeve was widened at the elbow to eighteen inches and the cuffs turned back to meet the sleeves were wider still Two three or even more buttons held the cuff back The pockets on the coats were cut vertically and horizontally and these also might be buttoned up Often the coat was held by only two centre buttons and the waistcoat flaps were not buttoned at all The men s and women s muffs were small and often tied and slung with ribbons Illustration Plain round riding coats were worn fastened by a clasp or a couple of large buttons The habit of tying the neckcloth in a bow with full hanging ends was dying out and a more loosely tied cravat was being worn this was finished with fine lace ends and was frequently worn quite long Illustration Stockings were pulled over the knee and were gartered below and rolled above it The ordinary citizen wore a modified edition of these clothes plain in cut full without half the number of buttons and without the tremendous periwig wearing merely his own hair long For convenience in riding the skirts of the coats were slit up the back to the waist this slit could be buttoned up if need be Illustration Now let us give the dandy of this time his pipe and let him go in peace Let us watch him stroll down the street planting his high heels carefully to join two companions outside the tobacco shop Here by the great carved wood figure of a smoking Indian with his kilt of tobacco leaves he meets his fellows From the hoop hung by the door one chooses a pipe another asks for a quid to chew and a spittoon the third calls for a paper of snuff newly rasped Then they pull aside the curtains and go into the room behind the shop where seated at a table made of planks upon barrels they will discuss the merits of smoking chewing and snuffing We three are engaged in one cause I snuffs I smokes and I chaws THE WOMEN Let me picture for you a lady of this time in the language of those learned in dress and you will see how much it may benefit We see her coming afar off against the yew hedge her weeds shine for a moment We see her figuretto gown well looped and puffed with the monte la haut Her echelle is beautiful and her pinner exquisitely worked We can see her commode her top not and her fontage for she wears no rayonne A silver pin holds her meurtriers and the fashion suits better than did the creve coeurs One hand holds her Saxon green muffetee under one arm is her chapeau bras She is beautiful she needs no plumpers and she regards us kindly with her watchet eyes A lady of this date would read this and enjoy it just as a lady of to day would understand modern dress language which is equally peculiar to the mere man For example this one of the Queen of Spain s hats from her trousseau curiously enough a trousseau is a little bundle The hat is a paille d Italie trimmed with a profusion of pink roses accompanied by a pink chiffon ruffle fashioned into masses bouillonnee arranged at intervals and circled with wreaths of shaded roses Illustration The modern terms so vaguely used are shocking and the descriptive names given to colours by dress artists are horrible beyond belief such as Watteau pink and elephant grey not to speak of Sevres blue cherries However the female mind delights in such jargon and hotch potch Let me be kind enough to translate our William and Mary fashion language Weeds is a term still in use in widow s weeds meaning the entire dress appearance of a woman A figuretto gown looped and puffed with the monte la haut is a gown of figured material gathered into loops over the petticoat and stiffened out with wires monte la haut The echelle is a stomacher laced with ribbons in rungs like a ladder Her pinner is her apron The commode is the wire frame over which the curls are arranged piled up in high masses over the forehead The top not is a large bow worn at the top of the commode and the fontage or tower is a French arrangement of alternate layers of lace and ribbon raised one above another about half a yard high It was invented in the time of Louis XIV about sixteen eighty by Mademoiselle Fontage The rayonne is a cloth hood pinned in a circle The meurtriers or murderers are those twists in the hair which tie or unloose the arrangements of curls and the creve coeurs are the row of little forehead curls of the previous reign A muffetee is a little muff and a chapeau bras is a hat never worn but made to be carried under the arm by men or women for the men hated to disarrange their wigs Illustration Plumpers were artificial arrangements for filling out the cheeks and watchet eyes are blue eyes The ladies have changed a good deal by the middle of this reign they have looped up the gown till it makes side panniers and a bag like droop at the back the under gown has a long train and the bodice is long waisted The front of the bodice is laced open and shows either an arrangement of ribbon and lace or a piece of the material of the under gown Illustration Black pinners in silk with a deep frill are worn as well as the white lace and linen ones Illustration The ladies wear short black capes of this stuff with a deep frill Sometimes instead of the fontage a lady wears a lace shawl over her head and shoulders or a sort of lace cap bedizened with coloured ribbons Her sleeves are like a man s except that they come to the elbow only showing a white under sleeve of lace gathered into a deep frill of lace just below the elbow Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF WILLIAM AND MARY sixteen eighty nine seventeen oh two Here you see the cap called the fontage the black silk apron the looped skirt and the hair on the high frame called a commode Illustration Illustration Country Folk She is very stiff and tight laced and very long in the waist and at the waist where the gown opens and at the loopings of it the richer wear jewelled brooches Later in the reign there began a fashion for copying men s clothes and ladies wore wide skirted coats with deep flapped pockets the sleeves of the coats down below the elbow and with deep turned overcuffs They wore like the men very much puffed and ruffled linen and lace at the wrists Also they wore men s waistcoat fashions carried sticks and little arm hats chapeau bras To complete the dress the hair was done in a bob wig style and the cravat was tied round their necks and pinned For the winter one of those loose Dutch jackets lined and edged with fur having wide sleeves The general tendency was to look Dutch stiff prim but very prosperous even the country maid in her best is close upon the heel of fashion with her laced bodice sleeves with cuffs apron and high heeled shoes QUEEN ANNE Reigned twelve years seventeen oh two seventeen fourteen Born sixteen sixty five Married sixteen eighty three Prince George of Denmark THE MEN AND WOMEN When I turn to the opening of the eighteenth century and leave Dutch William and his Hollands and his pipe and his bulb gardens behind it seems to me that there is a great noise a tumultuous chattering We seem to burst upon a date of talkers of coffee houses of snuff and scandal All this was going on before I say to myself people were wearing powdered wigs and were taking snuff and were talking scandal but it did not appeal so forcibly We arrive at Sedan chairs and hoops too big for them we arrive at red heeled shoes Though both chairs and red heels belong to the previous reign still we arrive at them now they are very much in the picture We seem to see a profusion a confused mass of bobbins and bone lace mourning hatbands silk garters amber canes correctly conducted country men in red coats coxcombs brass and looking glass snuff boxes Illustration Gentlemen walk past our mental vision with seals curiously fancied and exquisitely well cut Ladies are sighing at the toss of a wig or the tap on a snuff box falling sick for a pair of striped garters or a pair of fringed gloves Gentlemen are sitting baldheaded in elegant dressing gowns while their wigs are being taken out of roulettes The peruquier removes the neat warm clay tube gives a last pat to the fine pipes of the hair and then gently places the wig on the waiting gentlemen If you can look through the walls of London houses you will next see regiments of gentlemen their faces pressed into glass cones while the peruquier tosses powder over their newly put on periwigs The bow at the end of the long pigtail on the Ramillies wig is tied that is over Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF QUEEN ANNE seventeen oh two seventeen fourteen The coat has become still more full at the sides The hat has a more generous brim Red heels in fashion Running footmen looking rather like Indians from the outsides of tobacco shops speed past They are dressed in close tunics with a fringed edge which flicks them just above the knee Their legs are tied up in leather guards their feet are strongly shod their wigs are in small bobs On their heads are little round caps with a feather stuck in them In one hand they carry a long stick about five feet high in the top knob of which they carry some food or a message A message to whom Illustration A Running Footman The running footman knocks on a certain door and delivers to the pretty maid a note for her ladyship from a handsome well shaped youth who frequents the coffee houses about Charing Cross There is no answer to the note her ladyship is too disturbed with household affairs Her Welsh maid has left her under suspicious circumstances and has carried off some articles The lady is even now writing to mister Bickerstaff of the Tatler to implore his aid This is the list of the things she has missed at least as much of the list as my mind remembers as it travels back over the years Illustration A thick wadded Calico Wrapper A Musk coloured Velvet Mantle lined with Squirrels Skins Eight night shifts four pairs of stockings curiously darned Six pairs of laced Shoes new and old with the heels of half two inches higher than their fellows A quilted Petticoat of the largest size and one of Canvas with whalebone hoops Three pairs of Stays boulstered below the left shoulder Two pairs of Hips of the newest fashion Six Roundabout Aprons with Pockets and four strip d Muslin night rails very little frayed A silver Cheese toaster with three tongues A silver Posnet to butter eggs A Bible bound in Shagreen with guilt Leaves and Clasps never opened but once Two Leather Forehead Cloathes three pair of oiled Dogskin Gloves Two brand new Plumpers three pair of fashionable Eyebrows Adam and Eve in Bugle work without Fig leaves upon Canvas curiously wrought with her Ladyship s own hand Bracelets of braided Hair Pomander and Seed Pearl A large old Purple Velvet Purse embroidered and shutting with a spring containing two Pictures in Miniature the Features visible A Silver gilt box for Cashu and Carraway Comfits to be taken at long sermons A new Gold Repeating Watch made by a Frenchman Together with a Collection of Receipts to make Pastes for the Hands Pomatums Lip Salves White Pots and Water of Talk Of these things one strikes the eye most curiously the canvas petticoat with whalebone hoops It dates the last making me know that the good woman lost her things in or about the year seventeen ten We are just at the beginning of the era of the tremendous hoop skirt This gentleman from the country will tell me all about it I stop him and remark his clothes by them I guess he has ridden from the country He is wearing a wide skirted coat of red with deep flap pockets his coat has buttons from neck to hem but only two or three at the waist are buttoned One hand with the deep cuff pushed back from the wrist to show his neat frilled shirt is thrust into his unbuttoned breeches pocket the two pockets being across the top of his breeches Round his neck is a black Steenkirk cravat a black silk tie knotted and twisted or allowed to hang over loose His hat is of black and the wide brim is turned back from his forehead His wig is a short black periwig in bobs that is it is gathered into bunches just on the shoulders and is twisted in a little bob at the back of the neck I have forgotten whether he wore red or blue stockings rolled above the knee but either is likely His shoes are strong high heeled and have a big tongue showing above the buckle Illustration Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF QUEEN ANNE seventeen oh two seventeen fourteen Notice that the fontage has become much lower and the hoop of the skirt has become enormous The hair is more naturally dressed He tells me that in Norfolk where he has come from the hoop has not come into fashion that ladies there dress much as they did before Queen Anne came to the throne The fontage is lower perhaps the waist may be longer but skirts are full and have long trains and are gathered in loops to show the petticoat of silk with its deep double row of flounces Aprons are worn long and have good pockets Cuffs are deep but are lowered to below the elbow The bodice of the gown is cut high in the back and low in front and is decked with a deep frill of lace or linen which allows less bare neck to show than formerly A very observant gentleman But you have seen the new hoop I ask him Yes he has seen it As he rode into town he noticed that the old fashions gave way to new that every mile brought the fontage lower and the hair more hidden until short curls and a little cap of linen or lace entirely replaced the old high head dress and the profusion of curls on the shoulders The hoop he noticed became larger and larger as he neared the town and the train grew shorter and the patterns on the under skirt grew larger with the hoop Illustration I leave my gentleman from the country and I stroll about the streets to regard the fashions Here I see is a gentleman in one of the new Ramillies wigs a wig of white hair drawn back from the forehead and puffed out full over the ears At the back the wig is gathered into a long queue the plaited or twisted tail of a wig and is ornamented at the top and bottom of the queue with a black bow Illustration I notice that this gentleman is dressed in more easy fashion than some His coat is not buttoned the flaps of his waistcoat are not over big his breeches are easy his tie is loose I know where this gentleman has stepped from he has come straight out of a sampler of mine by means of which piece of needlework I can get his story without book I know that he has a tremendous periwig at home covered with scented powder I know that he has an elegant suit with fullness of the skirts at his sides gathered up to a button of silver gilt there is plenty of lace on this coat and deep bands of it on the cuffs He has also I am certain a cane with an amber head very curiously clouded and this cane he hangs on to his fifth button by a blue silk ribbon This cane is never used except to lift it up at a coachman hold it over the head of a drawer or point out the circumstances of a story Also he has a single eyeglass or perspective which he will advance to his eye to gaze at a toast or an orange wench There is another figure on the sampler a lady in one of those wide hoops she has a fan in her hand I know her as well as the gentleman and know that she can use her fan as becomes a prude or a coquette I know she takes her chocolate in bed at nine in the morning at eleven she drinks a dish of bohea tries a new head at her twelve o clock toilette and at two cheapens fans at the Change Illustration Illustration I have seen her at her mantua makers I have watched her embroider a corner of her flower handkerchief and give it up to sit before her glass to determine a patch She is a good coachwoman and puts her dainty laced shoe against the opposite seat to balance herself against the many jolts meanwhile she takes her mask off for a look at the passing world If only I could ride in the coach with her If only I could I should see the fruit wenches in sprigged petticoats and flat broad brimmed hats the ballad sellers in tattered long skirted coats the country women in black hoods and cloaks and the men in frieze coats The ladies would pass by in pearl necklaces flowered stomachers artificial nosegays and shaded furbelows one is noted by her muff one by her tippet one by her fan Here a gentleman bows to our coach and my lady s heart beats to see his open waistcoat his red heels his suit of flowered satin I should not fail to notice the monstrous petticoats worn by ladies in chairs or in coaches these hoops stuffed out with cordage and stiffened with whalebone and according to mister Bickerstaff making the women look like extinguishers with a little knob at the upper end and widening downward till it ends in a basis of a most enormous circumference To finish I quite agree with mister Bickerstaff when he mentions the great shoe shop at the saint James s end of Pall Mall that the shoes there displayed notably the slippers with green lace and blue heels do create irregular thoughts in the youth of this nation GEORGE THE FIRST Reigned thirteen years seventeen fourteen seventeen twenty seven Born sixteen sixty Married sixteen eighty two Sophia of Brunswick THE MEN AND WOMEN Illustration We cannot do better than open Thackeray and put a finger on this passage There is the Lion s Head down whose jaws the Spectator s own letters were passed and over a great banker s in Fleet Street the effigy of the wallet which the founder of the firm bore when he came into London a country boy People this street so ornamented with crowds of swinging chairmen with servants bawling to clear the way with mister Dean in his cassock his lacquey marching before him or missus Dinah in her sack tripping to chapel her footboy carrying her ladyship s great prayer book with itinerant tradesmen singing their hundred cries I remember forty years ago as a boy in London city a score of cheery familiar cries that are silent now Fancy the beaux thronging to the chocolate houses tapping their snuff boxes as they issue thence their periwig appearing over the red curtains Fancy Saccharissa beckoning and smiling from the upper windows and a crowd of soldiers bawling and bustling at the door gentlemen of the Life Guards clad in scarlet with blue facings and laced with gold at the seams gentlemen of the Horse Grenadiers in their caps of sky blue cloth with the garter embroidered on the front in gold and silver men of the Halberdiers in their long red coats as bluff Harry left them with their ruffs and velvet flat caps Perhaps the King s Majesty himself is going to saint James s as we pass The Four Georges Illustration Illustration We find ourselves very willingly discussing the shoes of the King of France with a crowd of powdered beaux those shoes the dandyism of which has never been surpassed the heels if you please painted by Vandermeulen with scenes from Rhenish victories Or we go to the toy shops in Fleet Street where we may make assignations or buy us a mask where loaded dice are slyly handed over the counter Everywhere the beau He rides the world like a cock horse or like Og the giant rode the Ark of Noah steering it with his feet getting his washing for nothing and his meals passed up to him out by the chimney Here is the old soldier begging in his tattered coat of red here is a suspicious looking character with a black patch over his eye here the whalebone hoop of a petticoat takes up the way and above the monstrous hoop is the tight bodice and out of that comes the shoulders supporting the radiant Molly patches powder paint and smiles Here a woman passes in a Nithsdale hood covering her from head to foot this great cloak with a piquant history of prison breaking here with a clatter of high red heels the beau the everlasting beau in gold lace wide cuffs full skirts swinging cane A scene of flashing colours The coats embroidered with flowers and butterflies the cuffs a mass of fine sewing the three cornered hats cocked at a jaunty angle the stockings rolled above the knee Wigs in three divisions of loops at the back pass by wigs in long queues wigs in back and side bobs Lacquer hilted swords paste buckles gold and silver snuff boxes flashing in the sun which struggles through the mass of swinging signs Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF GEORGE I seventeen fourteen seventeen twenty seven The buckles on the shoes are now much larger the stockings are loosely rolled above the knee The great periwig is going out and the looped and curled wig very white with powder is in fashion Illustration There is a curious sameness about the clean shaven faces surmounted by white wigs there is if we believe the pictures a tendency to fat due to the tight waist of the breeches or the buckling of the belts The ladies wear little lace and linen caps their hair escaping in a ringlet or so at the side and flowing down behind or gathered close up to a small knob on the head The gentlemen s coats fall in full folds on either side the back at present has not begun to stick out so heavily with buckram Aprons for ladies are still worn Silks and satins brocades and fine cloths white wigs powdering velvet shoulders crowds of cut throats elegant gentlemen patched Aspasias tavern swindlers foreign adventurers thieves a highwayman a footpad a poor poet and narrow streets and mud Illustration Everywhere we see the skirted coat the big flapped waistcoat even beggar boys little pot high urchins are wearing some old laced waistcoat tied with string about their middles a pair of heel trodden buckleless shoes on their feet more likely bare footed Here is a man snatched from the tripe shop in Hanging Sword Alley by the King s men a pickpocket a highwayman a cut throat in hiding He will repent his jokes on Jack Ketch s kitchen when he feels the lash of the whip on his naked shoulders as he screams behind the cart tail ladies in flowered hoops will stop to look at him beaux will lift their quizzing glasses a young girl will whisper behind a fan painted with the loves of Jove to a gorgeous young fop in a light buttoned coat of sky blue Illustration There is a sadder sight to come a cart on the way to Tyburn a poor fellow standing by his coffin with a nosegay in his breast he is full of Dutch courage for as becomes a notorious highwayman he must show game before the crowd so he is full of stum and Yorkshire stingo Maybe we stop to see a pirate hanging in chains by the river and we are jostled by horse officers and watermen revenue men and jerkers and as usual the curious beau his glass to his eye Never was such a time for curiosity a man is preaching mystic religion there is a new flavour to the Rainbow Tavern furmity there is a fellow who can sew with his toes a man is in the pillory for publishing Jacobite ballads and always there is the beau looking on Illustration Country ladies still in small hoops even in full dresses innocent of whalebone are bewildered by the noise country gentlemen in plain coloured coats and stout shoes have come to London on South Sea Bubble business They will go to the Fair to see the Harlequin and Scaramouch dance they will buy a new perfume at The Civet Cat and they will go home the lady s head full of the new hoop fashion and she will cut away the sleeve of her old dress and put in fresh lace the gentleman full of curses on tavern bills and the outrageous price of South Sea shares Illustration And what says country dame to country dame lately from town what is the mode in gentlemen s hair Her own goodman has an old periwig very full and a small bob for ordinary wear Illustration The very full periwig is going out our lady assures her a tied wig is quite the mode a wig in three queues tied in round bobs or in hair loops and the long single queue wig is coming in rapidly and will soon be all the wear So with talk of flowered tabbies and fine lutestring are the fashions passed on Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF GEORGE I seventeen fourteen seventeen twenty seven You will see that the fontage has given way to a small lace cap The hair is drawn off the forehead The hoop of the skirt is still large Illustration Just as Sir Roger de Coverley nearly called a young lady in riding dress sir because of the upper half of her body so the ladies of this day might well be taken for sirs with their double breasted riding coats like the men and their hair in a queue surmounted by a cocked hat Colours and combinations of colours are very striking petticoats of black satin covered with large bunches of worked flowers morning gown of yellow flowered satin faced with cherry coloured bands waistcoats of one colour with a fringe of another bird s eye hoods bodices covered with gold lace and embroidered flowers all these gave a gay artificial appearance to the age but we are to become still more quaintly devised still more powdered and patched in the next reign GEORGE THE SECOND Reigned thirty three years seventeen twenty seven seventeen sixty Born sixteen eighty three Married seventeen oh five Caroline of Anspach THE MEN Just a few names of wigs and you will see how the periwig has gone into the background how the bob wig has superseded the campaign wig you will find a veritable confusion of barbers enthusiasms half forgotten designs names dependent on a twist a lock a careful disarrangement pigeon s wing wigs with wings of hair at the sides comets with long full tails cauliflowers with a profusion of curls royal bind wigs staircase wigs ladders brushes Count Saxe wigs cut bobs long bobs negligents chain buckles drop wigs bags Go and look at Hogarth there s a world of dress for you by the grim humorist who painted Sarah Malcolm the murderess in her cell who painted Taste in High Life Wigs inexhaustible subject wigs passing from father to son until they arrived at the second hand dealers in Monmouth Street and there after a rough overhauling began a new life There was a wig lottery at sixpence a ticket in Rosemary Lane and with even ordinary wigs Grizzle Majors at twenty five shillings Great Tyes at a guinea and Brown Bagwigs at fifteen shillings quite a considerable saving might be made by the lucky lottery winner Illustration On wigs hats cocked to suit the passing fashion broad brimmed narrow brimmed round three cornered high brimmed low brimmed turned high off the forehead turned low in front and high at the back an endless crowd Such a day for clothes for patches and politics Tory side and Whig to your face Tory or Whig cock to your hat pockets high pockets low stiff cuffs crushable cuffs a regular jumble of go as you please Let me try to sort the jumble Illustration Illustration Foremost the coat The coat is growing more full more spread it becomes on the beau a great spreading flaunting skirted affair just buttoned by a button or two at the waist It is laced or embroidered all over it is flowered or plain The cuffs are huge they will of course suit the fancy of the owner or the tailor About seventeen forty five they will get small some will get small then the fashions begin to run riot by the cut of coat you may not know the date of it then when you pass it in the street From seventeen forty five there begins the same jumble as to day a hopeless thing to unravel in the next reign certainly you may tell yourself here is one of the new Macaronis but that will be all you will mark out of the crowd of fashions one more remarkable newer than the rest but perhaps you have been in the country for a week and a new mode has come in and is dying out Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF GEORGE II seventeen twenty seven seventeen sixty Notice the heavy cuffs and the very full skirts of the coat He carries a chapeau bras under his arm a hat for carrying only since he will not ruffle his wig He wears a black satin tie to his wig the ends of which tie come round his neck are made into a bow and brooched with a solitaire Illustration From coat let us look at waistcoat Full flaps and long almost to the knees but again about seventeen fifty six they will be shorter They are fringed flowered laced open to show the lace cravat fall so daintily to show the black velvet bow tie that comes over from the black velvet or silk or satin tie of the queue Ruffles of lace of all qualities at the wrists the beau s hand emerging with his snuff box from a filmy froth of white lace Illustration In this era of costume from George I to George IV the great thing to remember is that the coat changes more than anything else from the stiff William and Mary coat with its deep stiff cuffs you see the change towards the George I coat a looser cut of the same design still simple in embroideries then the coat skirts are gathered to a button at each side of the coat just behind the pockets Then in George II s reign the skirt hangs in parallel folds free from the button and shapes to the back more closely the opening of the coat from the neck to the waist being so cut as to hang over the buttons and show the cravat and the waistcoat Then later in the same reign we see the coat with the skirts free of buckram and very full all round and the cuffs also free of stiffening and folding with the crease of the elbow Then about seventeen forty five we get the coat left more open and for the beau cut much shorter this often worn over a double breasted waistcoat Then arriving at George III we get a long series of coat changes with a collar on it turned over and standing high in the neck with the skirts buttoned back then cut away then the front of the coat cut away like the modern dress coat Illustration In following out these really complicated changes I have done my best to make my meaning clear by placing dates against those drawings where dates are valuable hoping by this means to show the rise and fall of certain fashions more clearly than any description would do It will be noticed that for ceremony the periwig gave place to the tie wig or in some few cases to natural hair curled and powdered The older men kept to the periwig no doubt from fondness of the old and as they thought more grave fashion but as I showed at the beginning of the chapter the beau and the young man even the quite middle class man wore or had the choice of wearing endless varieties of false attires of hair The sporting man had his own idea of dress even as to day he has a piquant idea in clothes and who shall say he has not the right A black wig a jockey cap with a bow at the back of it a very resplendent morning gown richly laced a morning cap and very comfortable embroidered slippers such mixtures of clothes in his wardrobe his coat no doubt a little over full but of good cloth his fine clothes rather over embroidered his tie wig often pushed too far back on his forehead and so showing his cropped hair underneath Muffs must be remembered as every dandy carried a muff in winter some big others grotesquely small Bath must be remembered and the great Beau Nash in the famous Pump Room as Thackeray says so say I I should like to have seen the Folly he says meaning Nash It was a splendid embroidered beruffled snuff boxed red heeled impertinent Folly and knew how to make itself respected I should like to have seen that noble old madcap Peterborough in his boots he actually had the audacity to walk about Bath in boots with his blue ribbon and stars and a cabbage under each arm and a chicken in his hand which he had been cheapening for his dinner It was the fashion to wear new clothes on the Queen s birthday March one and then the streets noted the loyal people who indulged their extravagance or pushed a new fashion on that day Do not forget that no hard and fast rules can be laid down a man s a man for all his tailor tells him he is a walking fashion plate Those who liked short cuffs wore them those who did not care for solitaires did without the height of a heel the breadth of a buckle the sweep of a skirt all lay at the taste of the owner merely would I have you remember the essentials Illustration There was a deal of dressing up the King bless you in a Turkish array at a masque the day of the Corydon and Sylvia mock shepherd dainty shepherdess was here my lord in silk loose coat with paste buttons fringed waistcoat little three cornered hat under his arm and a pastoral staff between his fingers a crook covered with cherry and blue ribbons and my lady in such a hoop of sprigged silk or some such stuff the tiniest of straw hat on her head high heels tapping the ground all a shepherding what Cupids I suppose little Dresden loves little comfit box jokes little spiteful remarks about the Germans Illustration Come let me doff my Kevenhuller hat with the gold fringe bring my red heels together with a smart tap bow with my hand on the third button of my coat from which my stick dangles and let me introduce the ladies THE WOMEN I will introduce the fair painted powdered patched perfumed sex though this would do for man or woman of the great world then by some lines from the Bath Guide Bring O bring thy essence pot Amber musk and bergamot Eau de chipre eau de luce Sanspareil and citron juice In a band box is contained Painted lawns and chequered shades Crape that s worn by love lorn maids Watered tabbies flowered brocades Straw built hats and bonnets green Catgut gauzes tippets ruffs Fans and hoods and feathered muffs Stomachers and Paris nets Earrings necklaces aigrets Fringes blouses and mignionets Fine vermillion for the cheek Velvet patches a la grecque Come but don t forget the gloves Which with all the smiling loves Venus caught young Cupid picking From the tender breast of chicken Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF GEORGE II seventeen twenty seven seventeen sixty She is wearing a large pinner over her dress Notice the large panniers the sleeves without cuffs the tied cap and the shortness of the skirts Illustration Now I think it will be best to describe a lady of quality In the first years of the reign she still wears the large hoop skirt a circular whalebone arrangement started at the waist and at intervals the hoops were placed so that the petticoat stood out all round like a bell over this the skirt hung stiff and solemn The bodice was tight laced cut square in front where the neckerchief of linen or lace made the edge soft The sleeves still retained the cuff covering the elbow and the under sleeve of linen with lace frills came half way down the forearm leaving bare arm and wrist to show Illustration Over the skirt she would wear as her taste held her a long plain apron or a long tucked apron or an apron to her knees The bodice generally formed the top of a gown which gown was very full skirted and was divided so as to hang back behind the dress showing often very little in front This will be seen clearly in the illustrations The hair is very tightly gathered up behind twisted into a small knob on the top of the head and either drawn straight back from the forehead or parted in the middle allowing a small fringe to hang on the temples Nearly every woman wore a small cap or a small round straw hat with a ribbon round it The lady s shoes would be high heeled and pointed toed with a little buckle and strap About the middle of the reign the sacque became the general town fashion the sacque being so named on account of the back which fell from the shoulders into wide loose folds over the hooped petticoat The sacque was gathered at the back in close pleats which fell open over the skirt part of this dress The front of the sacque was sometimes open sometimes made tight in the bodice Illustration Now the lady would puff her hair at the sides and powder it if she had no hair she wore false and a little later a full wig She would now often discard her neat cap and wear a veil behind her back over her hair and falling over her shoulders In seventeen forty eight so they say and so I believe to be true the King walking in the Mall saw the Duchess of Bedford riding in a blue riding habit with white silk facings this would be a man s skirted coat double breasted a cravat a three corned hat and a full blue skirt He admired her dress so much and thought it so neat that he straightway ordered that the officers of the navy who until now had worn scarlet should take this coat for the model of their new uniform So did the navy go into blue and white The poorer classes were not of course dressed in hooped skirts but the bodice and gown over the petticoat the apron and the turned back cuff to the short sleeve were worn by all The orange wench laced her gown neatly and wore a white cloth tied over her head about her shoulders she wore a kerchief of white and often a plain frill of linen at her elbows There were blue canvas striped dimity flannel and ticken for the humble for the rich lustrings satins Padesois velvets damasks fans and Leghorn hats bands of Valenciennes and Point de Dunquerque these might be bought of missus Holt whose card Hogarth engraved at the Two Olive Posts in the Broad part of the Strand Illustration Seventeen hundred and fifty five saw the one horse chairs introduced from France called cabriolets the first of our own extraordinary wild looking conveyances contrived for the minimum of comfort and the maximum of danger This invention captivated the hearts of both men and women The men painted cabriolets on their waistcoats they embroidered them on their stockings they cut them out in black silk and patched their cheeks with them horse and all the women began to take up a little later the cabriolet caps with round sides like linen wheels and later still at the very end of the reign there began a craze for such head dresses post chaises chairs and chairmen even waggons and this craze grew and grew and hair grew in wigs to meet the cry for hair and straw men of war for loads of hay for birds of paradise for goodness knows what forms of utter absurdity all of which I put down to the introduction of the cab I think that I can best describe the lady of this day as a swollen skirted figure with a pinched waist little head of hair or tiny cap developing into a loose sacque backed figure still whaleboned out with hair puffed at the sides and powdered getting ready to develop again into a queer figure under a tower of hair but that waits for the next reign One cannot do better than go to Hogarth s prints and pictures wonderful records of this time one picture especially Taste in High Life being a fine record of the clothes of seventeen forty two here you will see the panier and the sacque the monstrous muff the huge hoop the long tailed wig the black boy and the monkey In the Noon of the Four Parts of the Day there are clothes again satirized Illustration I am trusting that the drawings will supply what my words have failed to picture and I again for the twenty first time repeat that given the cut and the idea of the time the student has always to realize that there can be no hard and fast rule about the fashions with the shape he can take liberties up to the points shown with colour he can do anything patterns of the materials are obtainable and Hogarth will give anything required in detail GEORGE THE THIRD Reigned sixty years seventeen sixty eighteen twenty Born seventeen thirty eight Married seventeen sixty one Charlotte Sophia of Mecklenburg Strelitz THE MEN AND WOMEN Throughout this long reign the changes of costume are so frequent so varied and so jumbled together that any precise account of them would be impossible I have endeavoured to give a leading example of most kind of styles in the budget of drawings which goes with this chapter Details concerning this reign are so numerous Fashion books fashion articles in the London Magazine the St James s Chronicle works innumerable on hair dressing tailors patterns these are easily within the reach of those who hunt the second hand shops or are within reasonable distance of a library Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF GEORGE III seventeen sixty eighteen twenty The full skirted coat though still worn has given way in general to the tail coat The waistcoat is much shorter Black silk knee breeches and stockings are very general Following my drawings you will see in the first the ordinary wig skirted coat knee breeches chapeau bras cravat or waistcoat of the man about town I do not mean of the exquisite about town but if you will take it kindly just such clothes as you or I might have worn Illustration In the second drawing we see a fashionable man who might have strutted past the first fellow in the Park His hair is dressed in a twisted roll he wears a tight brimmed little hat a frogged coat a fringed waistcoat striped breeches and buckled shoes In the third we see the dress of a Macaroni On his absurd wig he wears a little Nevernoise hat his cravat is tied in a bow his breeches are loose and beribboned at the knee Many of these Macaronis wore coloured strings at the knee of their breeches but the fashion died away when Jack Rann Sixteen String Jack as he was called after this fashion had been hung in this make of breeches In number four we see the development of the tail coat and the high buttoned waistcoat The tail coat is of course son to the frock coat the skirts of which being inconvenient for riding had first been buttoned back and then cut back to give more play Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF GEORGE III seventeen sixty eighteen twenty In the earlier half of the reign Notice her sack dress over a satin dress and the white elaborately made skirt Also the big cap and the curls of white wig In the fifth drawing we see the double breasted cut away coat Number six is but a further tail coat design Number seven shows how different were the styles at one time Indeed except for the Macaroni and other extreme fashions the entire budget of men as shown might have formed a crowd in the Park on one day about twenty years before the end of the reign There would not be much powdered hair after seventeen ninety five but a few examples would remain A distinct change is shown in the eighth drawing of the long tailed full coat the broad hat the hair powdered but not tied Number nine is another example of the same style The tenth drawing shows the kind of hat we associate with Napoleon and in fact very Napoleonic garments In eleven we have a distinct change in the appearance of English dress The gentleman is a Zebra and is so called from his striped clothes He is of course in the extreme of fashion which did not last for long but it shows a tendency towards later Georgian appearance the top hat the shorter hair the larger neckcloth the pantaloons forerunners of Brummell s invention the open sleeve Illustration Illustration A MAN OF THE TIME OF GEORGE III seventeen sixty eighteen twenty The cuffs have gone and now the sleeve is left unbuttoned at the wrist The coat is long and full skirted but not stiffened The cravat is loosely tied and the frilled ends stick out These frills were in the end made on the shirt and were called chitterlings Number twelve shows us an ordinary gentleman in a coat and waistcoat with square flaps called dog s ears As the drawings continue you can see that the dress became more and more simple more like modern evening dress as to the coats more like modern stiff fashion about the neck The drawings of the women s dresses should also speak for themselves You may watch the growth of the wig and the decline of the hoop I trust with ease You may see those towers of hair of which there are so many stories Those masses of meal and stuffing powder and pomatum the dressing of which took many hours Those piles of decorated perfumed reeking mess by which a lady could show her fancy for the navy by balancing a straw ship on her head for sport by showing a coach for gardening by a regular bed of flowers Heads which were only dressed perhaps once in three weeks and were then rescented because it was necessary Monstrous germ gatherers of horse hair hemp wool and powder laid on in a paste the cleaning of which is too awful to give in full detail Three weeks says my lady s hairdresser is as long as a head can go well in the summer without being opened Illustration Illustration A WOMAN OF THE TIME OF GEORGE III seventeen sixty eighteen twenty This shows the last of the pannier dresses which gave way in seventeen ninety four or seventeen ninety five to Empire dresses A change came over all dress after the Revolution Then we go on to the absurd idea which came over womankind that it was most becoming to look like a pouter pigeon She took to a buffon a gauze or fine linen kerchief which stuck out pigeon like in front giving an exaggerated bosom to those who wore it With this fashion of seventeen eighty six came the broad brimmed hat Travel a little further and you have the mob cap All of a sudden out go hoops full skirts high hair powder buffons broad brimmed hats patches high heeled shoes and in come willowy figures and thin nearly transparent dresses turbans low shoes straight fringes I am going to give a chapter from a fashion book to show you how impossible it is to deal with the vagaries of fashion in the next reign and if I chose to occupy the space I could give a similar chapter to make the confusion of this reign more confounded DRAWINGS TO ILLUSTRATE THE COSTUME OF THE

GEORGE THE FOURTH Reigned ten years eighteen twenty eighteen thirty Born seventeen sixty two Married seventeen ninety five Caroline of Brunswick Out of the many fashion books of this time I have chosen from a little brown book in front of me a description of the fashions for ladies during one part of eighteen twenty seven It will serve to show how mere man blundering on the many complexities of the feminine passion for dress I was going to say clothes may find himself left amid a froth of frills high and dry except for a whiff of spray standing in his unromantic garments on the shore of the great world of gauze and gussets while the most noodle headed girl sails gracefully away upon the high seas to pirate some new device of the Devil or Paris Our wives bless them occasionally treat us to a few bewildering terms hoping by their gossamer knowledge to present to our gaze a mental picture of a new adorable ardently desired hat Perhaps those nine proverbial tailors who go to make the one proverbial man least of his sex might by a strenuous effort confine the history of clothes during this reign into a compact literature of forty volumes It would be indecent as undecorous as the advertisements in ladies papers to attempt to fathom the language of the man who endeavoured to read the monumental effigy to the vanity of human desire for adornment But is it adornment Nowadays to be dressed well is not always the same thing as to be well dressed Often it is far from it The question of modern clothes is one of great perplexity It seems that what is beauty one year may be the abomination of desolation the next because the trick of that beauty has become common property You puff your hair at the sides you are in the true sanctum of the mode you puff your hair at the sides you are for ever utterly cast out as one having no understanding I shall not attempt to explain it it passes beyond the realms of explanation into the pure air of Truth The Truth is simple Aristocracy being no longer real but only a cult one is afraid of one s servants Your servant puffs her hair at the sides and hang it she becomes exactly like an aristocrat Our servant having dropped her g s for many years as well as her h s it behoved us to pronounce our g s and our h s Our servants having learned our English it became necessary for us to drop our g s we seem at present unwilling in the matter of the h but that will come To cut the cackle and come to the clothes horse let me say that the bunglement of clothes which passes all comprehension in King George IV s reign is best explained by my cuttings from the book of one who apparently knew Let the older writer have his or her fling in his or her words CUROSY REMARKS ON THE LAST NEW FASHIONS The City of London is now indeed most splendid in its buildings and extent London is carried into the country but never was it more deserted A very very few years ago and during the summer the dresses of the wives and daughters of our opulent tradesmen would furnish subjects for the investigators of fashion Now if those who chance to remain in London take a day s excursion of about eight or ten miles distance from the Metropolis they hear the innkeepers deprecating the steamboats by which they declare they are almost ruined on Sundays which would sometimes bring them the clear profits of ten or twenty pounds they now scarce produce ten shillings No those of the middle class belonging to Cockney Island must leave town though the days are short and even getting cold and comfortless the steamboats carrying them off by shoals to Margate and its vicinity The pursuit after elegant and superior modes of dress must carry us farther it is now from the rural retirement of the country seats belonging to the noble and wealthy that we must collect them Young ladies wear their hair well arranged but not quite with the simplicity that prevailed last month during the warmth of the summer months the braids across the forehead were certainly the best but now when neither in fear of heat or damp the curls again appear in numerous clusters round the face and some young ladies who seem to place their chief pride in a fine head of hair have such a multitude of small ringlets that give to what is a natural charm all the poodle like appearance of a wig The bows of hair are elevated on the summit of the head and confined by a comb of tortoise shell Caps of the cornette kind are much in fashion made of blond and ornamented with flowers or puffs of coloured gauze most of the cornettes are small and tie under the chin with a bow on one side of white satin ribbon those which have ribbons or gauze lappets floating loose have them much shorter than formerly A few dress hats have been seen at dinner parties and musical amateur meetings in the country of transparent white crape ornamented with a small elegant bouquet of marabones When these dress hats are of coloured crape they are generally ornamented with flowers of the same tint as the hat in preference to feathers Printed muslins and chintzes are still very much worn in the morning walks with handsome sashes having three ends depending down each side not much beyond the hips With one of these dresses we saw a young lady wear a rich black satin pelerine handsomely trimmed with a very beautiful black blond it had a very neat effect as the dress was light White muslin dresses though they are always worn partially in the country till the winter actually commences are now seldom seen except on the young the embroidery on these dresses is exquisite Dresses of Indian red either in taffety or chintz have already made their appearance and are expected to be much in favour the ensuing winter the chintzes have much black in their patterns but this light material will in course be soon laid aside for silks and these like the taffeties which have partially appeared will no doubt be plain with these dresses was worn a Canezon spencer with long sleeves of white muslin trimmed with narrow lace Gros de Naples dresses are very general especially for receiving dinner parties and for friendly evening society At private dances the only kind of ball that has at present taken place are worn dresses of the white figured gauze over white satin or gros de Naples at the theatricals sometimes performed by noble amateurs the younger part of the audience who do not take a part are generally attired in very clear muslin over white satin with drapery scarves of lace barege or thick embroidered tulle Cachemire shawls with a white ground and a pattern of coloured flowers or green foliage are now much worn in outdoor costumes especially for the morning walk the mornings being rather chilly these warm envelopes are almost indispensable We are sorry however to find our modern belles so tardy in adopting those coverings which ought now to succeed to the light appendages of summer costume The muslin Canezon spencer the silk fichu and even the lighter barege are frequently the sole additions to a high dress or even to one but partially so We have lately seen finished to the order of a lady of rank in the county of Suffolk a very beautiful pelisse of jonquil coloured gros de Naples It fastens close down from the throat to the feet in front with large covered buttons at a suitable distance on each side of this fastening are three bias folds rather narrow brought close together under the belt and enlarging as they descend to the border of the skirt A large pelerine cape is made to take on and off and the bust from the back of each shoulder is ornamented with the same bias folds forming a stomacher in front of the waist The sleeves a la Marie are puckered a few inches above the wrist and confined by three straps each with a large button Though long ends are very much in favour with silk pelerines yet there are quite as many that are quite round such was the black satin pelerine we cited above Coloured bonnets are now all the rage we are happy to say that some though all too large are in the charming cottage style and are modestly tied under the chin Some bonnets are so excessively large that they are obliged to be placed quite at the back of the head and as their extensive brims will not support a veil when they are ornamented with a broad blond the edge of that just falls over the hair but does not even conceal the eyes Leghorn hats are very general their trimmings consist chiefly of ribbons though some ladies add a few branches of green foliage between the bows or puffs these are chiefly of the fern a great improvement to these green branches is the having a few wild roses intermingled The most admired colours are lavender Esterhazy olive green lilac marshmallow blossom and Indian red At rural fetes the ornaments of the hats generally consist of flowers these hats are backward in the Arcadian fashion and discover a wreath of small flowers on the hair ex bandeau In Paris the most admired colours are ethereal blue Hortensia cameleopard yellow pink grass green jonquil and Parma violet September one eighteen twenty seven Really this little fashion book is very charming it recreates for me the elegant simpering ladies it gives in its style just that artificial note which conjures this age of ladies with hats in the charming cottage style modestly tied under the chin They had the complete art of languor these dear creatures they lisped Italian and were fine needlewomen they painted weak little landscapes nooks or arbours found them dreaming of a Gothic revival they were all this and more but through this sweet envelope the delicate refined souls shone they were true women often great women their loops of hair their cameleopard pelerines shall not rob them of immortality cannot destroy their softening influence which permeated even the outrageous dandyism of the men of their time and steered the three bottle gentlemen their husbands and our grandfathers into a grand old age which we reverence to day and wonder at seeing them as giants against our nerve shattered drug taking generation As for the men look at the innumerable pictures and collect for instance the material for a colossal work upon the stock ties of the time run your list of varieties into some semblance of order commence with the varieties of macassar brown stocks pass on to patent leather stocks take your man for a walk and cause him to pass a window full of Hibernian stocks and let him discourse on the stocks worn by turf enthusiasts and when you are approaching the end of your twenty third volume give a picture of a country dinner party and end your work with a description of the gentlemen under the table being relieved of their stocks by the faithful family butler POWDER AND PATCHES The affectation of a mole to set off their beauty such as Venus had At the devill s shopps you buy A dresse of powdered hayre From the splendid pageant of history what figures come to you most willingly Does a great procession go by the window of your mind Knights bronzed by the sun of Palestine kings in chains emperors in blood drenched purple poets clothed like grocers with the souls of angels shining through their eyes fussy Secretaries of State informers spies inquisitors Court cards come to life harlequins statesmen in great ruffs wives of Bath in foot mantles and white wimples sulky Puritans laughing Cavaliers Dutchmen drinking gin and talking politics men in wide skirted coats and huge black periwigs all walking riding being carried in coaches in sedan chairs over the face of England Every step of the procession yields wonderful dreams of colour in every group there is one who by the personality of his clothes can claim the name of beau Near the tail of the throng there is a chattering bowing rustling crowd dimmed by a white mist of scented hair powder They are headed I think for one cannot see too clearly by the cook of the Comte de Bellemare a man by name Legros the great hairdresser Under his arm is a book the title of which reads Art de la Coiffure des Dames Francaises Behind him is a lady in an enormous hoop her hair is dressed a la belle Poule she is arguing some minute point of the disposition of patches with Monsieur Leonard another artist in hair What will be the next wear she asks A heart near the eye l assassine eh Or a star near the lips la friponne Must I wear a galante on my cheek an enjouee in my dimple or la majestueuse on my forehead Before we can hear the reply another voice is raised a guttural German voice it is John Schnorr the ironmaster of Erzgebinge The feet stuck in it I tell you he says actually stuck I got from my saddle and looked at the ground My horse had carried me on to what proved to be a mine of wealth Hair powder I sold it in Dresden in Leipsic and then at Meissen what does Boettcher do but use my hair powder to make white porcelain And so the chatter goes on Here is Charles Fox tapping the ground with his red heels and proclaiming in a voice thick with wine on the merits of blue hair powder here is Brummell free from hair powder free from the obnoxious necessity of going with his regiment to Manchester The dressy person and the person who is well dressed these two showing everywhere The one is in a screaming hue of woad the other a quiet note of blue dye the one in excessive velvet sleeves that he cannot manage the other controlling a rich amplitude of material with perfect grace Here a liripipe is extravagantly long here a gold circlet decorates curled locks with matchless taste Everywhere the battle between taste and gaudiness High hennins steeples of millinery stick up out of the crowd below these the towers of powdered hair bow and sway as the fine ladies patter along What a rustle and a bustle of silks and satins of flowered tabbies rich brocades cut velvets superfine cloths woollens cloth of gold See there are the square shouldered Tudors there are the steel glints of Plantagenet armour the Eastern robed followers of Coeur de Lion the swaggering beribboned Royalists the ruffs trunks and doublets of Elizabethans the snuffy wide skirted coats swaying about Queen Anne There are the soft swathed Norman ladies with bound up chins the tapestry figures of ladies proclaiming Agincourt the dignified dames about Elizabeth of York the playmates of Katherine Howard the wheels of round farthingales and the high lace collars of King James s Court the beauties bare breasted of Lely the Hogarthian women in close caps And in front of us two posturing figures in Dresden china colours rouged patched powdered perfumed in hoop skirts flirting with a fan the lady in gold laced wide coat solitaire bagwig ruffles and red heels the gentleman I protest madam he is saying but you flatter me vastly La sir she replies I am prodigiously truthful And how are we to know that all this is true the critics ask guarding the interest of the public We see that your book is full of statements and there are no or few authorities given for your studies Where they ask are the venerable anecdotes which are given a place in every respectable work on your subject

probably come and speak to us and if he enters into conversation be careful to give him a favourable impression of you for and she sunk her voice to a whisper he is the celebrated mister Brummell Life of Beau Brummell Captain Jesse Those who care to make the melancholy pilgrimage may see in the Protestant Cemetery at Caen the tomb of George Bryan Brummell He died at the age of sixty two in eighteen forty It is indeed a melancholy pilgrimage to view the tomb of that once resplendent figure to think before the hideous grave of the witty clever foolish procession from Eton to Oriel College Oxford from thence to a captaincy in the tenth Hussars from No four Chesterfield Street to No thirteen Chapel Street Park Lane from Chapel Street a flight to Calais from Calais to Paris and then at last to Caen and the bitter bitter end mumbling and mad to die in the Bon Sauveur Place him beside the man who once pretended to be his friend the man of whom Thackeray spoke so truly But a bow and a grin I try and take him to pieces and find silk stockings padding stays a coat with frogs and a fur coat a star and a blue ribbon a pocket handkerchief prodigiously scented one of Truefitt s best nutty brown wigs reeking with oil a set of teeth and a huge black stock under waistcoats more under waistcoats and then nothing Nothing Thackeray is right absolutely nothing remains of this King George of ours but a sale list of his wardrobe a wardrobe which fetched Lfifteen thousand second hand a wardrobe that had been a man He invented a shoe buckle one inch long and five inches broad He wore a pink silk coat with white cuffs He had five thousand steel beads on his hat He was a coward a good natured contemptible voluptuary Beside him in our eyes walks for a time the elegant figure of Beau Brummell I have said that Brummell was the inventor of modern dress it is true He was the Beau who raised the level of dress from the slovenly dirty linen the greasy hair the filthy neckcloth the crumbled collar to a position ever since held by Englishmen of quiet unobtrusive cleanliness decent linen an abhorrence of striking forms of dress He made clean linen and washing daily a part of English life See him seated before his dressing glass a mahogany framed sliding cheval glass with brass arms on either sides for candles By his side is George IV recovering from his drunken bout of last night The Beau s glass reflects his clean complexioned face his grey eyes his light brown hair and sandy whiskers A servant produces a shirt with a twelve inch collar fixed to it assists the Beau into it arranges it and stands aside The collar nearly hides the Beau s face Now with his hand protected with a discarded shirt he folds his collar down to the required height Now he takes his white stock and folds it carefully round the collar the stock is a foot high and slightly starched A supreme moment of artistic decision and the stock and collar take their perfect creases In an hour or so he will be ready to partake of a light meal with the royal gentleman He will stand up and survey himself in his morning dress his regular quiet suit A blue coat light breeches fitting the leg well a light waistcoat over a waistcoat of some other colour never a startling contrast Hessian boots or top boots and buckskins There was nothing very peculiar about his clothes except as Lord Byron said an exquisite propriety His evening dress was a blue coat white waistcoat black trousers buttoned at the ankle these were of his own invention and one may say it was the wearing of them that made trousers more popular than knee breeches striped silk stockings and a white stock He was a man of perfect taste of fastidious taste On his tables lay books of all kinds in fine covers Who would suspect it but the Prince is leaning an arm on a copy of Ellis s Early English Metrical Romances The Beau is a rhymer an elegant verse maker Here we see the paper presser of Napoleon I am flitting for the moment over some years and see him in his room in Calais here we notice his passion for buhl his Sevres china painted with Court beauties In his house in Chapel Street he saw daily portraits of Nelson and Pitt and George III upon his walls This is no Beau as we understand the term for we make it a word of contempt a nickname for a feeble fellow in magnificent garments Rather this is the room of an educated gentleman of exquisite propriety He played high as did most gentlemen he was superstitious as are many of the best of men That lucky sixpence with the hole in it that you gave to a cabman Beau Brummell was that loss the commencement of your downward career There are hundreds of anecdotes of Brummell which despite those of the George ring the bell character and those told of his heavy gaming are more valuable as showing his wit his cleanliness his distaste of display in fact his exquisite propriety A Beau is hardly a possible figure to day we have so few personalities and those we have are chiefly concerned with trade men who uphold trusts men who fight trusts men who speak for trade in the House of Commons We have not the same large vulgarities as our grandfathers nor have we the same wholesome refinement in killing the evil the great gambler the great men of the turf the great prize fighters the heavy wine drinkers we have killed also the good the classic well spoken civil gentleman Our manners have suffered at the expense of our morals Fifty or sixty years ago the world was full of great men saying writing thinking great things To day perhaps it is too early to speak of to day Personalities are so little marked by their clothes by any stamp of individuality that the caricaturist or even the minute and truthful artist be he painter or writer has a difficult task before him when he sets out to point at the men of these our times George Brummell came into the world on June seven seventeen seventy eight He was a year or so late for the Macaroni style of dress many years behind the Fribbles after the Smarts and must have seen the rise and fall of the Zebras when he was thirteen During his life he saw the old fashioned full frock coat bagwig solitaire and ruffles die away he saw the decline and fall of knee breeches for common wear and the pantaloons invented by himself take their place From these pantaloons reaching to the ankle came the trousers as fashionable garments open over the instep at first and joined by loops and buttons then strapped under the boot and after that in every manner of cut to the present style He saw the three cornered hat vanish from the hat boxes of the polite world and he saw fine coloured clothes give way to blue coats with brass buttons or coats of solemn black It may be said that England went into mourning over the French Revolution and has not yet recovered Beau Brummell on his way to Eton saw a gay coloured crowd of powdered and patched people saw claret coloured coats covered with embroidery gold laced hats twinkling shoe buckles On his last walks in Caen no doubt he dreamed of London as a place of gay colours instead of the drab place it was beginning to be To day there is no more monotonous sight than the pavements of Piccadilly crowded with people in dingy sad clothes with silk tubes on their heads their black and gray suits being splashed by the mud from black hansoms or by the scatterings of motor cars driven by aristocratic looking mechanics in which mechanical looking aristocrats lounge darkly clad Here and there some woman s dress enlivens the monotony here a red pillar box shines in the sun there again we bless the Post Office for their red mail carts and perhaps we are strengthened to bear the gloom by the sight of a blue or red bus But our hearts are not in tune with the picture we feel the lack of colour of romance of everything but money in the street Suddenly a magnificent policeman stops the traffic there is a sound of jingling harness of horses hoofs beating in unison There flashes upon us an escort of Life Guards sparkling in the sun flashing specks of light from swords breastplates helmets The little forest of waving plumes the raising of hats the polite murmuring of cheers warms us We feel young our hearts beat we feel more healthy more alive for this gleam of colour Then an open carriage passes us swiftly as we stand with bared heads There is a momentary sight of a man in uniform a man with a wonderful face clever dignified kind And we say with a catch in our voices THE KING GOD BLESS HIM THE END BILLING AND SONS limited PRINTERS GUILDFORD
