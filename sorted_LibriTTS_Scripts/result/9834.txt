RESTORED TO ENERGY XXVIII THE WOMAN IN BLACK THE TALLEYRAND MAXIM CHAPTER I DEATH BRINGS OPPORTUNITY Linford Pratt senior clerk to Eldrick Pascoe solicitors of Barford a young man who earnestly desired to get on in life by hook or by crook with no objection whatever to crookedness so long as it could be performed in safety and secrecy had once during one of his periodical visits to the town Reference Library lighted on a maxim of that other unscrupulous person Prince Talleyrand which had pleased him greatly With time and patience said Talleyrand the mulberry leaf is turned into satin This seemed to Linford Pratt one of the finest and soundest pieces of wisdom which he had ever known put into words A mulberry leaf is a very insignificant thing but a piece of satin is a highly marketable commodity with money in it Henceforth he regarded himself as a mulberry leaf which his own wit and skill must transform into satin at the same time he knew that there is another thing in addition to time and patience which is valuable to young men of his peculiar qualities a thing also much beloved by Talleyrand opportunity He could find the patience and he had the time but it would give him great happiness if opportunity came along to help in the work In everyday language Linford Pratt wanted a chance he waited the arrival of the tide in his affairs which would lead him on to fortune Leave him alone he said to himself to be sure to take it at the flood If Pratt had only known it as he stood in the outer office of Eldrick Pascoe at the end of a certain winter afternoon opportunity was slowly climbing the staircase outside not only opportunity but temptation both assisted by the Devil They came at the right moment for Pratt was alone the partners had gone the other clerks had gone the office boy had gone in another minute Pratt would have gone too he was only looking round before locking up for the night Then these things came combined in the person of an old man Antony Bartle who opened the door pushed in a queer wrinkled face and asked in a quavering voice if anybody was in I m in mister Bartle answered Pratt turning up a gas jet which he had just lowered Come in sir What can I do for you Antony Bartle came in wheezing and coughing He was a very very old man feeble and bent with little that looked alive about him but his light alert eyes Everybody knew him he was one of the institutions of Barford as well known as the Town Hall or the Parish Church For fifty years he had kept a second hand bookshop in Quagg Alley the narrow passage way which connected Market Street with Beck Street It was not by any means a common or ordinary second hand bookshop its proprietor styled himself an antiquarian bookseller and he had a reputation in two Continents and dealt with millionaire buyers and virtuosos in both Barford people sometimes marvelled at the news that mister Antony Bartle had given two thousand guineas for a Book of Hours and had sold a Missal for twice that amount to some American collector and they got a hazy notion that the old man must be well to do despite his snuffiness and shabbiness and that his queer old shop in the window of which there was rarely anything to be seen but a few ancient tomes and two or three rare engravings contained much that he could turn at an hour s notice into gold All that was surmise but Eldrick Pascoe which term included Linford Pratt knew all about Antony Bartle being his solicitors his will was safely deposited in their keeping and Pratt had been one of the attesting witnesses The old man having slowly walked into the outer office leaned against a table panting a little Pratt hastened to open an inner door Come into mister Eldrick s room mister Bartle he said There s a nice easy chair there come and sit down in it Those stairs are a bit trying aren t they I often wish we were on the ground floor He lighted the gas in the senior partner s room and turning back took hold of the visitor s arm and helped him to the easy chair Then having closed the doors he sat down at Eldrick s desk put his fingers together and waited Pratt knew from experience that old Antony Bartle would not have come there except on business he knew also having been at Eldrick Pascoe s for many years that the old man would confide in him as readily as in either of his principals There s a nasty fog coming on outside said Bartle after a fit of coughing It gets on my lungs and then it makes my heart bad mister Eldrick in Gone replied Pratt All gone mister Bartle only me here You ll do answered the old bookseller You re as good as they are He leaned forward from the easy chair and tapped the clerk s arm with a long claw like finger I say he continued with a smile that was something between a wink and a leer and suggestive of a pleased satisfaction I ve had a find Oh responded Pratt One of your rare books mister Bartle Got something for twopence that you ll sell for ten guineas You re one of the lucky ones you know you are Nothing of the sort chuckled Bartle And I had to pay for my knowledge young man before I got it we all have No but I ve found something not half an hour ago Came straight here with it Matters for lawyers of course Yes said Pratt inquiringly And what may it be He was expecting the visitor to produce something but the old man again leaned forward and dug his finger once more into the clerk s sleeve I say he whispered You remember John Mallathorpe and the affair of how long is it since Two years answered Pratt promptly Of course I do Couldn t very well forget it or him He let his mind go back for the moment to an affair which had provided Barford and the neighbourhood with a nine days sensation One winter morning just two years previously mister John Mallathorpe one of the best known manufacturers and richest men of the town had been killed by the falling of his own mill chimney The condition of the chimney had been doubtful for some little time experts had been examining it for several days at the moment of the catastrophe Mallathorpe himself some of his principal managers and a couple of professional steeple jacks were gathered at its base consulting on a report The great hundred foot structure above them had collapsed without the slightest warning Mallathorpe his principal manager and his cashier had been killed on the spot two other bystanders had subsequently died from injuries received No such accident had occurred in Barford nor in the surrounding manufacturing district for many years and there had been much interest in it for according to the expert s conclusions the chimney was in no immediate danger Other mill owners then began to examine their chimneys and for many weeks Barford folk had talked of little else than the danger of living in the shadows of these great masses of masonry But there had soon been something else to talk of It sprang out of the accident and it was of particular interest to persons who like Linford Pratt were of the legal profession John Mallathorpe so far as anybody knew or could ascertain had died intestate No solicitor in the town had ever made a will for him No solicitor elsewhere had ever made a will for him No one had ever heard that he had made a will for himself There was no will Drastic search of his safes his desks his drawers revealed nothing not even a memorandum No friend of his had ever heard him mention a will He had always been something of a queer man He was a confirmed bachelor The only relation he had in the world was his sister in law the widow of his deceased younger brother and her two children a son and a daughter And as soon as he was dead and it was plain that he had died intestate they put in their claim to his property John Mallathorpe had left a handsome property He had been making money all his life His business was a considerable one he employed two thousand workpeople His average annual profit from his mills was reckoned in thousands four or five thousands at least And some years before his death he had bought one of the finest estates in the neighbourhood Normandale Grange a beautiful old house set amidst charming and romantic scenery in a valley which though within twelve miles of Barford might have been in the heart of the Highlands Therefore it was no small thing that missus Richard Mallathorpe and her two children laid claim to Up to the time of John Mallathorpe s death they had lived in very humble fashion lived indeed on an allowance from their well to do kinsman for Richard Mallathorpe had been as much of a waster as his brother had been of a money getter And there was no withstanding their claim when it was finally decided that John Mallathorpe had died intestate no withstanding that at any rate of the nephew and niece The nephew had taken all the real estate he and his sister had shared the personal property And for some months they and their mother had been safely installed at Normandale Grange and in full possession of the dead man s wealth and business All this flashed through Linford Pratt s mind in a few seconds he knew all the story he had often thought of the extraordinary good fortune of those young people To be living on charity one week and the next to be legal possessors of thousands a year oh if only such luck would come his way Of course he repeated looking thoughtfully at the old bookseller Not the sort of thing one does forget in a hurry mister Bartle What of it Antony Bartle leaned back in his easy chair and chuckled something some idea seemed to be affording him amusement I m eighty years old he remarked No I m more to be exact I shall be eighty two come February When you ve lived as long as that young mister Pratt you ll know that this life is a game of topsy turvy to some folks at any rate Just so You didn t come here to tell me that mister Bartle said Pratt He was an essentially practical young man who dined at half past six every evening having lunched on no more than bread and cheese and a glass of ale and he also had his evenings well mapped out I know that already sir Aye aye but you ll know more of it later on replied Bartle Well you know too no doubt that the late John Mallathorpe was a bit only a bit of a book collector collected books and pamphlets relating to this district I ve heard of it answered the clerk He had that collection in his private room at the mill continued the old bookseller and when the new folks took hold I persuaded them to sell it to me There wasn t such a lot maybe a hundred volumes altogether but I wanted what there was And as they were of no interest to them they sold em That s some months ago I put all the books in a corner and I never really examined them until this very afternoon Then by this afternoon s post I got a letter from a Barford man who s now out in America He wanted to know if I could supply him with a nice copy of Hopkinson s History of Barford I knew there was one in that Mallathorpe collection so I got it out and examined it And in the pocket inside in which there s a map I found what d ye think Couldn t say replied Pratt He was still thinking of his dinner and of an important engagement to follow it and he had not the least idea that old Antony Bartle was going to tell him anything very important Letters Bank notes Something of that sort The old bookseller leaned nearer across the corner of the desk until his queer wrinkled face was almost close to Pratt s sharp youthful one Again he lifted the claw like finger again he tapped the clerk s arm I found John Mallathorpe s will he whispered His will Linford Pratt jumped out of his chair For a second he stared in speechless amazement at the old man then he plunged his hands deep into his trousers pockets opened his mouth and let out a sudden exclamation No he said No John Mallathorpe s will His will Made the very day on which he died answered Bartle nodding emphatically Queer wasn t it He might have had some premonition eh Pratt sat down again Where is it he asked Here in my pocket replied the old bookseller tapping his rusty coat Oh it s all right I assure you All duly made out signed and witnessed Everything in order I know because a long a very long time ago I was like you an attorney s clerk I ve drafted many a will and witnessed many a will in my time I ve read this every word of it it s all right Nothing can upset it Let s see it said Pratt eagerly Well I ve no objection I know you of course answered Bartle but I d rather show it first to mister Eldrick Couldn t you telephone up to his house and ask him to run back here Certainly replied Pratt He mayn t be there though But I can try You haven t shown it to anybody else Neither shown it to anybody nor mentioned it to a soul said Bartle I tell you it s not much more than half an hour since I found it It s not a long document Do you know how it is that it s never come out he went on turning eagerly to Pratt who had risen again It s easily explained The will s witnessed by those two men who were killed at the same time as John Mallathorpe So of course there was nobody to say that it was in evidence My notion is that he and those two men Gaukrodger and Marshall his manager and cashier had signed it not long before the accident and that Mallathorpe had popped it into the pocket of that book before going out into the yard Eh But see if you can get mister Eldrick down here and we ll read it together And I say this office seems uncommonly stuffy can you open the window a bit or something I feel oppressed like Pratt opened a window which looked out on the street He glanced at the old man for a moment and saw that his face always pallid was even paler than usual You ve been talking too much he said Rest yourself mister Bartle while I ring up mister Eldrick s house If he isn t there I ll try his club he often turns in there for an hour before going home He went out by a private door to the telephone box which stood in a lobby used by various occupants of the building And when he had rung up Eldrick s private house and was waiting for the answer he asked himself what this discovery would mean to the present holders of the Mallathorpe property and his curiosity a strongly developed quality in him became more and more excited If Eldrick was not at home if he could not get in touch with him he would persuade old Bartle to let him see his find he would cheerfully go late to his dinner if he could only get a peep at this strangely discovered document Romance Why this indeed was romance and it might be what else Old Bartle had already chuckled about topsy turvydom did that mean that The telephone bell rang Eldrick had not yet reached his house Pratt got on to the club Eldrick had not been there He rang off and went back to the private room Can t get hold of him mister Bartle he began as he closed the door He s not at home and he s not at the club I say you might as well let me have a look at Pratt suddenly stopped There was a strange silence in the room the old man s wheezy breathing was no longer heard And the clerk moved forward quickly and looked round the high back of the easy chair He knew at once what had happened knew that old Bartle was dead before he laid a finger on the wasted hand which had dropped helplessly at his side He had evidently died without a sound or a movement died as quietly as he would have gone to sleep Indeed he looked as if he had just laid his old head against the padding of the chair and dropped asleep and Pratt who had seen death before knew that he would never wake again He waited a moment listening in the silence Once he touched the old man s hand once he bent nearer still listening And then without hesitation and with fingers that remained as steady as if nothing had happened he unbuttoned Antony Bartle s coat and drew a folded paper from the inner pocket CHAPTER II IN TRUST As quietly and composedly as if he were discharging the most ordinary of his daily duties Pratt unfolded the document and went close to the solitary gas jet above Eldrick s desk What he held in his hand was a half sheet of ruled foolscap paper closely covered with writing which he at once recognized as that of the late John Mallathorpe He was familiar with that writing he had often seen it It was an old fashioned writing clear distinct with every letter well and fully formed Made it himself muttered Pratt Um looks as if he wanted to keep the terms secret Well He read the will through rapidly but with care murmuring the phraseology half aloud This is the last will of me John Mallathorpe of Normandale Grange in the parish of Normandale in the West Riding of the County of York I appoint Martin William Charlesworth manufacturer of Holly Lodge Barford and Arthur James Wyatt chartered accountant of sixty five Beck Street Barford executors and trustees of this my will I give and devise all my

presence of each other have hereunto set our names as witnesses HENRY GAUKRODGER sixteen Florence Street Barford Mill Manager CHARLES WATSON MARSHALL fifty six Laburnum Terrace Barford Cashier As the last word left his lips Pratt carefully folded up the will slipped it into an inner pocket of his coat and firmly buttoned the coat across his chest Then without as much as a glance at the dead man he left the room and again visited the telephone box He was engaged in it for a few minutes When he came out he heard steps coming up the staircase and looking over the banisters he saw the senior partner Eldrick a middle aged man Eldrick looked up and saw Pratt I hear you ve been ringing me up at the club Pratt he said What is it Pratt waited until Eldrick had come up to the landing Then he pointed to the door of the private room and shook his head It s old mister Bartle sir he whispered He s in your room there dead Dead exclaimed Eldrick Dead Pratt shook his head again He came up not so long after you d gone sir he said Everybody had gone but me I was just going Wanted to see you about something I don t know what He was very tottery when he came in complained of the stairs and the fog I took him into your room to sit down in the easy chair And he died straight off Just concluded Pratt just as if he was going quietly to sleep You re sure he is dead not fainting asked Eldrick He s dead sir quite dead replied Pratt I ve rung up doctor Melrose he ll be here in a minute or two and the Town Hall the police as well Will you look at him sir Eldrick silently motioned his clerk to open the door together they walked into the room And Eldrick looked at his quiet figure and wan face and knew that Pratt was right Poor old chap he murmured touching one of the thin hands He was a fine man in his time Pratt clever man And he was very very old one of the oldest men in Barford Well we must wire to his grandson mister Bartle Collingwood You ll find his address in the book He s the only relation the old fellow had Come in for everything doesn t he sir asked Pratt as he took an address book from the desk and picked up a sheaf of telegram forms Every penny murmured Eldrick Nice little fortune too a fine thing for a young fellow who s just been called to the Bar As a matter of fact he ll be fairly well independent even if he never sees a brief in his life He has been called has he sir asked Pratt laying a telegram form on Eldrick s writing pad and handing him a pen I wasn t aware of that Called this term quite recently at Gray s Inn replied Eldrick as he sat down Very promising clever young man Look here we d better send two wires one to his private address and one to his chambers They re both in that book It s six o clock isn t it he might be at his chambers yet but he may have gone home I ll write both messages you put the addresses on and get the wire off we must have him down here as soon as possible One address is fifty threex Pump Court the other s ninety six Cloburn Square remarked Pratt consulting the book There s an express from King s Cross at eight point fifteen which gets here midnight Oh it would do if he came down first thing in the morning leave it to him said Eldrick I say Pratt do you think an inquest will be necessary Pratt had not thought of that he began to think And while he was thinking the doctor whom he had summoned came in He looked at the dead man asked the clerk a few questions and was apparently satisfied I don t think there s any need for an inquest he said in reply to Eldrick I knew the old man very well he was much feebler than he would admit The exertion of coming up these stairs of yours and the coughing brought on by the fog outside that was quite enough Of course the death will have to be reported in the usual way but I have no hesitation in giving a certificate You ve let the Town Hall people know Well the body had better be removed to his rooms we must send over and tell his housekeeper He d no relations in the town had he Only one in the world that he ever mentioned his grandson a young barrister in London answered Eldrick We ve just been wiring to him Here Pratt you take these messages now and get them off Then we ll see about making all arrangements By the by he added as Pratt moved towards the door you don t know what what he came to see me about Haven t the remotest idea sir answered Pratt readily and glibly He died just as I ve told you before he could tell me anything He went downstairs and out into the street and away to the General Post Office only conscious of one thing only concerned about one thing that he was now the sole possessor of a great secret The opportunity which he had so often longed for had come And as he hurried along through the gathering fog he repeated and repeated a fragment of the recent conversation between the man who was now dead and himself who remained very much alive You haven t shown it to anybody else Pratt had asked Neither shown it to anybody nor mentioned it to a soul Antony Bartle had answered So in all that great town of Barford he Linford Pratt he alone out of a quarter of a million people knew what The magnitude of what he knew not only amazed but exhilarated him There were such possibilities for himself in that knowledge He wanted to be alone to think out those possibilities to reckon up what they came to Of one thing he was already certain they should be must be turned to his own advantage It was past eight o clock before Pratt was able to go home to his lodgings His landlady meeting him in the hall hoped that his dinner would not be spoiled Pratt who relied greatly on his dinner as his one great meal of the day replied that he fervently hoped it wasn t but that if it was it couldn t be helped this time For once he was thinking of something else than his dinner as for his engagement for that evening he had already thrown it over he wanted to give all his energies and thoughts and time to his secret Nevertheless it was characteristic of him that he washed changed his clothes ate his dinner and even glanced over the evening newspaper before he turned to the real business which was already deep in his brain But at last when the maid had cleared away the dinner things and he was alone in his sitting room and had lighted his pipe and mixed himself a drop of whisky and water the only indulgence in such things that he allowed himself within the twenty four hours he drew John Mallathorpe s will from his pocket and read it carefully three times And then he began to think closely and steadily First of all the will was a good will Nothing could upset it It was absolutely valid It was not couched in the terms which a solicitor would have employed but it clearly and plainly expressed John Mallathorpe s intentions and meanings in respect to the disposal of his property Nothing could be clearer The properly appointed trustees were to realize his estate They were to distribute it according to his specified instructions It was all as plain as a pikestaff Pratt who was a good lawyer knew what the Probate Court would say to that will if it were ever brought up before it as he did a quite satisfactory will And it was validly executed Hundreds of people competent to do so could swear to John Mallathorpe s signature hundreds to Gaukrodger s thousands to Marshall s who as cashier was always sending his signature broadcast No there was nothing to do but to put that into the hands of the trustees named in it and then Pratt thought next of the two trustees They were well known men in the town They were comparatively young men about forty They were men of great energy Their chief interests were in educational matters that no doubt was why John Mallathorpe had appointed them trustees Wyatt had been plaguing the town for two years to start commercial schools Charlesworth was a devoted champion of technical schools Pratt knew how the hearts of both would leap if he suddenly told them that enormous funds were at their disposal for the furtherance of their schemes And he also knew something else that neither Charlesworth nor Wyatt had the faintest remotest notion or suspicion that John Mallathorpe had ever made such a will or they would have moved heaven and earth pulled down Normandale Grange and Mallathorpe s Mill in their efforts to find it But the effect the effect of producing the will now Pratt like everybody else had been deeply interested in the Mallathorpe affair There was so little doubt that John Mallathorpe had died intestate such absolute certainty that his only living relations were his deceased brother s two children and their mother that the necessary proceedings for putting Harper Mallathorpe and his sister Nesta in possession of the property real and personal had been comparatively simple and speedy But what was it worth What would the two trustees have been able to hand over to the Mayor and Corporation of Barford if the will had been found as soon as John Mallathorpe died Pratt from what he remembered of the bulk and calculations at the time made a rapid estimate As near as he could reckon the Mayor and Corporation would have got about Lthree hundred thousand That then and this was what he wanted to get at was what these young people would lose if he produced the will Nay on second thoughts it would be much more very much more in some time for the manufacturing business was being carried on by them and was apparently doing as well as ever It was really an enormous amount which they would lose and they would get what Ten thousand apiece and their mother a like sum Thirty thousand pounds in all in comparison with hundreds of thousands But they would have no choice in the matter Nothing could upset that will He began to think of the three people whom the production of this will would dispossess He knew little of them beyond what common gossip had related at the time of John Mallathorpe s sudden death They had lived in very quiet fashion somewhere on the outskirts of the town until this change in their fortunes Once or twice Pratt had seen missus Mallathorpe in her carriage in the Barford streets somebody had pointed her out to him and had observed sneeringly that folk can soon adapt themselves to circumstances and that missus Mallathorpe now gave herself all the airs of a duchess though she had been no more than a hospital nurse before she married Richard Mallathorpe And Pratt had also seen young Harper Mallathorpe now and then in the town since the good fortune arrived and had envied him he had also thought what a strange thing it was that money went to young fellows who seemed to have no particular endowments of brain or energy Harper was a very ordinary young man not over intelligent in appearance who Pratt had heard was often seen lounging about the one or two fashionable hotels of the place As for the daughter Pratt did not remember having ever set eyes on her but he had heard that up to the time of John Mallathorpe s death she had earned her own living as a governess or a nurse or something of that sort He turned from thinking of these three people to thoughts about himself Pratt often thought about himself and always in one direction the direction of self advancement He was always wanting to get on He had nobody to help him He had kept himself since he was seventeen His father and mother were dead he had no brothers or sisters the only relations he had uncles and aunts lived some in London some in Canada He was now twenty eight and earning four pounds a week He had immense confidence in himself but he had never seen much chance of escaping from drudgery He had often thought of asking Eldrick Pascoe to give him his articles but he had a shrewd idea that his request would be refused No it was difficult to get out of a rut And yet he was a clever fellow a good looking fellow a sharp shrewd able and here was a chance such a chance as scarcely ever comes to a man He would be a fool if he did not take it and use it to his own best and lasting advantage And so he locked up the will in a safe place and went to bed resolved to take a bold step towards fortune on the morrow CHAPTER III THE SHOP BOY When Pratt arrived at Eldrick Pascoe s office at his usual hour of nine next morning he found the senior partner already there And with him was a young man whom the clerk at once set down as mister Bartle Collingwood and looked at with considerable interest and curiosity He had often heard of mister Bartle Collingwood but had never seen him He knew that he was the only son of old Antony Bartle s only child a daughter who had married a London man he knew too that Collingwood s parents were both dead and that the old bookseller had left their son everything he possessed a very nice little fortune as Eldrick had observed last night And since last night he had known that Collingwood had just been called to the Bar and was on the threshold of what Eldrick who evidently knew all about it believed to be a promising career Well there he was in the flesh and Pratt who was a born observer of men and events took a good look at him as he stood just within the private room talking to Eldrick A good looking fellow what most folk would call handsome dark clean shaven tall with a certain air of reserve about his well cut features firm lips and steady eyes that suggested strength and determination He would look very well in wig and gown decided Pratt viewing matters from a professional standpoint he was just the sort that clients would feel a natural confidence in and that juries would listen to Another of the lucky ones too for Pratt knew the contents of Antony Bartle s will and that the young man at whom he was looking had succeeded to a cool five and twenty thousand pounds at least through his grandfather s death Here is Pratt said Eldrick glancing into the outer office as the clerk entered it Pratt come in here here is mister Bartle Collingwood He would like you to tell him the facts about mister Bartle s death Pratt walked in armed and prepared He was a clever hand at foreseeing things and he had known all along that he would have to answer questions about the event of the previous night There s very little to tell sir he said with a polite acknowledgment of Collingwood s greeting mister Bartle came up here just as I was leaving everybody else had left He wanted to see mister Eldrick Why he didn t say He was coughing a good deal when he came in and he complained of the fog outside and of the stairs He said something just a mere mention about his heart being bad I lighted the gas in here and helped him into the chair He just sat down laid his head back and died Without saying anything further asked Collingwood Not a word more mister Collingwood answered Pratt He well it was just as if he had dropped off to sleep Of course at first I thought he d fainted but I soon saw what it was it so happens that I ve seen a death just as sudden as that once before my landlady s husband died in a very similar fashion in my presence There was nothing I could do mister Collingwood except ring up mister Eldrick and the doctor and the police mister Pratt made himself very useful last night in making arrangements remarked Eldrick looking at Collingwood As it is there is very little to do There will be no need for any inquest Melrose has given his certificate So there are only the funeral arrangements We can help you with that matter of course But first you d no doubt like to go to your grandfather s place and look through his papers We have his will here you know and I ve already told you its effect I m much obliged to you mister Pratt said Collingwood turning to the clerk He turned again to Eldrick All right he went on I ll go over to Quagg Alley Bye the bye mister Pratt my grandfather didn t tell you anything of the reason of his call here Not a word sir replied Pratt Merely said he wanted mister Eldrick Had he any legal business in process asked Collingwood Eldrick and his clerk both shook their heads No mister Bartle had no business of that sort that they knew of Nothing but there again Pratt was prepared It might have been about the lease of that property in Horsebridge Land sir he said glancing at his principal He did mention that you know when he was in here a few weeks ago Just so agreed Eldrick Well you ll let me know if we can be of use he went on as Collingwood turned away Pratt can be at your disposal any time Collingwood thanked him and went off He had travelled down from London by the earliest morning train and leaving his portmanteau at the hotel of the Barford terminus had gone straight to Eldrick Pascoe s office accordingly this was his first visit to the shop in Quagg Alley But he knew the shop and its surroundings well enough though he had not been in Barford for some time he also knew Antony Bartle s old housekeeper missus Clough a rough and ready Yorkshirewoman who had looked after the old man as long as he Collingwood could remember She received him as calmly as if he had merely stepped across the street to inquire after his grandfather s health I thowt ye d be down here first thing Mestur Collingwood she said as he walked into the parlor at the back of the shop Of course there s naught to be done except to see after yer grandfather s burying I don t know if ye were surprised or no when t lawyers tellygraphed to yer last night I weren t surprised to hear what had happened I d been expecting summat o that sort this last month or two You mean he was failing asked Collingwood He were gettin feebler and feebler every day said the housekeeper But nobody dare say so to him and he wouldn t admit it his self He were that theer high spirited at he did things same as if he were a young man But I knew how it ud be in the end and so it has been I knew he d go off all of a sudden And of course I had all in readiness when they brought him back last night there was naught to do but lay him out Me and missus Thompson next door did it i no time Wheer will you be for buryin him Mestur Collingwood We must think that over answered Collingwood Well an theer s all ready for that too responded missus Clough He s had his grave all ready i the cemetery this three year I remember when he bowt it it s under a yew tree and he told me at he d ordered his monnyment an all So yer an t lawyers ll have no great trouble about them matters Mestur Eldrick he gev orders for t coffin last night Collingwood left these gruesome details highly pleasing to their narrator and went up to look at his dead grandfather He had never seen much of him but they had kept up a regular correspondence and always been on terms of affection and he was sorry that he had not been with the old man at the last He remained looking at the queer quiet old face for a while when he went down again missus Clough was talking to a sharp looking lad of apparently sixteen or seventeen years who stood at the door leading into the shop and who glanced at Collingwood with keen interest and speculation Here s Jabey Naylor wants to know if he s to do aught Mestur said the housekeeper Of course I ve telled him at we can t have the shop open till the burying s over so I don t know what theer is that he can do Oh well let him come into the shop with me answered Collingwood He motioned the lad to follow him out of the parlour So you were mister Bartle s assistant eh he asked Had he anybody else Nobody but me sir replied the lad I ve been with him a year And your name s what inquired Collingwood Jabez Naylor sir but everybody call me Jabey I see Jabey for short eh said Collingwood good humouredly He walked into the shop followed by the boy and closed the door The outer door into Quagg Alley was locked a light blind was drawn over the one window the books and engravings on the shelves and in the presses were veiled in a half gloom Well as missus Clough says we can t do any business for a few days Jabey after that we must see what can be done You shall have your wages just the same of course and you may look in every day to see if there s anything you can do You were here yesterday of course Were you in the shop when mister Bartle went out Yes sir replied the lad I d been in with him all the afternoon I was here when he went out and here when they came to say he d died at mister Eldrick s Collingwood sat down in his grandfather s chair at a big table piled high with books and papers which stood in the middle of the floor Did my grandfather seem at all unwell when he went out he asked No sir He had been coughing a bit more than usual that was all There was a fog came on about five o clock and he said it bothered him What had he been doing during the afternoon Anything particular Nothing at all particular before half past four or so sir Collingwood took a closer look at Jabez Naylor He saw that he was an observant lad evidently of superior intelligence a good specimen of the sharp town lad well trained in a modern elementary school Oh he said Nothing particular before half past four eh Did he do something particular after half past four There was a post came in just about then sir answered Jabey There was an American letter that s it sir just in front of you mister Bartle read it and asked me if we d got a good clear copy of Hopkinson s History of Barford I reminded him that there was a copy amongst the books that had been bought from Mallathorpe s Mill some time ago Books that had belonged to mister John Mallathorpe who was killed asked Collingwood who was fully acquainted with the chimney accident Yes sir mister Bartle bought a lot of books that mister Mallathorpe had at the Mill local books They re there in that corner they were put there when I fetched them and he d never looked over them since particularly Well and this History of Barford You reminded him of it I got it out for him sir He sat down where you re sitting and began to examine it He said something about it being a nice copy and he d get it off that night that s it sir I didn t read it of course And then he took some papers out of a pocket that s inside it and I heard him say Bless my soul who d have thought it Collingwood picked up the book which the boy indicated a thick substantially bound volume inside one cover of which was a linen pocket wherein were some loose maps and plans of Barford These what he took out he asked holding them up Yes sir but there was another paper with writing on it a biggish sheet of paper written all over Did you see what the writing was Did you see any of it No sir only that it was writing I was dusting those shelves out over there when I heard mister Bartle say what he did I just looked round over my shoulder that was all Was he reading this paper that you speak of Yes sir he was holding it up to the gas reading it Do you know what he did with it Yes sir he folded it up and put it in his pocket Did he say any more make any remark No sir He wrote a letter then At once Yes sir straight off But he wasn t more than a minute writing it Then he sent me to post it at the pillar box at the end of the Alley Did you read the address The lad turned to a book which stood with others in a rack over the chimney piece and tapped it with his finger Yes sir because mister Bartle gave orders when I first came here that a register of every letter sent out was to be kept I ve always entered them in this book And this letter you re talking about to whom was it addressed Miss Mallathorpe Normandale Grange sir You went and posted it at once That very minute sir Was it soon afterwards that mister Bartle went out He went out as soon as I came back sir And you never saw him again Jabey shook his head Not alive sir he answered I saw him when they brought him back How long had he been out when you heard he was dead About an hour sir just after six it was when they told missus Clough and me He went out at ten minutes past five Collingwood got up He gave the lad s shoulder a friendly squeeze All right he said Now you seem a smart intelligent lad don t mention a word to any one of what we ve been talking about You have not mentioned it before I suppose Not a word That s right don t Come in again tomorrow morning to see if I want you to be here as usual I m going to put a manager into this shop When the boy had gone Collingwood locked up the shop from the house side put the key in his pocket and went into the kitchen missus Clough he said I want to see the clothes which my grandfather was wearing when he was brought home last night Where are they They re in that little room aside of his bed chamber Mestur Collingwood replied the housekeeper I laid em all there on the clothes press just as they were taken off of him by Lawyer Eldrick s orders he said they hadn t been examined and wasn t to be till you came Nobody whatever s touched em since Collingwood went upstairs and into the little room a sort of box room opening out of that in which the old man lay There were the clothes he went through the pockets of every garment He found such things as keys a purse loose money a memorandum book a bookseller s catalogue or two two or three letters of a business sort but there was no big folded paper covered with writing such as Jabey Naylor had described The mention of that paper had excited Collingwood s curiosity He rapidly summed up what he had learned His grandfather had found a paper closely written upon in a book which had been the property of John Mallathorpe deceased The discovery had surprised him for he had given voice to an exclamation of what was evidently astonishment He had put the paper in his pocket Then he had written a letter to missus Mallathorpe of Normandale Grange When his shop boy had posted that letter he himself had gone out to his solicitor What asked Collingwood was the reasonable presumption The old man had gone to Eldrick to show him the paper which he had found He lingered in the little room for a few minutes thinking No one but Pratt had been with Antony Bartle at the time of his seizure and sudden death What sort of a fellow was Pratt Was he honest Was his word to be trusted Had he told the precise truth about the old man s death He was evidently a suave polite obliging sort of fellow this clerk but it was a curious thing that if Antony Bartle had that paper whatever it was in his pocket when he went to Eldrick s office it should not be in his pocket still if his clothing had really remained untouched Already suspicion was in Collingwood s mind vague and indefinable but there He was half inclined to go straight back to Eldrick Pascoe s and tell Eldrick what Jabey Naylor had just told him But he reflected that while Naylor went out to post the letter the old bookseller might have put the paper elsewhere locked it up in his safe perhaps One thing however he Collingwood could do at once he could ask missus Mallathorpe if the letter referred to the paper He was fully acquainted with all the facts of the Mallathorpe history old Bartle knowing they would interest his grandson had sent him the local newspaper accounts of its various episodes It was only twelve miles to Normandale Grange a motor car would carry him there within the hour He glanced at his watch just ten o clock An hour later Collingwood found himself standing in a fine oak panelled room the windows of which looked out on a romantic valley whose thickly wooded sides were still bright with the red and yellow tints of autumn A door opened he turned expecting to see missus Mallathorpe Instead he found himself looking at a girl who glanced inquiringly at him and from him to the card which he had sent in on his arrival CHAPTER IV THE FORTUNATE POSSESSORS Collingwood at once realized that he was in the presence of one of the two fortunate young people who had succeeded so suddenly and according to popular opinion so unexpectedly to John Mallathorpe s wealth This was evidently Miss Nesta Mallathorpe of whom he had heard but whom he had never seen She however was looking at him as if she knew him and she smiled a little as she acknowledged his bow My mother is out in the grounds with my brother she said motioning Collingwood towards a chair Won t you sit down please I ve sent for her she will be here in a few minutes Collingwood sat down Nesta Mallathorpe sat down too and as they looked at each other she smiled again I have seen you before mister Collingwood she said I knew it must be you when they brought up your card Collingwood used his glance of polite inquiry to make a closer inspection of his hostess He decided that Nesta Mallathorpe was not so much pretty as eminently attractive a tall well developed warm coloured young woman whose clear grey eyes and red lips and general bearing indicated the possession of good health and spirits And he was quite certain that if he had ever seen her before he would not have forgotten it Where have you seen me he asked smiling back at her Have you forgotten the mock trial year before last she asked Collingwood remembered what she was alluding to He had taken part in company with various other law students in a mock trial a breach of promise case for the benefit of a certain London hospital to him had fallen one of the principal parts that of counsel for the plaintiff When I saw your name I remembered it at once she went on I was there I was a probationer at saint Chad s Hospital at that time Dear me said Collingwood I should have thought our histrionic efforts would have been forgotten I m afraid I don t remember much about them except that we had a lot of fun out of the affair So you were at saint Chad s he continued with a reminiscence of the surroundings of the institution they were talking of Very different to Normandale Yes she replied Very very different to Normandale But when I was at saint Chad s I didn t know that I that we should ever come to Normandale And now that you are here he asked The girl looked out through the big window on the valley which lay in front of the old house and she shook her head a little It s very beautiful she answered but I sometimes wish I was back at saint Chad s with something to do Here there s nothing to do but to do nothing Collingwood realized that this was not the complaint of the well to do young woman who finds time hang heavy it was rather indicative of a desire for action I understand he said I think I should feel like that One wants I suppose is it action movement what is it Better call it occupation that s a plain term she answered We re both suffering from lack of occupation here my brother and I And it s bad for us especially for him Before Collingwood could think of any suitable reply to this remarkably fresh and candid statement the door opened and missus Mallathorpe came in followed by her son And the visitor suddenly and immediately noticed the force and meaning of Nesta Mallathorpe s last remark Harper Mallathorpe a good looking but not remarkably intelligent appearing young man of about Collingwood s own age gave him the instant impression of being bored to death the lack lustre eye the aimless lounge the hands thrust into the pockets of his Norfolk jacket as if they took refuge there from sheer idleness all these things told their tale Here thought Collingwood was a fine example of how riches can be a curse relieved of the necessity of having to earn his daily bread by labour Harper Mallathorpe was finding life itself laborious But there was nothing of aimlessness idleness or lack of vigour in missus Mallathorpe She was a woman of character energy of brains Collingwood saw all that at one glance A little neat figured compact sort of woman still very good looking still on the right side of fifty with quick movements and sharp glances out of a pair of shrewd eyes this he thought was one of those women who will readily undertake the control and management of big affairs He felt as missus Mallathorpe turned inquiring looks on him that as long as she was in charge of them the Mallathorpe family fortunes would be safe Mother said Nesta handing Collingwood s card to missus Mallathorpe this gentleman is mister Bartle Collingwood He s aren t you yes a barrister He wants to see you Why I don t know I have seen mister Collingwood before but he didn t remember me Now he ll tell you what he wants to see you about If you ll allow me to explain why I called on you missus Mallathorpe said Collingwood I don t suppose you ever heard of me but you know at any rate the name of my grandfather mister Antony Bartle the bookseller of Barford My grandfather is dead he died very suddenly last night missus Mallathorpe and Nesta murmured words of polite sympathy Harper suddenly spoke as if mere words were some relief to his obvious boredom I heard that this morning he said turning to his mother Hopkins told me he was in town last night I meant to tell you Dear me exclaimed missus Mallathorpe glancing at some letters which stood on a rack above the mantelpiece Why I had a letter from mister Bartle this very morning It is that letter that I have come to see you about said Collingwood I only got down here from London at half past eight this morning and of course I have made some inquiries about the circumstances of my grandfather s sudden death He died very suddenly indeed at mister Eldrick s office He had gone there on some business about which nobody knows nothing he died before he could mention it And according to his shop boy Jabey Naylor the last thing he did was to write a letter to you Now I have reason for asking would you mind telling me missus Mallathorpe what that letter was about missus Mallathorpe moved over to the hearth and took an envelope from the rack She handed it to Collingwood indicating that he could open it And Collingwood drew out one of old Bartle s memorandum forms and saw a couple of lines in the familiar crabbed handwriting missus MALLATHORPE Normandale Grange Madam If you should drive into town tomorrow will you kindly give me a call I want to see you particularly Respectfully A BARTLE Collingwood handed back the letter Have you any idea to what that refers he asked Well I think I have perhaps answered missus Mallathorpe mister Bartle persuaded us to sell him some books local books which my late brother in law had at his office in the mill And since then he has been very anxious to buy more local books and pamphlets about this neighbourhood and he had some which mister Bartle was very anxious indeed to get hold of I suppose he wanted to see me about that Collingwood made no remarks for the moment He was wondering whether or not to tell what Jabey Naylor had told him about this paper taken from the linen pocket inside the History of Barford But missus Mallathorpe s ready explanation had given him a new idea and he rose from his chair Thank you he said I suppose that s it You may think it odd that I wanted to know what he d written about but as it was certainly the last letter he wrote Oh I m quite sure it must have been that exclaimed missus Mallathorpe And as I am going into Barford this afternoon in any case I meant to call at mister Bartle s I m sorry to hear of his death poor old gentleman But he was very old indeed wasn t he He was well over eighty replied Collingwood Well thank you again and good bye I have a motorcar waiting outside there and I have much to do in Barford when I get back The two young people accompanied Collingwood into the hall And Harper suddenly brightened I say he said Have a drink before you go It s a long way in and out Come into the dining room But Collingwood caught Nesta s eye and he was quick to read a signal in it No thanks awfully he answered I won t really I must get back I ve such a lot of things to attend to This is a very beautiful place of yours he went on as Harper whose face had fallen at the visitor s refusal followed with his sister to where the motor car waited It might be a hundred miles from anywhere It s a thousand miles from anywhere muttered Harper Nothing to do here No hunting shooting fishing asked Collingwood Get tired of em Well why not make a private golf links in your park You d get a fine sporting course round there That s a good notion Harper observed Nesta with some eagerness You could have it laid out this winter Harper suddenly looked at Collingwood Going to stop in Barford he asked Till I settle my grandfather s affairs yes answered Collingwood Come and see us again said Harper Come for the night we ve got a jolly good billiard table Do added Nesta heartily Since you re so kind I will then replied Collingwood But not for a few days He drove off to wonder why he had visited Normandale Grange at all For missus Mallathorpe s explanation of the letter was doubtless the right one Collingwood little as he had seen of Antony Bartle knew what a veritable sleuth hound the old man was where rare books or engravings were concerned Yet why the sudden exclamation on finding that paper Why the immediate writing of the letter to missus Mallathorpe Why the setting off to Eldrick Pascoe s office as soon as the letter was written It all looked as if the old man had found some document the contents of which related to the Mallathorpe family and was anxious to communicate its nature to missus Mallathorpe and to his own solicitor as soon as possible But that s probably only my fancy he mused as he sped back to Barford the real explanation is doubtless that suggested by missus Mallathorpe Something made the old man think of the collection of local books at Normandale Grange and he immediately wrote off to ask her to see him with the idea of persuading her to let him have them That s all there is in it what a suspicious sort of party I must be getting And suspicious of whom and of what Anyhow I m glad I went out there and I ll certainly go again On his way back to Barford he thought a good deal of the two young people he had just left There was something of the irony of fate about their situation There they were in possession of money and luxury and youth and already bored because they had nothing to do He felt what closely approached a contemptuous pity for Harper why didn t he turn to some occupation There was their own business why didn t he put in so many hours a day there instead of leaving it to managers Why didn t he interest himself in local affairs work at something Already he had all the appearance of a man who is inclined to slackness and in that case mused Collingwood his money would do him positive harm But he had no thoughts of that sort about Nesta Mallathorpe he had seen that she was of a different temperament She ll not stick there idling he said She ll break out and do something or other What did she say Suffering from lack of occupation A bad thing to suffer from too glad I m not similarly afflicted There was immediate occupation for Collingwood himself when he reached the town He had already made up his mind as to his future plans He would sell his grandfather s business as soon as he could find a buyer the old man had left a provision in his will the gist of which Eldrick had already communicated to Collingwood to the effect that his grandson could either carry on the business with the help of a competent manager until the stock was sold out or could dispose of it as a going concern Collingwood decided to sell it outright and at once But first it was necessary for him to look round the collection of valuable books and prints and get an idea of what it was that he was about to sell And when he had reached Barford again and had lunched at his hotel he went to Quagg Alley and shut himself in the shop and made a careful inspection of the treasures which old Bartle had raked up from many quarters Within ten minutes of beginning his task Collingwood knew that he had gone out to Normandale Grange about a mere nothing Picking up the History of Barford which Jabey Naylor had spoken of and turning over its leaves two papers dropped out one a half sheet of foolscap folded the other a letter from some correspondent in the United States Collingwood read the letter first it was evidently that which Naylor had referred to as having been delivered the previous afternoon It asked for a good clear copy of Hopkinson s History of Barford and then it went on If you should come across a copy of what is I believe a very rare tract or pamphlet Customs of the Court Leet of the Manor of Barford published I think about seventeen twenty I should be glad to pay you any price you like to ask for it in reason So much for the letter Collingwood turned from it to the folded paper It was headed List of Barford Tracts and Pamphlets in my box marked B P in the library at N Grange and it was initialled at the foot J M Then followed the titles of some twenty five or thirty works amongst them was the very tract for which the American correspondent had inquired And now Collingwood had what he believed to be a clear vision of what had puzzled him his grandfather having just read the American buyer s request had found the list of these pamphlets inside the History of Barford and in it the entry of the particular one he wanted and at once he had written to missus Mallathorpe in the hope of persuading her to sell what his American correspondent desired to buy It was all quite plain and the old man s visit to Eldrick Pascoe s had nothing to do with the letter to missus Mallathorpe Nor had he carried the folded paper in his pocket to Eldrick s when Jabey Naylor went out to post the letter Antony had placed the folded paper and the American letter together in the book and left them there Quite quite simple he had had his run to Normandale Grange and back all about nothing and for nothing except that he had met Nesta Mallathorpe whom he was already sufficiently interested in to desire to see again But having arrived at an explanation of what had puzzled him and made him suspicious he dismissed that matter from his mind and thought no more of it But across the street all unknown to Collingwood Linford Pratt was thinking a good deal Collingwood had taken his car from a rank immediately opposite Eldrick Pascoe s windows Pratt whose desk looked on to the street had seen him drive away soon after ten o clock and return about half past twelve Pratt who knew everybody in the business centre of the town knew the man who had driven Collingwood and when he went out to his lunch he asked him where he had been that morning The man who knew no reason for secrecy told him and Pratt went off to eat his bread and cheese and drink his one glass of ale and to wonder why young Collingwood had been to Normandale Grange He became slightly anxious and uneasy He knew that Collingwood must have made some slight examination of old Bartle s papers Was it could it be possible that the old man before going to Eldrick s had left some memorandum of his discovery in his desk or in a diary He had said that he had not shown the will nor mentioned the will to a soul but he might old men were so fussy about things he might have set down in his diary that he had found it on such a day and under such and such circumstances However there was one person who could definitely inform him of the reason of Collingwood s visit to Normandale Grange missus Mallathorpe He would see her at once and learn if he had any grounds for fear And so it came about that at nine o clock that evening missus Mallathorpe for the second time that day found herself asked to see a limb of the law CHAPTER V POINT BLANK missus Mallathorpe was alone when Pratt s card was taken to her Harper and Nesta were playing billiards in a distant part of the big house Dinner had been over for an hour missus Mallathorpe who had known what hard work and plenty of it was in her time was trifling over the newspapers rest comfort and luxury were by no means boring to her She looked at the card doubtfully Pratt had pencilled a word or two on it Private and important business Then she glanced at the butler an elderly man who had been with John Mallathorpe many years before the catastrophe occurred Who is he Dickenson she asked Do you know him Clerk at Eldrick Pascoe s in the town ma am replied the butler I know the young man by sight Where is he inquired missus Mallathorpe In the little morning room at present ma am said Dickenson Take him into the study commanded missus Mallathorpe I ll come to him presently She was utterly at a loss to understand Pratt s presence there Eldrick Pascoe were not her solicitors and she had no business of a legal nature in which they could be in any way concerned But it suddenly struck her that that was the second time she had heard Eldrick s name mentioned that day young mister Collingwood had said that his grandfather s death had taken place at Eldrick Pascoe s office Had this clerk come to see her about that and if so what had she to do with it Before she reached the room in which Pratt was waiting for her missus Mallathorpe was filled with curiosity But in that curiosity there was not a trace of apprehension nothing suggested to her that her visitor had called on any matter actually relating to herself or her family The room into which Pratt had been taken was a small apartment opening out of the library John Mallathorpe when he bought Normandale Grange had it altered and fitted to suit his own tastes and Pratt as soon as he entered it saw that it was a place in which privacy and silence could be ensured He noticed that it had double doors and that there were heavy curtains before the window And during the few minutes which elapsed between his entrance and missus Mallathorpe s he took the precaution to look behind those curtains and to survey his surroundings what he had to say was not to be overheard if he could help it missus Mallathorpe looked her curiosity as soon as she came in She did not remember that she had ever seen this young man before but she recognized at once that he was a shrewd and sharp person and she knew from his manner that he had news of importance to give her She quietly acknowledged Pratt s somewhat elaborate bow and motioned him to take a chair at the side of the big desk which stood before the fireplace she herself sat down at the desk itself in John Mallathorpe s old elbow chair And Pratt thought to himself that however much young Harper John Mallathorpe might be nominal master of Normandale Grange the real master was there in the self evident quiet looking woman who turned to him in business like fashion You want to see me said missus Mallathorpe What is it Business missus Mallathorpe replied Pratt As I said on my card of a private and important sort To do with me she asked With you and with your family said Pratt And before we go any further not a soul knows of it but me missus Mallathorpe took another searching look at her visitor Pratt was leaning over the corner of the desk towards her already he had lowered his tones to the mysterious and confidential note I don t know what you re talking about she said Go on Pratt bent a little nearer A question or two first if you please missus Mallathorpe And answer them They re for your own good Young mister Collingwood called on you today Well and what of it What did he want missus Mallathorpe hesitated and frowned a little And Pratt hastened to reassure her I m using no idle words missus Mallathorpe when I say it s for your own good It is What did he come for He came to ask what there was in a letter which his grandfather wrote to me yesterday afternoon Antony Bartle had written to you had he And what did he say missus Mallathorpe For that is important No more than that he wanted me to call on him today if I happened to be in Barford Nothing more Nothing more not a word Nothing as to why he wanted to see you No I thought that he probably wanted to see me about buying some books of the late mister Mallathorpe s Did you tell Collingwood that asked Pratt eagerly Yes of course Did it satisfy him missus Mallathorpe frowned again Why shouldn t I she demanded It was the only explanation I could possibly give him How do I know what the old man really wanted Pratt drew his chair still nearer to the desk His voice dropped to a whisper and his eyes were full of meaning I ll tell you what he wanted he said speaking very slowly It s what I ve come for Listen Antony Bartle came to our office soon after five yesterday afternoon I was alone everybody else had gone I took him into Eldrick s room He told me that in turning over one of the books which he had bought from Mallathorpe Mill some short time ago he had found what do you think missus Mallathorpe s cheek had flushed at the mention of the books from the Mill Now at Pratt s question and under his searching eye she turned very pale and the clerk saw her fingers tighten on the arms of her chair What she asked What John Mallathorpe s will he answered Do you understand His will The woman glanced quickly about her at the doors the uncurtained window Safe enough here whispered Pratt I made sure of that Don t be afraid no one knows but me But missus Mallathorpe seemed to find some difficulty in speaking and when she at last got out a word her voice sounded hoarse Impossible It s a fact said Pratt Nothing was ever more a fact as you ll see But let me finish my story The old man told me how he d found the will only half an hour before and he asked me to ring up Eldrick so that we might all read it together I went to the telephone when I came back Bartle was dead just dead And I took the will out of his pocket missus Mallathorpe made an involuntary gesture with her right hand And Pratt smiled craftily and shook his head Much too valuable to carry about missus Mallathorpe he said I ve got it all safe under lock and key But as I ve said nobody knows of it but myself Not a living soul No one has any idea No one can have any idea I was a bit alarmed when I heard that young Collingwood had been to you for I thought that the old man though he didn t tell me of any such thing might have dropped you a line saying what he d found But as he didn t well not one living soul knows that the will s in existence except me and you missus Mallathorpe was regaining her self possession She had had a great shock but the worst of it was over Already she knew from Pratt s manner insidious and suggesting that the will was of a nature that would dispossess her and hers of this recently acquired wealth the clerk had made that evident by look and tone So there was nothing but to face things What what does it say she asked with an effort Pratt unbuttoned his overcoat plunged a hand into the inner pocket drew out a sheet of paper unfolded it and laid it on the desk An exact copy he said tersely Read it for yourself In spite of the determined effort which she made to be calm missus Mallathorpe s fingers still trembled as she took up the sheet on which Pratt had made a fair copy of the will The clerk watched her narrowly as she read He knew that presently there would be a tussle between them he knew too that she was a woman who would fight hard in defence of her own interest and for the interests of her children Always keeping his ears open to local gossip especially where money was concerned Pratt had long since heard that missus Mallathorpe was a keen and sharp business woman And now he was not surprised when having slowly and carefully read the copy of the will from beginning to end she laid it down and turned to him with a business like question The effect of that she asked What would it be curtly Precisely what it says answered Pratt Couldn t be clearer We should lose all she demanded almost angrily All All except what he says there agreed Pratt And that she went on drumming her fingers on the paper that would stand What it s a copy of would stand said Pratt Oh yes don t you make any mistake about it missus Mallathorpe Nothing can upset that will It is plain as a pikestaff how it came to be made Your late brother in law evidently wrote his will out it s all in his own handwriting and took it down to the Mill with him the very day of the chimney accident Just as evidently he signed it in the presence of his manager Gaukrodger and his cashier Marshall they signed at the same time as it says there Now I take it that very soon after that mister Mallathorpe went out into his mill yard to have a look at the chimney Gaukrodger and Marshall went with him Before he went he popped the will into the book where old Bartle found it yesterday such things are easily done Perhaps he was reading the book perhaps it lay handy he slipped the will inside anyway And then he was killed and what s more the two witnesses were killed with him So there wasn t a man left who could tell of that will But there s half Barford could testify to these three signatures missus Mallathorpe there s not a chance for you if I put that will into the hands of the two trustees He leaned back in his chair after that nodding confidently watching keenly And now he saw that the trembling fingers were interlacing each other twisting the rings on each other and that missus Mallathorpe was thinking as she had most likely never thought in her life After a moment s pause Pratt went on Perhaps you didn t understand he said I mean you don t know the effect Those two trustees Charlesworth Wyatt could turn you all clean out of this tomorrow in a way of speaking Everything s theirs They can demand an account of every penny that you ve all had out of the estate and the business from the time you all took hold If anything s been saved put aside they can demand that You re entitled to nothing but the three amounts of ten thousand each Of course thirty thousand is thirty thousand it means at five per cent fifteen hundred a year if you could get five per cent safely But I should say your son and daughter are getting a few thousand a year each aren t they missus Mallathorpe It would be a nice come down Five hundred a year apiece at the outside A small house instead of Normandale Grange Genteel poverty comparatively speaking instead of riches That is if I hand over the will to Charlesworth Wyatt missus Mallathorpe slowly turned her eyes on Pratt And Pratt suddenly felt a little afraid there was anger in those eyes anger of a curious sort It might be against fate against circumstance it might not why should it be against him personally but it was there and it was malign and almost evil and it made him uncomfortable Where is the will she asked Safe In my keeping answered Pratt She looked him all over surmisingly You ll sell it to me she suggested You ll hand it over and let me burn it destroy it No answered Pratt I shall not He saw that his answer produced personal anger at last missus Mallathorpe gave him a look which would have warned a much less observant man than Pratt But he gave her back a look that was just as resolute I say no and I mean no he continued I won t sell but I ll bargain Let s be plain with each other You don t want that will to be handed over to the trustees named in it Charlesworth Wyatt Do you think I m a fool man she flashed out I should be a fool myself if I did replied Pratt calmly And I m not a fool Very well then you ll square me You ll buy me Come to terms with me and nobody shall ever know I repeat to you what I ve said before not a soul knows now no nor suspects It s utterly impossible for anybody to find out The testator s dead The attesting witnesses are dead The man who found this will is dead No one but you and myself ever need know a word about all this If you make terms with me missus Mallathorpe What do you want she asked sullenly You forget I ve nothing of my own I didn t come into anything I ve a pretty good notion who s real master here and at Mallathorpe Mill too retorted Pratt I should say you re still in full control of your children missus Mallathorpe and that you can do pretty well what you like with them With one of them perhaps she said still angry and sullen But I tell you for you may as well know if my daughter knew of what you ve told me she d go straight to these trustees and tell That s a fact that you d better realize I can t control her Oh remarked Pratt Um then we must take care that she doesn t know But we don t intend that anybody should know but you and me missus Mallathorpe You needn t tell a soul not even your son You mustn t tell Listen now I ve thought out a good scheme which ll profit me and make you safe Do you know what you want on this estate She stared at him as if wondering what this question had to do with the matter which was of such infinite importance And Pratt smiled and hastened to enlighten her You want a steward he said A steward and estate agent John Mallathorpe managed everything for himself but your son can t and pardon me if I say that you can t properly You need a man you need me You can persuade your son to that effect Give me the job of steward here I ll suggest to you how to do it in such a fashion that it ll arouse no suspicion and look just like an ordinary very ordinary business job at a salary and on conditions to be arranged and you re safe Safe missus Mallathorpe you know what that means missus Mallathorpe suddenly rose from her chair I know this she said I ll discuss nothing and do nothing till I ve seen that will Pratt rose too nodding his head as if quite satisfied He took up the copy tore it in two pieces and carefully dropped them into the glowing fire I shall be at my lodgings at any time after five thirty tomorrow evening he answered quietly Call there You have the address And you can then read the will with your own eyes I shan t bring it here The game s in my hands missus Mallathorpe Within a few minutes he was out in the park again and making his way to the little railway station in the valley below He felt triumphant he knew that the woman he had just left was at his mercy and would accede to his terms And all the way back to town and through the town to his lodgings he considered and perfected the scheme he was going to suggest to missus Mallathorpe on the morrow Pratt lived in a little hamlet of old houses on the very outskirts of Barford on the edge of a stretch of Country honeycombed by stone quarries some in use some already worked out It was a lonely neighbourhood approached from the nearest tramway route by a narrow high walled lane He was half way along that lane when a stealthy foot stole to his side and a hand was laid on his arm just as stealthily came the voice of one of his fellow clerks at Eldrick Pascoe s A moment Pratt I ve been waiting for you I want a word or two in private CHAPTER VI THE UNEXPECTED Pratt started when he heard that voice and felt the arresting hand He knew well enough to whom they belonged they were those of one James Parrawhite a little weedy dissolute chap who had been in Eldrick Pascoe s employ for about a year It had always been a mystery to him and the other clerks that Parrawhite had been there at all and that being there he was allowed to stop He was not a Barford man Nobody knew anything whatever about him though his occasional references to it seemed to indicate that he knew London pretty thoroughly Pratt shrewdly suspected that he was a man whom Eldrick had known in other days possibly a solicitor who had been struck off the rolls and to whom Eldrick for old times sake was disposed to extend a helping hand All that any of them knew was that one morning some fifteen months previously Parrawhite a complete stranger had walked into the office asked to see Eldrick had remained closeted with him half an hour and had been given a job at two pounds a week there and then That he was a clever and useful clerk no one denied but no one liked him He was always borrowing half crowns He smelt of rum He was altogether undesirable It was plain to the clerks that Pascoe disliked him But he was evidently under Eldrick s protection and he did his work and did it well and there was no doubt that he knew more law than either of the partners and was better up in practice than Pratt himself But he was not desirable and Pratt never desired him less than on this occasion What are you after coming on a man like that growled Pratt You replied Parrawhite I knew you d got to come up this lane so I waited for you I ve something to say Get it said then retorted Pratt Not here answered Parrawhite Come down by the quarry nobody about there And suppose I don t asked Pratt Then you ll be very sorry for yourself tomorrow replied Parrawhite That s all Pratt had already realized that this fellow knew something Parrawhite s manner was not only threatening but confident He spoke as a man speaks who has got the whip hand And so still growling and inwardly raging and anxious he turned off with his companion into a track which lay amongst the stone quarries It was a desolate lonely place no house was near they were as much alone as if they had been in the middle of one of the great moors outside the town the lights of which they could see in the valley below them In the grey sky above a waning moon gave them just sufficient light to see their immediate surroundings a grass covered track no longer used and the yawning mouths of the old quarries no longer worked the edges of which were thick with gorse and bramble It was the very place for secret work and Pratt was certain that secret work was at hand Now then he said when they had walked well into the wilderness What is it And no nonsense You ll get no nonsense from me sneered Parrawhite I m not that sort This is what I want to say I was in Eldrick s office last night all the time you were there with old Bartle This swift answer went straight through Pratt s defences He was prepared to hear something unpleasant and disconcerting but not that And he voiced the first thought that occurred to him That s a lie he exclaimed There was nobody there No lie replied Parrawhite I was there I was behind the curtain of that recess you know And since I know what you did I don t mind telling you we re in the same boat my lad what I was going to do You thought I d gone with the others But I hadn t I d merely done what I ve done several times without being found out slipped in there to wait until you d gone Why Because friend Eldrick as you know is culpably careless about leaving loose cash in the unlocked drawer of his desk culpably careless too about never counting it And a stray sovereign or half sovereign is useful to a man who only gets two quid a week Understand So you re a thief said Pratt bitterly I m precisely what you are a thief retorted Parrawhite You stole John Mallathorpe s will last night I heard everything I tell you and saw everything I heard the whole business what the old man said what you later said to Eldrick I saw old Bartle die I saw you take the will from his pocket read it and put it in your pocket I know all except the terms of the will But I ve a pretty good idea of what those terms are Do you know why Because I watched you set off to Normandale by the eight twenty train tonight Hang you for a dirty sneak growled Pratt Parrawhite laughed and flourished a heavy stick which he carried Not a bit of it he said almost pleasantly I thought you were more of a philosopher I fancied I d seen gleams mere gleams of philosophy in you at times Fortunes of war my boy Come now you ve seen enough of me to know I m an adventurer This is an adventure of the sort I love Go into it heart and soul man Own up you ve found out that the will leaves the property away from the present holders and you ve been to Normandale to bargain Come now What then demanded Pratt Then of course I come in at the bargaining answered Parrawhite I m going to have my share That s a certainty You d better take my advice Because you re absolutely in my power I ve nothing to do but to tell Eldrick tomorrow morning Suppose I tell Eldrick tomorrow morning of what you ve told me interjected Pratt Eldrick will believe me before you retorted Parrawhite imperturbably I m a much cleverer more plausible man than you are my friend I ve had an experience of the world which you haven t I can easily invent a fine excuse for being in that room For two pins I ll incriminate you See Be reasonable for if it comes to a contest of brains you haven t a rabbit s chance against a fox Tell me all about the will and what you ve done You ve got to for by the Lord Harry I m going to have my share Come now Pratt stood in a little hollow wherein they had paused and thought rapidly and angrily There was no doubt about it he was trapped This fearful scoundrel at his side who boasted of his cleverness would stick to him like a leach he would have to share All his own smart schemes for exploiting missus Mallathorpe for ensuring himself a competence for life were knocked on the head There was no helping it he would have to tell and to share And so sullenly resentfully he told Parrawhite listened in silence taking in every point Pratt knowing that concealment was useless told the truth about everything concisely but omitting nothing All right remarked Parrawhite at the end Now then what terms do you mean to insist on What s the good of going into that growled Pratt Now that you ve stuck your foot in it what do my terms matter Quite right agreed Parrawhite They don t What matter is our terms Now let me suggest no insist on what they must be Cash Do you know why I insist on that No Then I ll tell you Because this young barrister chap Collingwood has evidently got some suspicion of something I can t see it said Pratt uneasily He was only curious to know what that letter was about Never mind continued Parrawhite He had some suspicion or he wouldn t have gone out there almost as soon as he reached Barford after his grandfather s death And even if suspicion is put to sleep for awhile it can easily be reawakened so cash We must profit at once before any future risk arises But what terms were you thinking of Stewardship of this estate for life muttered Pratt gloomily With the risk of some discovery being made some time any time sneered Parrawhite Where are your brains man The old fellow John Mallathorpe probably made a draft or two of that will before he did his fair copy he may have left those drafts among his papers If he did missus Mallathorpe ud find em said Pratt slowly I don t believe there s the slightest risk I ve figured everything out I don t believe there s any danger from Collingwood or from anybody it s impossible And if we take cash now we re selling for a penny what we ought to get pounds for The present is much more important than the future my friend answered Parrawhite To me at any rate Now then this is my proposal I ll be with you when this lady calls at your place tomorrow evening We ll offer her the will to do what she likes with for ten thousand pounds She can find that quickly When she pays as she will we share equally and then well you can go to the devil I shall go somewhere else So that s settled No said Pratt Parrawhite turned sharply and Pratt saw a sinister gleam in his eyes Did you say no he asked I said no replied Pratt I m not going to take five thousand pounds for a chance that s worth fifty thousand Hang you if you hadn t been a black sneak thief as you are I d have had the whole thing to myself And I don t know that I will give way to you If it comes to it my word s as good as yours and I don t believe Eldrick would believe you before me Pascoe wouldn t anyway You ve got a past in quod I should think my past s all right I ve a jolly good mind to let you do your worst after all I ve got the will And by george now I come to think of it you can do your worst Tell what you like tomorrow morning I shall tell em what you are a scoundrel He turned away at that and as he turned Parrawhite with a queer cry of rage that might have come from some animal which saw its prey escaping struck out at him with the heavy stick The blow missed Pratt s head but it grazed the tip of his ear and fell slantingly on his left shoulder And then the anger that had been boiling in Pratt ever since the touch on his arm in the dark lane burst out in activity and he turned on his assailant gripped him by the throat before Parrawhite could move and after choking and shaking him until his teeth rattled and his breath came in jerking sobs flung him violently against the masses of stone by which they had been standing Pratt was of considerable physical strength He played cricket and football he visited a gymnasium thrice a week His hands had the grip of a blacksmith his muscles were those of a prize fighter He had put more strength than he was aware of into his fierce grip on Parrawhite s throat he had exerted far more force than he knew he was exerting when he flung him away He heard a queer cracking sound as the man struck something and for the moment he took no notice of it the pain of that glancing blow on his shoulder was growing acute and he began to rub it with his free hand and to curse its giver Get up you fool and I ll give you some more he growled I ll teach you to He suddenly noticed the curiously still fashion in which Parrawhite was lying where he had flung him noticed too as a cloud passed the moon and left it unveiled how strangely white the man s face was And just as suddenly Pratt forgot his own injury and dropped on his knees beside his assailant An instant later and he knew that he was once more confronting death For Parrawhite was as dead as Antony Bartle violent contact of his head with a rock had finished what Pratt had nearly completed with that vicious grip There was no questioning it no denying it Pratt was there in that lonely place staring half consciously half in terror at a dead man He stood up at last cursing Parrawhite with the anger of despair He had not one scrap of pity for him All his pity was for himself That he should have been brought into this that this vile little beast perfect scum that he was should have led him to what might be the utter ruin of his career it was shameful it was abominable it was cruel He felt as if he could cheerfully tear Parrawhite s dead body to pieces But even as these thoughts came others of a more important nature crowded on them For there lay a dead man who was not to be put in one s pocket like a will It was necessary to hide that thing from the light ever that light Within a few hours morning would break and lonely and deserted as that place was nowadays some one might pass that way Out of sight with him then and quickly Pratt was very well acquainted with the spot at which he stood Those old quarries had a certain picturesqueness They had become grass grown ivy shrubs trees had clustered about them the people who lived in the few houses half a mile away sometimes walked around them the children made a playground of the place Pratt himself had often gone into some quiet corner to read and smoke And now his quick mind immediately suggested a safe hiding place for this thing that he could not carry away with him and dare not leave to the morning sun close by was a pit formerly used for some quarrying purpose which was filled always filled with water It was evidently of considerable depth the water was black in it the mouth was partly obscured by a maze of shrub and bramble It had been like that ever since Pratt came to lodge in that part of the district ten or twelve years before it would probably remain like that for many a long year to come That bit of land was absolutely useless and therefore neglected and as long as rain fell and water drained that pit would always be filled to its brim He remembered something else also close by where he stood a heap of old iron things broken and disused picks smashed rails fragments thrown aside when the last of the limestone had been torn out of the quarries Once more luck was playing into his hands those odds and ends might have been put there for the very purpose to which he now meant to turn them And being certain that he was alone and secure Pratt proceeded to go about his unpleasant task skilfully and methodically He fetched a quantity of the iron fastened it to the dead man s clothing drew the body thus weighted to the edge of the pit and prepared to slide it into the black water But there an idea struck him While he made these preparations he had had hosts of ideas as to his operations next morning this idea was supplementary to them Quickly and methodically he removed the contents of Parrawhite s pockets to his own everything money watch and chain even a ring which the dead man had been evidently vain of Then he let Parrawhite glide into the water and after him he sent the heavy stick carefully fastened to a bar of iron Five minutes later the surface of the water in that pit was as calm and unruffled as ever not a ripple showed that it had been disturbed And Pratt made his way out of the wilderness swearing that he would never enter it again CHAPTER VII THE SUPREME INDUCEMENT Pratt was in Eldrick Pascoe s office soon after half past eight next morning and for nearly forty minutes he had the place entirely to himself But it took only a few of those minutes for him to do what he had carefully planned before he went to bed the previous night Shutting himself into Eldrick s private room and making sure that he was alone that time he immediately opened the drawer in the senior partner s desk wherein Eldrick culpably enough as Parrawhite had sneeringly remarked was accustomed to put loose money Eldrick was strangely careless in that way he would throw money into that drawer in presence of his clerks notes gold silver If it happened to occur to him he would take the money out at the end of the afternoon and hand it to Pratt to lock up in the safe but as often as not it did not occur Pratt had more than once ventured on a hint which was almost a remonstrance and Eldrick had paid no attention to him He was a careless easy going man in many respects Eldrick and liked to do things in his own way And after all as Pratt had decided when he found that his hints were not listened to it was Eldrick s own affair if he liked to leave the money lying about There was money lying about in that drawer when Pratt drew it open it was never locked day or night or if it was the key was left in it As soon as he opened it he saw gold two or three sovereigns and silver a little pile of it And under a letter weight four banknotes of ten pounds each But this was precisely what Pratt had expected to see he himself had handed banknotes gold and silver to Eldrick the previous evening just after receiving them from a client who had called to pay his bill And he had seen Eldrick place them in the drawer as usual and soon afterwards Eldrick had walked out saying he was going to the club and he had never returned What Pratt now did was done as the result of careful thought and deliberation There was a cheque book lying on top of some papers in the drawer he took it up and tore three cheques out of it Then he picked up the bank notes tore them and the abstracted blank cheques into pieces and dropped the pieces in the fire recently lighted by the caretaker He watched these fragments burn and then he put the gold and silver in his hip pocket where he already carried a good deal of his own and walked out Nine o clock brought the office boy a quarter past nine brought the clerks at ten o clock Eldrick walked in According to custom Pratt went into Eldrick s room with the letters and went through them with him One of them contained a legal document over which the solicitor frowned a little Ask Parrawhite s opinion about that he said presently indicating a marked paragraph Parrawhite has not come in this morning sir observed Pratt gathering up letters and papers I ll draw his attention to it when he arrives He went into the outer office only to be summoned back to Eldrick a few minutes later The senior partner was standing by his desk looking a little concerned and thought Pratt decidedly uncomfortable He motioned the clerk to close the door Has Parrawhite come he asked No replied Pratt Not yet mister Eldrick Is is he usually late inquired Eldrick Usually quite punctual half past nine said Pratt Eldrick glanced at his watch then at his clerk Didn t you give me some cash last night he asked Forty three pounds nine answered Pratt Thompson s bill of costs he paid it yesterday afternoon Eldrick looked more uncomfortable than ever Well the fact is he said I I meant to hand it to you to put in the safe Pratt but I didn t come back from the club And it s gone Pratt simulated concern but not astonishment And Eldrick pulled open the drawer and waved a hand over it I put it down there he said Very careless of me no doubt but nothing of this sort has ever happened before and however there s the unpleasant fact Pratt The money s gone Pratt who had hastily turned over the papers and other contents of the drawer shook his head and used his privilege as an old and confidential servant I ve always said sir that it was a great mistake to leave loose money lying about he remarked mournfully If there d only been a practice of letting me lock anything of that sort up in the safe every night and this chequebook too sir then I know I know said Eldrick Very reprehensible on my part I m afraid I am careless no doubt of it But He in his turn was interrupted by Pratt who was turning over the cheque book Some cheque forms have been taken out of this he said Three at the end Look there sir Eldrick uttered an exclamation of intense annoyance and disgust He looked at the despoiled cheque book and flung it into the drawer Pratt he said turning half appealingly half confidentially to the clerk Don t say a word of this above all don t mention it to mister Pascoe It s my fault and I must make the forty three pounds good Pratt I m afraid this is Parrawhite s work I well I may as well tell you he d been in trouble before he came here I gave him another chance I d known him years ago I thought he d go straight But I fear he s been tempted He may have seen me leave money about Was he in here last night Pratt pointed to a document which lay on Eldrick s desk He came in here to leave that for your perusal he answered He was in here alone a minute or two before he left All these lies came readily and naturally and Eldrick swallowed each He shook his head My fault all my fault he said Look here keep it quiet But do you know where Parrawhite has lived lodged No replied Pratt Some of the others may though Try to find out quickly continued Eldrick Then make some excuse to go out take papers somewhere or something and find if he s left his lodgings I I don t want to set the police on him He was a decent fellow once See what you can make out Pratt In strict secrecy you know I do not want this to go further Pratt could have danced for joy when he presently went out into the town There would be no hue and cry after Parrawhite none Eldrick would accept the fact that Parrawhite had robbed him and flown and Parrawhite would never be heard of never mentioned again It was the height of good luck for him Already he had got rid of any small scraps of regret or remorse about the killing of his fellow clerk Why should he be sorry The scoundrel had tried to murder him thinking no doubt that he had the will on him And he had not meant to kill him what he had done he had done in self defence No everything was working most admirably Parrawhite s previous bad record Eldrick s carelessness and his desire to shut things up it was all good From that day forward Parrawhite would be as if he had never been Pratt was not even afraid of the body being discovered though he believed that it would remain where it was for ever for the probability was that the authorities would fill up that pit with earth and stones But if it was brought to light Why the explanation was simple Parrawhite having robbed his employer had been robbed himself possibly by men with whom he had been drinking and had been murdered in the bargain No suspicion could attach to him Pratt he had nothing to fear nothing For the form of the thing he called at the place whereat Parrawhite had lodged they had seen nothing of him since the previous morning They were poor cheap lodgings in a mean street The woman of the house said that Parrawhite had gone out as usual the morning before and had never been in again In order to find out all he could Pratt asked if he had left much behind him in the way of belongings and just as he had expected he learned that Parrawhite s personal property was remarkably limited he possessed only one suit of clothes and not over much besides said the landlady Is there aught wrong she asked when Pratt had finished his questions Are you from where he worked That s it answered Pratt And he hasn t turned up this morning and we think he s left the town Owe you anything missis Nay nothing much she replied Ten shillings ud cover it mister Pratt gave her half a sovereign It was not out of consideration for her nor as a concession to Parrawhite s memory it was simply to stop her from coming down to Eldrick Pascoe s Well I don t think you ll see him again he remarked And I dare say you won t care if you don t He turned away then but before he had gone far the woman called him back What am I to do with his bits of things mister if he doesn t come back she asked Aught you please answered Pratt indifferently Throw em on the dust heap As he went back to the centre of the town he occupied himself in considering his attitude to missus Mallathorpe when she called on him that evening In spite of his own previous notion and of his carefully worked out scheme about the stewardship he had been impressed by what Parrawhite has said as to the wisdom of selling the will for cash Pratt did not believe that there was anything in the Collingwood suggestion no doubt whatever he had decided that old Bartle had meant to tell missus Mallathorpe of his discovery when she called in answer to his note but as he had died before she could call and as he had told nobody but him Pratt what possible danger could there be from Collingwood And a stewardship for life appealed to him He knew from observation of the world what a fine thing it is to have a certainty Once he became steward and agent of the Normandale Grange estate he would stick there until he had saved a tidy heap of money Then he would retire with a pension and a handsome present and enjoy himself To be provided for for life what more could a wise man want And yet there was something in what that devil Parrawhite had urged For there was a risk however small of discovery and if discovery were made there would be a nice penalty to pay It might after all be better to sell the will outright for as much ready money as ever he could get and to take his gains far away and start out on a career elsewhere After all there was much to be said for the old proverb The only question was was the bird in hand worth the two or the money which he believed he would net in the bush Pratt s doubts on this point were settled in a curious fashion He had reached the centre of the town in his return to Eldrick s and there in the fashionable shopping street he ran up against an acquaintance He and the acquaintance stopped and chatted about nothing And as they lounged on the curb a smart victoria drew up close by and out of it alone stepped a girl who immediately attracted Pratt s eyes He watched her across the pavement he watched her into the shop And his companion laughed That s the sort he remarked flippantly If you and I had one each old man what Who is she demanded Pratt The acquaintance stared at him in surprise What he exclaimed You don t know That s Miss Mallathorpe I didn t know said Pratt Fact He waited until Nesta Mallathorpe came out and drove away so that he could get another and a closer look at her And when she was gone he went slowly back to the office his mind made up Risk or no risk he would carry out his original notion Whatever missus Mallathorpe might offer he would stick to his idea of close and intimate connection with Normandale Grange CHAPTER VIII TERMS missus Mallathorpe left to face the situation which Pratt had revealed to her in such sudden and startling fashion had been quick to realize its seriousness It had not taken much to convince her that the clerk knew what he was talking about She had no doubt whatever that he was right when he said that the production of John Mallathorpe s will would mean dispossession to her children and through them to herself Nor had she any doubt either of Pratt s intention to profit by his discovery She saw that he was a young man of determination not at all scrupulous eager to seize on anything likely to turn to his own advantage She was in short at his mercy And she had no one to turn to Her son was weak purposeless almost devoid of character he cared for nothing beyond ease and comfort and left everything to her so long as he was allowed to do what he liked She dared not confide in him he was not fit to be entrusted with such a secret nor endowed with the courage to carry it boldly and unflinchingly Nor dare she confide it to her daughter Nesta was as strong as her brother was weak missus Mallathorpe had only told the plain truth when she said to Pratt that if her daughter knew of the will she would go straight to the two trustees No she would have to do everything herself And she could do nothing save under Pratt s dictation So long as he had that will in his possession he could make her agree to whatever terms he liked to insist upon She spent a sleepless night resolving all sorts of plans she resolved more plans and schemes during the day which followed But they all ended at the same point Pratt All the future depended upon Pratt And by the end of the day it had come to this she must make a determined effort to buy Pratt clean out so that she could get the will into her own possession and destroy it She knew that she could easily find the necessary money Harper Mallathorpe had such a natural dislike of all business matters and was so little fitted to attend to them that he was only too well content to leave everything relating to the estate and the mill at Barford to his mother Up to that time missus Mallathorpe had managed the affairs of both and she had large sums at her disposal out of which she could pay Pratt without even Harper being aware that she was paying him anything And surely no young man in Pratt s position a mere clerk earning a few pounds a week would refuse a big sum of ready money It seemed incredible to her and she went into Barford towards evening hoping that by the time she returned the will would have been burned to grey ashes missus Mallathorpe used some ingenuity in making her visit to Pratt Giving out that she was going to see a friend in Barford of whose illness she had just heard she drove into the town and on arriving near the Town Hall dismissed her carriage with orders to the coachman to put up his horses at a certain livery stable and to meet her at the same place at a specified time Then she went away on foot and drew a thick veil over her face before hiring a cab in which she drove up to the outskirt on which Pratt had his lodging She was still veiled when Pratt s landlady showed her into the clerk s sitting room Is it safe here she asked at once Is there no fear of anybody hearing what we may say None answered Pratt reassuringly I know these folks I ve lived here several years And nobody could hear however much they put their ears to the keyhole Good thick old walls these missus Mallathorpe and a solid door We re as safe here as we were in your study last night missus Mallathorpe sat down in the chair which Pratt politely drew near his fire She raised her veil and looked at him and the clerk saw at once how curious and eager she was That will she said in a low voice Let me see it first One moment answered Pratt First you understand that I m not going to let you handle it I ll hold it before you so you can read it Second you give me your promise I m trusting you that you ll make no attempt to seize it It s not going out of my hands I m only a woman and you re a strong man she retorted sullenly Quite so said Pratt But women have a trick of snatching at things And if you please you ll do exactly what I tell you to do Put your hands behind you If I see you make the least movement with them back goes the will into my pocket If Pratt had looked more closely at her just then he would have taken warning from the sudden flash of hatred and resentment which swept across missus Mallathorpe s face it would have told him that he was dealing with a dangerous woman who would use her wits to circumvent and beat him if not now then later But he was moving the gas bracket over the mantelpiece and he did not see Very well but I had no intention of touching it said missus Mallathorpe All I want is to see it and read it She obediently followed out Pratt s instructions and standing in front of her he produced the will unfolded it and held it at a convenient distance before her eyes He watched her closely as she read it and he saw her grow very pale Take your time read it over two or three times he said quietly Get it well into your mind missus Mallathorpe She nodded her head at last and Pratt stepped back folded up the will and turning to a heavy box which lay open on the table placed it within under lock and key And that done he turned back and took a chair close to his visitor Safe there missus Mallathorpe he said with a glance that was both reassuring and cunning But only for the night I keep a few securities of my own at one of the banks in the town never mind which and that will shall be deposited with them tomorrow morning missus Mallathorpe shook her head No she said Because you ll come to terms with me Pratt shook his head too and he laughed Of course I shall come to terms with you he answered But they ll be my terms and they don t include any giving up of that document That s flat missus Mallathorpe Not if I make it worth your while she asked Listen you don t know what ready money I can command Ready money I tell you cash down on the spot I ve a pretty good notion responded Pratt It s generally understood in the town that your son s a mere figure head and that you re the real boss of the whole show I know that you re at the mill four times a week and that the managers are under your thumb I know that you manage everything connected with the estate So of course I know you ve lots of ready money at your disposal And I know that you don t earn more than four or five pounds a week at the outside said missus Mallathorpe quietly Come now just think what a nice convenient thing it would be to a young man of your age to have a capital Capital It would be the making of you You could go right away to London say and start out on whatever you liked Be sensible sell me that paper and be done with the whole thing No replied Pratt missus Mallathorpe looked at him for a full moment She was a shrewd judge of character and she felt that Pratt was one of those men who are hard to stir from a position once adopted But she had to make her effort and she made it in what she thought the most effective way I ll give you five thousand pounds cash for it she said Meet me with it tomorrow anywhere you like in the town any time you like and I ll hand you the money in notes No said Pratt No Once more she looked at him And Pratt looked back and smiled When I say no I mean no he went on And I never meant No more firmly than I do now I don t believe you she answered affecting a doubt which she certainly did not feel You re only holding out for more money If I were holding out for more money missus Mallathorpe replied Pratt if I meant to sell you that will for cash payment I should have stated my terms to you last night I should have said precisely how much I wanted and I shouldn t have budged from the amount missus Mallathorpe it s no good I ve got my own schemes and my own ideas and I m going to carry em out I want you to appoint me steward to your property your affairs for life Life she exclaimed Life My life answered Pratt And let me tell you you ll find me a first class man a good faithful honest servant I ll do well by you and yours You ll never regret it as long as you live It ll be the best day s work you ve ever done I ll look after your son s interests everybody s interests as if they were my own As indeed he added with a sly glance they will be missus Mallathorpe realized the finality the resolve in all this but she made one more attempt Ten thousand she said Come now think what ten thousand pounds in cash would mean to you No nor twenty thousand replied Pratt I ve made up my mind I ll have my own terms It s no use not one bit of use haggling or discussing matters further I m in possession of the will and therefore of the situation missus Mallathorpe you ve just got to do what I tell you He got up from his chair and going over to a side table took from it a blotting pad some writing paper and a pencil For the moment his back was turned and again he did not see the look of almost murderous hatred which came into his visitor s eyes had he seen and understood it he might even then have reconsidered matters and taken missus Mallathorpe s last offer But the look had gone when he turned again and he noticed nothing as he handed over the writing materials What are these for she asked You ll see in a moment replied Pratt reseating himself and drawing his chair a little nearer her own Now listen because it s no good arguing any more You re going to give me that stewardship and agency You ll simply tell your son that it s absolutely necessary to have a steward He ll agree If he doesn t no matter you ll convince him Now then we must do it in a fashion that won t excite any suspicion Thus in a few days say next week you ll insert in the Barford papers all three of them the advertisement I m going to dictate to you We ll put it in the usual formal phraseology Write this down if you please missus Mallathorpe He dictated an advertisement setting forth the requirements of which he had spoken and missus Mallathorpe obeyed him and wrote She hated Pratt more than ever at that moment there was a quiet steadfast implacability about him that made her feel helpless But she restrained all sign of it and when she had done his bidding she looked at him as calmly as he looked at her I am to insert this in the Barford papers next week she said And what then Then you ll get a lot of applications for the job chuckled Pratt There ll be mine amongst them You can throw most of em in the fire Keep a few for form s sake Profess to discuss them with mister Harper but let the discussion be all on your side I ll send two or three good testimonials you ll incline to me from the first You ll send for me Your interview with me will be highly satisfactory And you ll give me the appointment And your terms asked missus Mallathorpe Now that her own scheme had failed she seemed quite placable to all Pratt s proposals a sure sign of danger to him if he had only known it Better let me know them now and have done with it Quite so agreed Pratt But first of all can you keep this secret to yourself and me The money part any way I can and shall she answered Good said Pratt Very well I want a thousand a year Also I want two rooms and a business room at the Grange I shall not interfere with you or your family or your domestic arrangements but I shall expect to have all my meals served to me from your kitchen and to have one of your servants at my disposal I know the Grange I ve been over it more than once There s much more room there than you can make use of Give me the rooms I want in one of the wings I shan t disturb any of you You ll never see me except on business and if you want to Again the calm acquiescence which would have surprised some men Why Pratt failed to be surprised by it was because he was just then feeling exceedingly triumphant he believed that missus Mallathorpe was metaphorically at his feet He had more than a little vanity in him and it pleased him greatly that dictating of terms he saw himself a conqueror with his foot on the neck of his victim Is that all then asked the visitor All answered Pratt missus Mallathorpe calmly folded up the draft advertisement and placed it in her purse Then she rose and adjusted her veil Then there is nothing to be done until I get your answer to this your application she asked Very well Pratt showed her out and walked to the cab with her He went back to his rooms highly satisfied and utterly ignorant of what missus Mallathorpe was thinking as she drove away CHAPTER IX UNTIL NEXT SPRING Within a week of his sudden death in Eldrick s private office old Antony Bartle was safely laid in the tomb under the yew tree of which missus Clough had spoken with such appreciation and his grandson had entered into virtual possession of all that he had left Collingwood found little difficulty in settling his grandfather s affairs Everything had been left to him he was sole executor as well as sole residuary legatee He found his various tasks made uncommonly easy Another bookseller in the town hurried to buy the entire stock and business goodwill book debts everything Collingwood was free of all responsibility of the shop in Quagg Alley within a few days of the old man s funeral And when he had made a handsome present to the housekeeper a suitable one to the shop boy and paid his grandfather s last debts he was free to depart a richer man by some five and twenty thousand pounds than when he hurried down to Barford in response to Eldrick s telegram He sat in Eldrick s office one afternoon winding up his affairs with him There were certain things that Eldrick Pascoe would have to do as for himself it was necessary for him to get back to London There s something I want to propose to you said Eldrick when they had finished the immediate business You re going to practise of course Of course replied Collingwood with a laugh If I get the chance You ll get the chance said Eldrick What were you going in for Commercial law company law as a special thing answered Collingwood Why I ll tell you what it is continued Eldrick eagerly There s a career for you if you ll take my advice Leave London come down here and take chambers in the town and go the North Eastern Circuit I ll promise you for our firm alone plenty of work You ll get more there s lots of work waiting here for a good smart young barrister Ah you smile but I know what I m talking about You don t know Barford men They believe in the old adage that one should look at home before going abroad They re terribly litigious too and if you were here on the spot they d give you work What do you say Collingwood That sounds very tempting But I was thinking of sticking to London Not one hundredth part of the chance in London that there is here affirmed Eldrick We badly want two or three barristers in this place A man who s really well up in commercial and company law would soon have his hands full There s work I tell you Take my advice and come I couldn t come in any case for a few months said Collingwood musingly Of course if you really think there s an opening I know there is asserted Eldrick I ll guarantee you lots of work our work I m sick of fetching men down all the way from town or getting them from Leeds Come and you ll see I might come in a few months time and try things for a year or two replied Collingwood But I m off to India you know next week and I shall be away until the end of spring four months or so To India exclaimed Eldrick What are you going to do there Sir John Standridge said Collingwood mentioning a famous legal luminary of the day is going out to Hyderabad to take certain evidence and hold a sort of inquiry in a big case and I m going with him as his secretary and assistant I was in his chambers for two years you know We leave next week and we shall not be back until the end of April Lucky man remarked the solicitor Well when you return don t forget what I ve said Come back you ll not regret it Come and settle down Bye the bye you re not engaged are you Engaged said Collingwood To what to whom what do you mean Engaged to be married answered Eldrick coolly You re not Good If you want a wife there s Miss Mallathorpe Nice clever girl my boy and no end of what Barford folk call brass The very woman for you Do you Barford people ever think of anything else but what you call brass asked Collingwood laughing Sometimes replied Eldrick But it s generally of something that nothing but brass can bring or produce After all a rich wife isn t a despicable thing nowadays You ve seen this young lady I ve been there once asserted Collingwood Go again before you leave counselled Eldrick You re just the right man Listen to the counsels of the wise And while you re in India think well over my other advice I tell you there s a career for you here in the North that you d never get in town Collingwood left him and went out to find a motorcar and drive off to Normandale Grange not because Eldrick had advised him to go but because of his promise to Harper and Nesta Mallathorpe And once more he found Nesta alone and though he had no spice of vanity in his composition it seemed to him that she was glad when he walked into the room in which they had first met My mother is out gone to town to the mill she said And Harper is knocking around the park with a gun killing rabbits and time He ll be in presently to tea and he ll be delighted to see you Are you going to stay in Barford much longer I m going up to town this evening seven o clock train answered Collingwood watching her keenly All my business is finished now for the present But you ll be coming back she asked Perhaps he said I may come back after a while When you do come back she went on a little hurriedly will you come and see us again I it s difficult to explain but I do wish Harper knew more men the right sort of men Do you understand You mean he needs more company More company of the right kind He doesn t know many nice men And he has so little to occupy him He s no head for business my mother attends to all that and he doesn t care much about sport and when he goes into Barford he only hangs about the club and I m afraid at two or three of the hotels there and it s not good for him Can t you get him interested in anything suggested Collingwood Is there nothing that he cares about He never did care about anything replied Nesta with a sigh He s apathetic He just moves along Sometimes I think he was born half asleep and he s never been really awakened Pity isn t it Considering everything a great pity agreed Collingwood But he s provided for Nesta gave him a swift glance It might have been a good deal better for him if he hadn t been provided for she said He d have just had to do something then But if you come back you ll come here sometimes Of course answered Collingwood And if I come back it will probably be to stop here mister Eldrick says there s a lot of work going begging in Barford for a smart young barrister well up in commercial law Perhaps I may try to come up to his standard I m certainly young but I don t know whether I m smart Better come and try she said smiling Don t forget that I ve seen you look the part anyway your wig and gown suited you very well Theatrical properties he replied laughing The wig was too small and the gown too long Well we ll see But in the meantime I m going away for four months to India To India four months she exclaimed That sounds nice Legal business said Collingwood I shall be back about the end of April and then I shall probably come down here again and seriously consider Eldrick s suggestion I m very much inclined to take it Then you d leave London she asked I ve little to leave there replied Collingwood My father and mother are dead and I ve no brothers no sisters no very near relations Sounds lonely doesn t it One can feel lonely when one has relations said Nesta Are you saying that from experience he asked I often wish I had more to do she answered frankly What s the use of denying it I ve next to nothing to do here I liked my work at the hospital I was busy all day Here If I were you interrupted Collingwood I d set to work nursing in another fashion Look after your brother Get him going at something even if it s playing golf Play with him It would do him and you all the good in the world if you got thoroughly infatuated with even a game Don t you see You mean anything is better than nothing she replied All right I ll try that anyway For I m anxious about Harper All this money and no occupation Collingwood who was sitting near the windows looked out across the park and into the valley beyond I should have thought that a man who had come into an estate like this would have found plenty of occupation he remarked What is there beside the house and this park Nesta who had busied herself with some fancy work since Collingwood s entrance laid it down and came to the windows She pointed to certain roofs and gables in the valley There s the whole village of Normandale she said A busy place no doubt but it s all Harper s he s lord of the manor He s patron of the living too It s all his farms cottages everything And the woods and the park and this house and a stretch of the moors as well Of course he ought to find a lot to do but he doesn t Perhaps because my mother does everything She really is a business woman Collingwood looked out over the area which Nesta had indicated Harper Mallathorpe he calculated must be possessed of some three or four thousand acres A fine property he said He s a very fortunate fellow Just then this very fortunate fellow came in His face dull enough as he entered lighted up at sight of a visitor and fell again when Collingwood explained that his visit was a mere flying one and that he was returning to London that night Collingwood led him on to the project which he had mentioned at his previous visit the making of golf links in the park and pointed out as a devotee of the sport what a fine course could be made Before he left he had succeeded in arousing like interest in Harper he promised to go into the matter and to employ a man whom Collingwood recommended as an expert in laying out golf courses You ll have got your greens in something like order by this time next year if you start operations soon said Collingwood And then if I settle down at Barford I ll come out now and then if you ll let me Let you exclaimed Harper By Jove we re only too glad to have anybody out here aren t we Nesta We shall always be glad to see mister Collingwood said Nesta Collingwood went away with that last intimation warm in his memory He had an idea that the girl meant what she said and for a moment he was sorry that he was going to India He might have settled down at Barford there and then and but at that he laughed at himself A young woman with several thousands a year of her own he said Of course she ll marry some big pot in the county They feel a little lonely those two just now because everything s new to them and they re new to their changed circumstances But when I get back ah I guess they ll have got plenty of people around them And he determined being a young man of sense not to think any more for already he had thought a good deal of Nesta Mallathorpe until he returned from his Indian travels Let him attend to his business and leave possibilities until they came nearer All the same he mused as he drew near the town again I m pretty sure I shall come back here next spring I feel like it He called in at Eldrick s office on his way to the hotel to take some documents which had been preparing for him It was then late in the afternoon and no one but Pratt was there Pratt indeed had been waiting until Collingwood called Going back to town mister Collingwood asked Pratt as he handed over a big envelope When shall we have the pleasure of seeing you again sir Something in the clerk s tone made Collingwood think he could not tell why that Pratt was fishing for information And also for reasons which he could not explain Collingwood had taken a curious dislike to Pratt and was not inclined to give him any confidence I don t know he answered a little icily I am leaving for India next week He bade the clerk a formal farewell and went off and Pratt locked the office door and slowly followed him downstairs To India he said to himself watching the young barrister s retreating figure To India eh For a time or for what Anyway that was good news Pratt had seen in Collingwood a possible rival CHAPTER X THE FOOT BRIDGE Collingwood s return to London was made on a Friday evening next day he began the final preparations for his departure to India on the following Thursday He was looking forward to his journey and his stay in India with keen expectation He would have the society of a particularly clever and brilliant man they were to break their journey in Italy and in Egypt he would enjoy exceptional facilities for seeing the native life of India he would gain valuable experience It was a chance at which any young man would have jumped and Collingwood had been greatly envied when it was known that Sir John Standridge had offered it to him And yet he was conscious that if he could have done precisely what he desired he would have stayed longer at Barford in order to see more of Nesta Mallathorpe Already it seemed a long time to the coming spring when he would be back and free to go North again But Collingwood was fated to go North once more much sooner than he had dreamed of As he sat at breakfast in his rooms on the Monday morning after his departure from Barford turning over his newspaper with no particular aim or interest his attention was suddenly and sharply arrested by a headline Even that headline might not have led him to read what lay beneath But in the same instant in which he saw it he also saw a name Mallathorpe In the next he knew that heavy trouble had fallen on Normandale Grange the very day after he had left it This is what Collingwood read as he sat coffee cup in one hand newspaper in the other staring at the lines of unleaded type TRAGIC FATE OF YOUNG YORKSHIRE SQUIRE A fatal accident of a particularly sad and disturbing nature occurred near Barford Yorkshire on Saturday About four o clock on Saturday afternoon mister Linford Pratt managing clerk to Messrs Eldrick Pascoe Solicitors of Barford who was crossing the grounds of Normandale Grange on his way to a business appointment discovered the dead body of mister H J Mallathorpe the owner of the Normandale Estate lying in a roadway which at that point is spanned forty feet above by a narrow foot bridge The latter is an ancient construction of wood and there is no doubt that it was in extremely bad repair and had given way when the unfortunate young gentleman who was out shooting in his park stepped upon it mister Mallathorpe who was only twenty four years of age succeeded to the Normandale estates one of the finest properties in the neighbourhood of Barford about two years ago under somewhat romantic and also tragic circumstances their previous owner his uncle mister John Mallathorpe a well known Barford manufacturer meeting a sudden death by the falling of his mill chimney a catastrophe which also caused the deaths of several of his employees mister John Mallathorpe died intestate and the estate at Normandale passed to the young gentleman who met such a sad fate on Saturday afternoon mister H J Mallathorpe was unmarried and it is understood that Normandale which includes the village of that name the advowson of the living and about four thousand acres of land now becomes the property of his sister Miss Nesta Mallathorpe Collingwood set down his cup and dropped the newspaper He was but half way through his breakfast but all his appetite had vanished All that he was conscious of was that here was trouble and grief for a girl in whom it was useless to deny it he had already begun to take a warm interest And suddenly he started from his chair and snatched up a railway guide As he turned over its pages he thought rapidly The preparations for his journey to India were almost finished what was not done he could do in a few hours He had no further appointment with Sir John Standridge until nine o clock on Thursday morning when he was to meet him at the train for Dover and Paris Monday Tuesday Wednesday he had three days ample time to hurry down to Normandale to do what he could to help there and to get back in time to make his own last arrangements He glanced at his watch he had forty minutes in which to catch an express from King s Cross to Barford Without further delay he picked up a suit case which was already packed and set out for the station He was in Barford soon after two o clock in Eldrick s office by half past two Eldrick shook his head at sight of him I can guess what s brought you down Collingwood he said Good of you of course I don t think they ve many friends out there I can scarcely call myself that yet answered Collingwood But I thought I might be of some use I ll drive out there presently But first how was it Eldrick shook his head Don t know much more than what the papers say he answered There s an old foot bridge there that spans a road in the park road cut through a ravine They say it was absolutely rotten and the poor chap s weight was evidently too much for it And there was a drop of forty feet into a hard road Extraordinary thing that nobody on the estate seems to have known of the dangerous condition of that bridge but they say it was little used simply a link between one plantation and another However it s done now Our clerk Pratt you know found the body Hadn t been dead five minutes Pratt says What was Pratt doing there asked Collingwood Oh business of his own replied Eldrick Not ours There was an advertisement in Saturday s papers which set out that a steward was wanted for the Normandale estate and Pratt mentioned it to me in the morning that he thought of applying for the job if we d give him a good testimonial I suppose he d gone out there to see about the preliminaries Anyway he was walking through the park when he found young Mallathorpe s body I understand he made himself very useful too and I ve sent him out there again today to do anything he can smart chap Pratt Possibly then there is nothing I can do remarked Collingwood I should say you ll do a lot by merely going there answered Eldrick As I said just now they ve few friends and no relations and I hear that missus Mallathorpe is absolutely knocked over Go by all means a bit of sympathy goes a long way on these occasions I say what a regular transformation an affair of this sort produces Do you know that young fellow just like his uncle had not made any will Fact I had it from Robson their solicitor this very morning The whole of the estate comes to the sister of course she and the mother will share the personal property By that lad s death Nesta Mallathorpe becomes one of the wealthiest young women in Yorkshire Collingwood made no reply to this communication But as he drove off to Normandale Grange it was fresh in his mind And it was not very pleasant to him One of the wealthiest young women in Yorkshire and he was already realizing that he would like to make Nesta Mallathorpe his wife it was because he felt what he did for her that he had rushed down to do anything he could that would be of help Supposing only supposing that people anybody said that he was fortune hunting Somewhat unduly sensitive proud almost to a fault he felt his cheek redden at the thought and for a moment he wished that old John Mallathorpe s wealth had never passed to his niece But then he sneered at himself for his presumption Ass he said She s never even thought of me in that way most likely Anyway I m a stupid fool for thinking of these things at present But he knew within a few minutes of entering the big desolate looking house that Nesta had been thinking of him She came to him in the room where they had first met and quietly gave him her hand I was not surprised when they told me you were here she said I was thinking about you or rather expecting to hear from you I came at once answered Collingwood who had kept her hand in his I well I couldn t stop away I thought perhaps I could do something be of some use It s a great deal of use to have just come she said Thank you But I suppose you ll have to go Not for two days anyway he replied What can I do I don t know that you can actually do anything she answered Everything is being done mister Eldrick sent his clerk mister Pratt who found Harper he s been most kind and useful He and our own solicitor are making all arrangements There s got to be an inquest No I don t know that you can do actual things But while you re here you can look in when you like My mother is very ill she has scarcely spoken since Saturday I ll tell you what I will do said Collingwood determinedly I noticed in coming through the village just now that there s quite a decent inn there I ll go down and arrange to stay there until Wednesday evening then I shall be close by if you should need me He saw by her look of quick appreciation and relief that this suggestion pleased her She pressed his hand and withdrew her own Thank you again she said Do you know I can t quite explain I should be glad if you were close at hand Everybody has been very kind but I do feel that there is nobody I can talk to If you arrange this will you come in again this evening I shall arrange it answered Collingwood I ll see to it now Tell your people I am to be brought in whenever I call And I ll be close by whenever you want me It seemed little to say little to do but he left her feeling that he was being of some use And as he went off to make his arrangements at the inn he encountered Pratt who was talking to the butler in the outer hall The clerk looked at Collingwood with an unconcern and a composure which he was able to assume because he had already heard of his presence in the house Inwardly he was malignantly angry that the young barrister was there but his voice was suave and polite enough when he spoke Good afternoon mister Collingwood he said quietly Very sad occasion on which we meet again sir Come to offer your sympathy mister Collingwood of course very kind of you I came answered Collingwood who was not inclined to bandy phrases with Pratt to see if I could be of any practical use Just so sir said Pratt mister Eldrick sent me here for the same purpose There s really not much to do beyond the necessary arrangements which are already pretty forward Going back to town sir he went on following Collingwood out to his motor car which stood waiting in the drive No replied Collingwood I m going to send this man to Barford to fetch my bag to the inn down there in the village where I m going to stay for a few days Did you hear that he continued turning to the driver Go back to Barford get my bag from the Station Hotel there bring it to the Normandale Arms I ll meet you there on your return The car went off and Collingwood with a nod to Pratt was about to turn down a side path towards the village But Pratt stopped him Would you care to see the place where the accident happened mister Collingwood he said It s close by won t take five minutes Collingwood hesitated a moment then he turned back It might be well he reflected if he made himself acquainted with all the circumstances of this case simple as they seemed Thank you he said If it s so near This way sir responded Pratt He led his companion along the front of the house through the shrubberies at the end of a wing and into a plantation by a path thickly covered with pine needles Presently they emerged upon a similar track at right angles to that by which they had come and leading into a denser part of the woods And at the end of a hundred yards of it they came to a barricade evidently of recent construction over which Pratt stretched a hand There he said That s the bridge sir Collingwood looked over the barricade He saw that he and Pratt were standing at the edge of one thick plantation of fir and pine the edge of a similar plantation stretched before them some ten yards away But between the two lay a deep dark ravine which immediately in front of the temporary barricade was spanned by a narrow rustic bridge a fragile looking thing of planks railed in by boughs of trees And in the middle was a jagged gap in both floor and side rails showing where the rotten wood had given way I ll explain mister Collingwood said the clerk presently I knew this park sir I knew it well before the late mister John Mallathorpe bought the property That path at the other end of the bridge makes a short cut down to the station in the valley through the woods and the lower part of the park I came up that path from the station on Saturday afternoon intending to cross this bridge and go on to the house where I had private business When I got to the other end of the bridge there I saw the gap in the middle And then I looked down into the cut there s a road a paved road down there and I saw him And so I made shift to scramble down stiff job it was to get to him But he was dead mister Collingwood stone dead sir though I m certain he hadn t been dead five minutes And Aye an he d never ha been dead at all wouldn t young Squire if only his ma had listened to what I telled her interrupted a voice behind them He d ha been alive at this minute he would if his ma had done what I said owt to be done now then Collingwood turned sharply to confront an old man evidently one of the woodmen on the estate who had come up behind them unheard on the thick carpeting of pine needles And Pratt turned too with a keen look and a direct question What do you mean he asked What are you talking about I know what I m talking about young gentleman said the man doggedly I ain t worked lad and man on this one estate nine and forty years and happen more wi out knowin all about it I tell d missus Mallathorpe on Friday noon at that there owd brig ud fall in afore long if it worn t mended I met her here at this very place where we re standin and I showed her at it worn t safe to cross it I tell d her t she owt to have it fastened up theer an then It s been rottin for many a year has this owd brig why I mind when it wor last repaired and that wor years afore owd Mestur Mallathorpe bowt this estate When do you say you told missus Mallathorpe all that asked Pratt Friday noon it were sir answered the woodman When I were on my way home dinner time Cause I met the missis here and I made bold to tell her what I d noticed That there owd brig lor bless yer gentlemen it were black rotten i the middle theer where poor young maister he fell through it Ye mun hev that seen to at once missis I says Sartin sure tain t often as it s used I says but surely sartin at if it ain t mended or closed altogether I says summun ll be going through and brekkin their necks I says An reight too gentlemen forty feet it is down to that road An a mortal hard road an all paved wi granite stone all t way to t stable yard You re sure it was Friday noon repeated Pratt As sure as that I see you answered the woodman An missus Mallathorpe she said she d hev it seen to Dear a me it should ha been closed The old man shook his head and went off amongst the trees and Pratt giving his vanishing figure a queer look turned silently back along the path followed by Collingwood At the point where the other path led to the house he glanced over his shoulder at the young barrister If you keep straight on mister Collingwood he said you ll get straight down to the village and the inn I must go this way He went off rapidly and Collingwood walked on through the plantation towards the Normandale Arms wondering all the way why Pratt was so anxious to know exactly when it was that missus Mallathorpe had been warned about the old bridge CHAPTER XI THE PREVALENT ATMOSPHERE Until that afternoon Collingwood had never been in the village to which he was now bending his steps on that and his previous visits to the Grange he had only passed the end of its one street Now descending into it from the slopes of the park he found it to be little more than a hamlet a church a farmstead or two a few cottages in their gardens all clustering about a narrow stream spanned by a high arched bridge of stone The Normandale Arms a roomy old fashioned place stood at one end of the bridge and from the windows of the room into which Collingwood was presently shown he could look out on the stream itself and on the meadows beyond it A peaceful pretty quiet place but the gloom which was heavy at the big house or the hill seemed to have spread to everybody that he encountered Bad job this sir said the landlord an elderly serious faced man to whom Collingwood had made known his wants and who had quickly formed the opinion that his guest was of the legal profession And a queer one too Odd thing sir that our old squire and now the young one should both have met their deaths in what you might term violent fashion Accident in both cases remarked Collingwood The landlord nodded his head and then shook it in a manner which seemed to indicate that while he agreed with this proposition in one respect he entertained some sort of doubt about it in others Ay well he answered Of course a mill chimney falling without notice as it were and a bridge giving way them s accidents to be sure But it s a very strange thing about this foot bridge up yonder at the Grange very strange indeed There s queer talk about it already What sort of talk asked Collingwood Ever since the old woodman had come up to him and Pratt as they stood looking at the foot bridge he had been aware of a curious sense of mystery and the landlord s remark tended to deepen it What are people talking about Nay it s only one or two replied the landlord There s been two men in here since the affair happened that crossed that bridge Friday afternoon and both of em big heavy men According to what one can learn that there bridge wasn t used much by the Grange people it led to nowhere in particular for them But there is a right of way across that part of the park and these two men as I m speaking of they made use of it on Friday getting towards dark I know em well they d both of em weigh four times as much together as young Squire Mallathorpe and yet it didn t give way under them And then only a few hours later as you might say down it goes with him I don t think you can form any opinion from that said Collingwood These things these old structures often give way quite suddenly and unexpectedly Ay well they did admit these men too that it seemed a bit tottery like remarked the landlord Talking it over between themselves in here they agreed to be sure that it felt to give a bit All the same there s them as says that it s a queer thing it should ha given altogether when young squire walked on it Collingwood clinched matters with a straight question You don t mean to say that people are suggesting that the foot bridge had been tampered with he asked There is them about as wouldn t be slow to say as much answered the landlord Folks will talk You see sir nobody saw what happened And when country folk doesn t see what takes place with their own eyes then they Make mysteries out of it interrupted Collingwood a little impatiently I don t think there s any mystery here landlord I understood that this foot bridge was in a very unsafe condition No I m afraid the whole affair was only too simple But he was conscious as he said this that he was not precisely voicing his own sentiments He himself was mystified He was still wondering why Pratt had been so pertinacious in asking the old woodman when precisely he had told missus Mallathorpe about the unsafe condition of the bridge still wondering about a certain expression which had come into Pratt s face when the old man told them what he did still wondering at the queer look which Pratt had given the information as he went off into the plantation Was there then something some secret which was being kept back by somebody He was still pondering over these things when he went back to the Grange later in the evening but he was resolved not to say anything about them to Nesta And he saw Nesta only for a few minutes Her mother she said was very ill indeed the doctor was with her then and she must go back to them Since her son s death missus Mallathorpe had scarcely spoken and the doctor knowing that her heart was not strong was somewhat afraid of a collapse If there is anything that I can do or if you should want me during the night said Collingwood earnestly promise me that you ll send at once to the inn Yes answered Nesta I will But I don t think there will be any need We have two nurses here and the doctor will stop There is something I should be glad if you would do tomorrow she went on looking at him a little wistfully You know about the inquest Yes said Collingwood They say we that is I because of course my mother couldn t that I need not be present she continued mister Robson our solicitor says it will be a very short formal affair He will be there of course but would you mind being there too so that you can afterwards tell me all about it Will you tell me something straight out answered Collingwood looking intently at her Have you any doubt of any description about the accepted story of your brother s death Be plain with me Nesta hesitated for awhile before answering Not of the actual circumstances she replied at last none at all of what you call the accepted story The fact is I m not a good hand at explaining anything and perhaps I can t convey to you what I mean But I ve a feeling an impression that there is or was some mystery on Saturday which might have and might not have oh I can t make it clear even to myself If you would be at the inquest tomorrow and listen carefully to everything and then tell me afterwards do you understand I understand answered Collingwood Leave it to me Whether he expected to hear anything unusual at the inquest whether he thought any stray word hint or suggestion would come up during the proceedings Collingwood was no more aware than Nesta was certain of her vague ideas But he was very soon assured that there was going to be nothing beyond brevity and formality He had never previously been present at an inquest his legal mind was somewhat astonished at the way in which things were done It was quickly evident to him that the twelve good men and true of the jury most of them cottagers and labourers living on the estate were quite content to abide by the directions of the coroner a Barford solicitor whose one idea seemed to be to get through the proceedings as rapidly and smoothly as possible And Collingwood felt bound to admit that taking the evidence as it was brought forward no simpler or more straightforward cause of investigation could be adduced It was all very simple indeed as it appeared there and then The butler a solemn faced respectable type of the old family serving man spoke as to his identification of the dead master s body and gave his evidence in a few sentences mister Mallathorpe he said had gone out of the front door of the Grange at half past two on Saturday afternoon carrying a gun and had turned into the road leading towards the South Shrubbery At about three o clock mister Pratt had come running up the drive to the house and told him and Miss Mallathorpe that he had just found mister Mallathorpe lying dead in the sunken cut between the South and North Shrubbery Nobody had any question to ask the butler Nor were any questions asked of Pratt the one really important witness Pratt gave his evidence tersely and admirably On Saturday morning he had seen an advertisement in the Barford newspapers which stated that a steward and agent was wanted for the Normandale Estate and all applications were to be made to missus Mallathorpe Desirous of applying for the post he had written out a formal letter during Saturday morning had obtained a testimonial from his present employers Messrs Eldrick Pascoe and anxious to present his application as soon as possible had decided to take it to Normandale Grange himself that afternoon He had left Barford by the two o clock train which arrived at Normandale at two thirty five Knowing the district well he had taken the path through the plantations Arrived at the foot bridge he had at once noticed that part of it had fallen in Looking into the cutting he had seen a man lying in the roadway beneath motionless He had scrambled down the side of the cutting discovered that the man was mister Harper Mallathorpe and that he was dead and had immediately hurried up the road to the house where he had informed the last witness and Miss Mallathorpe A quite plain story evidently thought everybody no questions needed Nor were there any questions needed in the case of the only other witnesses the estate carpenter who said that the foot bridge was very old but that he had not been aware that it was in quite so bad a condition and who gave it as his opinion that the recent heavy rains had had something to do with the matter and the doctor who testified that the victim had suffered injuries which would produce absolutely instantaneous death A clear case nothing could be clearer said the coroner to his obedient jury who presently returned the only verdict one of accidental death which on the evidence was possible Collingwood heard no comments on the inquest from those who were present But that evening as he sat in his parlour at the Normandale Arms the landlord coming in on pretence of attending to the fire approached him with an air of mystery and jerked his thumb in the direction of the regions which he had just quitted You remember what we were talking of this afternoon when you come in sir he whispered There s some of em regular nightly customers village folk you understand talking of the same thing now and of this here inquest And if you d like to hear a bit of what you may call local opinion and especially one man s I ll put you where you can hear it without being seen It s worth hearing anyway Collingwood curious to know what the village wiseacres had to say rose and followed the landlord into a small room at the back of the bar parlour An open hatchment in the wall covered by a thin curtain allowed him to hear every word which came from what appeared to be a full company But it was quickly evident that in that company there was one man who either was or wished to be dictator and artifex a man of loud voice and domineering tone who was laying down the law to the accompaniment of vigorous thumpings of the table at which he sat What I say is and I say it agen I reckon nowt at all o crowners quests he was affirming as Collingwood and his guide drew near the curtained opening What is a crowner s quest anyway It s nowt but formality all form and show it means nowt All them at sits on t jury does and says just what t crowner tells em to say and do They nivver ax no questions out o their own mouths they re as dumb as sheep that s what yon jury wor this mornin now then That s James Stringer the blacksmith whispered the landlord coming close to Collingwood s elbow He thinks he knows everything And pray what would you ha done Mestur Stringer if you d been on yon jury inquired a milder voice I suppose ye d ha wanted to know a bit more what Mestur Stringer ud ha wanted to know a deal more observed another voice He would do There s a many things I want to know continued the blacksmith with a stout thump of the table They all tak it for granted at young squire walked on to yon bridge an at it theer and then fell to pieces Who see d it fall to pieces Who was theer to see what did happen What else did happen or could happen nor what were testified to asked a new voice Theer wor what they call circumstantial evidence to show how all t affair happened Circumstantial evidence be blowed sneered the blacksmith heartily I reckon nowt o circumstantial evidence Look ye here How do you know how does anybody know at t young squire worn t thrown off that bridge and at t bridge collapsed when he wor thrown He might ha met somebody on t bridge and quarrelled wi em and whoivver it wor might ha been t strongest man and flung him into t road beneath Aye but i that case t other feller t assailant ud ha fallen wi him objected somebody Nowt o t sort retorted the blacksmith He d be safe on t sound part o t bridge it s only a piece on t that gave way I say that theer idea wants in quirin into An theer s another thing what wor that lawyer clerk chap fro Barford Pratt doin about theer What reight had he to be prowlin round t neighbourhood o that bridge and at that time Come now theer s a tickler for somebody He telled that exclaimed several voices He had business i t place He had some papers to liver Then why didn t he go t nearest way to t house t liver em demanded Stringer T shortest way to t house fro t railway station is straight up t carriage drive not through them plantations I ax agen what wor that feller doin theer It s important Why ye don t suspect him of owt do yer Mestur Stringer asked somebody A respectable young feller like that theer come I m sayin nowt about suspectin nobody vociferated the blacksmith I m doin nowt but puttin a case as t lawyers ud term it I say at theer s a lot o things at owt to ha comed out I ll tell ye one on em how is it at nowt not a single word wor said at yon inquest about missus Mallathorpe and t affair Not one word A sudden silence fell on the company and the landlord tapped Collingwood s arm and took the liberty of winking at him Why inquired somebody at last what about missus Mallathorpe and t affair What had she to do wi t affair The blacksmith s voice became judicial in its solemnity Ye listen to me he said with emphasis I know what I m talking about Ye know what came out at t inquest When this here Pratt ran to tell t news at t house he returned to what they term t fatal spot i company wi t butler and a couple of footmen and Dan Scholes one o t grooms Now theer worn t a word said at t inquest about what that lot five on em mind yer found when they reached t dead corpse not one word But I know Dan Scholes tell d me What did they find then Mestur Stringer asked an eager member of the assemblage What wor it The blacksmith s voice sank to a mysterious whisper I ll tell yer he replied They found missus Mallathorpe lyin i a dead faint close by And they say at she s nivver done nowt but go out o one faint into another ivver since So of course she s nivver been able to tell if she saw owt or knew owt And what I say is he concluded with a heavy thump of the table that theer crowner s quest owt to ha been what they term adjourned until missus Mallathorpe could tell if she did see owt or if she knew owt or heer d owt She mun ha been close by or else they wo dn t ha found her lyin theer aside o t corpse What did she see What did she hear Does she know owt I tell ye at theer s questions at wants answerin and theer s trouble ahead for somebody if they aren t answered now then Collingwood went away from his retreat beckoning the landlord to follow In the parlour he turned to him Have you heard anything of what Stringer said just now he asked I mean about missus Mallathorpe Heard just the same and from the same chap Scholes the groom sir replied the landlord Oh yes Of course people will wonder why they didn t get some evidence from missus Mallathorpe just as Stringer says Collingwood sat a long time that night thinking over the things he had heard He came to the conclusion that the domineering blacksmith was right in one of his dogmatic assertions there was trouble ahead And next morning before going up to the Grange he went to the nearest telegraph office and sent Sir John Standridge a lengthy message in which he resigned the appointment that would have taken him to India CHAPTER XII THE POWER OF ATTORNEY Collingwood had many things to think over as he walked across Normandale Park that morning He had deliberately given up his Indian appointment for Nesta s sake so that he might be near her in case the trouble which he feared arose suddenly But it was too soon yet to let her know that she was the cause of his altered arrangements in any case that was not the time to tell her that it was on her account that he had altered them He must make some plausible excuse then he must settle down in Barford according to Eldrick s suggestion He would then be near at hand and if the trouble whatever it might be took tangible form he would be able to help But he was still utterly in the dark as to what that possible trouble might be yet of one thing he felt convinced it would have some connection with Pratt He remembered as he walked along that he had formed some queer uneasy suspicion about Pratt when he first hurried down to Barford on hearing of Antony Bartle s death that feeling subsequently allayed to some extent had been revived There might be nothing in it he said to himself over and over again everything that seemed strange might be easily explained the evidence of Pratt at the inquest had appeared absolutely truthful and straightforward and yet the blunt rough downright question of the blacksmith crudely voiced as it was found a ready agreement in Collingwood s mind As he drew near the house he found himself repeating Stringer s broad Yorkshire What wor that lawyer clerk chap fro Barford Pratt doin about theer What reight had he to be prowlin round t neighbourhood o that bridge and at that time Come now theer s a tickler for somebody And even as he smiled at the remembrance of the whole rustic conversation of the previous evening and thought that the blacksmith s question certainly might be a ticklish one for somebody he looked up from the frosted grass at his feet and saw Pratt Pratt a professional looking bag in his hand a morning newspaper under the other arm was standing at the gate of one of the numerous shrubberies which flanked the Grange talking to a woman who leaned over it Collingwood recognized her as a person whom he had twice seen in the house during his visits on the day before a middle aged slightly built woman neatly dressed in black and wearing a sort of nurse s cap which seemed to denote some degree of domestic servitude She was a woman who had once been pretty and who still retained much of her good looks she was also evidently of considerable shrewdness and intelligence and possessed a pair of remarkably quick eyes the sort of eyes thought Collingwood that see everything that happens within their range of vision And she had a firm chin and a mouth which expressed determination he had seen all that as she exchanged some conversation with the old butler in Collingwood s presence a noticeable woman altogether She was evidently in close conference with Pratt at that moment but as Collingwood drew near she turned and went slowly in the direction of the house while Pratt always outwardly polite stepped towards the interrupter of this meeting and lifted his hat Good morning mister Collingwood he said A fine sharp morning sir I was just asking missus Mallathorpe s maid how her mistress is this morning she was very ill when I left last night Better sir I m glad to say missus Mallathorpe has had a much better night I m very pleased to hear it replied Collingwood He was going towards the front of the Grange and Pratt walked at his side evidently in the same direction I am afraid she has had a great shock You are still here then he went on feeling bound to make some remark and saying the first obvious thing Still busy mister Eldrick has lent me so to speak until the funeral s over tomorrow answered Pratt There are a lot of little things in which I can be useful you know mister Collingwood I suppose your arrangements you said you were sailing for India won t permit of your being present tomorrow sir Collingwood was not sure if the clerk was fishing for information Pratt s manner was always polite his questions so innocently put that it was difficult to know what he was actually after But he was not going to give him any information either then or at any time I don t quite know what my arrangements may be he answered And just then they came to the front entrance and Collingwood was taken off in one direction by a footman while Pratt who already seemed to be fully acquainted with the house and its arrangements took himself and his bag away in another Nesta came to Collingwood looking less anxious than when he had left her at his last call the night before He had already told her what his impressions of the inquest were and he was now wondering whether to tell her of the things he had heard said at the village inn But remembering that he was now going to stay in the neighbourhood he decided to say nothing at that time if there was anything in these vague feelings and suspicions it would come out and could be dealt with when it arose At present he had need of a little diplomacy Oh I wanted to tell you he said after talking to her awhile about missus Mallathorpe I there s a change in my arrangements I m not going to India after all He was not prepared for the sudden flush that came over the girl s face It took him aback It also told him a good deal that he was glad to know and it was only by a strong effort of will that he kept himself from taking her hands and telling her the truth But he affected not to see anything and he went on talking rapidly Complete change in the arrangements at the last minute he said I ve just been writing about it So as that s off I think I shall follow Eldrick s advice and take chambers in Barford for a time and see how things turn out I m going into Barford now to see Eldrick about all that Nesta who was conscious of her betrayal of more than she cared to show just then tried to speak calmly But isn t it an awful disappointment she said You were looking forward so to going there weren t you Can t be helped replied Collingwood All these affairs are provisional I thought I d tell you at once however so that you ll know if you ever want me that I shall be somewhere round about In fact as it s quite comfortable there I shall stop at the inn until I ve got rooms in the town Then not trusting himself to remain longer he went off to Barford certain that he was now definitely pledged in his own mind to Nesta Mallathorpe and not much less that when the right time came she would not be irresponsive to him And on that like a cold douche came the remembrance of her actual circumstances she was what Eldrick had said one of the wealthiest young women in Yorkshire The thought of her riches made Collingwood melancholy for a while he possessed a curious sort of pride which made him hate and loathe the notion of being taken for a fortune hunter But suddenly and with a laugh he remembered that he had certain possessions of his own ability knowledge and perseverance Before he reached Eldrick s office he had had a vision of the Woolsack Eldrick received Collingwood s news with evident gratification He immediately suggested certain chambers in an adjacent building he volunteered information as to where the best rooms in the town were to be had And in proof of his practical interest in Collingwood s career he there and then engaged his professional services for two cases which were to be heard at a local court within the following week Pratt shall deliver the papers to you at once he said That is as soon as he s back from Normandale this afternoon I sent him there again to make himself useful I saw him this morning remarked Collingwood He appears to be a very useful person Clever chap asserted Eldrick carelessly I don t know what ll be done about that stewardship that he was going to apply for Everything will be altered now that young Mallathorpe s dead Of course I personally shouldn t have thought that Pratt would have done for a job like that but Pratt has enough self assurance and self confidence for a dozen men and he thought he would do and I couldn t refuse him a testimonial And as he s made himself very useful out there it may be that if this steward business goes forward Pratt will get the appointment As I say he s a smart chap Collingwood offered no comment But he was conscious that it would not be at all pleasing to him to know that Linford Pratt held any official position at Normandale Foolish as it might be mere inspiration though it probably was he could not get over his impression that Eldrick s clerk was not precisely trustworthy And yet he reflected he himself could do nothing it would be utter presumption on his part to offer any gratuitous advice to Nesta Mallathorpe in business matters He was very certain of what he eventually meant to say to her about his own personal hopes some time hence when all the present trouble was over but in the meantime as regarded anything else he could only wait and watch and be of service to her if she asked him to render any Some time went by before Collingwood was asked to render service of any sort At Normandale Grange events progressed in apparently ordinary and normal fashion Harper Mallathorpe was buried his mother began to make some recovery from the shock of his death the legal folk were busied in putting Nesta in possession of the estate and herself and her mother in proprietorship of the mill and the personal property In Barford things went on as usual too Pratt continued his round of duties at Eldrick Pascoe s no more was heard by outsiders at any rate of the stewardship at Normandale As for Collingwood he settled down in chambers and lodgings and as Eldrick had predicted found plenty of work And he constantly went out to Normandale Grange and often met Nesta elsewhere and their knowledge of each other increased and as the winter passed away and spring began to show on the Normandale woods and moors Collingwood felt that the time was coming when he might speak He was professionally engaged in London for nearly three weeks in the early part of that spring when he returned he had made up his mind to tell Nesta the truth at once He had faced it for himself he was by that time so much in love with her that he was not going to let monetary considerations prevent him from telling her so But Collingwood found something else than love to talk about when he presented himself at Normandale Grange on the morning after his arrival from his three weeks absence in town As soon as he met her he saw that Nesta was not only upset and troubled but angry I am glad you have come she said when they were alone I want some advice Something has happened something that bothers and puzzles me very very much I m dreadfully bothered Tell me suggested Collingwood Nesta frowned at some recollection or thought Yesterday afternoon she answered I was obliged to go into Barford on business I left my mother fairly well she has been recovering fast lately and she only has one nurse now Unfortunately she too was out for the afternoon I came back to find my mother ill and much upset and there s no use denying it she d all the symptoms of having been well frightened I can t think of any other term than that frightened And then I learned that in my absence mister Eldrick s clerk mister Pratt you know him had been here and had been with her for quite an hour I am furiously angry Collingwood had expected this announcement as soon as she began to explain So the trouble was beginning How came Pratt to be admitted to your mother he asked That makes me angry too answered Nesta Though I confess I ought to be angry with myself for not giving stricter orders I left the house about two he came about three and asked to see my mother s maid Esther Mawson He told her that it was absolutely necessary for him to see my mother on business and she told my mother he was there My mother consented to see him and he was taken up And as I say I found her ill and frightened and that s not the worst of it What is the worst of it asked Collingwood anxiously Better tell me I may be able to do something The worst of it she said is just this my mother won t tell me what that man came about She flatly refuses to tell me anything She will only say that it was business of her own She won t trust me with it you see her own daughter What business can that man have with her or she with him Eldrick Pascoe are not our solicitors There s some secret and Will you answer one or two questions said Collingwood quietly He had never seen Nesta angry before and he now realized that she had certain possibilities of temper and determination which would be formidable when roused First of all is that maid you speak of Esther Mawson reliable I don t know answered Nesta My mother has had her two years she s a Barford woman Sometimes I think she s sly and cunning But I ve given her such strict orders now that she ll never dare to let any one see my mother again without my consent The other question s this said Collingwood Have you any idea any suspicion of why Pratt wanted to see your mother Not unless it was about that stewardship replied Nesta But how could that frighten her Besides all that s over Normandale is mine and if I have a steward or an estate agent I shall see to the appointment myself No I do not know why he should have come here But there s some mystery The curious thing is What asked Collingwood as she paused Why she said shaking her head wonderingly that I m absolutely certain that my mother never even knew this man Pratt I don t I think she even knew his name until quite recently I know when she got to know him too It was just about the time that you first called here at the time of mister Bartle s death Our butler told me this morning that Pratt came here late one evening just about that time and asked to see my mother and was with her for some time in the study Oh what is it all about and why doesn t she tell me Collingwood stood silently staring out of the window At the time of Antony Bartle s death An evening visit evidently of a secret nature And why paid to missus Mallathorpe at that particular time He suddenly turned to Nesta What do you wish me to do he asked Will you speak to mister Eldrick she said Tell him that his clerk must not call upon or attempt to see my mother I will not have it Collingwood went off to Barford and straight to Eldrick s office He noticed as he passed through the outer rooms that Pratt was not in his accustomed place as a rule it was impossible to get at either Eldrick or Pascoe without first seeing Pratt Hullo said Eldrick Just got in from town That s lucky I ve got a big case for you I got in last night replied Collingwood But I went out to Normandale first thing this morning I ve just come back from there I say Eldrick here s an unpleasant matter to tell you of and he told the solicitor all that Nesta had just told him and also of Pratt s visit to missus Mallathorpe about the time of Antony Bartle s death Whatever it is he concluded sternly it s got to stop If you ve any influence over your clerk Eldrick made a grimace and waved his hand He s our clerk no longer he said He left us the week after you went up to town Collingwood He was only a weekly servant and he took advantage of that to give me a week s notice Now what game is Master Pratt playing He s smart and he s deep too He Just then an office boy announced mister Robson the Mallathorpe family solicitor a bustling rather rough and ready type of man who came into Eldrick s room looking not only angry but astonished He nodded to Collingwood and flung himself into a chair at the side of Eldrick s desk Look here Eldrick he exclaimed What on earth has that clerk of yours Pratt got to do with missus Mallathorpe Do you know what missus Mallathorpe has done Hang it she must be out of her senses or or there s something I can t fathom She s given your clerk Linford Pratt a power of attorney to deal with all her affairs and all her property Oh it s all right I tell you Pratt s been to my office and exhibited it to me as if as if he were the Lord Chancellor Eldrick turned to Collingwood and Collingwood to Eldrick and then both turned to Robson CHAPTER XIII THE FIRST TRICK The Mallathorpe family solicitor shook his head impatiently under those questioning glances It s not a bit of use appealing to me to know what it means he exclaimed I know no more than what I ve told you That chap walked into my office as bold as brass half an hour ago and exhibited to me a power of attorney all duly drawn up and stamped executed in his favour by missus Mallathorpe yesterday And as missus Mallathorpe is as far as I know in her senses why there you are What is it asked Eldrick A general power Or a special General answered Robson with an air of disgust Authorizes him to act for her in all business matters It means of course that that fellow now has full control over why a tremendous amount of money The estate of course is Miss Mallathorpe s he can t interfere with that But missus Mallathorpe shares equally with her daughter as regards the personal property of Harper Mallathorpe his share in the business and all that he left and what s more missus Mallathorpe is administratrix of the personal property She s simply placed in Pratt s hands an enormous power And for what reason Who on earth is Pratt what right title age or qualification has he to be entrusted with such a big affair I never knew of such a business in the whole course of my professional experiences Nor I agreed Eldrick But there s one thing in which you re mistaken Robson You ask what qualification Pratt has for a post of that sort Pratt s a very smart clever managing chap Oh of course He s your clerk retorted Robson a little sneeringly Naturally you ve a big idea of his abilities But He s not our clerk any longer said Eldrick He left us about a week ago I heard this morning that he s set up an office in Market Street in the Atlas Building and I wondered for what purpose Purpose of fleecing missus Mallathorpe I should say grumbled Robson Of course everything of hers must pass through his hands What on earth can her daughter have been thinking of to allow Stop a bit interrupted Eldrick Collingwood came in to tell me about that he s just come from Normandale Grange Miss Mallathorpe complains that Pratt called there yesterday in her absence That s probably when this power of attorney was signed But Miss Mallathorpe doesn t know anything of it she insists that Pratt shall not visit her mother Robson stirred impatiently in his chair That s all bosh he said She can t prevent it I saw missus Mallathorpe myself three days ago she s recovering very well and she s in her right senses and she s capable of doing business Her daughter can t prevent her from doing anything she likes And if she did what she liked yesterday when she signed that document why everybody s powerless except Pratt There s the question of how the document was obtained remarked Collingwood There may have been undue influence The two solicitors looked at each other Then Eldrick rose from his chair I ll tell you what I ll do he said It s no affair of mine but we employed Pratt for years and he ll confide in me I ll go and see him and ask him what it s all about Wait here a while you two He went out of his office and across into Market Street where the Atlas Building a modern range of offices and chambers towered above the older structures at its foot In the entrance hall a man was gilding the name of a new tenant on the address board that name was Pratt s and Eldrick presently found himself ascending in the lift to Pratt s quarters on the fifth floor Within five minutes of leaving Collingwood and Robson he was closeted with Pratt in a well furnished and appointed little office of two rooms the inner one of which was almost luxurious in its fittings And Pratt himself looked extremely well satisfied and confident and quite at his ease He wheeled forward an easy chair for his visitor and pushed a box of cigarettes towards him Glad to see you mister Eldrick he said with a cordial politeness which suggested however somehow that he and the solicitor were no longer master and servant How do you like my little place of business You re making a comfortable nest of it anyhow Pratt answered Eldrick looking round And what sort of business are you going to do pray Agency replied Pratt promptly It struck me some little time ago that a smart man like myself eh could do well here in Barford as an agent in a new sort of fashion attending to things for people who aren t fitted or inclined to do em for themselves or are rich enough to employ somebody to look after their affairs Of course that Normandale stewardship dropped out when young Harper died and I don t suppose the notion ll be revived now that his sister s come in But I ve got one good job to go on with missus Mallathorpe s given me her affairs to look after Eldrick took one of the cigarettes and lighted it as a sign of his peaceable and amicable intentions Pratt he said That s just what I ve come to see you about Unofficially mind in quite a friendly way It s like this and he went on to tell Pratt of what had just occurred at his own office So there you are he concluded I m saying nothing you know it s no affair of mine but if these people begin to say that you ve used any undue influence mister Collingwood and mister Robson and Miss Mallathorpe and anybody answered Pratt slowly and firmly had better mind what they are saying mister Eldrick There s such a thing as slander as you re well aware I m not the man to be slandered or libelled or to have my character defamed without fighting for my rights There has been no undue influence I went to see missus Mallathorpe yesterday at her own request The arrangement between me and her is made with her approval and free will If her daughter found her a bit upset it s because she d such a shock at the time of her son s death I did nothing to frighten her not I The fact is Miss Mallathorpe doesn t know that her mother and I have had a bit of business together of late And all that missus Mallathorpe has entrusted to me is the power to look after her affairs for her And why not You know that I m a good man of business a really good hand at commercial accountancy and well acquainted with the trade of this town You know too mister Eldrick that I m scrupulously honest I ve had many and many a thousand pounds of yours and your partner s through my hands Who s got anything to say against me I m only trying to earn an honest living Well well said Eldrick who being an easy going and kindly dispositioned man was somewhat inclined to side with his old clerk I suppose mister Robson thinks that if missus Mallathorpe wished to put her affairs in anybody s hands she should have put them in his He s their family solicitor you know Pratt while you re a young man with no claim on missus Mallathorpe Pratt smiled a queer knowing smile and reached out his hand to some papers which lay on his desk You re wrong there mister Eldrick he said But of course you don t know I didn t know myself nor did missus Mallathorpe until lately But I have a claim and a good one to get a business lift from missus Mallathorpe I m a relation What of the Mallathorpe family exclaimed Eldrick whose legal mind was at once bitten by notion of kinship and succession and who knew that Harper Mallathorpe was supposed to have no male relatives at all of any degree You don t mean it No but of hers missus Mallathorpe answered Pratt My mother was her cousin I found that out by mere chance and when I d found it I worked out the facts from our parish church register They re all here fairly copied missus Mallathorpe has seen them So I have some claim even if it s only that of a poor relation Eldrick took the sheets of foolscap which Pratt handed to him and looked them over with interest and curiosity He was something of an expert in such matters and had helped to edit a print more than once of the local parish registers He soon saw from a hasty examination of the various entries of marriages and births that Pratt was quite right in what he said I call it a poor and a mean game remarked Pratt while his old master was thus occupied a very mean game indeed of well to do folk like mister Collingwood and mister Robson to want to injure me in a matter which is no business of theirs I shall do my duty by missus Mallathorpe you yourself know I m fully competent to do it and I shall fully earn the percentage that she ll pay me What right have these people what right has her daughter to come between me and my living Oh well well said Eldrick as he handed back the papers and rose It s one of those matters that hasn t been understood You made a mistake you know Pratt when you went to see missus Mallathorpe yesterday in her daughter s absence You shouldn t have done that Pratt pulled open a drawer and after turning over some loose papers picked out a letter Do you know missus Mallathorpe s handwriting he asked Very well there it is Isn t that a request from her that I should call on her yesterday afternoon Very well then Eldrick looked at the letter with some surprise He had a good memory and he remembered that Collingwood had told him that Nesta had said that Pratt had gone to Normandale Grange seen Esther Mawson and told her that it was absolutely necessary for him to see missus Mallathorpe And though Eldrick was naturally unsuspicious an idea flashed across his mind had Pratt got missus Mallathorpe to write that letter while he was there yesterday and brought it away with him I think there s a good deal of misunderstanding he said mister Collingwood says that you went there and told her maid that it was absolutely necessary for you to see her mistress sort of forced yourself in you see Pratt Nothing of the sort retorted Pratt He flourished the letter in his hand Doesn t it say there in missus Mallathorpe s own handwriting that she particularly desires to see me at three o clock It does Then it was absolutely necessary for me to see her Come now And mister Collingwood had best attend to his own business What s he got to do with all this After Miss Mallathorpe and her money I should think that s about it Eldrick said another soothing word or two and went back to his own office He was considerably mystified by certain things but inclined to be satisfied about others and in giving an account of what had just taken place he unconsciously seemed to take Pratt s side much to Robson s disgust and to Collingwood s astonishment You can t get over this you know Robson said Eldrick Pratt went there yesterday by appointment went at missus Mallathorpe s own express desire made in her own handwriting And it s quite certain that what he says about the relationship is true I examined the proof myself It s not unnatural that missus Mallathorpe should desire to do something for her own cousin s son To that extent sneered Robson Bless me you talk as if it were no more than presenting him with a twenty pound note instead of its being what it is giving him the practical control of many a thousand pounds every year There ll be more heard of this yet He went away angrier than when he came and Eldrick looked at Collingwood and shook his head I don t see what more there is to do he said So far as I can make out or see Pratt is within his rights If missus Mallathorpe liked to entrust her business to him what is to prevent it I see nothing at all strange in that But there is a fact which does seem uncommonly strange to me It s this how is it that missus Mallathorpe doesn t consult hasn t consulted doesn t inform hasn t informed her daughter about all this That answered Collingwood is precisely what strikes me and I can t give any explanation Nor I believe can Miss Mallathorpe He felt obliged to go back to Normandale and tell Nesta the result of the afternoon s proceedings And having seen during his previous visit how angry she could be he was not surprised to see her become angrier and more determined than ever I will not have mister Pratt coming here she exclaimed He shall not see my mother under my roof at any rate I don t believe she sent for him mister Eldrick saw her letter interrupted Collingwood quietly Then that man made her write it while he was here exclaimed Nesta As to the relationship it may be so I never heard of it But I don t care what relation he is to my mother he is not going to interfere with her affairs The strange thing said Collingwood as pointedly as was consistent with kindness is that your mother just now at any rate doesn t seem to be taking you into her confidence Nesta looked steadily at him for a moment without speaking When she did speak it was with decision Quite so she said She is keeping something from me And if she won t tell me things well I must find them out for myself She would say no more than that and Collingwood left her And as he went back to Barford he cursed Linford Pratt soundly for a deep and underhand rogue who was most certainly playing some fine game But Pratt himself was quite satisfied up to that point He had won his first trick and he had splendid cards still left in his hand And he was reckoning his chances on them one morning a little later when a ring at his bell summoned him to his office door whereat stood Nesta Mallathorpe alone CHAPTER XIV CARDS ON THE TABLE Had any third person been present closely to observe the meeting of these two young people he would have seen that the one to whom it was unexpected and a surprise was outwardly as calm and self possessed as if the other had come there to keep an ordinary business appointment Nesta Mallathorpe looking very dignified and almost stately in her mourning was obviously angry indignant and agitated But Pratt was as cool and as fully at his ease as if he were back in Eldrick s office receiving the everyday ordinary client He swept his door open and executed his politest bow and was clever enough to pretend that he saw nothing of his visitor s agitation Yet deep within himself he felt more tremors than one and it needed all his powers of dissimulation to act and speak as if this were the most usual of occurrences Good morning Miss Mallathorpe he said You wish to see me Come into my private office if you please I haven t fixed on a clerk yet he went on as he led his visitor through the outer room and to the easy chair by his desk I have several applications from promising aspirants but I have to be careful you know Miss Mallathorpe it s a position of confidence And now he concluded as he closed the door upon Nesta and himself how is missus Mallathorpe today Improving I hope Nesta made no reply to these remarks or to the question And instead of taking the easy chair which Eldrick had found so comfortable she went to one which stood against the wall opposite Pratt s desk and seated herself in it in as upright a position as the wall behind her I wish to speak to you plainly she said as Pratt who now regarded her somewhat doubtfully realizing that he was in for business of a serious nature sat down at his desk I want to ask you a plain question and I expect a plain answer Why are you blackmailing my mother Pratt shook his head as if he felt more sorrow than anger He glanced deprecatingly at his visitor I think you ll be sorry on reflection that you said that Miss Mallathorpe he answered You re a little shall we say upset A little shall we say angry If you were calmer you wouldn t say such things you wouldn t use such a term as blackmailing It s dear me I dare say you don t know it it s actionable If I were that sort of man Miss Mallathorpe and you said that of me before witnesses ah I don t know what mightn t happen However I m not that sort of man But don t say it again if you please If you don t answer my question and at once said Nesta whose cheeks were pale with angry determination I shall say it again in a fashion you won t like not to you but to the police Pratt smiled a quiet strange smile which made his visitor feel a sudden sense of fear And again he shook his head slowly and deprecatingly Oh no he said gently That s a bigger mistake than the other Miss Mallathorpe The police Oh not the police I think Miss Mallathorpe You see other people than you might go to the police about something else Nesta s anger cooled down under that scarcely veiled threat The sight of Pratt of his self assurance his comfortable offices his general atmosphere of almost sleek satisfaction had roused her temper already strained to breaking point But that smile and the quiet look which accompanied his last words warned her that anger was mere foolishness and that she was in the presence of a man who would have to be dealt with calmly if the dealings were to be successful Yet she repeated her words but this time in a different tone I shall certainly go to the police authorities she said unless I get some proper explanation from you I shall have no option You are forcing or have forced my mother to enter into some strange arrangements with you and I can t think it is for anything but what I say blackmail You ve got or you think you ve got some hold on her Now what is it I mean to know one way or another Miss Mallathorpe said Pratt You re taking a wrong course with me Now who advised you to come here and speak to me like this as if I were a common criminal mister Collingwood no doubt Or perhaps mister Robson Now if either Neither mister Robson nor mister Collingwood know anything whatever about my coming here retorted Nesta No one knows I am quite competent to manage my own affairs of this sort I want to know why my mother has been forced into that arrangement with you for I am sure you have forced her If you will not tell me why then I shall do what I said You ll go to the police authorities asked Pratt Ah but let us consider things a little Miss Mallathorpe Now to start with who says there has been any forcing I know one person who won t say so and that s your mother herself Nesta felt unable to answer that assertion And Pratt smiled triumphantly and went on She ll tell you missus Mallathorpe ll tell you that she s very pleased indeed to have my poor services he said She knows that I shall serve her well She s glad to do a kind service to a poor relation And since I am your mother s relation Miss Mallathorpe I m yours too I m some degree of cousin to you You might think rather better rather more kindly of me Are you going to tell me anything more than that asked Nesta steadily Pratt shrugged his shoulders and waved his hands What more can I tell he asked The fact is there s a business arrangement between me and your mother and you object to it Well I m sorry but I ve my own interests to consider Are you going to tell me what it was that induced my mother to sign that paper you got from her the other day asked Nesta Can I say more than that it was a business arrangement pleaded Pratt There s nothing unusual in one party in a business arrangement giving a power of attorney to another party Nothing Very well said Nesta rising from the straight backed chair and looking very rigid herself as she stood up You won t tell me anything So I am now going to the police I don t know what they ll do I don t know what they can do But I can tell them what I think and feel about this at any rate For as sure as I am that I see you there s something wrong And I ll know what it is Pratt recognized that she had passed beyond the stage of mere anger to one of calm determination And as she marched towards the door he called her back as the result of a second s swift thought on his part Miss Mallathorpe he said Oblige me by sitting down again I m not in the least afraid of your going to the police But my experience is that if one goes to them on errands of this sort it sets all sorts of things going scandal and suspicion and I don t know what You don t want any scandal Sit down if you please and let us think for a moment And I ll see if I can tell you what you want to know Nesta already had a hand on the door But after looking at him for a second or two she turned back and sat down in her old position And Pratt still seated at his desk plunged his hands in his trousers pockets tilted back his chair and for five minutes stared with knitted brows at his blotting pad A queer silence fell on the room The windows were double sashed no sound came up from the busy street below But on the mantelpiece a cheap Geneva clock ticked and ticked and Nesta felt at last that if it went on much longer without the accompaniment of a human voice she should suddenly snatch it up and hurl it anywhere Pratt was in the position of the card player who confronted by a certain turn in the course of a game which he himself feels sure he is bound to win wonders whether he had better not expedite matters by laying his cards on the table and asking his opponent if he can possibly beat their values and combination He had carefully reckoned up his own position more than once during the progress of recent events and the more carefully he calculated it the more he felt convinced that he had nothing to fear He had had to alter his ground in consequence of the death of Harper Mallathorpe and he had known that he would have to fight Nesta But he had not anticipated that hostilities would come so soon or begin with such evident determination on her part How would it be then at this first stage to make such a demonstration in force that she would recognize his strength He looked up at last and saw Nesta regarding him sternly But Pratt smiled the quiet smile which made her uneasy Miss Mallathorpe he said I was thinking of two things just then a game at cards and the science of warfare In both it s a good thing sometimes to let your adversary see what a strong hand you ve got Now then a question if you please are you and I adversaries Yes answered Nesta unflinchingly You re acting like an enemy you are an enemy I ve hoped that you and I would be friends good friends said Pratt with something like a sigh And if I may say so I ve no feeling of enmity towards you When I speak of us being adversaries I mean it in well let s say a sort of legal sense But now I ll show you my hand that is as far as I please Will you listen quietly to me I ve no choice replied Nesta bluntly And I came here to know what you ve got to say for yourself Say it Pratt moved his chair a little nearer to his visitor Now he said speaking very quietly and deliberately I ll go through what I have to say to you carefully point by point I shall ask you to go back a little way It is now some time since I discovered a secret about your mother missus Mallathorpe Ah you start it may be with indignation but I assure you I m telling you and am going to tell you the absolute truth I say a secret No one knows it but myself not one living soul Except of course your mother I shall not reveal it to you under any consideration or in any circumstances but I can tell you this if that secret were revealed your mother would be ruined for life and you yourself would suffer in more ways than one Nesta looked at him incredulously and yet she began to feel he was telling some truth And Pratt shook his head at the incredulous expression It s quite so he said You ll begin to believe it from other things Now it was in connection with this that I paid a visit to Normandale Grange one evening some months ago Perhaps you never heard of that I was alone with your mother for some time in the study I have heard of it she answered Very good said Pratt But you haven t heard that your mother came to see me at my rooms here in Barford my lodgings the very next night On the same business of course But she did I know how she came too Secretly heavily veiled naturally she didn t want anybody to know Are you beginning to see something in it Miss Mallathorpe Go on with your story answered Nesta I go on then to the day before your brother s death continued Pratt Namely a certain Friday Now if you please I ll invite you to listen carefully to certain facts which are indisputable which I can prove easily On that Friday the day before your brother s death missus Mallathorpe was in the shrubbery at Normandale Grange which is near the north end of the old foot bridge She was approached by Hoskins an old woodman who has been on the estate a great many years you know him well enough Hoskins told missus Mallathorpe that the foot bridge between the north and south shrubberies spanning the cut which was made there a long time since so that a nearer road could be made to the stables was in an extremely dangerous condition so dangerous in fact that in his opinion it would collapse under even a moderate weight I impress this fact upon you strongly Well said Nesta Hoskins Pratt went on urged upon missus Mallathorpe the necessity of having the bridge closed at once or barricaded He pointed out to her from where they stood certain places in the bridge and in the railing on one side of it which already sagged in such a fashion that he as a man of experience knew that planks and railings were literally rotten with damp Now what did missus Mallathorpe do She said nothing to Hoskins except that she d have the thing seen to But she immediately went to the estate carpenter s shop and there she procured two short lengths of chain and two padlocks and she herself went back to the foot bridge and secured its wicket gates at both ends I beg you will bear that in mind too Miss Mallathorpe I am bearing everything in mind said Nesta resolutely Don t be afraid that I shall forget one word that you say I hear that sneer in your voice answered Pratt as he turned unlocked a drawer and drew out some papers But I think you will soon learn that the sneer at what I m telling you is foolish missus Mallathorpe had a set purpose in locking up those gates as you will see presently You will see it from what I am now going to tell you Oblige me if you please by looking at that letter Do you recognize your mother s handwriting Yes admitted Nesta with a sudden feeling of apprehension That is her writing Very good said Pratt Then before I read it to you I ll just tell you what this letter is It formed when it was written an invitation from missus Mallathorpe to me an invitation to walk innocently into what she knew knew mind you to be a death trap She meant me to fall through the bridge CHAPTER XV PRATT OFFERS A HAND For a full moment of tense silence Nesta and Pratt looked at each other across the letter which he held in his outstretched hand looked steadily and with a certain amount of stern inquiry And it was Nesta s eyes which first gave way beaten by the certainty in Pratt s She looked aside her cheeks flamed she felt as if something were rising in her throat to choke her I can t believe that she muttered You re mistaken Oh utterly mistaken No mistake said Pratt confidently I tell you your mother meant me me to meet my death at that bridge Here s the proof in this letter I ll tell you first when I received it then I ll read you what s in it and if you doubt my reading of it you shall read it yourself but it won t go out of my hands And first as to my getting it for that s important It reached me by registered post mind you on the Saturday morning on which your brother met his death It was handed in at Normandale village post office for registration late on the Friday afternoon And by whom do you think I don t know replied Nesta faintly This merciless piling up of details was beginning to frighten her already she felt as if she herself were some criminal forced to listen from the dock to the opening address of a prosecuting counsel How should I know how can I think It was handed in for registration by your mother s maid Esther Mawson said Pratt with a dark look I ve got her evidence anyway And that was all part of a plan just as a certain something that was enclosed was a part of the same plan a plot And now I ll read you the letter and you ll bear it in mind that I got it by first post that Saturday morning This is what it what your mother says I particularly wish to see you again at once about the matter between us and to have another look at that document Can you come here bringing it with you tomorrow Saturday afternoon by the train which leaves soon after two o clock As I am most anxious that your visit should be private and unknown to any one here do not come to the house Take the path across the park to the shrubberies near the house so that if you are met people would think you were taking a near cut to the village I will meet you in the shrubbery on the house side of the little foot bridge The gates Pratt suddenly paused and before proceeding looked hard at his visitor Now listen to what follows and bear in mind what your mother knew and had done at the time she wrote this letter This is how the letter goes on let every word fix itself in your mind Miss Mallathorpe The gates of the foot bridge are locked but the enclosed keys will open them I will meet you amongst the trees on the further side Be sure to come and to bring that document I have something to say about it on seeing it again Pratt turned to the drawer from which he had taken the letter and took out two small keys evidently belonging to patent padlocks He held them up before Nesta There they are he said triumphantly Been in my possession ever since and will remain there Now do you wish to read the letter I ve read it to you word for word You don t Very good back it goes in there with these keys And now then he continued having replaced letter and keys in his drawer and turned to her again now then you see what a diabolical scheme it was that was in your mother s mind against me She meant me to meet with the fate which overtook her own son She meant me to fall through that bridge Why She hoped that I should break my neck as he did She wanted to silence me but she also wanted more she wanted to take from my dead body or my unconscious body the certain something which she was so anxious I should bring with me which she referred to as that document She was willing to risk anything even to murder to get hold of that And now you know why I went to Normandale Grange that Saturday you know now the real reason I told a deliberate lie at the inquest for your mother s sake for your sake if you know it I did not go there to hand in my application for the stewardship I went in response to the letter I ve just read Is all this clear to you Nesta could only move her head in silent acquiescence She was already convinced that whether all this was entirely true or not there was truth of some degree in what Pratt had told her And she was thinking of her mother and of the trap which she certainly appeared to have laid and of her brother s fate and for the moment she felt sick and beaten But Pratt went on in that cold calculating voice telling his story point by point Now I come to what happened that Saturday afternoon he said I may as well tell you that in my own interest I have carefully collected certain evidence which never came out at the inquest which indeed has nothing to do with the exact matter of the inquest Now that Saturday your mother and you had lunch together your brother as we shall see in a moment being away at your lunch time a quarter to two About twenty minutes past two your mother left the house She went out into the gardens She left the gardens for the shrubberies And at twenty five minutes to three she was seen by one of your gardeners Featherstone in what was of course hiding amongst the trees at the end of the north shrubbery What was she doing there Miss Mallathorpe She was waiting waiting until a certain hoped for accident happened to me Then she would come out of her hiding place in the hope of getting that document from my pocket Do you see how cleverly she d laid her plans murderous plans Nesta was making a great effort to be calm She knew now that she was face to face with some awful mystery which could only be solved by patience and strenuous endeavour She knew too that she must show no sign of fear before this man Will you finish your story if you please she asked In my own way in my own time answered Pratt I now come to your mother On the Friday noon the late mister Harper Mallathorpe went to Barford to visit a friend young Stemthwaite at the Hollies He was to stay the night there and was not expected home until Saturday evening He did stay the night and remained in Barford until noon on Saturday but he unexpectedly returned to the house at half past two And almost as soon as he d got in he picked up a gun and strolled out into the gardens and the north shrubbery And as you know he went to the foot bridge You see Miss Mallathorpe your mother clever as she was had forgotten one detail the gates of that footbridge were merely low four barred things and there was nothing to prevent an active young man from climbing them She forgot another thing too that warning had not been given at the house that the bridge was dangerous And of course she d never never calculated that your brother would return sooner than he was expected or that on his return he d go where he did And so but I ll spare you any reference to what happened Only you know now how it was that missus Mallathorpe was found by her son s body She d been waiting about for me But the fate she d meant for me was dealt out to him In spite of herself Nesta gave way to a slight cry I can t bear any more of that she said Have you finished There s not much more to say now at any rate replied Pratt And what I have to say shall be to the point I m sorry enough to have been obliged to say all that I have said But you know you forced me to it You threatened me The real truth Miss Mallathorpe is just this you don t understand me at all You come here excuse my plain speech hectoring and bullying me with talk about the police and blackmail and I don t know what It s I who ought to go to the police I could have your mother arrested and put in the dock on a charge of attempted murder this very day I ve got all the proofs I suppose you held that out as a threat to her when you forced her to sign that power of attorney observed Nesta For the first time since her arrival Pratt looked at his visitor in an unfriendly fashion His expression changed and his face flushed a little You think that do you he said Well you re wrong I m not a fool I held out no such threat I didn t even tell your mother what I d found out I wasn t going to show her my hand all at once though I ve shown you a good deal of it Not all she asked quickly Not all answered Pratt with a meaning glance To use more metaphors I ve several cards up my sleeve Miss Mallathorpe But you re utterly wrong about the threats I ll tell you I don t mind that how I got the authority you re speaking about Your mother had promised me that stewardship for life I d have been a good steward But we recognized that your brother s death had altered things that you being as she said a self willed young woman you see how plain I am would insist on looking after your own affairs So she gave me another post I ll discharge its duties honestly Yes said Nesta but you ve already told me that you d a hold on my mother before any of these recent events happened and that you possess some document which she was anxious to get into her hands So it comes to this you ve a double hold on her according to your story Just so agreed Pratt You re right I have a double hold Nesta looked at him silently for a while Pratt looked at her Very well she said at last How much do you want to be bought out Pratt laughed I thought that would be the end of it he remarked Yes I thought so Name your price said Nesta Miss Mallathorpe answered Pratt bending forward and speaking with a new earnestness Just listen to me It s no good I m not to be bought out Your mother tried that game with me before She offered me first five then ten thousand pounds cash down for that document when she came to see me at my rooms I dare say she d have gone to twenty thousand and found the money there and then But I said no then and I say no to you I m not to be purchased in that way I ve my own ideas my own plans my own ambitions my own hopes It s not any use at all for you to dangle your money before me But I ll suggest something else that you can do Nesta made no answer She continued to look steadily at the man who evidently had her mother in his power and Pratt who was watching her intently went on speaking quietly but with some intensity of tone You can do this he said To start with and it ll go a long way just try and think better of me I told you you don t understand me Try to I m not a bad lot I ve great abilities I m a hard worker Eldrick Pascoe could tell you that I m scrupulously honest in money matters You ll see that I ll look after your mother s affairs in a fashion that ll commend itself to any firm of auditors and accountants who may look into my accounts every year I m only taking the salary from her that I was to have had for the stewardship So why not leave it at that Let things be Perhaps in time you ll come to see that I m to be trusted How can I trust a man who deliberately tells me that he holds a secret and a document over a woman s head demanded Nesta You ve admitted a previous hold on my mother You say you re in possession of a secret that would ruin her quite apart from recent events Is that honest It was none of my seeking retorted Pratt I gained the knowledge by accident You re giving yourself away said Nesta Or you ve some mental twist or defect which prevents you from seeing things straight It s not how you got your knowledge but the use you re making of it that s the important thing You re using it to force my mother to Excuse me interrupted Pratt with a queer smile It s you who don t see things straight I m using my knowledge to protect all of you Let your mind go back to what was said at first to what I said at first I said that I d discovered a secret which if revealed would ruin your mother and injure you So it would more than ever now So you see in keeping it I m taking care not only of her interests but of yours Nesta rose She realized that there was no more to be said or done And Pratt rose too and looked at her almost appealingly I wish you d try to see things as I ve put them Miss Mallathorpe he said I don t bear malice against your mother for that scheme she contrived I m willing to put it clear out of my head Why not accept things as they are I ll keep that secret for ever no one shall ever know about it Why not be friends now why not shake hands He held out his hand as he spoke But Nesta drew back No she said My opinion is just what it was when I came here Before Pratt could move she had turned swiftly to the door and let herself out and in another minute she was amongst the crowds in the street below For a few minutes she walked in the direction of Robson s offices but when she had nearly reached them she turned and went deliberately to those of Eldrick Pascoe CHAPTER XVI A HEADQUARTERS CONFERENCE By the time she had been admitted to Eldrick s private room Nesta had regained her composure she had also had time to think and her present action was the result of at any rate a part of her thoughts She was calm and collected enough when she took the chair which the solicitor drew forward I called on you for two reasons mister Eldrick she said First to thank you for your kindness and thoughtfulness at the time of my brother s death in sending your clerk to help in making the arrangements Very glad he was of any assistance Miss Mallathorpe answered Eldrick I thought of course that as he had been on the spot as it were when the accident happened he could do a few little things He was very useful in that way said Nesta And I was very much obliged to him But the second reason for my call is I want to speak to you about him Yes responded Eldrick He had already formed some idea as to what was in his visitor s mind and he was secretly glad of the opportunity of talking to her About Pratt eh What about him Miss Mallathorpe He was with you for some years I believe she asked A good many years answered Eldrick He came to us as office boy and was head clerk when he left us Then you ought to know him well she suggested As to that replied Eldrick there are some people in this world whom other people never could know well that s to say really well I know Pratt well enough for what he was our clerk Privately I know little about him He s clever he s ability he s a chap who reads a good deal he s got ambitions And I should say he is a bit subtle Deceitful she asked I couldn t say that replied Eldrick It wouldn t be true if I said so I think he s possibilities of strategy in him But so far as we re concerned we found him hardworking energetic truthful dependable and honest and absolutely to be trusted in money matters He s had many and many a thousand pounds of ours through his hands I believe you re unaware that my mother for some reason or other unknown to me has put him in charge of her affairs asked Nesta Yes mister Collingwood told me so answered Eldrick So too did your own solicitor mister Robson who s very angry about it And you she said putting a direct question What do you think Do please tell me It s difficult to say Miss Mallathorpe replied Eldrick with a smile and a shake of the head If your mother who of course is quite competent to decide for herself wishes to have somebody to look after her affairs I don t see what objection can be taken to her procedure And if she chooses to put Linford Pratt in that position why not As I tell you I as his last and only employer am quite convinced of his abilities and probity I suppose that as your mother s agent he ll supervise her property collect money due to her advise her in investments and so on Well I should say personally mind he s quite competent to do all that and that he ll do it honestly I should certainly say so But why should he do it at all asked Nesta Eldrick waved his hands Ah he exclaimed Now you ask me a very different question But I understand in fact I know that Pratt turns out to be a relation of yours distant but it s there Perhaps your mother who of course is much better off since your brother s sad death is desirous of benefiting Pratt as a relation Do you advise anything asked Nesta Well you know Miss Mallathorpe replied Eldrick smiling I m not your legal adviser What about mister Robson mister Robson is so very angry about all this with my mother said Nesta that I don t even want to ask his advice What I really do want is the advice counsel of somebody perhaps more as a friend than as a solicitor Delighted to give you any help I can either professionally or as a friend exclaimed Eldrick But let me suggest something And first of all is there anything something in all this that you haven t told to anybody yet Yes much she answered A great deal Then said Eldrick let me advise a certain counsel Two heads are better than one Let me ask mister Collingwood to come here He was watching his visitor narrowly as he said this and he saw a faint rise of colour in her cheeks But for the moment she did not answer and Eldrick saw that she was thinking I can get him across from his chambers in a few minutes he said He s sure to be in just now Can I have a few minutes to decide asked Nesta Eldrick jumped up Of course he said I ll leave you a while It so happens I want to see my partner I ll go up to his room and return to you presently Nesta left alone gave herself up to deep thought and to a careful reckoning of her position She was longing to confide in some trustworthy person or persons for Pratt s revelations had plunged her into a maze of perplexity But her difficulties were many First of all she would have to tell all about the terrible charge brought by Pratt against her mother Then about the second which he professed to or probably did hold What sort of a secret could it be And supposing her advisers suggested strong measures against Pratt what then about the danger to her mother in a twofold direction Would it be better wiser if she kept all this to herself at present and waited for events to develop But at the mere thought of that she shrank feeling mentally and physically afraid to keep all that knowledge to herself to brood over it in secret to wonder what it all meant what lay beneath what might develop that was more than she felt able to bear And when Eldrick came back she looked at him and nodded I should like to talk to you and mister Collingwood she said quietly Collingwood came across to Eldrick s office at once And to these two Nesta unbosomed herself of every detail that she could remember of her interview with Pratt and as she went on from one thing to another she saw the men s faces grow graver and graver and realized that this was a more anxious matter than she had thought That s all she said in the end I don t think I ve forgotten anything And even now I don t know if I ve done right to tell you all this But I don t think I could have faced it alone My dear Miss Mallathorpe said Eldrick earnestly You ve done the wisest thing you probably ever did in your life Now he went on looking at Collingwood just let us all three realize what is to me a more important fact Nobody would be more astonished than Pratt to know that you have taken the wise step you have You agree Collingwood Yes answered Collingwood after a moment s reflection I think so Miss Mallathorpe doesn t quite see what we mean said Eldrick turning to Nesta We mean that Pratt firmly believed when he told you what he did that for your mother s sake and your own you would keep his communication a dead secret He firmly believed that you would never dare to tell anybody what he told you Most people in your position wouldn t have told They d have let the secret eat their lives out You re a wise and a sensible young woman And the thing is we must let Pratt remain under the impression that you are keeping your knowledge to yourself Let him continue to believe that you ll remain silent under fear And let us meet his secret policy with a secret strategy of our own Again he glanced at Collingwood and again Collingwood nodded assent Now continued Eldrick just let us consider matters for a few minutes from the position which has newly arisen To begin with Pratt s account of your mother s dealings about the foot bridge is a very clever and plausible one I can see quite well that it has caused you great pain so before I go any further just let me say this to you don t you attach one word of importance to it Nesta uttered a heartfelt cry of relief Oh she exclaimed If you knew how thankful I should be to know that it s all lies that he was lying Can I really think that after what I saw I won t ask you to think that he s telling lies just now answered Eldrick with a glance at Collingwood but I ll ask you to believe that your mother could put a totally different aspect and complexion on all her actions and words in connection with the entire affair My impression of course he went on with something very like a wink at Collingwood is that missus Mallathorpe when she wrote that letter to Pratt intended to have the bridge mended first thing next morning and that something prevented that being done and that when she was seen about the shrubberies in the afternoon she was on her way to meet Pratt before he could reach the dangerous point so that she could warn him What do you say Collingwood I should say answered Collingwood regarding the solicitor earnestly and speaking with great gravity of manner that that would make an admirable line of defence to any charge which Pratt was wicked enough to prefer You don t think my mother meant meant to exclaimed Nesta eagerly turning from one man to the other You don t There is no evidence worth twopence against your mother replied Eldrick soothingly Put everything that Pratt has said against her clear out of your mind Put all recent events out of your mind Don t interfere with Pratt just now The thing to be done about Pratt is this and it s the only thing We must find out exactly as secretly as possible what this secret is of which he speaks What is this hold on missus Mallathorpe What is this document to which he refers In other words we must work back to some point which at present we can t see At least I can t see it But we may discover it What do you say Collingwood I agree entirely answered Collingwood Let Pratt rest in his fancied security The thing is certainly to go back But to what point That we must consider later said Eldrick Now for the present Miss Mallathorpe you are I suppose going back home Yes at once answered Nesta I have my car at the Crown Hotel I should just like to know something continued Eldrick again looking at Collingwood as if for approval That is missus Mallathorpe s present disposition towards affairs in general and Pratt in particular Miss Mallathorpe just do something which I will now suggest to you When you reach home see your mother she is still I understand an invalid though evidently able to transact business Just approach her gently and kindly and tell her that you are a little should we say uncomfortable about certain business arrangements which you hear she has made with mister Pratt and ask her if she won t talk them over with you and give you her full confidence It s now half past twelve continued Eldrick looking at his watch You ll be home before lunch See your mother early in the afternoon and then telephone briefly the result to me here at four o clock Then mister Collingwood and I will have a consultation He motioned Collingwood to remain where he was and himself saw Nesta down to the street When he came back to his room he shook his head at the young barrister Collingwood he said There s some dreadful business afloat in all this And it s all the worse because of the fashion in which Pratt talked to that girl She s evidently a very good memory she narrated that conversation clearly and fully Pratt must be very sure of his hand if he showed her his cards in that way his very confidence in himself shows what a subtle network he s either made or is making I question if he d very much care if he knew that we know But he mustn t know that yet We must reply to his mine with a counter mine What do you think of Pratt s charge against missus Mallathorpe asked Collingwood Eldrick made a wry face Looks bad very very bad Collingwood he answered Art and scheme of a desperate woman of course But we mustn t let her daughter think we believe it Let her stick to the suggestion I made which as you remarked would certainly make a very good line of defence supposing Pratt even did accuse her But now what on earth is this document that s been mentioned this paper of which Pratt has possession Has missus Mallathorpe at some time committed forgery or bigamy or what is it One thing s sure however we ve got to work quietly We mustn t let Pratt know that we re working I hope he doesn t know that Miss Mallathorpe came here Will you come back about four and hear what message she sends me After that we could consult Collingwood went away to his chambers He was much occupied just then and had little time to think of anything but the work in hand But as he ate his lunch at the club which he had joined on settling in Barford he tried to get at some notion of the state of things and once more his mind reverted to the time of his grandfather s death and his own suspicions about Pratt at that period Clearly that was a point to which they must hark back he himself must make more inquiries about the circumstances of Antony Bartle s last hours For this affair would not have to rest where it was it was intolerable that Nesta Mallathorpe should in any way be under Pratt s power He went back to Eldrick at four o clock with a suggestion or two in his mind And at the sight of him Eldrick shook his head I ve had that telephone message from Normandale he said five minutes ago Pretty much what I expected at this juncture anyway missus Mallathorpe absolutely declines to talk business with even her daughter at present and earnestly desires that mister Linford Pratt may be left alone Well asked Collingwood after a pause What now We must do what we can secretly privately for the daughter s sake said Eldrick I confess I don t quite see a beginning but Just then the private door opened and Pascoe a somewhat lackadaisical mannered man who always looked half asleep and was in reality remarkably wide awake lounged in nodded to Collingwood and threw a newspaper in front of his partner I say Eldrick he drawled as he removed a newly lighted cigar from his lips There s an advertisement here which seems to refer to that precious protege of yours who left you with such scant ceremony Same name anyhow Eldrick snatched up the paper glanced at it and read a few words aloud INFORMATION WANTED about James Parrawhite at one time in practice as a solicitor CHAPTER XVII ADVERTISEMENT Eldrick looked up at his partner with a sharp confirmatory glance That s our Parrawhite of course he said Who s after him now And he went on to read the rest of the advertisement murmuring its phraseology half aloud in practice as a solicitor at Nottingham and who left that town six years ago If the said James Parrawhite will communicate with the undersigned he will hear something greatly to his advantage Any person able to give information as to his whereabouts will be suitably rewarded Apply to Halstead Byner fifty sixB saint Martin s Chambers London W C Um Pascoe hand over that Law List Collingwood looked on in silence while Eldrick turned over the pages of the big book which his partner took down from a shelf He wondered at Eldrick s apparent and almost eager interest Halstead Byner are not solicitors announced Eldrick presently They must be inquiry agents or something of that sort Anyway I ll write to them Pascoe at once You don t know where the fellow is said Pascoe What s the good No but we know where he last was retorted Eldrick He turned to Collingwood as the junior partner sauntered out of the room Rather odd that Pascoe should draw my attention to that just now he remarked This man Parrawhite was in a certain sense mixed up with Pratt at least Pratt and I are the only two people who know the secret of Parrawhite s disappearance from these offices That was just about the time of your grandfather s death Collingwood immediately became attentive His first suspicions of Pratt were formed at the time of which Eldrick spoke and any reference to events contemporary excited his interest Who was or is this man you re talking of he asked Bad lot very answered Eldrick shaking his head He and I were articled together at the same time to the same people we saw a lot of each other as fellow articled clerks He afterwards practised in Nottingham and he held some good appointments But he d a perfect mania for gambling the turf and he went utterly wrong and misappropriated clients money and in the end he got into prison and was of course struck off the rolls I never heard anything of him for years and then one day some time ago he turned up here and begged me to give him a job I did and I ll do him the credit to say that he earned his money But in the end his natural badness broke out One afternoon I m careless about some things I left some money lying in this drawer about forty pounds in notes and gold and next morning Parrawhite never came to business We ve never seen or heard of him since You mentioned Pratt said Collingwood Only Pratt and I know about the money replied Eldrick We kept it secret I didn t want Pascoe to know I d been so careless Pascoe didn t like Parrawhite and he doesn t know his record I only told him that Parrawhite was a chap I d known in better circumstances and wanted to give a hand to You said it was about the time of my grandfather s death asked Collingwood It was just about then between his death and his funeral I should say answered Eldrick The two events are associated in my mind Anyway I d like to know what it is that these people want Parrawhite for If it s money that s come to him it ll be of no advantage it ll only go where all the rest s gone Collingwood lost interest in Parrawhite Parrawhite appeared to have nothing to do with the affairs in which he was interested He sat down and began to tell Eldrick about his own suspicions of Pratt at the time of Antony Bartle s death of what Jabey Naylor had told him about the paper taken from the History of Barford of the lad s account of the old man s doings immediately afterwards and of his own proceedings which had led him to believe for the time being that his suspicions were groundless But now he went on a new idea occurs to me Suppose that that paper found by my grandfather in a book which had certainly belonged to the late John Mallathorpe was something important relating to missus Mallathorpe Suppose that my grandfather brought it across here to you Suppose that finding you out he showed it to Pratt As my grandfather died suddenly with nobody but Pratt there what was there to prevent Pratt from appropriating that paper if he saw that it would give him a hold over missus Mallathorpe We know now that he has some document in his possession which does give him a hold may it not be that of which the boy Naylor told me Might be agreed Eldrick But my opinion is taking things all together that the paper which Antony Bartle found was the one you yourself discovered later the list of books No I ll tell you what I think I believe that the document which Pratt told Miss Mallathorpe he holds and to which her mother referred in the letter asking Pratt to meet her is probably most probably one which he discovered in searching out his relationship to missus Mallathorpe He s a cute chap and he may have found some document which well I ll tell you what it might be something which would upset the rights of Harper Mallathorpe to his uncle s estates No other relatives came forward or were heard of or were discoverable when John Mallathorpe was killed in that chimney accident but there may be some there may be one in particular That s my notion and I intend in the first place to make a personal search of the parish registers from which Pratt got his information He may have discovered something there which he s keeping to himself You think that is the course to adopt asked Collingwood after a moment s reflection At present yes replied Eldrick And while I m making it I ll do it myself we ll just go on outwardly as if nothing had happened If I meet Pratt as I shall I shall not let him see that I know anything Do you go on in just the usual way Go out to Normandale Grange now and then and tell Miss Mallathorpe to think no more of her interview with Pratt until we ve something to talk to her about You talk to her about something else When Collingwood had left him Eldrick laid a telegram form on his plotting pad and after a brief interval of thought wrote out a message addressed to the people whose advertisement had attracted Pascoe s attention HALSTEAD BYNER fifty sixB saint Martin s Chambers London W C I can give you definite information concerning James Parrawhite if you will send representative to see me personally CHARLES ELDRICK Eldrick Pascoe Solicitors Barford After Eldrick had sent off a clerk with this message to the nearest telegraph office he sat thinking for some time And at the close of his meditations and after some turning over of a diary which lay on his desk he picked up pen and paper and drafted an advertisement of his own TEN POUNDS REWARD will be paid to any person who can give reliable and useful information as to James Parrawhite who until November last was a clerk in the employ of Messrs Eldrick Pascoe Solicitors Barford and who is believed to have left the town on the evening of November twenty three Apply to mister CHARLES ELDRICK of the above firm Worth risking ten pounds on anyway muttered Eldrick Whether these London people will cover it or not Here he went on turning to a clerk who had just entered the room Make three copies of this advertisement and take one to each of the three newspaper offices and tell em to put it in their personal column tonight He sat musing for some time after he was left alone again and when he at last rose it was with a shake of the head I wonder if Pratt told me the truth that morning he said to himself Anyway he s now being proved to be even deeper than I d ever considered him Well other folk than Pratt are possessed of pretty good wits Before he left the office that evening Eldrick was handed a telegram from Messrs Halstead Byner of saint Martin s Chambers informing him that their mister Byner would travel to Barford by the first express next morning and would call upon him at eleven o clock Then they have some important news for Parrawhite mused Eldrick as he put the message in his pocket and went off to his club Inquiry agents don t set off on long journeys at a moment s notice for a matter of a trifling agency But where is Parrawhite He awaited the arrival of mister Byner next morning with considerable curiosity And soon after eleven there was shown in to him a smart well dressed alert looking young man who having introduced himself as mister Gerald Byner immediately plunged into business You can tell me something of James Parrawhite mister Eldrick he began We shall be glad we ve been endeavouring to trace him for some months It s odd that you didn t see our advertisement before I don t look at that sort of advertisement replied Eldrick I believe it was by mere accident that my partner saw yours yesterday afternoon But now a question or two first What are you inquiry agents Just so sir inquiry agents with a touch of private detective business answered mister Gerald Byner with a smile We undertake to find people to watch people to recover lost property and so on In this case we re acting for Messrs Vickers Marshall Hebbleton Solicitors of Cannon Street They want James Parrawhite badly Why asked Eldrick Because replied Byner with a dry laugh there s about twenty thousand pounds waiting for him in their hands Eldrick whistled with astonishment Whew he said Twenty thousand for Parrawhite My good sir if that s so and if as you say you ve been advertising Advertising in several papers interrupted Byner Dailies weeklies provincials Never had one reply till your wire Then Parrawhite must be dead said Eldrick Or in gaol under another name Twenty thousand pounds waiting for Parrawhite If Parrawhite was alive man or at liberty he wouldn t let twenty thousand pence wait five minutes I know him What can you tell me mister Eldrick asked the inquiry agent Eldrick told all he knew concealing nothing And Byner listened silently and eagerly There s something strikes me at once he said You say that with him disappeared three or four ten pound notes of yours Have you the numbers of those notes I can t say replied Eldrick doubtfully I haven t certainly But they were paid in to our head clerk Pratt and I think he used to enter such things in a sort of day ledger I ll get it He went into the clerks office and presently returned with an oblong marble backed book which he began to turn over This may be what you ask about he said at last Here under date November twenty three are some letters and figures which obviously refer to bank notes You can copy them if you like Another question mister Eldrick remarked Byner as he made a note of the entries You say some cheque forms were abstracted from a book of yours at the same time Have you ever heard of any of these cheque forms being made use of Never replied Eldrick No forgery of your name or anything suggested the caller No said Eldrick There s been nothing of that sort I can soon ascertain if these bank notes have reached the Bank of England said Byner That s a simple matter Now suppose they haven t Well asked Eldrick You know of course continued Byner that it doesn t take long for a Bank of England note once issued to get back to the Bank You know too that it s never issued again Now if those notes haven t been presented at the Bank where are they And if no use has been made of your stolen cheques where are they Good agreed Eldrick I see that you ought to do well in your special line of business Now are you going to pursue inquiries for Parrawhite here in Barford after what I ve told you Certainly said Byner I came down prepared to stop awhile It s highly important that this man should be found highly important he added smiling to other people than Parrawhite himself In what way asked Eldrick Why replied Byner if he s dead as he may be this money goes to somebody else a relative The relative would be very glad to hear he is dead But definite news will be welcome in any case Oh yes now that I ve got down here I shall do my best to trace him You have the address of the woman he lodged with you say I shall go there first of course Then I must try to find out what he did with himself in his spare time But from all you tell me it s my impression he s dead unless as you say he s got into prison again possibly under another name It seems impossible that he should not have seen our advertisements You never advertised in any Yorkshire newspapers asked Eldrick No said Byner Because we d no knowledge of his having come so far North We advertised in the Midland papers But then all the London papers daily and weekly that we used come down to Yorkshire Parrawhite said Eldrick reflectively was a big newspaper reader He used to go to the Free Library reading room a great deal I begin to think he must certainly be dead or locked up However in supplement of your endeavours I did a little work of my own last night There you are he went on picking up the local papers and handing them over I put that in we ll see if any response comes But now a word mister Byner since you ve come to me You have heard me mention my late clerk Pratt Yes answered Byner Pratt has left us and is in business as a sort of estate agent in the next street continued Eldrick Now I have particular reasons most particular reasons why Pratt should remain in absolute ignorance of your presence in the town If you should happen to come across him as you may for though there are a quarter of a million of us here it s a small place compared with London don t let him know your business I m not very likely to do that mister Eldrick remarked Byner quietly Aye but you don t take my meaning said Eldrick eagerly I mean this it s just possible that Pratt may see that advertisement of yours and that he may write to your firm In that case as he s here and you re here your partner would send his letter to you Don t deal with it here Don t if you should come across Pratt even let him know your name When I ve a job of this sort replied Byner I don t let anybody know my name except people like you When I register at one of your hotels presently I shall be mister Black of London But if this Pratt wanted to give any information about Parrawhite he d give it to you surely now that you ve advertised No he wouldn t asserted Eldrick Why Because he s told me all he knows or says he knows already The inquiry agent looked keenly at the solicitor for a moment during which they both kept silence Then Byner smiled You said or says he knows he remarked Do you think he didn t tell the truth about Parrawhite I should say now it s quite likely he didn t answered Eldrick The truth is I m making some inquiry myself about Pratt and I don t want this to interfere with it You keep me informed of what you find out and I ll help you all I can while you re here It may be A clerk came into the room and looked at his master mister George Pickard of the Green Man at Whitcliffe sir he said Well asked Eldrick Wants to see you about that advertisement in the paper this morning sir continued the clerk Eldrick looked at Byner and smiled significantly Then he turned towards the door Bring mister Pickard in he said CHAPTER XVIII THE CONFIDING LANDLORD The clerk presently ushered in a short thick set round faced man apparently of thirty to thirty five years of age whose chief personal characteristics lay in a pair of the smallest eyes ever set in a human countenance and a mere apology for a nose But both nose and eyes combined somehow to communicate an idea of profound inquiry as the round face in which they were placed turned from the solicitor to the man from London and a podgy forefinger was lifted to a red forehead Servant gentlemen said the visitor Fine morning for the time of year Take a chair mister Pickard replied Eldrick Let me see from the Green Man at Whitcliffe I believe Landlord sir had that house a many years answered Pickard as he took a seat near the wall Seven year come next Michaelmas any road Just so and you want to see me about the advertisement in this morning s paper continued Eldrick What about it now The landlord looked at Eldrick and then at Eldrick s companion The solicitor understood that look it meant that what his caller had to say was of a private nature It s all right mister Pickard he remarked reassuringly This gentleman is here on just the same business whatever you say will be treated as confidential it ll go no further You ve something to tell about my late clerk James Parrawhite Pickard who had been nervously fingering a white billycock hat now put it down on the floor and thrust his hands into the pockets of his trousers as if to keep them safe while he talked It s like this here he answered When I saw that there advertisement in the paper this mornin says I to my missus I ll away I says an see Lawyer Eldrick about that there this very day Cause you see mister Eldrick there is summat as I can tell about yon man at you mention James Parrawhite I ve said nowt about it to nobody up to now cause it were private business atween him and me as it were but I lost money over it and of course ten pound is ten pound gentlemen Quite so agreed Eldrick And you shall have your ten pounds if you can tell anything useful I don t know owt about it s being useful sir nor what use is to be made on it said Pickard but I can tell you a bit o truth and you can do what you like wi what I tell But he went on lowering his voice and glancing at the door by which he had just entered there s another name at ll have to be browt in private like Name as it so happens o one o your clerks t head clerk I m given to understand mister Pratt Eldrick showed no sign of surprise But he continued to look significantly at Byner as he turned to the landlord mister Pratt has left me he said Left me three weeks ago So you needn t be afraid mister Pickard say anything you like Oh I didn t know remarked Pickard It s not oft that I come down in t town and we don t hear much Barford news up our way Well it s this here mister Eldrick you know where my place is of course Eldrick nodded and turned to Byner I d better explain to you he said Whitcliffe is an outlying part of the town well up the hills a sort of wayside hamlet with a lot of our famous stone quarries in its vicinity The Green Man of which our friend here is the landlord is an old fashioned tavern by the roadside where people are rather fond of dropping in on a Sunday I fancy eh mister Pickard You re right sir replied the landlord It makes a nice walk out on a Sunday And it were on a Sunday too at I got to know this here James Parrawhite as you want to know summat about He began coming to my place of a Sunday evenin d ye see gentlemen he d walk across t valley up there to Whitcliffe and stop an hour or two enjoyin hisself Well now as you re no doubt well aweer mister Eldrick he were a reight hand at talkin were yon Parrawhite he d t gift o t gab reight enough and talked well an all And of course him an me we hed bits o conversation at times cause he come to t house reg lar and sometimes o week nights an all An he tell d me at he d had a deal o experience i racin matters whether it were true or not I couldn t say but True enough said Eldrick He had Well so he said continued Pickard and he was allus tellin me at he could make a pile o brass on t turf if he only had capital An i t end he persuaded me to start what he called investin money with him i that way i plain language it meant givin him brass to put on horses at he said was goin to win d ye understand Perfectly replied Eldrick You gave him various amounts which he was to stake for you Just so sir And at first said Pickard with a shake of the head at first I d no great reason to grumble He cert ny wor a good hand at spottin a winner But as time went on I t greatest difficulty in gettin a settlement wi him d ye see He wor just as good a hand at makin excuses as he wor at pickin out winners better I think I nivver knew wheer I was wi him he d pay up and then he d persuade me to go in for another do wi t brass I d won and happen we should lose that time and then of course we had to hev another investment to get back what we d dropped and so it went on But t end wor this here last November theer wor about fifty to sixty pound o mine i his hands and I wanted it I d a spirit merchant s bill to settle and I wanted t brass badly for that I knew Parrawhite had been paid d ye see by t turf agent at he betted wi and I plagued him to hand t brass over to me He made one excuse and then another howsumivver it come to that very day you re talkin about i your advertisement mister Eldrick the twenty third o November Stop a minute mister Pickard interrupted Eldrick Now how do you know for a certainty that this day you re going to talk about was the twenty third of November The landlord who had removed his hands from his pockets and was now twiddling a pair of fat thumbs as he talked chuckled slyly For a very good reason he answered I had to pay that spirit bill I tell d about just now on t twenty fourth and that I m going to tell you happened t night afore t twenty fourth so of course it were t twenty third D ye see I see asserted Eldrick That ll do And now what did happen This here replied Pickard On that night t twenty third November Parrawhite came into t Green Man at about happen half past eight He come into t little private parlour to me bold as brass as indeed he allers wor Ye re a nice un I says I ve written yer three letters durin t last week and ye ve nivver answered one o em I ve come to answer i

tomorrow mornin he says Wheer s it coomin from says I Now never you mind he says It s safe I don t believe a word you re sayin says I Ye re havin me for t mug that s about it An I went on so at him at i t end he tell d me at he wor presently goin to meet Pratt and at he could get t brass out o Pratt an as much more as iwer he liked to ax for Well I don t believe that theer and I said so What brass has Pratt says I Pratt s nowt but a clerk wi happen three or four pound a week That s all you know he says Pratt s become a gold mine and I m going to dig in it a bit What s it matter to you he says so long as you get your brass Well of course that wor true enough all at I wanted just then were to handle my brass And I tell d him so I ll brek thy neck Parrawhite I says if thou doesn t bring me that theer money eyther to night or t first thing tomorrow so now Don t talk rot he says I ve told you And he had money wi him then nough to pay for drinks and cigars any road and we had a drink or two and a smoke or two and then he went out sayin he wor goin to meet Pratt and he d be back at my place before closin time wi either t cash or what ud be as good An I waited and waited after closin time an all But I ve nivver seen Parrawhite from that day to this nor heerd tell on him neither Eldrick and Byner looked at each other for a moment Then the solicitor spoke quietly and with a significance which the agent understood Do you want to ask mister Pickard any questions he said Byner nodded and turned to the landlord Did Parrawhite tell you where he was going to meet Pratt he asked He did replied Pickard Near Pratt s lodgin place Did or does Pratt live near you then Closish by happen ten minutes walk There s few o houses a sort o terrace like on t edge o what they call Whitcliffe Moor Pratt lodged lodges now for all I know to t contrary i one o them Did Parrawhite give you any idea that he was going to the house in which Pratt lodged No He were not goin to t house I know he worn t He tell d me at he d a good idea what time Pratt ud be home cause he knew where he was that evening and he were goin to meet him just afore Pratt got to his place I know where he d meet him Where asked Byner Tell me exactly It s important Pratt ud come up fro t town i t tram answered Pickard He d approach this here terrace I tell d you about by a narrow lane that runs off t high road He d meet him there would Parrawhite Did you ever ask any question of Pratt about Parrawhite No never I d no wish that Pratt should know owt about my dealin s with Parrawhite When Parrawhite never come back why I kep it all to myself till now What do you think happened to Parrawhite mister Pickard asked Byner Gow I know what I think replied Pickard disgustedly I think at if he did get any brass out o Pratt which is what I know nowt about and hewn t much belief in he went straight away fro t town vanished I do know this he nivver went back to his lodgin s that neet cause I went theer mysen next day to inquire Eldrick pricked up his ears at that He remembered that he had sent Pratt to make inquiry at Parrawhite s lodgings on the morning whereon the money was missing What time of the day on the twenty fourth was that mister Pickard he asked Evenin sir replied the landlord They d nivver seen naught of him since he went out the day before Oh he did me did Parrawhite Of course I lost mi brass fifty odd pounds Byner gave Eldrick a glance I think mister Pickard has earned the ten pounds you offered he said Eldrick took the hint and pulled out his cheque book Of course you re to keep all this private strictly private mister Pickard he said as he wrote Not a word to a soul Just as you order sir agreed Pickard I ll say nowt to nobody And perhaps tomorrow perhaps this afternoon you ll see me at the Green Man remarked Byner I shall just drop in you know You needn t know me if there s anybody about All right sir I understand said Pickard Quiet s the word what Very good much obliged to you gentlemen When the landlord had gone Eldrick motioned Byner to pick up his hat Come across the street with me he said I want us to have a consultation with a friend of mine a barrister mister Collingwood For this matter is assuming a very queer aspect and we can t move too warily nor consider all the features too thoroughly Collingwood listened with deep interest to Eldrick s account of the morning s events And once again he was struck by the fact that all these various happenings in connection with Pratt and now with Parrawhite took place at the time of Antony Bartle s death and he said so True enough agreed Eldrick And once more pointed out Collingwood We re hearing of a hold Pratt claims to have a hold on missus Mallathorpe now it turns out that Parrawhite boasted of a hold on Pratt Suppose all these things have a common origin Suppose the hold which Parrawhite had or has on Pratt is part and parcel of the hold which Pratt has on missus Mallathorpe In that case or cases what is the best thing to do Will you gentlemen allow me to suggest something said Byner Very well find Parrawhite Of all the people concerned in this Parrawhite from your account of him anyway mister Eldrick is the likeliest person to extract the truth from There s a great deal in that suggestion said Eldrick Do you know what I think he went on turning to Collingwood mister Byner tells me he means to stay here until he has come across some satisfactory news of Parrawhite or solved the mystery of his disappearance Well now that we ve found that there is some ground for believing that Parrawhite was in some fashion mixed up with Pratt about that time why not place the whole thing in mister Byner s hands let him in any case see what he can do about the Parrawhite Pratt business of November twenty third eh I take it answered Collingwood looking at the inquiry agent that mister Byner having heard what he has would do that quite apart from us Yes said Byner Now that I ve heard what Pickard had to say I certainly shall follow that up I am following out something of my own said Collingwood turning to Eldrick I shall know more by this time tomorrow Let us have a conference here at noon They separated on that understanding and Byner went his own ways His first proceeding was to visit one after another the Barford newspaper offices and to order the insertion in large type and immediately of the Halstead Byner advertisement for news of Parrawhite His second was to seek the General Post Office where he wrote out and dispatched a message to his partner in London That message was in cypher translated into English it read as follows If person named Pratt sends any communication to us re Parrawhite on no account let him know I am in Barford but forward whatever he sends to me at once addressed to H D Black Central Station Hotel CHAPTER XIX THE EYE WITNESS When Collingwood said that he was following out something of his own he was thinking of an interesting discovery which he had made It was one which might have no significance in relation to the present perplexities on the other hand out of it might come a good deal of illumination Briefly it was that on the evening before this consultation with Eldrick Byner he had found out that he was living in the house of a man who had actually witnessed the famous catastrophe at Mallathorpe s Mill whereby John Mallathorpe his manager and his cashier together with some other bystanders had lost their lives On settling down in Barford Collingwood had spent a couple of weeks in looking about him for comfortable rooms of a sort that appealed to his love of quiet and retirement He had found them at last in an old house on the outskirts of the town a fine old stone house once a farmstead set in a large garden and tenanted by a middle aged couple who having far more room than they needed for themselves had no objection to letting part of it to a business gentleman Collingwood fell in love with this place as soon as he saw it The rooms were large and full of delightful nooks and corners the garden was rich in old trees from it there were fine views of the valley beneath and the heather clad hills in the distance within two miles of the town and easily approached by a convenient tram route it was yet quite out in the country He was just as much set up by his landlady a comfortable middle aged woman who fostered true Yorkshire notions about breakfast and knew how to cook a good dinner at night With her Collingwood had soon come to terms and to his new abode had transferred a quantity of books and pictures from London He soon became acquainted with the domestic menage There was the landlady herself missus Cobcroft who having no children of her own had adopted a niece now grown up and a teacher in an adjacent elementary school there was a strapping rosy cheeked servant maid whose dialect was too broad for the lodger to understand more than a few words of it finally there was mister Cobcroft a mild mannered quiet man who disappeared early in the morning and was sometimes seen by Collingwood returning home in the evening Lately with the advancing spring this unobtrusive individual was seen about the garden at the end of the day Collingwood had so seen him on the evening before the talk with Eldrick and Byner busied in setting seeds in the flower beds And he had asked missus Cobcroft just then in his sitting room if her husband was fond of gardening It s a nice change for him sir answered the landlady He s kept pretty close at it all day in the office yonder at Mallathorpe s Mill and it does him good to get a bit o fresh air at nights now that the fine weather s coming on That was one reason why we took this old place it s a deal better air here nor what it is in the town So your husband is at Mallathorpe s Mill eh asked Collingwood Been there in the counting house boy and man over thirty years sir replied missus Cobcroft Did he see that terrible affair then was it two years ago The landlady shook her head and let out a weighty sigh Aye I should think he did she answered And a nice shock it gave him too he actually saw that chimney fall him and another clerk were looking out o the counting house window when it gave way Collingwood said no more then except to remark that such a sight must indeed have been trying to the nerves But for purposes of his own he determined to have a talk with Cobcroft and the next evening seeing him in his garden again he went out to him and got into conversation and eventually led up to the subject of Mallathorpe s Mill the new chimney of which could be seen from a corner of the garden Your wife tells me observed Collingwood that you were present when the old chimney fell at the mill yonder Cobcroft a quiet unassuming man usually of few words looked along the hillside at the new chimney and nodded his head A curious far away look came into his eyes I was sir he said And I hope I may never see aught o that sort again as long as ever I live It was one o those things a man can never forget Don t talk about it if you don t want to remarked Collingwood But I ve heard so much about that affair that Oh I don t mind talking about it replied Cobcroft He leaned over the fence of his garden still gazing at the mill in the distance There were others that saw it of course lots of em But I was close at hand our office was filled with the dust in a few seconds It was a sudden affair asked Collingwood It was one of those affairs answered Cobcroft slowly that some folk had been expecting for a long time only nobody had the sense to see that it might happen at some unexpected minute It was a very old chimney It looked all right stood plumb and all that But mister Mallathorpe my old master mister John Mallathorpe I m talking of he got an idea from two or three little things d ye see that it wasn t as safe as it ought to be And he got a couple of these professional steeplejacks to examine it They made a thorough examination too so far as one could tell by what they did They d been at the job several days when the accident happened One of em had only just come down when the chimney fell mister Mallathorpe himself and his manager and his cashier had just stepped out of the counting house and crossed the yard to hear what this man had got to say when down it came Not the slightest warning at the time It just collapsed You saw the actual collapse asked Collingwood Aye didn t I exclaimed Cobcroft Another man and myself were looking out of the office window right opposite It fell in the queerest way like this he went on holding up his garden rake Supposing this shaft was the chimney standing straight up As we looked we saw it suddenly bulge out on all sides it was a square chimney same size all the way up till you got to the cornice at the top bulge out d ye see just about half way up simultaneous like Then down it came with a roar that they heard over half the town O course there were some two or three thousands of tons of stuff in that chimney and when the dust was cleared a bit there it was in one great heap right across the yard And it was a good job concluded Cobcroft reflectively that it fell straight collapsed in itself as you might say for if it had fallen slanting either way it ud ha smashed right through some of the sheds and there d ha been a terrible loss of life mister John Mallathorpe was killed on the spot I believe suggested Collingwood Aye and Gaukrodger and Marshall and the steeplejack that had just come down and another or two said Cobcroft They d no chance they were standing in a group at the very foot talking They were all killed there and then instantaneous Some others were struck and injured one or two died Yes sir I m not very like to forget that A terrible experience agreed Collingwood It would naturally fix itself on your memory Aye my memory s very keen about it said Cobcroft I remember every detail of that morning And he continued showing a desire to become reminiscent there was something happened that morning before the accident that I ve oft thought over and has oft puzzled me I ve never said aught to anybody about it because we Yorkshiremen we re not given to talking about affairs that don t concern us and after all it was none o mine But you re a law gentleman and I dare say you get things told to you in confidence now and then and of course this is between you and me I ll not deny that I have oft thought that I would like to tell it to a lawyer of some sort and find out how it struck him Anything that you like to tell me mister Cobcroft I shall treat as a matter of confidence until you tell me it s no longer a secret answered Collingwood Why continued Cobcroft it isn t what you rightly would call a secret though I don t think anybody knows aught about it but myself It was just this and it may be there s naught in it but a mere fancy o mine That morning before the accident happened I was in and out of the private office a good deal carrying in and out letters and account books and so on mister John Mallathorpe s private office ye ll understand sir opened out of our counting house as it does still the present manager mister Horsfall has it just as it was Well now on one occasion when I went in there to take a ledger back to the safe mister Mallathorpe had his manager and cashier Gaukrodger and Marshall in with him mister Mallathorpe he always used a stand up desk to write at never wrote sitting down though he had a big desk in the middle of the room that he used to sit at to look over accounts or talk to people Now when I went in he and Gaukrodger and Marshall were all at this stand up desk in the window place and they were signing some papers At least Gaukrodger had just signed a paper and Marshall was taking the pen from him Sign there Marshall says mister Mallathorpe And then he went on Now we ll sign this other it s well to have these things in duplicate in case one gets lost And then well then I went out and why that was all You ve some idea in your mind about that said Collingwood who had watched Cobcroft closely as he talked What is it Cobcroft smiled and looked round as if to ascertain that they were alone Why he answered in a low voice I ll tell you what I did wonder some time afterwards I dare say you re aware it was all in the papers that mister John Mallathorpe died intestate Yes asserted Collingwood I know that I ve oft wondered continued Cobcroft if that could ha been his will that they were signing But then I reflected a bit on matters And there were two or three things that made me say naught at all not a word First of all I considered it a very unlikely thing that a rich man like mister John Mallathorpe would make a will for himself Second I remembered that very soon after I d been in his private office Marshall came out into the counting house and gave the office lad a lot of letters and documents to take to the post some of em big envelopes and I thought that what I d seen signed was some agreement or other that was in one of them And third and most important no will was ever found in any of mister John Mallathorpe s drawers or safes or anywhere though they turned things upside down at the office and I heard at his house as well Of course you see sir supposing that to have been a will why the only two men who could possibly have proved it was were dead and gone They were killed with him And of course the young people the nephew and niece they came in for everything so there was an end of it But I ve oft wondered what those papers were One thing is certain anyway concluded Cobcroft with a grim laugh when those three signed em they were picking up their pens for the last time How long was it after you saw the signing of those papers that the accident occurred asked Collingwood It ud be twelve or fifteen minutes as near as I can recollect replied Cobcroft A few minutes after I d left the private office Gaukrodger came out of it alone and stood at the door leading into the yard looking up at the chimney The steeple jack was just coming down and his mate was waiting for him at the bottom Gaukrodger turned back to the private office and called mister Mallathorpe out All three of em Mallathorpe Gaukrodger Marshall went out and walked across the yard to the chimney foot They stood there talking a bit and then down it came Collingwood thought matters over Supposing that the document which Cobcroft spoke of as being in process of execution before him were indeed duplicate copies of a will What could have been done with them in the few minutes which elapsed between the signing and the catastrophe to the chimney It was scarcely likely that John Mallathorpe would have sent them away by post If they had been deposited in his own pocket they would have been found when his clothing was removed and examined If they were in the private office when the three men left it You re sure the drawers safe and so on in mister Mallathorpe s room were thoroughly searched after his death he asked I should think they were answered Cobcroft laconically I helped at that myself There wasn t as much as an old invoice that was not well fingered and turned over No I came to the conclusion that what I d seen signed was some contract or something sent off there and then by the lad to post Collingwood made no further remark and asked no more questions But he thought long and seriously that night and he came to certain conclusions First what Cobcroft had seen signed was John Mallathorpe s will Second John Mallathorpe had made it himself and had taken the unusual course of making a duplicate copy Third John Mallathorpe had probably slipped the copy into the History of Barford which was in his private office when he went out to speak to the steeple jack Fourth that copy had come into Linford Pratt s hands through Antony Bartle And now arose two big questions What were the terms of that will And where was the duplicate copy He was still putting these to himself when noon of the next day came and brought Eldrick and Byner for the promised serious consultation CHAPTER XX THE GREEN MAN Byner in taking his firm s advertisement for Parrawhite to the three Barford newspaper offices had done so with a special design he wanted Pratt to see that a serious wish to discover Parrawhite was alive in more quarters than one He knew that Pratt was almost certain to see Eldrick s advertisement in his own name now he wanted Pratt to see another advertisement of the same nature in another name Already he had some suspicion that Pratt had not told Eldrick the truth about Parrawhite and that nothing would suit him so well as that Parrawhite should never be heard of or mentioned again now he wished Pratt to learn that Parrawhite was much wanted and was likely to be much mentioned wherefore the supplementary advertisements with Halstead Byner s name attached It was extremely unlikely that Pratt could fail to see those advertisements There were three newspapers in Barford one a morning journal of large circulation throughout the county the other two evening journals which usually appeared in three or four editions As Byner stipulated for large type and a prominent position in the personal column of each it was scarcely within the bounds of probability that a townsman like Pratt would miss seeing the advertisement Most likely he would see it in all three newspapers And if he had also seen Eldrick s similar advertisement he would begin to think and then Why then mused Byner ruminating on his design then we will see what he will do Meanwhile there was something he himself wanted to do and on the morning following his arrival in the town he set out to do it Byner had been much struck by Pickard s account of his dealings with James Parrawhite on the evening which appeared to be the very last wherein Parrawhite was ever seen He had watched the landlord of the Green Man closely as he told his story and had set him down for an honest if somewhat sly and lumpish soul who was telling a plain tale to the best of his ability Byner believed all the details of that story he even believed that when Parrawhite told Pickard that he would find him fifty pounds that evening or early next day he meant to keep his word In the circumstances as far as Byner could reckon them up from what he had gathered it would not have paid Parrawhite to do otherwise Byner put the situation to himself in this fashion Pratt had got hold of some secret which was being or could be made to be highly profitable to him Parrawhite had discovered this and was in a position to blackmail Pratt Therefore Parrawhite would not wish to leave Pratt s neighbourhood so long as there was money to be got out of Pratt Parrawhite would stick to him like a leech But if Parrawhite was to abide peaceably in Barford he must pay Pickard that little matter of between fifty and sixty pounds Accordingly in Byner s opinion Parrawhite had every honest intention of returning to the Green Man on the evening of the twenty third of November after having seen Pratt And in Byner s further and very seriously considered opinion the whole problem for solution possibly involving the solution of other and more important problems was this Did Parrawhite meet Pratt that night and if he did what took place between them which prevented Parrawhite from returning to Pickard It was in an endeavour to get at some first stage of a solution of this problem that Byner having breakfasted at the Central Hotel on his second day in the town went out immediately afterwards asked his way to Whitcliffe and was directed to an electric tram which started from the Town Hall Square and after running through a district of tall warehouses and squat weaving sheds began a long and steady climb to the heights along the town When he left it he found himself in a district eminently characteristic of that part of the country The tram set him down at a cross roads on a high ridge of land Beneath him lay Barford its towers and spires and the gables of its tall buildings showing amongst the smoke of its many chimneys All about him lay open ground broken by the numerous stone quarries of which Eldrick had spoken and at a little distance along one of the four roads at the intersection of which he stood he saw a few houses and cottages one of which taller and bigger than the rest was distinguished by a pole planted in front of its stone porch and bearing a swinging sign whereon was rudely painted the figure of a man in Lincoln green Byner walked on to this entered a flagged hall and found himself confronting Pickard who at sight of him motioned him into a little parlour behind the bar Mornin mister said he You ll be all right in here there s nobody about just now and if my missis or any o t servant lasses sees yer they ll tak yer for a brewer s traveller or summat o that sort Come to hev a look round like what I want to have a look at the place where you told us Parrawhite was to meet Pratt that night replied Byner I thought you would perhaps be kind enough to show me where it is I will an all wi pleasure said the landlord but ye mun hev a drop o summat first try a glass o our ale he went on with true Yorkshire hospitality I hev some bitter beer i my cellar such as I ll lay owt ye couldn t get t likes on down yonder i Barford no nor i London neyther I ll just draw a jug Byner submitted to this evidence of friendliness and Pickard after disappearing into a dark archway and down some deeply worn stone steps came back with a foaming jug the sight of which seemed to give him great delight He gazed admiringly at the liquor which he presently poured into two tumblers and drew his visitor s attention to its colour Reight stuff that mister what he said I nobbut tapped that barril two days since and I d been keepin it twelve month so you ve come in for it at what they call t opportune moment I say he went on after pledging Byner and smacking his lips over the ale I heard summat last night at might be useful to you and Lawyer Eldrick about this here Parrawhite affair Oh said Byner at once interested What now You ll ha noticed as you come along t road just now at there s a deal o stone quarries i this neighbourhood replied Pickard Well now of course some o t quarry men comes in here Last night theer wor sev ral on em i t bar theer talkin and one on em wor readin t evenin newspaper t Barford Dispatch An he read out that theer advertisement about Parrawhite wi your address i London at t foot on it Well theer wor nowt said except summat about advertisin for disappeared folk but later on one o t men a young man come to me private like I say Pickard he says between you an me worrn t t name o that man at used to come in here on a Sunday sometimes Parrawhite It runs a my mind he says at I ve heerd you call him by that name Well an what if it wor I says Nay nowt much he says but I see fro t Dispatch at he s wanted and I could tell a bit about him he says What could ye tell says I just like that theer Why he says this much one night t last back end Stop a bit mister Pickard interrupted Byner What does that mean that term back end Why it means t end o t year answered the landlord What some folks call autumn d ye understand One night t last back end says this young fellow I wor hengin about on t quiet at t end o Stubbs Lane he says T truth wor he says I wor waitin for a word wi a young woman at lives i that terrace at t top o Stubbs Lane she wor goin to come out and meet me for half an hour or so An he says I see d that theer feller at I think I ve heerd you call Parrawhite come out o Stubbs Lane wi that lawyer chap at lives i t Terrace Pratt I know Pratt he says cause them at he works for Eldricks once did a bit o law business for me Where did you see em go to then says I I see d em cross t road into t owd quarry ground he says I see d em plain enough tho they didn t see me I wor keepin snug agen t wall it wor a moonlit night that he says Well I says an what now Why he says d yer think I could get owt o this reward for tellin that theer So I thowt pretty sharp then d ye see mister I ll tell yer what mi lad I says Say nowt to nobody keep your tongue still and I ll tell ye tomorrow night what ye can do I shall see a man at s on that job tween now and then I says So theer it is concluded Pickard looking hard at Byner D yer think this chap s evidence ud be i your line Decidedly I do replied Byner Where is he to be found I couldn t say wheer he lives answered the landlord But it ll be somewhere close about anyway he ll be in here tonight Bill Thomson t feller s name is decent young feller enough I must contrive to see him certainly said Byner Well now can you show me this Stubbs Lane and the neighbourhood Just step along t road a bit and I ll join you in a few o minutes assented Pickard We d best not be seen leavin t house together or our folk ll think it s a put up job Walk forrard a piece Byner strolled along the road a little way and leaned over a wall until mister Pickard wearing his white billycock hat and accompanied by a fine fox terrier lounged up with his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat Together they went a little further along Now then said the landlord crossing the road towards the entrance of a narrow lane which ran between two high stone walls This here is Stubbs Lane so called I believe cause an owd gentleman named similar used to hev a house here at s been pulled down Ye see it runs up fro this high road towards yon terrace o houses Folks hereabouts calls that terrace t World s End cause they re t last houses afore ye get on to t open moorlands Now that night at Parrawhite wor aimin to meet Pratt it wor i this very lane Pratt when he left t tram car t other side o my place ud come up t road and up this lane And it wor at t top o t lane at Bill Thomson see d Pratt and Parrawhite cross into what Bill called t owd quarry ground Can we go into that asked Byner Nowt easier said Pickard It s a sort of open space where t childer goes and plays about they hev n t worked no stone theer for many a long year all t stone s exhausted like He led Byner along the lane to its further end pointed out the place where Thomson said he had seen Pratt and Parrawhite and indicated the terrace of houses in which Pratt lived Then he crossed towards the old quarries Don t know what they should want to come in here for unless it wor to talk very confidential said Pickard But lor bless yer it ud be quiet enough anywheer about this neighbourhood at that time o neet However this is wheer Bill Thomson says he see d em come He led the way amongst the disused quarries and Byner following climbed on a mound now grown over with grass and weed and looked about him To his town eyes the place was something novel He had never seen the like of it before Gradually he began to understand it The stone had been torn out of the earth sometimes in square pits sometimes in semi circular ones until the various veins and strata had become exhausted Then when men went away Nature had stepped in to assert her rights All over the despoiled region she had spread a new clothing of green Turf had grown on the flooring of the quarries ivy and bramble had covered the deep scars bushes had sprung up trees were already springing And in one of the worn out excavations some man had planted a kitchen garden in orderly and formal rows and plots Dangerous place that there said Pickard suddenly If I d known o that I shouldn t ha let my young uns come to play about here They might be tummlin in and drownin theirsens I mun tell my missis to keep em away Byner turned to find the landlord pointing at the old shaft which had gradually become filled with water In the morning sunlight its surface glittered like a plane of burnished metal but when the two men went nearer and gazed at it from its edge the water was black and unfathomable to the eye Goodish thirty feet o water in that there surmised Pickard It s none safe for childer to play about theer s nowt to protect em Next time I see Mestur Shepherd I shall mak it my business to tell him so he owt either to drain that watter off or put a fence around it Is mister Shepherd the property owner asked Byner Aye it s all his this land answered Pickard He pointed to a low roofed house set amidst elms and chestnuts some distance off across the moor Lives theer does Mestur Shepherd varry well to do man he is How could that water be drained off asked Byner with assumed carelessness Easy enough replied Pickard Cut through yon ledge and let it run into t far quarry there A couple o men ud do that job in a day Byner made no further remark He and Pickard strolled back to the Green Man together And declining the landlord s invitation to step inside and take another glass but promising to see him again very soon the inquiry agent walked on to the tram car and rode down to Barford to keep his appointment with Eldrick and Collingwood at the barrister s chambers CHAPTER XXI THE DIRECT CHARGE While Byner was pursuing his investigations in the neighbourhood of the Green Man Collingwood was out at Normandale Grange discussing certain matters with Nesta Mallathorpe He had not only thought long and deeply over his conversation with Cobcroft the previous evening but had begun to think about the crucial point of the clerk s story as soon as he spoke in the morning and the result of his meditations was that he rose early intercepted Cobcroft before he started for Mallathorpe s Mill and asked his permission to re tell the story to Miss Mallathorpe Cobcroft raised no objection and when Collingwood had been to his chambers and seen his letters he chartered a car and rode out to Normandale where he told Nesta of what he had learned and of his own conclusions And Nesta having listened carefully to all he had to tell put a direct question to him You think this document which Pratt told me he holds is my late uncle s will she said What do you suppose its terms to be Frankly these or something like these replied Collingwood And I get at my conclusions in this way Your uncle died intestate consequently everything in the shape of real estate came to your brother and everything in personal property to your brother and yourself Now supposing that the document which Pratt boasts of holding is the will one fact is very certain the property real or personal is not disposed of in the way in which it became disposed of because of John Mallathorpe s intestacy He probably disposed of it in quite another fashion Why do I think that Because the probability is that Pratt said to your mother I have got John Mallathorpe s will It doesn t leave his property to your son and daughter Therefore I have all of you at my mercy Make it worth my while or I will bring the will forward Do you see that situation Then replied Nesta after a moment s reflection you do think that my mother was very anxious to get that document a will from Pratt Collingwood knew what she was thinking of her mind was still uneasy about Pratt s account of the affair of the foot bridge But the matter had to be faced I think your mother would naturally be very anxious to secure such a document he said You must remember that according to Pratt s story to you she tried to buy it from him just as you did yourself though you of course had no idea of what it was you wanted to buy What I wanted to buy she answered readily was necessity from further interference But is there no way of compelling Pratt to give up that document whatever it is Can t he be made to give it up A way is may be being made just now through another affair replied Collingwood At present matters are vague One couldn t go to Pratt and demand something at which one is after all only guessing Your mother of course would deny that she knows what it is that Pratt holds But there is the possibility of the duplicate to which Cobcroft referred Now I want to put the question straight to you supposing that duplicate will can be found and supposing to put it plainly its terms dispossess you of all your considerable property what then Do you want the exact truth she asked Well then I should just welcome anything that cleared up all this mystery What is it at present this situation but intolerable I know that my mother is in Pratt s power and likely to remain so as long as ever this goes on probably for life She will not give me her confidence What is more I am certain that she is giving it to Esther Mawson who is most likely hand in glove with Pratt Esther Mawson is always with her I am almost sure that she communicates with Pratt through Esther Mawson It is all what I say intolerable I had rather lose every penny that has come into my hands than have this go on Answer me a plain question said Collingwood Is your mother fond of money position all that sort of thing She is fond of power replied Nesta It pleased her greatly when we came into all this wealth to know that she was the virtual administrator Even if she could only do it by collusion with Pratt she would make a fight for all that she and I hold It s useless to deny that Don t forget she added looking appealingly at Collingwood don t forget that she has known what it was to be poor and if one does come into money I suppose one doesn t want to lose it again Oh it s natural enough agreed Collingwood But if things are as I think Pratt would be an incubus a mill stone for ever Anyway I came out to tell you what I ve learned and what I have an idea may be the truth and above all to get your definite opinion You want the Pratt influence out of the way at any cost At any cost she affirmed Even if I have to go back to earning my own living Whatever pleasure in life could there be for me knowing that at the back of all this there is that what Pratt answered Collingwood Pratt He s the shadow with his deep schemes However as I said there may be developing at this moment another way of getting at Pratt Gentlemen like Pratt born schemers invariably forget one very important factor in life the unexpected Even the cleverest and most subtle schemer may have his delicate machinery broken to pieces by a chance bit of mere dust getting into it at an unexpected turn of the wheels And to turn to plainer language I m going back to Barford now to hear what another man has to say concerning certain of Pratt s recent movements Eldrick was already waiting when Collingwood reached his chambers Byner came there a few moments later Within half an hour the barrister had told his story of Cobcroft and the inquiry agent his of his visit to the Green Man and the quarries And the solicitor listened quietly and attentively to both and in the end turned to Collingwood I ll withdraw my opinion about the nature of the document which Pratt got hold of he said What he s got is what you think John Mallathorpe s will If I may venture an opinion remarked Byner that s dead certain And now continued Eldrick we re faced with a nice situation Don t either of you forget this fact Not out of willingness on her part but because she s got to do it missus Mallathorpe and Pratt are partners in that affair He s got the will but she knows its contents She ll pay any price to Pratt to keep them from ever becoming known or operative But as I say don t you forget something What asked Collingwood Eldrick tapped the edge of the table emphasizing his words as he spoke them They can destroy that will whenever they like he said And once destroyed nothing can absolutely prove that it ever existed The duplicate suggested Collingwood Nothing to give us the faintest idea as to its existence said Eldrick We might advertise said Collingwood Lots of advertising was done when John Mallathorpe died replied the solicitor No if any person had had it in possession it would have turned up then It may be probably is possibly must be somewhere and may yet come to light But there s another way of getting at Pratt Through this Parrawhite affair Pratt most likely had not the least notion that he would ever hear of Parrawhite again He is going to hear of Parrawhite again I am convinced now that Parrawhite knew something about this and that Pratt squared him and got him away Aren t you he asked turning to Byner But Byner smiled quietly and shook his head No he answered I am not mister Eldrick You re not exclaimed Eldrick surprised and wondering that anybody could fail to agree with him Why not then Because replied Byner I am certain that Pratt murdered Parrawhite on the night of November twenty third last That s why He didn t square him He didn t get him away He killed him The effect of this straightforward pronouncement of opinion on the two men who heard it was strikingly different Collingwood s face at once became cold and inscrutable his lips fixed themselves sternly his eyes looked hard into a problematic future But Eldrick flushed as if a direct accusation had been levelled at himself and he turned on the inquiry agent almost impatiently Murder he exclaimed Oh come I really that s rather a stiff order I dare say Pratt s been up to all sorts of trickery and even deviltry but murder is quite another thing You re pretty ready to accuse him Byner moved his head in Collingwood s direction and Eldrick turned and looked anxiously at Collingwood who finding the eyes of both men on him opened his hitherto tight shut lips I think it quite likely he said Byner laughed softly and looked at the solicitor Just listen to me a minute or two mister Eldrick he said I ll sum up my own ideas on this matter got from the various details that have been supplied to me since I came to Barford Just consider my points one by one Let s take them separately and see how they fit in one mister Bartle is seen by his shop boy to take a certain paper from a book which came from the late John Mallathorpe s office at Mallathorpe Mill He puts that paper in his pocket two Immediately afterwards mister Bartle goes to your office Nobody is there but Pratt as far as Pratt knows three Bartle dies suddenly after telling Pratt that the paper is John Mallathorpe s will Pratt steals the will And the probability is that Parrawhite unknown to Pratt was in that office and saw him steal it Why is that probable Because four Next night Parrawhite who is being pressed for money by Pickard tells Pickard that he can get it out of Pratt over whom he has a hold What hold We can imagine what hold Anyway five Parrawhite leaves Pickard to meet Pratt He did meet Pratt in Stubbs Lane He was seen to go with Pratt into the disused quarry And there in my opinion Pratt killed him and disposed of his body six What does Pratt do next He goes to your office first thing next morning and removes certain moneys which you say you carelessly left in your desk the night before and tears out certain cheque forms from your book When Parrawhite never turns up that morning you and Pratt conclude that he s the thief and that he s run away seven If you want some proof of the correctness of this last suggestion you ll find it in the fact that no use has ever been made of those blank cheques and that in all probability the stolen bank notes have never reached the Bank of England On that last point I m making inquiry but my feeling is that Pratt destroyed both cheques and bank notes when he stole them eight This man Parrawhite out of the way Pratt has a clear field He s got the will He s already acquainted missus Mallathorpe with that fact and with the terms of the will whatever they may be We may be sure however that they are of such a nature as to make her willing to agree to his demands upon her and accidentally to go to any lengths upon which we needn t touch at present towards getting possession of the will from him nine And the present situation from Pratt s standpoint of yesterday is this He s so sure of his own safety that he doesn t mind revealing to the daughter that the mother s in his power Why Because Pratt like most men of his sort cannot believe that self interest isn t paramount with everybody it s beyond him to conceive it possible that Miss Mallathorpe would do anything that might lose her several thousands a year He argued So long as I hold that will nobody and nothing can make me give it up nor divulge its contents But I can bind one person who benefits by it Miss Mallathorpe and for the mother s sake I can keep the daughter quiet Well he hasn t kept the daughter quiet She spoke ten And last in all such schemes as Pratt s the schemer invariably forgets something Pratt forgot that there might arise what actually has arisen inquiry for Parrawhite The search for Parrawhite is afoot and if you want to get at Pratt it will have to be through what I firmly believe to be a fact his murder of Parrawhite and his disposal of Parrawhite s body That s all mister Eldrick concluded Byner who had spoken with much emphasis throughout It all seems very clear to me and he added with a glance at Collingwood I think mister Collingwood is inclined to agree with most of what I ve said Pretty nearly all if not all assented Collingwood I think you ve put into clear language precisely what I feel I don t believe there s a shadow of doubt that Pratt killed Parrawhite And we can and must get at him in that way What do you suggest he continued turning to Byner You have some idea of course First of all answered Byner we mustn t arouse any suspicion on Pratt s part Let us work behind the screen But I have an idea as to how he disposed of Parrawhite and I m going to follow it up this very day my first duty you know is towards the people who want Parrawhite or proof of his death I propose to Just then Collingwood s clerk came in with a telegram Sent on from the Central Hotel sir he answered They said mister Black would be found here That s mine said the inquiry agent I left word at the hotel that they were to send to your chambers if any wire came for me Allow me He opened the telegram looked it over and waiting until the clerk had gone turned to his companions Here s a message from my partner mister Halstead he continued Listen to what he wires Wire just received from Murgatroyd shipping agent Peel Row Barford He says Parrawhite left that town for America on November twenty fourth last and offers further information Let me know what to reply Byner laid the message before Eldrick and Collingwood without further comment CHAPTER XXII THE CAT SPAW On the evening of the day whereon Nesta Mallathorpe had paid him the visit which had resulted in so much plain speech on both sides Pratt employed his leisure in a calm review of the situation He was by no means dissatisfied it seemed to him that everything was going very well for his purposes He was not at all sorry that Nesta had been to see him far from it He regretted nothing that he had said to her In his desperate opinion his own position was much stronger when she left him than it was when he opened his office door to her She now knew said Pratt with what a strong and resourceful man she had to deal she would respect him and have a better idea of him now that she was aware of his impregnable position Herein Pratt s innate vanity and his ignorance showed themselves He had little knowledge of modern young women and few ideas about them and such ideas as he possessed were usually mistaken ones But one was that it is always necessary to keep a firm hand on women let them see and feel your power said Pratt He had been secretly delighted to acquaint Nesta Mallathorpe with his power to drive it into her that he had the whip hand of her mother and through her mother of Nesta herself He had seen that Nesta was much upset and alarmed by what he told her And though she certainly seemed to recover her spirits at the end of the interview and even refused to shake hands with him he cherished the notion that in the war of words he had come off a decided victor He did not believe that Nesta would utter to any other soul one word of what had passed between them she would be too much afraid of calling down his vengeance on her mother What he did believe was that as time went by and all progressed smoothly Nesta would come to face and accept facts she would find him honest and hardworking in his dealings with missus Mallathorpe as he fully intended to be from purely personal and selfish motives and she herself would begin to tolerate and then to trust him and eventually well who knew what might or might not happen What said the great Talleyrand WITH TIME AND PATIENCE THE MULBERRY LEAF IS TURNED INTO SATIN But Pratt s self complacency received a shock next morning If he had been a reader of London newspapers it would have received a shock the day before Pratt however was essentially parochial in his newspaper tastes he never read anything but the Barford papers And when he picked up the Barford morning journal and saw Eldrick s advertisement for Parrawhite in a prominent place he literally started from sheer surprise not unmingled with alarm It was as if he were the occupant of a strong position only fortified who suddenly finds a shell dropped into his outworks from a totally unexpected quarter Parrawhite Advertised for by Eldrick Why For what reason For what purpose With what idea Parrawhite of all men in the world Parrawhite of whom he had never wanted to hear again And what on earth could Eldrick want with him or with news of him It would be or might be an uncommonly awkward thing for him Pratt if a really exhaustive search were made for Parrawhite For nobody knew better than himself that one little thing leads to another and but he forbore to follow out what might have been his train of thought Once he was tempted to make an excuse for going round to Eldrick Pascoe s with the idea of fishing for information but he refrained Let things develop that was a safer plan Still he was anxious and disturbed all day Then towards the end of the afternoon he bought one of the Barford evening papers and saw in staring letters the advertisement which Byner had caused to be inserted only a few hours previously And at that Pratt became afraid Parrawhite wanted news of Parrawhite wanted and in two separate quarters Wanted by Eldrick wanted by some London people What in the name of the devil did it mean At any rate he must see to himself One thing was certain no search for Parrawhite must be permitted in Barford That evening instead of going home to dinner Pratt remained in town and dined at a quiet restaurant When he dined he thought and planned and schemed and after treating himself very well in the matter of food and drink he lighted a cigar returned to his new offices opened a safe which he had just set up and took from a drawer in it a hundred pounds in bank notes With these in his pocket book he went off to a quiet part of the town the part in which James Parrawhite had lodged during his stay in Barford Pratt turned into a somewhat mean and shabby street a street of small poor class shops He went forward amongst them until he came to one which if anything was meaner and shabbier than the others and bore over its window the name Reuben Murgatroyd Watchmaker and Jeweller There were few signs of jewellery in Reuben Murgatroyd s window some cheap clocks some foreign made watches of the five shilling and seven and six variety a selection of flashy rings and chains were spread on the shelves equally cheap and flashy bangles bracelets and brooches lay in dust covered trays on the sloping bench beneath them At these things Pratt cast no more than a contemptuous glance But he looked with interest at the upper part of the window in which were displayed numerous gaily coloured handbills and small posters relating to shipping chiefly in the way of assisted passages to various parts of the globe These set out that you could get an assisted passage to Canada for so much to Australia for not much more and if the bills and posters themselves did not tell you all you wanted to know certain big letters at the foot of each invited you to apply for further information to mister R Murgatroyd agent within And Pratt pushed open the shop door and walked inside An untidily dressed careworn anxious looking man came forward from a parlour at the rear of his shop At sight of Pratt who in the course of business had once served him with a writ his pale face flushed and then whitened and Pratt hastened to assure him of his peaceful errand All right mister Murgatroyd he said Nothing to be alarmed about I m out of that line now no papers of that sort tonight I ve a bit of business I can put in your hands profitable business Look here have you got a quarter of an hour to spare Murgatroyd who looked greatly relieved to find that his visitor had neither writ nor summons for him glanced at his parlour door I was just going to put the shutters up and sit down to a bite of supper mister Pratt he answered Will you come in sir No you come out with me said Pratt Come round to the Coach and Horses and have a drink and we can talk You ll have a better appetite for your supper when you come back he added with a wink I ve a profitable job for you Glad to hear it sir replied Murgatroyd I can do with aught of that sort I assure you He went into the parlour said a word or two to some person within and came out again Not much business doing at present mister Pratt he said as he and his visitor turned into the street Gets slacker than ever Then you ll do with a slice of good luck remarked Pratt It just happens that I can put a bit in your way He led Murgatroyd to the end of the street where stood a corner tavern into a side door of which Pratt turned as if he were well acquainted with the geography of the place Walking down a narrow passage he conducted his companion into a small parlour at that moment untenanted pointed him to a seat in the corner and rang the bell Five minutes later having provided Murgatroyd with rum and water and a cigar he turned on him with a direct question Look here he said in a low voice Would a hundred pounds be any use to you Murgatroyd s cheeks flushed It ud be a fortune he answered with fervour A hundred pound Lor bless you mister Pratt it s many a year since I saw a hundred pound of my own all in one lump Pratt pulled out his roll of bank notes fluttered it in his companion s face laid it on the table and set an ashtray on it There s a hundred pounds there he said It s yours to pick up if you ll do a little job for me Easy job too you ll never earn a hundred pounds so easy in your life Murgatroyd pricked up his ears According to his ideas money easily come by was seldom honestly earned He stirred uncomfortably in his seat So long as it s a straight job he muttered I don t want Straight enough as straight as it s easy answered Pratt It may seem a bit mysterious but there s reasons for that I give you my word it s all right all a mere bit of diplomacy and that nobody ll ever know you re in it that is beyond a certain stage and that there s no danger to you What is it asked Murgatroyd still uneasy and doubtful Pratt pulled the evening paper out of his pocket and showed Murgatroyd the advertisement signed Halstead Byner You see that he said Information wanted about Parrawhite Do you remember Parrawhite He once served you with some papers in that affair in which we were against you I remember him answered Murgatroyd I ve seen him in here now and again So he s wanted is he I didn t know he d left the town Left last November said Pratt And there are folks influential folks as you can guess seeing that they can throw a hundred pounds away who don t want any inquiries made for him in Barford They don t mind those folks how many inquiries and searches are made for him anywhere else but not here Well asked Murgatroyd anxiously This is it replied Pratt You do a bit now and then as agent for some of these shipping lines You book passages for emigrants and for other people going to New Zealand or Canada or Timbuctoo never mind where Now then couldn t you remember I m sure you could that you booked a passage for Parrawhite to America last November Come It s an easy matter to remember is that for a hundred pounds Murgatroyd s thin fingers trembled a little as he picked up his glass What do you want me to do exactly he asked This said Pratt I want you tomorrow morning early to send a telegram to these people Halstead Byner saint Martin s Chambers London just saying that James Parrawhite left Barford for America on November twenty fourth last and that you can give further information if necessary And what if it is necessary inquired Murgatroyd Then in answer to any letter or telegram of inquiry you ll just say that you knew Parrawhite by sight as a clerk at Eldrick Pascoe s in this town that on November twenty third he told you that he was going to emigrate to America that next day you booked him his passage for which he paid you whatever it was and that he thereupon set off for Liverpool See It s all lies you know muttered Murgatroyd Nobody can find em out anyway replied Pratt That s the one important thing to consider You re safe And if you re cursed with a conscience and it s tender well that ll make a good plaister for it He pointed to the little wad of bank notes and the man sitting at his side followed the pointing finger with hungry eyes Murgatroyd wanted money badly His business always poor was becoming worse his shipping agency rarely produced any result his rent was in arrears he owed money to his neighbour tradesmen he had a wife and young children To such a man a hundred pounds meant relief comfort the lifting of pressure You re sure there s naught wrong in it mister Pratt he asked abruptly and assiduously It ud be a bad job for my family if anything happened to me you know There s naught that will happen answered Pratt confidently Who on earth can contradict you Who knows what people you sell passages to but yourself There s the folks themselves replied Murgatroyd Suppose Parrawhite turns up He won t exclaimed Pratt You know where he is suggested Murgatroyd Not exactly said Pratt But he s left this country for another further off than America That s certain And the folks I referred to don t want any inquiry about him here If I am asked questions later am I to say he booked in his own name inquired Murgatroyd No name of Parsons responded Pratt Here I ll write down for you exactly what I want you to say in the telegram to Halstead Byner and I ll make a few memoranda for you to post you up in case they write for further information I haven t said that I ll do it remarked Murgatroyd I don t like the looks of it It s all a pack of lies Pratt paid no heed to this moral reflection He found some loose paper in his pocket and scribbled on it for a while Then as if accidentally he moved the ash tray and the bank notes beneath it all new gave forth a crisp rustling sound Here you are said Pratt pushing notes and memoranda towards his companion Take the brass man you don t get a job like that every day And Murgatroyd put the money in his pocket and presently went home persuading himself that everything would be all right CHAPTER XXIII SMOOTH FACE AND ANXIOUS BRAIN Byner watched Eldrick and Collingwood inquisitively as they bent over Halstead s telegram He was not surprised when Collingwood merely nodded in silence nor when Eldrick turned excitedly in his own direction There what did I tell you he exclaimed There s been no murder The man left the town Probably Pratt helped him off Couldn t have better proof than that wire What do you take that wire to prove then mister Eldrick asked Byner Take it to prove answered Eldrick Why that Parrawhite booked a passage to America with this man Murgatroyd last November Clear enough that What do you take it to prove mister Collingwood continued the inquiry agent as he turned to the barrister with a smile Before I take it for anything replied Collingwood I want to know who Murgatroyd is Byner looked at Eldrick and laughed Precisely he said Who is Murgatroyd Perhaps mister Eldrick knows I do just know that he s a man who carries on a small watch and clock business in a poorish part of the town and that he has some sort of a shipping agency answered Eldrick But do you mean to imply that whatever message it is that he s sent to your partner in London this morning has not been sent in good faith I don t imply anything answered Byner All I say is before I attach any value to his message I like Collingwood want to know something about the sender He may have been put up to sending it He may be in collusion with somebody Now mister Eldrick you can come in here strongly I don t want to be seen in this affair yet Will you go and see Murgatroyd Tell him his wire to Halstead Byner in London has been communicated to you here Ask him for further particulars and then drop in on me at my hotel and tell me what you ve learnt I ll be found in the smoking room there any time after two thirty onward Eldrick s intense curiosity in what was rapidly becoming a fascinating mystery to him led him to accept this embassy And a little before three o clock he walked into the smoking room at the Central Hotel and discovered Byner in a comfortable corner I ve seen Murgatroyd he whispered as he took an adjacent chair Decent honest enough man very poor I should say He tells a plain enough story Parrawhite whom he knew as one of our clerks told him last November twenty third He was exact about dates then was he interrupted Byner He mentioned them readily enough replied the solicitor But to go on Parrawhite mentioned to him November twenty third last that he wanted to go to America at once Murgatroyd told him about bookings Parrawhite called very early next morning paid for his passage under the name of Parsons and went off en route for Liverpool of course So there you are That s all Murgatroyd could tell inquired Byner That s all he knows answered Eldrick You say Murgatroyd knew Parrawhite as one of your clerks asked Byner after a moment s thought We had some process in hand against this man last autumn replied Eldrick I dare say Parrawhite served him with papers Would he Murgatroyd be likely to know Pratt continued Byner He might in the same connection admitted Eldrick Byner smoked in silence for a while Do you know what I think mister Eldrick he said at last I think Pratt put up Murgatroyd to sending that telegram to us in London this morning You do exclaimed Eldrick Surely And now continued the inquiry agent if you will you can do more much more without appearing to do anything Pratt s office is only a few minutes away Can you drop in there making some excuse and while there mention more or less casually that Parrawhite or information about him is wanted that you and a certain Halstead Byner are advertising for him that you ve just seen Murgatroyd in respect of a communication which he wired to Halstead s this morning and that most important of all a fortune of twenty thousand pounds is awaiting Parrawhite Don t forget the last bit of news Why that particularly asked Eldrick Because answered Byner solemnly I want Pratt to know that the search for Parrawhite is going to be a thorough one Eldrick went off on his second mission promising to return in due course Within a few minutes he was in Pratt s office talking over some unimportant matter of business which he had invented as he went along It was not until he was on the point of departure that he referred to the real reason of his visit Did you notice that Parrawhite is being advertised for he asked suddenly turning on his old clerk Pratt was ready for this had been ready ever since Eldrick walked in He affected a fine surprise Parrawhite he exclaimed Why who s advertising for him Don t you see the newspapers asked Eldrick pointing to some which lay about the room It s in there there s an advertisement of mine and one of Halstead Byner s of London Pratt picked up a Barford paper and looked at the advertisements with a clever affectation of having never seen them before I haven t had much time for newspaper reading this last day or two he remarked Advertisements for him from two quarters Acting together acting together you know replied Eldrick It s those people who really want him Halstead Byner inquiry agents working for a firm of City solicitors I m only local agent as it were Had any response mister Eldrick asked Pratt throwing aside the paper Any one come forward Yes answered Eldrick watching Pratt narrowly without seeming to do so This morning a man named Murgatroyd in Peel Row who does a bit of shipping agency wired to Halstead Byner to say that he booked Parrawhite to New York last November Of course they at once communicated with me and I ve just been to see Murgatroyd He s that man watchmaker we had some proceedings against last year Oh that man said Pratt Thought the name was familiar I remember him And what does he say Just about as much as and little more than he said in his wire to London replied Eldrick Booked Parrawhite to America November twenty fourth last and believes he left for Liverpool there and then Ah remarked Pratt That explains it then Explains what asked Eldrick Pratt gave his old employer a look confidential and significant Explains why he took that money out of your desk he said You remember forty odd pounds He d use some of that for his passage money America eh Now I suppose he s vanished for good then it s not very likely he ll ever be heard of from across there Eldrick laughed meaningly of set purpose We don t know that he s gone there he observed He mightn t get beyond Liverpool you know Anyhow we re going to make a very good search for him here in Barford first We ve nothing but Murgatroyd s word for his having set out for Liverpool What s he wanted for asked Pratt as unconcernedly as possible Been up to something No answered Eldrick as he turned on his heel A relation has left him twenty thousand pounds That s what he s wanted for and why he must be found or his death proved He gave Pratt another quick glance and went off to return to the hotel and Byner to whom he at once gave a faithful account of what had just taken place And he didn t turn a hair he remarked Cool as a cucumber all through If your theory is correct Pratt s a cleverer hand than I ever took him for and I ve always said he was clever Didn t show anything when you mentioned Murgatroyd asked Byner Not a shred of a thing replied Eldrick Nor when you spoke of the twenty thousand pounds No more than what you might call polite and interested surprise Byner laughed threw away the end of a cigar and rose out of his lounging posture Now mister Eldrick he said leaning close to the solicitor between ourselves do you know what I m going to do next which means at once No replied Eldrick The police whispered Byner That s my next move Just now Within a few minutes So will you give me a couple of notes one to the principal man here chief constable or police superintendent or whatever he is and another to the best detective there is here in your opinion They ll save me a lot of trouble Of course if you wish it answered Eldrick But you don t mean to say you re going to have Pratt arrested on what you know up to now Not at all replied Byner Much too soon All I want is detective help of the strictly professional kind No we ll give mister Pratt a little more rope yet for another four and twenty hours say But it ll come Now who is the best local detective a quiet steady fellow who knows how to do his work unobtrusively Prydale s the man said Eldrick Detective Sergeant Prydale I ve had reason to employ him more than once I ll give you a note to him and one to Superintendent Waterson He went over to a writing table and scribbled a few lines on half sheets of notepaper which he enclosed in envelopes and handed to Byner I don t know what line you re taking he said nor where it s going to end exactly But I do know this Pratt never turned a hair when I let out all that to him But if Eldrick went away from his old clerk s fine new offices thinking that Pratt was quite unperturbed and unmoved by the news he had just acquired he was utterly mistaken Pratt was very much perturbed deeply moved not a little frightened He had so schooled himself to keep a straight and ever blank expression of countenance in any sudden change of events that he had shown nothing to Eldrick but he was none the less upset by the solicitor s last announcement Twenty thousand pounds was lying to be picked up by Parrawhite or by Parrawhite s next of kin What an unhappy turn of fortune For the next of kin would never rest until either Parrawhite came to light or it was satisfactorily established that he was dead and if search begun to be made in Barford where might not that search end Unmoved cool if Eldrick had turned back he would have found that Pratt had suddenly given way to a fit of nerves But that soon passed and Pratt began to think He left his office early and betook himself to his favourite gymnasium Exercise did him good he thought a lot while he was exercising And once more instead of going home to dinner he dined in town and he sat late over his dinner in a snug corner of the restaurant and he thought and planned and schemed and after twilight had fallen on Barford he went out and made his way to Peel Row He must see Murgatroyd again at once Half way along Peel Row Pratt stopped suddenly and with sudden fear Out of a side street emerged a man a quiet ordinary looking man whom he knew very well indeed Detective Sergeant Prydale He was accompanied by a smart looking much younger man whom Pratt remembered to have seen in Beck Street that afternoon a stranger to him and to Barford And as he watched these two covered the narrow roadway and walked into Murgatroyd s shop CHAPTER XXIV THE BETTER HALF Under the warming influence of two glasses of rum and water and lulled by Pratt s assurance that all would be well Murgatroyd had carried home his hundred pounds with pretty much the same feeling which permeates a man who having been within measurable distance of drowning suddenly finds a substantial piece of timber drifting his way and takes a firm grip on it After all a hundred pounds was a hundred pounds He would be able to pay his rent and his rates and give something to the grocer and the butcher and the baker and the milkman the children should have some much needed new clothes and boots when all this was done there would be a nice balance left over And it was Pratt s affair when all was said and done and if any trouble arose why Pratt would have to settle it So he ate his supper with the better appetite which Pratt had prophesied and he slept more satisfactorily than usual and next morning he went to the nearest telegraph office and sent off the stipulated telegram to Halstead Byner in London and hoped that there was the end of the matter as far as he was concerned And then shortly after noon in walked mister Eldrick one of the tribe which Murgatroyd dreaded having had various dealings with solicitors in the way of writs and summonses and began to ask questions Murgatroyd emerged from that ordeal very satisfactorily Eldrick s questions were few elementary and easily answered There were no signs of suspicion about him and Murgatroyd breathed more freely when he was gone It seemed to him that the solicitor s visit would certainly wind things up for him Eldrick asked all that could be asked as far as he could see and he had replied now he would probably be bothered no more His spirits had assumed quite a cheerful tone by evening but they received a rude shock when summoned from his little workshop to the front premises he found himself confronting one man whom he certainly knew to be a detective and another who might be one Do what he would he could not conceal some agitation and Detective Sergeant Prydale a shrewdly observant man noticed it and affected not to Evening mister Murgatroyd he said cheerily We ve come to see if you can give us a bit of information You ve had mister Eldrick the lawyer here today on the same business You know this affair of an old clerk of his Parrawhite I told mister Eldrick all I know muttered Murgatroyd Very likely replied Prydale but there s a few questions this gentleman and myself would like to ask Can we come in Murgatroyd fetched his wife to mind the shop and took the callers into the parlour which she had unwillingly vacated He knew Prydale by sight and reputation about Byner he wondered Finally he set him down as a detective from London and was all the more afraid of him What do you want to know he asked when the three men were alone I don t think there s anything that I didn t tell mister Eldrick Oh there s a great deal that mister Eldrick didn t ask said Prydale mister Eldrick sort of just skirted round things like We want to know a bit more This Parrawhite s got to be found d ye see mister Murgatroyd and as you seem to be the last man who had aught to do with him in Barford why naturally we come to you Now to start with you say he came to you about getting a passage to America Just so now when would that be Day before he did get it answered Murgatroyd rapidly thinking over the memoranda which Pratt had jotted down for his benefit That said Prydale would be on the twenty third Yes replied Murgatroyd twenty third November of course What time now on the twenty third asked the detective Time said Murgatroyd Oh in the evening Bit vague remarked Prydale What time in the evening As near as I can recollect replied Murgatroyd it ud be just about half past eight I was thinking of closing Ah said Prydale with a glance at Byner who had already told him of Parrawhite s presence at the Green Man on the other side of the town a good two miles away at the hour which Murgatroyd mentioned Ah he was here in your shop at half past eight on the evening of November twenty third last Asking about a ticket to America New York muttered Murgatroyd And he came next morning and bought one asked the detective I told mister Eldrick that said Murgatroyd a little sullenly How much did it cost inquired Byner Eight pound ten replied Murgatroyd Usual price What did he pay for it in continued Prydale He gave me a ten pound note and I gave him thirty shillings change answered Murgatroyd Just so assented Prydale Now what line might that be by Murgatroyd was becoming uneasy under all these questions and his uneasiness was deepened by the way in which both his visitors watched him He was a man who would have been a bad witness in any case nervous ill at ease suspicious inclined to boggle and in this instance he was being forced to invent answers It was oh the Royal Atlantic he answered at last I ve an agency for them So I noticed from the bills and placards in your window observed the detective And of course you issue these tickets on their paper I ve seen em before You fill up particulars on a form and a counterfoil don t you And you send a copy of those particulars to the Royal Atlantic offices at Liverpool Murgatroyd nodded silently this was much more than he bargained for and he did not know how much further it was going And Prydale gave him a sudden searching look Can you show us the counterfoil in this instance he asked Murgatroyd flushed But he managed to get out a fairly quick reply No I can t he answered I sent that book back at the end of the year Oh well they ll have it at Liverpool observed Prydale We can get at it there Of course they ll have your record of the entire transaction He d be down on their passenger list under the name of Parsons I think mister Murgatroyd He gave me that name said Murgatroyd Prydale gave Byner a look and both rose I think that s about all said the detective Of course our next inquiry will be at Liverpool at the Royal Atlantic Thank you mister Murgatroyd much obliged Before the watchmaker could collect himself sufficiently to say or ask more Prydale and his companion had walked out of the shop and gone away And then Murgatroyd realized that he was in for but he did not know what he was in for What he did know was that if Prydale went or sent over to Liverpool the whole thing would burst like a bubble For the Royal Atlantic people would tell the detectives at once that no passenger named Parsons had sailed under their auspices on November twenty fourth last and that he Murgatroyd had been telling a pack of lies missus Murgatroyd a sharp featured woman whose wits had been sharpened by a ten years daily acquaintance with poverty came out of the shop into the parlour and looked searchingly at her husband What did them fellows want she demanded I knew one of em Prydale the detective Now what s up Reuben More trouble Murgatroyd hesitated a moment Then he told his wife the whole story concealing nothing If they go to the Royal Atlantic it ll all come out he groaned I couldn t make any excuse or explanation anyhow What s to be done You should ha had naught to do wi that Pratt exclaimed missus Murgatroyd A scoundrelly fellow to come and tempt poor folk to do his dirty work Where s the money Locked up answered Murgatroyd I haven t touched a penny of it I thought I d wait a bit and see if aught happened But he assured me it was all right and you know as well as I do that a hundred pound doesn t come our way every day We want money Not at that price said his wife You can pay too much for money my lad I wish you d told me what that Pratt was after he should have heard a bit o my tongue If I d only known Just then the shop door opened and Pratt walked in He at once saw Murgatroyd and his wife standing between shop and parlour and realized at a glance that his secret in this instance was his no longer Well he said walking up to the watchmaker You ve had Prydale here and you d Eldrick this morning Of course you knew what to say to both I wish we d never had you here last night young man exclaimed missus Murgatroyd fiercely What right have you to come here making trouble for folk that s got plenty already But at any rate ours was honest trouble Yours is like to land my husband in dishonesty if it hasn t done so already And if my husband had only spoken to me Just let your husband speak a bit now interrupted Pratt almost insolently It s you that s making all the trouble or noise anyhow There s naught to fuss about missis What s upset you Murgatroyd They re going to the Royal Atlantic people muttered the watchmaker Of course it ll all come out then They know that I never booked any Parsons nor anybody else for that matter last November You should ha thought o that Pratt realized that the man was right He had never thought of that never anticipated that inquiry would go beyond Murgatroyd But his keen wits at once set to work What s the system he asked quickly Tell me what s done when you book anybody like that Come on explain quick Murgatroyd turned to a drawer and pulled out a book and some papers It s simple enough he said I ve this book of forms d ye see I fill up this form sort of ticket or pass for the passenger and hand it to him it s a receipt as well to him Then I enter the same particulars on that counterfoil Then I fill up one of these papers giving just the same particulars and post it at once to the Company with the passage money less my commission When one of these books is finished I return the counterfoils to Liverpool they check em Prydale s up to all that He asked to see the counterfoil in this case I had to say I hadn t got it I d sent it to the Company Of course he ll find out that I didn t Lies said missus Murgatroyd vindictively And they didn t start wi us neither Who was that other man with Prydale asked Pratt London detective I should say answered the watchmaker And judging by the way he watched me a sharp un too What impression did you get altogether demanded Pratt Why that they re going to sift this affair whatever it is right down to the bottom exclaimed Murgatroyd They re either going to find Parrawhite or get to know what became of him That s my impression And what am I going to do now This ll lose me what bit of business I ve done with yon shipping firm Nothing of the sort answered Pratt scornfully Don t be a fool You re all right You listen to me You write straight off to the Royal Atlantic Tell em you had some inquiry made about a man named Parsons who booked a passage with you for New York last November Say that on looking up your books you found that you unaccountably forgot to send them the forms for him and his passage money Make out a form for that date and crumple it up as if it had been left lying in a drawer Enclose the money in it here I ll give you ten pounds to cover it he went on drawing a bank note from his purse Get it off at once you ve time now plenty to catch the night mail at the General And then d ye see you re all right It s only a case then as far as you re concerned of forgetfulness What s that we all forget something in business now and then They ll overlook that when they get the money Aye but you re forgetting something now remarked Murgatroyd You re forgetting this no such passenger ever went They ll know that by their passenger lists What the devil has that to do with it snarled Pratt impatiently What the devil do we care whether any such passenger went or not All that you re concerned about is to prove that you issued a ticket to Parrawhite under the name of Parsons What s it matter to you where Parrawhite alias Parsons went when he d once left your shop You naturally thought he d go straight to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Station on his way to Liverpool and New York But for aught you know he may have fallen down a drain pipe in the next street Don t you see man There s nothing there s nobody not all the detectives in London and Barford can prove that you didn t issue a ticket to Parrawhite on that date It isn t up to you to prove that you did it s up to them to prove that you didn t And they can t It s impossible You get that letter off at once to Liverpool with that money inside it and you re as safe as houses and your hundred pounds as well Get it done And if those chaps come asking any more questions tell em you re not going to answer a single one Mind you do what I tell you and you re safe With that Pratt walked out of the shop and went off towards the centre of the town inwardly raging and disturbed It was very evident that these people meant to find Parrawhite alive or dead evident too that they had called in the aid of the Barford police And in spite of all his assurances to the watchmaker and his suggestion for the next move Pratt was far from easy about the whole matter He would have been easier if he had known who Prydale s companion was probably he was as Murgatroyd had suggested a London detective who might have been making inquiries in the town for some time and knew much more than he Pratt could surmise That was the devil of the whole thing in Pratt s opinion Adept himself in working underground he feared people who adopted the same tactics What was this stranger chap after What did he know What was he doing Had he let Eldrick know anything Was there a web of detectives already being spun around himself Was that silly unfortunate affair with Parrawhite being slowly brought to light to wreck him on the very beginning of what he meant to be a brilliant career He cursed Parrawhite again and again as he left Peel Row behind him The events of the day had made Pratt cautious as well as anxious He decided to keep away from his lodgings that night and when he reached the centre of the town he took a room at a quiet hotel He was up early next morning he had breakfasted by eight o clock by half past eight he was at his office And in his letter box he found one letter a thickish package which had not come by post but had been dropped in by hand and was merely addressed to mister Pratt Pratt tore that package open with a conviction of imminent disaster He pulled out a sheet of cheap note paper and a wad of bank notes His face worked curiously as he read a few lines scrawled in illiterate female handwriting mister PRATT My husband and me don t want any more to do with either you or your money which it is enclosed Been honest up to now though poor and intending to remain so our purpose is to make a clean breast of everything to the police first thing tomorrow morning for which you have nobody but yourself to blame for wickedness in tempting poor people to do wrong Yours missus MURGATROYD CHAPTER XXV DRY SHERRY Pratt wasted no time in cursing missus Murgatroyd There would be plenty of opportunity for such relief to his feelings later on Just then he had other matters to occupy him fully 
6248-298838-0001	train-other-500	He tore the indignant letter to shreds he hastily thrust the bank notes into one pocket and drew his keys from another Within five minutes he had taken from his safe a sealed packet which he placed in an inside pocket of his coat and had left his office
6248-298838-0002	train-other-500	for the last time as he knew very well That part of the game was up and it was necessary to be smart in entering on another phase of it Since Eldrick s visit of the previous day Pratt had been prepared for all eventuality
6248-298838-0003	train-other-500	He had made ready for flight And he was not going empty handed He had a considerable amount of missus Mallathorpe s money in his possession by obtaining her signature to one or two documents he could easily obtain much more in London at an hour s notice
6248-298838-0004	train-other-500	Those documents were all ready and in the sealed packet which he had just taken from the safe in it too were some other documents John Mallathorpe s will the letter which missus Mallathorpe had written to him on the evening previous to her son s fatal accident
6248-298838-0005	train-other-500	and the power of attorney which Pratt had obtained from her at his first interview after that occurrence All was ready and now there was nothing to do but to get to Normandale Grange see missus Mallathorpe and vanish
6248-298838-0006	train-other-500	He had planned it all out carefully when he perceived the first danger signals and knew that his other plans and schemes were doomed to failure Half an hour at Normandale Grange a journey to London
none	none	 a couple of hours in the City 
6248-298838-0007	train-other-500	and then the next train to the Continent on his way to regions much further off Here things had turned out badly unexpectedly badly but he would carry away considerable easily transported wealth to a new career in a new country
6248-298838-0008	train-other-500	Pratt began his flight in methodical fashion He locked up his office and left the building by a back entrance which took him into a network of courts and alleys at the rear of the business part of Barford
6248-298838-0009	train-other-500	He made his way in and out of these places until he reached a bicycle dealer s shop in an obscure street whereat he had left a machine of his own on the previous evening under the excuse of having it thoroughly cleaned and oiled It was all ready for him on his arrival
6248-298838-0010	train-other-500	and he presently mounted it and rode away through the outskirts of the town carefully choosing the less frequented streets and roads He rode on until he was clear of Barford until in fact he was some miles from it
6248-298838-0011	train-other-500	and had reached a village which was certainly not on the way to Normandale And then at the post office he dismounted and going inside wrote out and dispatched a telegram It was a brief message containing but three words One as usual
6248-298838-0012	train-other-500	and it was addressed Esther Mawson The Grange Normandale This done he remounted his bicycle rode out of the village
none	none	 and turned across country 
6248-298838-0013	train-other-500	in quite a different direction It was not yet ten o clock he had three hours to spare before the time came for keeping the appointment which he had just made At an early stage of his operations Pratt had found that even the cleverest of schemers cannot work unaided
6248-298838-0014	train-other-500	It had been absolutely necessary to have some tool close at hand to Normandale Grange and its inhabitants to have some person there upon whom he could depend for news He had found that person that tool in Esther Mawson
6248-298838-0015	train-other-500	who as missus Mallathorpe s maid had opportunities which he at once recognized as being likely to be of the greatest value to him The circumstances of Harper Mallathorpe s death had thrown Pratt and the maid together and he had quickly discovered that she was to be bought
6248-298838-0016	train-other-500	and would do anything for money He had soon come to an understanding with her soon bargained with her and made her a willing accomplice in certain of his schemes without letting her know their full meaning and extent all indeed that she had learned from Pratt
6248-298838-0017	train-other-500	was that he had some considerable hold on her mistress But it is dangerous work to play with edged tools and if Pratt had only known it he was running great risks in using Esther Mawson as a semi accomplice Esther Mawson was in constant touch with her mistress
6248-298838-0018	train-other-500	and missus Mallathorpe afraid of her daughter and not greatly in sympathy with her badly needed a confidante Little by little the mistress began to confide in the maid and before long Esther Mawson knew the secret and thenceforward she played a double game
6248-298838-0019	train-other-500	Pratt found her useful in arranging meetings with missus Mallathorpe unknown to Nesta and he believed her to be devoted to him But the truth was that Esther Mawson had only one object of devotion herself
6248-298838-0020	train-other-500	and she was waiting and watching for an opportunity to benefit that object at Pratt s expense Pratt knew nothing of this as he slowly made his way to Normandale that morning Having plenty of time he went by devious and lonely roads and by lanes
6248-298838-0021	train-other-500	Eventually he came to the boundary of Normandale Park at a point far away from the Grange There he dismounted hid his bicycle in a coppice wherein he had often left it before and went on towards the house through the woods and plantations
6248-298838-0022	train-other-500	He knew every yard of the ground he traversed and was skilled in taking cover if he saw any sign of woodman or gamekeeper And in the end just as one o clock chimed from the clock over the stables he came to a quiet spot in the shrubberies behind the Grange and found Esther Mawson
none	none	 waiting for him in an old summer house in which they had met on previous 
6248-298838-0023	train-other-500	and similar occasions Esther Mawson immediately realized that something unusual was in the air Clever as Pratt was at concealing his feelings she was cleverer in seeing small signs and she saw that this was no ordinary visit Anything wrong
6248-298838-0024	train-other-500	she asked at once Bit of bother nothing much it ll blow over answered Pratt who knew that a certain amount of candour was necessary in dealing with this woman But I shall have to be away for a bit
none	none	 week or two perhaps 
6248-298838-0025	train-other-500	You want to see her inquired Esther Of course I ve some papers for her to sign replied Pratt How do things stand Coast clear Miss Mallathorpe s going into Barford after lunch answered Esther
6248-298838-0026	train-other-500	She ll be driving in about half past two I can manage it then How long shall you want to be with
none	none	 her Oh a quarter of an hour ll do said Pratt 
6248-298838-0027	train-other-500	Ten minutes if it comes to that And after that asked Esther Then I want to get a train at Scaleby replied Pratt mentioning a railway junction which lay ten miles across country in another direction So make it as soon after two thirty as you can
6248-298838-0028	train-other-500	You can see her as soon as Miss Mallathorpe s gone said Esther You d better come into the house I ve got the key of the turret door and all s clear the servants are all at dinner I could do with something myself observed Pratt who in his anxiety
none	none	 had only made a light breakfast that morning Can it be managed I ll manage it she answered Come on now Behind the summer house in which they had met a narrow path led through the shrubberies to an old part of the Grange which was never used and was in fact partly ruinous 
6248-298838-0029	train-other-500	Esther Mawson led the way along this until she and Pratt came to a turret in the grey walls in the lower story of which a massive oaken door heavily clamped with iron gave entrance to a winding stair locked it from inside when she and Pratt had entered
6248-298838-0030	train-other-500	and preceded her companion up the stair and across one or two empty and dust covered chambers to a small room in which a few pieces of ancient furniture were slowly dropping to decay Pratt had taken refuge in this room before and he sat down in one of the old chairs
6248-298838-0031	train-other-500	and mopped his forehead I want something to drink above everything he remarked What can you get Nothing but wine answered Esther Mawson As much as you like of that because I ve a stock that s kept up in missus Mallathorpe s room
6248-298838-0032	train-other-500	I couldn t get any ale without going to the butler I can get wine and sandwiches without anybody knowing That ll do said Pratt What sort of wine Port sherry claret she replied Whichever you like Sherry then answered Pratt
6248-298838-0033	train-other-500	Bring a bottle if you can get it I want a good drink The woman went away through the disused part of the old house into the modern portion She went straight to a certain store closet and took from it a bottle of old dry sherry which had been brought there from a bin in the cellars
6248-298838-0034	train-other-500	it was part of a quantity of fine wine laid down by John Mallathorpe years before and its original owner would have been disgusted to think that it should ever be used for the mere purpose of quenching thirst But Esther Mawson
none	none	 had another purpose in view with respect to that bottle 
6248-298838-0035	train-other-500	Carrying it to her own sitting room she carefully cut off the thick mass of sealing wax at its neck drew the cork and poured a little of the wine away And that done she unlocked a small box which stood on a corner of her dressing table
none	none	 and took from it a glass phial half full of a colourless liquid With steady hands and sure fingers she dropped some of that liquid into the wine carefully counting the drops Then she restored the phial to its hiding place and re locked the box after which taking up a spoon which lay on her table she poured out a little of the sherry and smelled and tasted it No smell other than that which ought to be there no taste other than was proper 
6248-298838-0036	train-other-500	Pratt would suspect nothing even if he drunk the whole bottle Esther Mawson had anticipated Pratt s desires in the way of refreshment and she now went to a cupboard and took from it a plate of sandwiches carefully swathed in a napkin
none	none	 Carrying these in one hand and the bottle of sherry and a glass in the other 
6248-298838-0037	train-other-500	she stole quietly back to the disused part of the house and set her provender before its expectant consumer Pratt poured out a glassful of the sherry and drank it eagerly
none	none	 Good stuff that he remarked smacking his lips 
6248-298838-0038	train-other-500	Some of old John Mallathorpe s no doubt It was here when we came anyhow replied Esther Well I shall have to go
none	none	 You ll be all right until I come back What time do you think it ll be asked Pratt Make it as soon as the coast s clear I want to be off As soon as ever she s gone 
6248-298838-0039	train-other-500	agreed Esther I heard her order the carriage for half past two
none	none	 And no fear of anybody else being about 
6248-298838-0040	train-other-500	asked Pratt That butler man for instance Or servants I ll see to it replied Esther reassuringly I ll lock this door and take the key until I come back make yourself comfortable She locked Pratt in the old room and went off
6248-298838-0041	train-other-500	and the willing prisoner ate his sandwiches and drank his sherry and looked out of a mullioned window on the wide stretches of park and coppice and the breezy moorlands beyond He indulged in some reflections not wholly devoid of sentiment
6248-298838-0042	train-other-500	He had cherished dreams of becoming the virtual owner of Normandale Always confident in his own powers he had believed that with time and patience he could have persuaded Nesta Mallathorpe to marry him why not Now
6248-298838-0043	train-other-500	all owing to that cursed and unfortunate contretemps with Parrawhite that seemed utterly impossible all he could do now was to save himself and to take as much as he could get More than once that morning as he made his way across country
6248-298838-0044	train-other-500	he had remembered Parrawhite s advice to take cash and be done with it perhaps he reflected it might have been better Still when he presently began his final retreat he would carry away with him a lot of the Mallathorpe money
6248-298838-0045	train-other-500	But before long Pratt indulged in no more reflections sentiment or practical He had eaten all his sandwiches he had drunk three quarters of the bottle of sherry And suddenly he felt unusually drowsy and he laid his head back in his big chair
none	none	 and fell soundly asleep CHAPTER XXVI THE TELEPHONE MESSAGE If Pratt had only known what was going on in the old quarries at Whitcliffe about the very time that he was riding slowly out to Barford on his bicycle he would not only have accelerated his pace but would have taken good care to have chosen another route he would also have made haste to exchange bicycle for railway train as quickly as possible and to have got himself far away before anybody could begin looking for him in his usual haunts or at places wherein there was a possibility of his being found But Pratt knew nothing of what Byner had done He was conscious of Byner s visit to the Green Man He did not know what Pickard had been told by Bill Thomson He was unaware of anything which Pickard had told to Byner If he had known that Byner guided by Pickard had been to the old quarries had fixed his inquiring eye on the shaft which was filled to its brim with water and had got certain ideas from the mere sight of it Pratt would have hastened to put hundreds of miles between himself and Barford as quickly as possible But all that Pratt knew was that there was a possibility of suspicion which might materialize eventually but not immediately On the previous evening Pratt had he but known it made a great mistake Instead of going into Murgatroyd s shop after he had watched Byner and Prydale away from it he should have followed those two astute and crafty persons and have ascertained something of their movements Had he done so he would certainly not have troubled to return to Peel Row nor to remain in Barford an hour longer than was absolutely necessary For Pratt was sharp witted enough when it came to a question of putting one and two together and if he had tracked Prydale and the unknown man who was with him to a certain house whereto they repaired as soon as they quitted Murgatroyd s shop he would have drawn an inference from the mere fact of their visit which would have thrown him into a cold sweat of fear But Pratt after all was only one man one brain one body and could not be in two places nor go in two ways at the same time He took his own way ignorant of his destruction Byner also took a way of his own As soon as he and Prydale left Murgatroyd s shop they chartered the first cab they met with and ordered its driver to go to Whitcliffe Moor It s the quickest thing to do if my theory s correct observed Byner as they drove along Of course it is all theory mere theory But I ve grounds for it The place the time mere lonely situation that scrap iron lying about which would be so useful in weighting a dead body I tell you I shall be surprised if we don t find Parrawhite at the bottom of that water I shouldn t wonder agreed Prydale One thing s very certain as we shall prove before we re through with it Pratt s put that poor devil Murgatroyd up to this passage to America business And a bit clumsily too fancy Murgatroyd being no better posted up than to tell me that Parrawhite called on him at a certain hour that night But you ve got to remember that Pratt didn t know of Parrawhite s affairs with Pickard nor that he was at the Green Man at that hour rejoined Byner My belief is that Pratt thinks himself safe that he fancies he s provided for all contingencies If things turn out as I think they will I believe we shall find Pratt calmly seated at his desk tomorrow morning Well if things do turn out as you expect we ll lose no time in seeking him there observed Prydale dryly We d better arrange to get the job done first thing This mister Shepherd ll make no objection I suppose asked Byner Objection Lor bless you he ll love it exclaimed Prydale It ll be a bit of welcome diversion to a man like him that s naught to do He ll object none not he Shepherd a retired quarry owner who lived in a picturesque old stone house in the middle of Whitcliffe Moor with nothing to occupy his attention but the growing of roses and vegetables and an occasional glance at the local newspapers listened to Prydale s request with gradually rising curiosity Byner had at once seen that this call was welcome to this bluff and hearty Yorkshireman who without any question as to their business had immediately welcomed them to his hearth and pressed liquor and cigars on them he sized up Shepherd as a man to whom any sort of break in the placid course of retired life was a delightful event A dead man i that old shaft i one o my worked out quarries he exclaimed Ye don t mean to say so An how long d yer think he might ha been there now Prydale Some months mister Shepherd replied the detective Why then it s high time he were taken out said Shepherd When might you be thinkin o doin t job like As soon as possible said Prydale Tomorrow morning early if that s convenient to you I ll tell you what I ll do observed the retired quarry owner You leave t job to me I ll get two or three men first thing tomorrow morning and we ll do it reight You be up there by half past eight o clock and we ll soon satisfy you as to whether there s owt i t shape of a dead man or not i t pit You hev grounds for believin at theer is what Strong grounds replied the detective and equally strong ones for believing the man came there by foul play too Say no more said Shepherd T mystery shall be cleared up Deary me An to think at I ve walked past yon theer pit many a dozen times within this last few o months and nivver dreamed at theer wor owt in it but watter Howivver gentlemen ye can put yer minds at ease we ll investigate the circumstances as the sayin goes before noon tomorrow One other matter remarked Prydale We want things kept quiet We don t want all the folk of the neighbourhood round about you know Leave it to me answered Shepherd There ll be me and these men and yourselves and a pair of grapplin irons We ll do it quiet and comfortable and we ll do it reight Odd character remarked Byner when he and Prydale went away Useful man for a job of that sort said the detective laconically Now then are we going to let anybody else know what we re after mister Eldrick or mister Collingwood for instance Do you want them or either of them to be present No answered Byner after a moment s reflection Let us see what results We can let them know soon enough if we ve anything to tell But what about Pratt Keeping an eye on him you mean said Prydale You said just now that in your opinion we should find him at his desk Just so but that s no reason why he shouldn t be looked after tomorrow morning answered Byner All right I ll put a man on to shadow him from the time he leaves his lodgings until until we want him said the detective That is if we do want him It will be one of the biggest surprises I ever had in my life if we don t asserted Byner I never felt more certain of anything than I do of finding Parrawhite s body in that pit It was this certainty which made Byner appear extraordinarily cool and collected when next day about noon he walked into Eldrick s private room where Collingwood was at that moment asking the solicitor what was being done The certainty was now established and it seemed to Byner that it would have been a queer thing if he had not always had it He closed the door and gave the two men an informing glance Parrawhite s body has been found he said quietly Eldrick started in his chair and Collingwood looked a sharp inquiry Little doubt about his having been murdered just as I conjectured continued Byner And his murderer had pretty cleverly weighted his body with scrap iron before dropping it into a pit full of water where it might have remained for a long time undiscovered However that s settled Eldrick got out the first question Pratt Prydale s after him answered Byner I expect we shall hear something in a few minutes if he s in town But I confess I m a bit doubtful and anxious now on that score Because when Prydale and I got down from Whitcliffe half an hour ago where the body s now lying at the Green Man awaiting the inquest we found Murgatroyd hanging about the police station He d come to make a clean breast of it about Pratt And it unfortunately turns out that Pratt saw Prydale and me go to Murgatroyd s shop last night and afterwards went in there himself and of course pumped Murgatroyd dry as to why we d been Why unfortunately asked Collingwood Because that would warn Pratt that something was afoot said Byner And he may have disappeared during the night He But just then Prydale came in shaking his head I m afraid he s off he announced I d a man watching for him outside his lodgings from an early hour this morning but he never came out and finally my man made an excuse and asked for him there and then he heard that he d never been home last night And his office is closed What steps are you taking asked Byner I ve got men all over the place already replied Prydale But if he got off in the night as I m afraid he did we shan t find him in Barford It s a most unlucky thing that he saw us go to Murgatroyd s last evening That of course would set him off he d know things were reaching a crisis Eldrick and Collingwood had arranged to lunch together that day and they presently went off asking the detective to keep them informed of events But up to half past three o clock they heard no more then as they were returning along the street Byner came running up to them Prydale s just had a telephone message from the butler at Normandale he exclaimed Pratt is there and something extraordinary is going on the butler wants the police We re off at once there s Prydale in a motor waiting for me Will you follow He darted away again and Eldrick looking round for a car suddenly recognized the Mallathorpe livery Great Scott he said There s Miss Mallathorpe just driving in Better tell her A moment later he and Collingwood had joined Nesta in her carriage and the horses heads were turned in the direction towards which Byner and Prydale were already hastening CHAPTER XXVII RESTORED TO ENERGY Esther Mawson leaving Pratt to enjoy his sherry and sandwiches at his leisure went away through the house out into the gardens and across the shrubbery to the stables The coachman and grooms were at dinner with the exception of one man who lived in a cottage at the entrance to the stable yard This was the very man she wanted to see and she found him in the saddle room and beckoned him to its door missus Mallathorpe wants me to go over to Scaleby on an errand for her this afternoon she said Can you have the dog cart ready at the South Garden gate at three o clock sharp And without saying anything to the coachman It s a private errand Of late this particular groom had received several commissions of this sort and being a sharp fellow he had observed that they were generally given to him when Miss Mallathorpe was out All right he answered The young missis is going out in the carriage at half past two South Garden gate three sharp Anybody but you Only me replied Esther Don t say anything to anybody about where we re going Get the dog cart ready after the carriage has gone The groom nodded in comprehension and Esther went back to the house and to her own room She ought at that time of day to have been eating her dinner with the rest of the upper servants but she had work to do which was of much more importance than the consumption of food and drink There was going to be a flight that afternoon but it would not be Pratt who would undertake it Esther Mawson had carefully calculated all her chances as soon as Pratt told her that he was going to be away for a while She knew that Pratt would not have left Barford for any indefinite period unless something had gone seriously wrong But she knew more by inference and intuition If Pratt was going away rather since he was going away he would have on his person things of value documents money She meant to gain possession of everything that he had she meant to have a brief interview with missus Mallathorpe then she meant to drive to Scaleby and to leave that part of the country just as thoroughly and completely as Pratt had meant to leave it And now in her own room she was completing her preparations There was little to do She knew that if her venture came off successfully she could easily afford to leave her personal possessions behind her and that she would be all the more free and unrestricted in her movements if she departed without as much as a change of clothes and linen And so by two o clock she had arrayed herself in a neat and unobtrusive tailor made travelling costume had put on an equally neat and plain hat had rolled her umbrella and laid it her gloves and a cloak where they could be readily picked up and had attached to her slim waist a hand bag by means of a steel chain which she secured by a small padlock as soon as she had arranged it to her satisfaction She was not the sort of woman to leave a hand bag lying about in a railway carriage at any time but in this particular instance she was not going to run any risk of even a moment s forgetfulness Everything was in readiness by twenty minutes past two and she took up her position in a window from which she could see the front door of the house At half past two the carriage and its two fine bay horses came round from the stables a minute or two later Nesta Mallathorpe emerged from the hall yet another minute and the carriage was whirling down the park in the direction of Barford And then Esther moved from the window picked up the umbrella the cloak the gloves and went off in the direction of the room wherein she had left Pratt No one ever went near those old rooms except on some special errand or business and there was a dead silence all around her as she turned the key in the lock and slipped inside the door to lock it again as soon as she had entered There was an equally deep silence within the room and for a moment she glanced a little fearfully at the recumbent figure in the old deep backed chair Pratt had stretched himself fully in his easy quarters his legs lay extended across the moth eaten hearth rug his head and shoulders were thrown far back against the faded tapestry and he was so still that he might have been supposed to be dead But Esther Mawson had tried the effect of that particular drug on a good many people and she knew that the victim in this instance was merely plunged in a sleep from which nothing whatever could wake him yet awhile And after one searching glance at him and one lifting of an eyelid by a practised finger she went rapidly and thoroughly through Pratt s pockets and within a few minutes of entering the room had cleared them of everything they contained The sealed packet which he had taken from his safe that morning the bank notes which missus Murgatroyd had returned in her indignant letter another roll of notes of considerable value in a note case a purse containing notes and gold to a large amount all those she laid one by one on a dust covered table And finally and as calmly as if she were sorting linen she swept bank notes gold and purse into her steel chained bag and tore open the sealed envelope There were five documents in that envelope Esther examined each with meticulous care The first was an authority to Linford Pratt to sell certain shares standing in the name of Ann Mallathorpe The second was a similar document relating to other shares each was complete save for Ann Mallathorpe s signature The third document was the power of attorney which Ann Mallathorpe had given to Linford Pratt the fourth the letter which she had written to him on the evening before the fatal accident to Harper And the fifth was John Mallathorpe s will At last she held in her hand the half sheet of foolscap paper of which missus Mallathorpe driven to distraction and knowing that she would get no sympathy from her own daughter had told her She was a woman of a quick and an understanding mind and she had read the will through and grasped its significance as swiftly as her eyes ran over it And those eyes turned to the unconscious Pratt with a flash of contempt she at any rate would not follow his foolish example and play for too high a stake no she would make hay while the sun shone its hottest She was of the Parrawhite persuasion better far better one good bird in the hand than a score of possible birds in the bush She presently restored the five documents to the stout envelope picked up her other belongings and without so much as a glance at Pratt left the room She turned the key in the door and took it away with her And now she went straight to a certain sitting room which missus Mallathorpe had tenanted by day ever since her illness The final and most important stage of Esther s venture was at hand missus Mallathorpe sat at an open window wearily gazing out on the park Ever since her son s death she had remained in a more or less torpid condition rarely talking to any person except Esther Mawson it had been manifest from the first that her daughter s presence distressed and irritated her and by the doctor s advice Nesta had gone to her as little as possible while taking every care to guard her and see to her comfort All day long she sat brooding and only Esther Mawson now for some time in her full confidence knew that her brooding was rapidly developing into a monomania missus Mallathorpe indeed had but one thought in her mind the eventual circumventing of Pratt and the destruction of John Mallathorpe s will She turned slowly as the maid came in and carefully closed the door behind her and her voice was irritable and querulous as she at once began to complain You ve never been near me for two hours she said Your dinner time was over long since I might have been wanting all sorts of things for aught you cared I ve had something else to do for you retorted Esther coming close to her mistress Listen now I ve got it missus Mallathorpe s attitude and manner suddenly changed She caught sight of the packet of papers in the woman s hand and at once sprang to her feet white and trembling Instinctively she held out her own hands and moved a little nearer to the maid And Esther quickly put the table between them and shook her head No no she exclaimed No handling of anything yet You keep your hands off You were ready enough to bargain with Pratt now you ll have to bargain with me But I m not such a fool as he was I ll take cash down and be done with it missus Mallathorpe rested her trembling hands on the table and bent forward across it Is it is it really the will she whispered hoarsely Instead of replying in words Esther taking care to keep at a safe distance behind the table and with the door only a yard or two in her rear drew out the documents one by one and held them up The will she said Your letter to Pratt The power of attorney Two papers that he brought for you to sign That s the lot And now as I said we ll bargain Where is he asked missus Mallathorpe How how did you get them Does he know did he give them up If you want to know he s safe and sound asleep in one of the rooms in the old part of the house answered Esther I drugged him There s something afoot something gone wrong with his schemes at Barford and he came here on his way elsewhere And so I took the chance Now then what are you going to give me missus Mallathorpe whose nervous agitation was becoming more and more marked wrung her hands I ve nothing to give she cried You know very well he s had the management of everything I don t know how things are Stuff exclaimed Esther I know better than that You ve a lot of ready money in that desk there you know you drew a lot out of the bank some time ago and it s there now You kept it for a contingency the contingency s here And you ve your rings the diamond and ruby rings I know what they re worth Come on now I mean to have the whole lot so it s no use hesitating missus Mallathorpe looked at the maid s bold and resolute eyes and then at the papers And she glanced from eyes and papers to a bright fire which burned in the grate close by You ll give everything up she asked nervously Put those bank notes that you ve got in your desk and those rings that are in your jewel case on the table between us answered Esther and I ll hand over these papers on the instant I m not going to be such a fool as to keep them not I Come on now isn t this the chance you ve wanted missus Mallathorpe drew a small bunch of keys from her gown and went over to the desk which Esther had pointed to Within a minute she was back again at the table a roll of bank notes in one hand half a dozen magnificent rings in the other She put both hands halfway across and unclasped them And Esther Mawson with a light laugh threw the papers over the table and hastily swept their price into her handbag missus Mallathorpe s nerves suddenly became steady With a deep sigh she caught up the various documents and looked them quickly and thoroughly over Then she tore them into fragments and flung the fragments in the fire and as they blazed up she turned and looked at Esther Mawson in a way which made Esther shrink a little But she was already at the door and she opened it and walked out and down the stair She was half way across the hall beneath where the butler and one of the footmen were idly talking when a sharp cry from above made her then look up missus Mallathorpe suddenly restored to life and energy was leaning over the balustrade Stop that woman you men she said Seize her Fasten her up lock the door wherever you put her She s stolen my rings and a lot of money out of my desk And telephone instantly to Barford and tell them to send the police here at once CHAPTER XXVIII THE WOMAN IN BLACK Nesta Mallathorpe who had just arrived in Barford when Eldrick caught sight of her was seriously startled as he and Collingwood came running up to her carriage The solicitor entered it without ceremony or explanation and turning to the coachman bade him drive back to Normandale as fast as he could make his horses go Meanwhile Collingwood turned to Nesta Don t be alarmed he said Something is happening at the Grange your mother has just telephoned to the police here to go there at once there they are in front of us in that car Did my mother say if she was in danger demanded Nesta She can t be exclaimed Eldrick turning from the coachman as the horses were whipped round and the carriage moved off She evidently gave orders for the message No Pratt s there And but of course you don t know the police want Pratt They ve been searching for him since noon He s wanted for murder Don t frighten Miss Mallathorpe said Collingwood The murder has nothing to do with present events he went on reassuringly It s something that happened some time ago Don t be afraid about your mother there are plenty of people round her you know I can t help feeling anxious if Pratt is there she answered How did he come to be there It s not an hour since I left home This is all some of Esther Mawson s work And we shall have to wait nearly an hour before we know what is going on it s all uphill work to Normandale and the horses can t do it in the time Eldrick said Collingwood as the carriage came abreast of the Central Station and a long line of motorcars Stop the coachman Let s get one of those cars we shall get to Normandale twice as quickly The main thing is to relieve Miss Mallathorpe of anxiety Now he went on as they hastily left the carriage and transferred themselves to a car quickly scented by Eldrick as the most promising of the lot Tell the driver to go as fast as he can the other car s not very far in front tell him to catch it up Eldrick leaned over and gave his orders I ve told him not only to catch him up but to get in front of em he said settling down again in his seat This is a better car than theirs and we shall be there first Now Miss Mallathorpe don t you bother this is probably going to be the clearing up point of everything One feels certain at any rate Pratt has reached the end of his tether If I seem to bother replied Nesta it s because I know that he and Esther Mawson are at Normandale working mischief We shall be there in half an hour said Collingwood as their own car ran past that in which the detectives and Byner were seated They can t do much mischief in that time None of the three spoke again until the car pulled up suddenly at the gates of Normandale Park The lodge keeper an old man coming out to open them approached the door of the car on seeing Nesta within There s a young woman just gone up to the house that wants to see you very particular miss he said I tell d her that you d gone to Barford but she said she d come a long way and she d wait till you come back She s going across the park there crossin yon path He pointed over the level sward to the slight figure of a woman in black who was obviously taking a near cut up to the Grange Nesta looked wonderingly across the park as the car cleared the gate and went on up the drive Who can she be she said musingly A woman from a long way to see me She ll get to the house soon after we reach it said Eldrick Let s attend to this more pressing business first We should know what s afoot here in a minute or two But it was somewhat difficult to make out or to discover what really was afoot The car stopped at the hall door the second car came close behind it Nesta Collingwood Eldrick Byner and the detectives poured into the hall encountered a much mystified looking butler a couple of footmen and the groom whose services Esther Mawson had requisitioned and who weary of waiting for her had come up to the house What s all this asked Eldrick taking the situation into his own hands What s the matter Why did you send for the police missus Mallathorpe s orders sir answered the butler with an apologetic glance at his young mistress Really sir I don t know exactly what is the matter We are all so confused What happened was that not very long after Miss Mallathorpe had left for town in the carriage Esther Mawson the maid came downstairs from missus Mallathorpe s room and was crossing the lower part of the hall when missus Mallathorpe suddenly appeared up there and called to me and James to stop her and lock her up as she d stolen money and jewels We were to lock her up and telephone for the police sir and to add that mister Pratt was here Well demanded Eldrick We did lock her up sir She s in my pantry continued the butler ruefully We ve got her in there because there are bars to the windows she can t get out of that A terrible time we had too sir she fought us like like a maniac protesting all the time that missus Mallathorpe had given her what she had on her Of course sir we don t know what she may have on her we simply obeyed missus Mallathorpe Where is missus Mallathorpe asked Collingwood Is she safe Oh quite safe sir replied the butler She returned to her room after giving those orders missus Mallathorpe appeared to be quite calm sir Prydale pushed himself forward unceremoniously and insistently Keep that woman locked up he said First of all where s Pratt missus Mallathorpe said he would be found in a room in the old part of the house answered the butler shaking his head as if he were thoroughly mystified She said you would find him fast asleep Mawson had drugged him Prydale looked at Byner and at his fellow detectives Then he turned to the butler Come on he said brusquely Take us there at once He glanced at Eldrick I m beginning to see through it mister Eldrick he whispered This maid s caught Pratt for us Let s hope he s still But before he could say more and just as the butler opened a door which led into a corridor at the rear of the hall a sharp crack which was unmistakably that of a revolver rang through the house waking equally sharp echoes in the silent room And at that Nesta hurried up the stairway to her mother s apartment and the men after a hurried glance at each other ran along the corridor after the butler and the footmen Pratt came out of his stupor much sooner than Esther Mawson had reckoned on According to her previous experiments with the particular drug which she had administered to him he ought to have remained in a profound and an undisturbed slumber until at least five o clock But he woke at four woke suddenly sharply only conscious at first of a terrible pain in his head which kept him groaning and moaning in his chair for a minute or two before he fairly realized where he was and what had happened As the pain became milder and gave way to a dull throbbing and a general sense of discomfort he looked round out of aching eyes and saw the bottle of sherry And so dull were his wits that his only thought at first was that the wine had been far stronger than he had known and that he had drunk far too much of it and that it had sent him to sleep and just then his wandering glance fell on some papers which Esther Mawson had taken from one of his pockets and thrown aside as of no value He leapt to his feet trembling and sweating His hands shaking as if smitten with a sudden palsy went to his pockets he tore off his coat and turned his pockets out as if touch and feeling were not to be believed and his eyes must see that there was really nothing there Then he snatched up the papers on the floor and found nothing but letters and odd scraps of unimportant memoranda He stamped his feet on those things and began to swear and curse and finally to sob and whine The shock of his discovery had driven all his stupefaction away by that time and he knew what had happened And his whining and sobbing was not that of despair but the far worse and fiercer sobbing and whining of rage and terrible anger If the woman who had tricked him had been there he would have torn her limb from limb and have glutted himself with revenge But he was alone And presently after moving around his prison more like a wild beast than a human being his senses having deserted him for a while he regained some composure and glanced about him for means of escape He went to the door and tried it But the old substantial oak stood firm and fast nothing but a crow bar would break that door And so he turned to the mullioned window set in a deep recess He knew that it was thirty or forty feet above the level of the ground but there was much thick ivy growing on the walls of Normandale Grange and it might be possible to climb down by its aid With a great effort he forced open one of the dirt encrusted sashes and looked out and in the same instant he drew in his head with a harsh groan The window commanded a full view of the hall door and he had seen Prydale and two other detectives and the stranger from London whom he believed to be a detective hurrying from their motorcar into the house There was but one thing for it now Esther Mawson had robbed him of everything that was on him in the way of papers and money But in his hip pocket she had left a revolver which Pratt had carried always loaded for some time And now without the least hesitation he drew it out and sent one of its bullets through his brain Eldrick and Collingwood returning to the hall from the room in which they and the detectives had found Pratt s dead body stood a little later in earnest conversation with Prydale who had just come there from an interview with Esther Mawson Nesta Mallathorpe suddenly called to them from the stairs at the same time beckoning them to go up to her Will you come with me and speak to my mother she said She knows you are here and she wants to say something about what has happened something about that document which Pratt said he possessed Eldrick and Collingwood exchanged glances without speaking They followed Nesta into her mother s sitting room And instead of the semi invalid whom they had expected to find there they saw a woman who had evidently regained not only her vivacity and her spirits but her sense of authority and her inclination to exercise it I am sorry that you gentlemen should have been drawn into all this wretched business she exclaimed as she pointed the two men to chairs Everything must seem very strange and indeed have seemed so for some time But I have been the victim of as bad a scoundrel as ever lived I m not going to be so hypocritical as to pretend that I m sorry he s dead I m not I only wish he d met his proper fate on the scaffold I don t know what you may have heard or gathered my daughter herself from what she tells me has only the vaguest notions but I wanted to tell you mister Eldrick and you mister Collingwood seeing that you re one a solicitor and the other a barrister that Pratt invented a most abominable plot against me which of course hasn t a word of truth in it yet was so clever that Eldrick suddenly raised his hand missus Mallathorpe he said quietly I think you had better let me speak before you go any further Perhaps we mister Collingwood and I know more than you think Don t trifle missus Mallathorpe for your own and your daughter s sake Tell the truth and answer a plain question which I assure you is asked in your own interest What have you done with John Mallathorpe s will Collingwood anxious for Nesta was watching her closely and now he saw her turn a startled and inquiring look on her mother who in her turn dashed a surprised glance at Eldrick But if missus Mallathorpe was surprised she was also indignant or she simulated indignation and she replied to the solicitor s question with a sharp retort What do you mean John Mallathorpe s will she exclaimed What do I know of John Mallathorpe s will There never was missus Mallathorpe interrupted Eldrick Don t I m speaking in your interest I tell you There was a will It was made on the morning of John Mallathorpe s death It was found by mister Collingwood s late grandfather Antony Bartle when he died suddenly in my office it fell into Pratt s hands That is the document which Pratt held over you and not an hour ago Esther Mawson took it from Pratt and she gave it to you Again I ask you what have you done with it missus Mallathorpe hesitated a moment Then she suddenly faced Eldrick with a defiant look Let them let everybody do what they like she exclaimed It s burnt I threw it in that fire as soon as I got it And now Nesta interrupted her mother Does any one know the terms of that will she asked looking at Eldrick Tell me if you know Hush she went on as missus Mallathorpe tried to speak again I will know Yes answered Eldrick Esther Mawson knows them She read the will carefully She told Prydale just now what they were With the exception of three legacies of ten thousand pounds each to your mother your brother and yourself John Mallathorpe left everything he possessed to the town of Barford for an educational trust Then asked Nesta quietly as she made a peremptory sign to her mother to be silent we never had any right to be here at all I m afraid not replied Eldrick Then of course we shall go said Nesta That s certain Do you hear that mother That s my decision It s final You can do what you like retorted missus Mallathorpe sullenly I am not going to be frightened by anything that Esther Mawson says Nor by what you say she continued turning on Eldrick All that has got to be proved Who can prove it What can prove it Do you think I am going to give up my rights without fighting for them I shall swear that every word of Esther Mawson s is a lie No one can bring forward a will that doesn t exist And what concern is it of yours mister Eldrick What right have you You are quite right missus Mallathorpe said Eldrick It is no concern of mine And so He turned to the door and as he turned the door opened to admit the old butler who looked apologetically but earnestly at Nesta as he stepped forward A missus Gaukrodger wishes to see you on very particular business he murmured She s been waiting some little time something she says about some papers she has just found belonging to the late mister John Mallathorpe Collingwood who was standing close to Nesta caught all the butler said Gaukrodger he exclaimed with a quick glance at Eldrick That was the name of the manager a witness See the woman at once he whispered to Nesta Bring missus Gaukrodger in Dickenson said Nesta Stay I ll come with you and bring her in myself She returned a moment later with a slightly built rather careworn woman dressed in deep mourning the woman in black whom they had seen crossing the park who looked nervously round her as she entered What is it you have for me missus Gaukrodger asked Nesta Papers belonging to the late mister John Mallathorpe How where did you get them missus Gaukrodger drew a large envelope from under her cloak This miss she answered One paper I only found it this morning In this way she went on addressing herself to Nesta When my husband was killed along with mister John Mallathorpe they of course brought home the clothes he was wearing There were a lot of papers in the pockets of the coat two pockets full of them And I hadn t heart or courage to look at them at that time miss I couldn t and I locked them up in a box I never looked at them until this very day but this morning I happened to open that box and I saw them and I thought I d see what they were And this was one you see it s in a plain envelope it was sealed but there s no writing on it I cut the envelope open and drew the paper out and I saw at once it was mister John Mallathorpe s will so I came straight to you with it She handed the envelope over to Nesta who at once gave it to Eldrick The solicitor hastily drew out the enclosure glanced it over and turned sharply to Collingwood with a muttered exclamation Good gracious he said That man Cobcroft was right There was a duplicate And here it is missus Mallathorpe had come nearer The sight of the half sheet of foolscap in Eldrick s hands seemed to fascinate her And the expression of her face as she came close to his side was so curious that the solicitor involuntarily folded up the will and hastily put it behind his back he had not only seen that expression but had caught sight of missus Mallathorpe s twitching fingers Is that that another will she whispered John Mallathorpe s Precisely the same another copy duly signed and witnessed answered Eldrick firmly What you foolishly did was done for nothing And it s the most fortunate thing in the world missus Mallathorpe that this has turned up most fortunate for you missus Mallathorpe steadied herself on the edge of the table and looked at him fixedly Everything ll have to be given up she asked The terms of this will will be carried out answered Eldrick Will will they make me give up what we ve saved she whispered Mother said Nesta appealingly Don t Come away somewhere and let me talk to you come But missus Mallathorpe shook off her daughter s hand and turned again to Eldrick Will they she demanded Answer I don t think you ll find the trustees at all hard when it comes to a question of account answered Eldrick They ll probably take matters over from now and ignore anything that s happened during the past two years Again Nesta tried to lead her mother away and again missus Mallathorpe pushed the appealing hand from her All her attention was fixed on Eldrick And and will the police give me now what they found on that woman she whispered I have no doubt they will replied Eldrick It s yours missus Mallathorpe drew a sigh of relief She looked at the solicitor steadily for a moment then without another word she turned and went away to find Prydale Eldrick turned to Nesta Don t forget he said in a low voice it s a terrible blow to her and she s been thinking of your interests Leave her alone for a while she ll get used to the altered circumstances I m sorry for her and for you But Nesta made a sign of dissent There s no need to be sorry for me mister Eldrick she answered It s a greater relief than you can realize She turned from him and went over to missus Gaukrodger who had watched this scene without fully comprehending it Come with me she said You look very tired and you must have some tea and rest awhile come now Eldrick and Collingwood left alone looked at each other in silence for a moment Then the solicitor shook his head expressively Well that s over he exclaimed I must go back and hand this will over to the two trustees But you Collingwood stay here a bit if ever that girl needs company and help it s now I m stopping said Collingwood He remained for a time where Eldrick left him at last he went down to the hall and out into the gardens And presently Nesta came to him there and as if with a mutual understanding they walked away into the nearer stretches of the park Normandale had never looked more beautiful than it did that afternoon and in the midst of a silence which up to then neither of them had cared to break Collingwood suddenly turned to the girl who had just lost it Are you sure that you won t miss all this greatly he asked Just think I d rather lose more than this however fond I d got of it than go through what I ve gone through lately she answered frankly Do you know what I want to do No I think not he said What If it s possible to forget all about this she replied And if that s also possible to help my mother to forget too Don t think too hardly of her I don t suppose any of us know how much all this place and the money meant to her I ve got no hard thoughts about her said Collingwood I m sorry for her But is it too soon to talk about the future Nesta looked at him in a way which showed him that she only half comprehended the question But there was sufficient comprehension in her eyes to warrant him in taking her hands in his You know why I didn t go to India he said bending his face to hers I guessed she answered shyly Then Collingwood at this suddenly arrived supreme moment became curiously bereft of speech And after a period of silence during which being in the shadow of a grove of beech trees which kindly concealed them from the rest of the world they held each other s hands all that he could find to say was one word Well Nesta laughed Well what she whispered Collingwood suddenly laughed too and put his arm round her It s no good he said I ve often thought of what I d to say to you and now I ve forgotten all Shall I say it all at once Wouldn t it be best she murmured with another laugh Then you re going to marry me he asked Am I to answer all at once she said One word will do he exclaimed drawing her to him Ah she whispered as she lifted her face to his I couldn t say it all in one word But we ve lots of time before us THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Talleyrand Maxim by J S Fletcher END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TALLEYRAND MAXIM This
