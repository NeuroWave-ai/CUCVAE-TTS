OUR NEW NEIGHBORS AT PONKAPOG BY THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH When I saw the little house building an eighth of a mile beyond my own on the Old Bay Road I wondered who were to be the tenants The modest structure was set well back from the road among the trees as if the inmates were to care nothing whatever for a view of the stylish equipages which sweep by during the summer season For my part I like to see the passing in town or country but each has his own unaccountable taste The proprietor who seemed to be also the architect of the new house superintended the various details of the work with an assiduity that gave me a high opinion of his intelligence and executive ability and I congratulated myself on the prospect of having some very agreeable neighbors It was quite early in the spring if I remember when they moved into the cottage a newly married couple evidently the wife very young pretty and with the air of a lady the husband somewhat older but still in the first flush of manhood It was understood in the village that they came from Baltimore but no one knew them personally and they brought no letters of introduction For obvious reasons I refrain from mentioning names It was clear that for the present at least their own company was entirely sufficient for them They made no advance toward the acquaintance of any of the families in the neighborhood and consequently were left to themselves That apparently was what they desired and why they came to Ponkapog For after its black bass and wild duck and teal solitude is the chief staple of Ponkapog Perhaps its perfect rural loveliness should be included Lying high up under the wing of the Blue Hills and in the odorous breath of pines and cedars it chances to be the most enchanting bit of unlaced disheveled country within fifty miles of Boston which moreover can be reached in half an hour s ride by railway But the nearest railway station Heaven be praised is two miles distant and the seclusion is without a flaw Ponkapog has one mail a day two mails a day would render the place uninhabitable The village it looks like a compact village at a distance but unravels and disappears the moment you drive into it has quite a large floating population I do not allude to the perch and pickerel in Ponkapog Pond Along the Old Bay Road a highway even in the Colonial days there are a number of attractive villas and cottages straggling off toward Milton which are occupied for the summer by people from the city These birds of passage are a distinct class from the permanent inhabitants and the two seldom closely assimilate unless there has been some previous connection It seemed to me that our new neighbors were to come under the head of permanent inhabitants they had built their own house and had the air of intending to live in it all the year round Are you not going to call on them I asked my wife one morning When they call on us she replied lightly But it is our place to call first they being strangers This was said as seriously as the circumstance demanded but my wife turned it off with a laugh and I said no more always trusting to her intuitions in these matters She was right She would not have been received and a cool Not at home would have been a bitter social pill to us if we had gone out of our way to be courteous I saw a great deal of our neighbors nevertheless Their cottage lay between us and the post office where he was never to be met with by any chance and I caught frequent glimpses of the two working in the garden Floriculture did not appear so much an object as exercise Possibly it was neither maybe they were engaged in digging for specimens of those arrowheads and flint hatchets which are continually coming to the surface hereabouts There is scarcely an acre in which the plowshare has not turned up some primitive stone weapon or domestic utensil disdainfully left to us by the red men who once held this domain an ancient tribe called the Punkypoags a forlorn descendant of which one Polly Crowd figures in the annual Blue Book down to the close of the Southern war as a state pensioner At that period she appears to have struck a trail to the Happy Hunting Grounds I quote from the local historiographer Whether they were developing a kitchen garden or emulating Professor Schliemann at Mycenae the newcomers were evidently persons of refined musical taste the lady had a contralto voice of remarkable sweetness although of no great compass and I used often to linger of a morning by the high gate and listen to her executing an arietta conjecturally at some window upstairs for the house was not visible from the turnpike The husband somewhere about the ground would occasionally respond with two or three bars It was all quite an ideal Arcadian business They seemed very happy together these two persons who asked no odds whatever of the community in which they had settled themselves There was a queerness a sort of mystery about this couple which I admit piqued my curiosity though as a rule I have no morbid interest in the affairs of my neighbors They behaved like a pair of lovers who had run off and got married clandestinely I willingly acquitted them however of having done anything unlawful for to change a word in the lines of the poet It is a joy to think the best We may of human kind Admitting the hypothesis of elopement there was no mystery in their neither sending nor receiving letters But where did they get their groceries I do not mean the money to pay for them that is an enigma apart but the groceries themselves No express wagon no butcher s cart no vehicle of any description was ever observed to stop at their domicile Yet they did not order family stores at the sole establishment in the village an inexhaustible little bottle of a shop which I advertise it gratis can turn out anything in the way of groceries from a hand saw to a pocket handkerchief I confess that I allowed this unimportant detail of their menage to occupy more of my speculation than was creditable to me In several respects our neighbors reminded me of those inexplicable persons we sometimes come across in great cities though seldom or never in suburban places where the field may be supposed too restricted for their operations persons who have no perceptible means of subsistence and manage to live royally on nothing a year They hold no government bonds they possess no real estate our neighbors did own their house they toil not neither do they spin yet they reap all the numerous soft advantages that usually result from honest toil and skilful spinning How do they do it But this is a digression and I am quite of the opinion of the old lady in David Copperfield who says Let us have no meandering Though my wife had declined to risk a ceremonious call on our neighbors as a family I saw no reason why I should not speak to the husband as an individual when I happened to encounter him by the wayside I made several approaches to do so when it occurred to my penetration that my neighbor had the air of trying to avoid me I resolved to put the suspicion to the test and one forenoon when he was sauntering along on the opposite side of the road in the vicinity of Fisher s sawmill I deliberately crossed over to address him The brusque manner in which he hurried away was not to be misunderstood Of course I was not going to force myself upon him It was at this time that I began to formulate uncharitable suppositions touching our neighbors and would have been as well pleased if some of my choicest fruit trees had not overhung their wall I determined to keep my eyes open later in the season when the fruit should be ripe to pluck In some folks a sense of the delicate shades of difference between meum and tuum does not seem to be very strongly developed in the Moon of Cherries to use the old Indian phrase I was sufficiently magnanimous not to impart any of these sinister impressions to the families with whom we were on visiting terms for I despise a gossip I would say nothing against the persons up the road until I had something definite to say My interest in them was well not exactly extinguished but burning low I met the gentleman at intervals and passed him without recognition at rarer intervals I saw the lady After a while I not only missed my occasional glimpses of her pretty slim figure always draped in some soft black stuff with a bit of scarlet at the throat but I inferred that she did not go about the house singing in her light hearted manner as formerly What had happened Had the honeymoon suffered eclipse already Was she ill I fancied she was ill and that I detected a certain anxiety in the husband who spent the mornings digging solitarily in the garden and seemed to have relinquished those long jaunts to the brow of Blue Hill where there is a superb view of all Norfolk County combined with sundry venerable rattlesnakes with twelve rattles As the days went by it became certain that the lady was confined to the house perhaps seriously ill possibly a confirmed invalid Whether she was attended by a physician from Canton or from Milton I was unable to say but neither the gig with the large white allopathic horse nor the gig with the homoeopathic sorrel mare was ever seen hitched at the gate during the day If a physician had charge of the case he visited his patient only at night All this moved my sympathy and I reproached myself with having had hard thoughts of our neighbors Trouble had come to them early I would have liked to offer them such small friendly services as lay in my power but the memory of the repulse I had sustained still rankled in me So I hesitated One morning my two boys burst into the library with their eyes sparkling You know the old elm down the road cried one Yes The elm with the hang bird s nest shrieked the other Yes yes Well we both just climbed up and there s three young ones in it Then I smiled to think that our new neighbors had got such a promising little family MY FIRST VISIT TO PORTLAND BY MAJOR JACK DOWNING In the fall of the year eighteen twenty nine I took it into my head I d go to Portland I had heard a good deal about Portland what a fine place it was and how the folks got rich there proper fast and that fall there was a couple of new papers come up to our place from there called the Portland Courier and Family Reader and they told a good many queer kind of things about Portland and one thing and another and all at once it popped into my head and I up and told father and says I am going to Portland whether or no and I ll see what this world is made of yet Father stared a little at first and said he was afraid I would get lost but when he see I was bent upon it he give it up and he stepped to his chist and opened the till and took out a dollar and he gave it to me and says he Jack this is all I can do for you but go and lead an honest life and I believe I shall hear good of you yet He turned and walked across the room but I could see the tears start into his eyes And mother sat down and had a hearty crying spell This made me feel rather bad for a minit or two and I almost had a mind to give it up and then again father s dream came into my mind and I mustered up courage and declared I d go So I tackled up the old horse and packed in a load of axe handles and a few notions and mother fried me some doughnuts and put em into a box along with some cheese and sausages and ropped me up another shirt for I told her I didn t know how long I should be gone And after I got rigged out I went round and bid all the neighbors good by and jumped in and drove off for Portland Aunt Sally had been married two or three years before and moved to Portland and I inquired round till I found out where she lived and went there and put the old horse up and eat some supper and went to bed And the next morning I got up and straightened right off to see the editor of the Portland Courier for I knew by what I had seen in his paper that he was just the man to tell me which way to steer And when I come to see him I knew I was right for soon as I told him my name and what I wanted he took me by the hand as kind as if he had been a brother and says he Mister says he I ll do anything I can to assist you You have come to a good town Portland is a healthy thriving place and any man with a proper degree of enterprise may do well here But says he stranger and he looked mighty kind of knowing says he if you want to make out to your mind you must do as the steamboats do Well says I how do they do for I didn t know what a steamboat was any more than the man in the moon Why says he they go ahead And you must drive about among the folks here just as though you were at home on the farm among the cattle Don t be afraid of any of them but figure away and I dare say you ll get into good business in a very little while But says he there s one thing you must be careful of and that is not to get into the hands of those are folks that trades up round Huckler s Row for ther s some sharpers up there if they get hold of you would twist your eye teeth out in five minits Well arter he had giv me all the good advice he could I went back to Aunt Sally s ag in and got some breakfast and then I walked all over the town to see what chance I could find to sell my axe handles and things and to get into business After I had walked about three or four hours I come along towards the upper end of the town where I found there were stores and shops of all sorts and sizes And I met a feller and says I What place is this Why this says he is Huckler s Row What says I are these the stores where the traders in Huckler s Row keep And says he Yes Well then says I to myself I have a pesky good mind to go in and have a try with one of these chaps and see if they can twist my eye teeth out If they can get the best end of a bargain out of me they can do what there ain t a man in our place can do and I should just like to know what sort of stuff these ere Portland chaps are made of So I goes into the best looking store among em And I see some biscuit on the shelf and says I Mister how much do you ax apiece for them ere biscuits A cent apiece says he Well says I I shan t give you that but if you ve a mind to I ll give you two cents for three of them for I begin to feel a little as though I would like to take a bite Well says he I wouldn t sell em to anybody else so but seeing it s you I don t care if you take em I knew he lied for he never seen me before in his life Well he handed down the biscuits and I took em and walked round the store awhile to see what else he had to sell At last says I Mister have you got any good cider Says he Yes as good as ever ye see Well says I what do you ax a glass for it Two cents says he Well says I seems to me I feel more dry than I do hungry now Ain t you a mind to take these ere biscuits again and give me a glass of cider And says he I don t care if I do So he took and laid em on the shelf again and poured out a glass of cider I took the cider and drinkt it down and to tell the truth it was capital good cider Then says I I guess it s time for me to be a going and I stept along towards the door but says he Stop mister I believe you haven t paid me for the cider Not paid you for the cider says I What do you mean by that Didn t the biscuits that I give you just come to the cider Oh ah right says he So I started to go again and says he But stop there mister you didn t pay me for the biscuits What says I do you mean to impose upon me do you think I am going to pay you for the biscuits and let you keep them too Ain t they there now on your shelf What more do you want I guess

none	none	of beauty to a temporary passion for elongation Length seemed to have been the central thought the theme as it were upon which he had been composed This effect was heightened by generously broad hands and feet and a contrastingly abbreviated chin The latter feature caused his countenance to wear in repose a decidedly vacant look but it was seldom caught reposing usually having to bear a smirk of some sort Eph s position in the Winkle household was as peculiar as his personality Nominally he was a hired servant but in fact from his own point of view at least he was mister Winkle s private secretary and confidential adviser He had been on the place ever sence old Fan was a yearlin which was a long while

none	none	and had come to regard himself as indispensable The Winkles treated him as one of the family and he reciprocated in truly familiar ways He sat at the table with them helped entertain their guests and often accompanied them to church In regulating matters on the farm mister Winkle proposed but Eph invariably disposed in a diplomatic way of course and although his judgment might be based on false logic the result was generally successful and satisfactory With all his good qualities and her attachment to him however missus Winkle was not sure that Eph s moral status was quite sound and she was inclined to discourage Johnnie s association with him As a matter of fact she had overheard Johnnie utter several bad words of which Eph was certainly the prime source But a mother s solicitude was of little avail when compared with Eph s Delphian wisdom Johnnie would steal away to join Eph in the field at every chance and the information he acquired at these secret seances was varied and valuable It was Eph who taught him how to tell the time of day by the sun how to insert a dutchman in the place of a lost suspender button how to make bird traps and how to skin the cat Eph initiated him into the mysteries of magic and witchcraft and showed him how to locate a subterranean vein of water by means of a twig of witch hazel Eph also confided to Johnnie that he himself could stanch the flow of blood or stop a toothache instantly by force of a certain charm but he could not tell how to do this because the secret could be imparted only from man to woman or vice versa Even the shadowy domain of spirits had not been exempt from Eph s investigations and he related many a terrifying experience with ha nts Johnnie was first introduced to the ghost world one summer night when he and Eph had gone fishing together If ye want to ketch the big uns always go at night in the dark o the moon said Eph and his piscatorial knowledge was absolute They had fished in silence for some time and Johnnie was nodding when Eph suddenly whispered Let s go home sonny I think I see a ha nt down yander Johnnie had no idea what a ha nt might be but Eph s constrained manner betokened something dreadful It was not until they had come within sight of home that Johnnie ventured to inquire Say Eph what is a ha nt Huh What is ha nts Why sonny you mean to tell me you don t know what ha nts is Not exactly sompin like wildcats ain t they Well I ll be confounded Wildcats Not by a long shot and Eph broke into the soft chuckle which always preceded his explanations They reached the orchard fence and seating himself squarely on the topmost rail Eph began impressively Ha nts is the remains of dead folks more specially them that s been assinated er that is kilt understan They re kind o like sperrits ye know After so long a time they take to comin back to yarth an ha ntin the precise spot where they wuz murdered They always come after dark an the diffrunt shapes they take on is supprisin I have seed ha nts that looked like sheep an ha nts that looked like human persons but lots of em ye cain t see a tall bein invisible as the sayin is Now fer all we know they may be a ha nt settin right here betwixt us this minute With this solemn declaration Johnnie shivered and began edging closer to Eph until restrained and appalled by the thought that he might actually sit on the unseen spirit by such movement But do they hurt people Eph he asked anxiously Eph gave vent to another chuckle Not if ye understan the r ways he observed sagely If ye let em alone an don t go foolin aroun the r ha ntin groun they ll never harm ye But don t ye never trifle with no ha nt sonny I knowed a feller t thought twuz smart to hector em an said he wuzn t feared Onct he throwed a rock at one Here Eph paused What h happened gasped Johnnie In one year from that time replied Eph gruesomely that there feller s cow wuz hit by lightnin in three year his hoss kicked him an busted a rib an in seven year he wuz a corpse The power of this horrible example was too much for Johnnie Don t you reckon it s bedtime he suggested tremblingly Thenceforth for many months Johnnie led a haunted life Ghosts glowered at him from cellar and garret Specters slunk at his heels phantoms flitted through the barn Twilight teemed with horrors and midnight when he awoke at that hour made of his bedroom a veritable Brocken It was vain for his parents to expostulate with him Was one not bound to believe one s own eyes And how about the testimony of the Hired Hand The story in his reader told in verse and graphically illustrated of the boy named Walter who being alone on a lonesome highway one dark night beheld a sight that made his blood run cold acquired an abnormal interest for Johnnie Walter with courage resembling madness marched straight up to the alleged ghost and laughed gleefully to find It was a friendly guide post his wand ring steps to guide This was all very well as it turned out but what if it had been a sure enough ghost reflected Johnnie What if it had reached down with its long snaky arms and snatched Walter up and run off with him in the dark and no telling what Or it might have swooped straight up in the air with him for ghosts could do that Johnnie resolved he would not take any chances with friendly guide posts which might turn out to be hostile spirits Then there was the similar tale of the lame goose and the one concerning the pillow in the swing each intended no doubt to allay foolish fears on the part of children but exercising an opposite and harrowing influence upon Johnnie MAXIOMS BY CAROLYN WELLS Reward is its own virtue The wages of sin is alimony Money makes the mayor go A penny saved spoils the broth Of two evils choose the prettier There s no fool like an old maid Make love while the moon shines Where there s a won t there s a way Nonsense makes the heart grow fonder A word to the wise is a dangerous thing A living gale is better than a dead calm A fool and his money corrupt good manners A word in the hand is worth two in the ear A man is known by the love letters he keeps A guilty conscience is the mother of invention Whosoever thy hands find to do do with thy might It s a wise child who knows less than his own father Never put off till to morrow what you can wear to night He who loves and runs away may live to love another day GARDEN ETHICS BY CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER I believe that I have found if not original sin at least vegetable total depravity in my garden and it was there before I went into it It is the bunch or joint or snake grass whatever it is called As I do not know the names of all the weeds and plants I have to do as Adam did in his garden name things as I find them This grass has a slender beautiful stalk and when you cut it down or pull up a long root of it you fancy it is got rid of but in a day or two it will come up in the same spot in half a dozen vigorous blades Cutting down and pulling up is what it thrives on Extermination rather helps it If you follow a slender white root it will be found to run under the ground until it meets another slender white root and you will soon unearth a network of them with a knot somewhere sending out dozens of sharp pointed healthy shoots every joint prepared to be an independent life and plant The only way to deal with it is to take one part hoe and two parts fingers and carefully dig it out not leaving a joint anywhere It will take a little time say all summer to dig out thoroughly a small patch but if you once dig it out and keep it out you will have no further trouble I have said it was total depravity Here it is If you attempt to pull up and root out sin in you which shows on the surface if it does not show you do not care for it you may have noticed how it runs into an interior network of sins and an ever sprouting branch of these roots somewhere and that you can not pull out one without making a general internal disturbance and rooting up your whole being I suppose it is less trouble to quietly cut them off at the top say once a week on Sunday when you put on your religious clothes and face so that no one will see them and not try to eradicate the network within Remark This moral vegetable figure is at the service of any clergyman who will have the manliness to come forward and help me at a day s hoeing on my potatoes None but the orthodox need apply I however believe in the intellectual if not the moral qualities of vegetables and especially weeds There was a worthless vine that or who started up about midway between a grape trellis and a row of bean poles some three feet from each but a little nearer the trellis When it came out of the ground it looked around to see what it should do The trellis was already occupied The bean pole was empty There was evidently a little the best chance of light air and sole proprietorship on the pole And the vine started for the pole and began to climb it with determination Here was as distinct an act of choice of reason as a boy exercises when he goes into a forest and looking about decides which tree he will climb And besides how did the vine know enough to travel in exactly the right direction three feet to find what it wanted This is intellect The weeds on the other hand have hateful moral qualities To cut down a weed is therefore to do a moral action I feel as if I were destroying a sin My hoe becomes an instrument of retributive justice I am an apostle of nature This view of the matter lends a dignity to the art of hoeing which nothing else does and lifts it into the region of ethics Hoeing becomes not a pastime but a duty And you get to regard it so as the days and the weeds lengthen Observation Nevertheless what a man needs in gardening is a cast iron back with a hinge in it The hoe is an ingenious instrument calculated to call out a great deal of strength at a great disadvantage The striped bug has come the saddest of the year He is a moral double ender iron clad at that He is unpleasant in two ways He burrows in the ground so that you can not find him and he flies away so that you can not catch him He is rather handsome as bugs go but utterly dastardly in that he gnaws the stem of the plant close to the ground and ruins it without any apparent advantage to himself I find him on the hills of cucumbers perhaps it will be a cholera year and we shall not want any the squashes small loss and the melons which never ripen The best way to deal with the striped bug is to sit down by the hills and patiently watch for him If you are spry you can annoy him This however takes time It takes all day and part of the night For he flieth in the darkness and wasteth at noonday If you get up before the dew is off the plants it goes off very early you can sprinkle soot on the plant soot is my panacea if I can get the disease of a plant reduced to the necessity of soot I am all right and soot is unpleasant to the bug But the best thing to do is set a toad to catch the bugs The toad at once establishes the most intimate relations with the bug It is a pleasure to see such unity among the lower animals The difficulty is to make the toad stay and watch the hill If you know your toad it is all right If you do not you must build a tight fence round the plants which the toad can not jump over This however introduces a new element I find that I have a zooelogical garden It is an unexpected result of my little enterprise which never aspired to the completeness of the Paris Jardin des Plantes A TRAVELED DONKEY BY BERT LESTON TAYLOR But Buddie got no farther The sound of music came to her ears and she stopped to listen The music was faint and sweet with the sighful quality of an AEolian harp Now it seemed near now far What can it be said Buddie Wait here and I ll find out said Snowfeathers He darted away and returned before you could count fifty A traveling musician he reported Come along It s only a little way Back he flew with Buddie scrambling after A few yards brought her to a little open place and here was the queerest sight she had yet seen in this queer wood On a bank of reindeer moss at the foot of a great white birch a mouse colored donkey sat playing a lute Over his head hanging from a bit of bark was the sign WHILE YOU WAIT OLD SAWS RESET After the many strange things that Buddie had come upon in Queerwood nothing could surprise her very much Besides as she never before had seen a donkey or a lute or the combination of donkey and lute it did not strike her as especially remarkable that the musician should be holding his instrument upside down and sweeping the strings with one of his long ears which he was able to wave without moving his head a jot And this it was that gave to the music its soft and furry purry quality The Donkey greeted Buddie with a careless nod and remarked as if anticipating a comment he had heard many times Oh yes I play everything by ear Please keep on playing said Buddie taking a seat on another clump of reindeer moss I intended to said the Donkey and the random chords changed to a crooning melody which wonderfully pleased Buddie whose opportunities to hear music were sadly few As for the White Blackbird he tucked his little head under his wing and went fast asleep Well what do you think of it asked the Donkey putting down the lute Very nice sir answered Buddie enthusiastically though she added to herself The idea of saying sir to an animal Would you please tell me your name she requested The Donkey pawed open a saddle bag drew forth with his teeth a card and presented it to Buddie who spelled out the following PROFESSOR BRAY TENORE BARITONALE TEACHER OF SINGING ALL METHODS CONCERTS AND RECITALS While Buddie was reading this the Donkey again picked up his instrument and thrummed the strings Did you ever see a donkey play a lute said he That s an old saw he added I never saw a donkey before said Buddie You haven t traveled much said the other The world is full of them This is the farthest I ve ever been from home confessed Buddie feeling very insignificant indeed And how far may that be Buddie couldn t tell exactly But it can t be a great way she said I live in the log house by the lake Pooh said the Donkey That s no distance at all Buddie shrank another inch or two I m a great traveler myself All donkeys travel that can If a donkey travels you know he may come home a horse and to become a horse is of course the ambition of every donkey Is it was all Buddie could think of to remark What could she say that would interest a globe trotter Perhaps you have an old saw you d like reset suggested the Donkey still thrumming the lute strings Buddie thought a moment There s an old saw hanging up in our woodshed she began but got no farther Hee haw hee haw laughed the Donkey Thistles and cactus but that s rich And he hee hawed until the tears ran down his nose Poor Buddie who knew she was being laughed at but didn t know why began to feel very much like crying and wished she might run away Excuse these tears the Donkey said at last recovering his family gravity Didn t you ever hear the saying A burnt child dreads the fire Buddie nodded and plucked up her spirits Well that s an old saw And you must have heard that other very old saw No use crying over spilt milk Another nod from Buddie Here s my setting of that said the Donkey and after a few introductory chords he sang Oh why do you cry my pretty little maid With a Boo hoo hoo and a Heigho I ve spilled my milk kind sir she said And the Cat said Me oh my oh No use to cry my pretty little maid With a Boo hoo hoo and a Heigho But what shall I do kind sir she said And the Cat said Me oh my oh Why dry your eyes my pretty little maid With a Boo hoo hoo and a Heigho Oh thank you thank you sir she said And the Cat said Me oh my oh How do you like my voice asked the Donkey in a tone that said very plainly If you don t like it you re no judge of singing Buddie did not at once reply A professional critic would have said and enjoyed saying that the voice was of the hit or miss variety that it was pitched too high all donkeys make that mistake that it was harsh rasping and unsympathetic and that altogether the performance was not convincing Now Little One although Buddie was not a professional critic and neither knew how to wound nor enjoyed wounding even she found the Donkey s voice harsh but she did not wish to hurt his feelings for donkeys have feelings in spite of a popular opinion to the contrary And after all it was pretty good singing for a donkey Critics should not as they sometimes do apply to donkeys the standards by which nightingales are judged So Buddie was able to say truthfully and kindly I think you do very well very well indeed It was a small tribute but the Donkey was so blinded by conceit that he accepted it as the greatest compliment I ought to sing well he said I ve studied methods enough The more methods you try you know the more of a donkey you are Oh yes murmured Buddie not understanding in the least Yes went on the Donkey I ve taken the Donkesi Method the Sobraylia Method the Thistlefixu Method I m afraid I don t quite know what you mean by methods ventured Buddie The Donkey regarded her with a pitying smile A method he explained is a way of singing Ah For example in the Thistlefixu Method which I am at present using I fill my mouth full of thistles stand on one leg take in a breath three yards long and sing Ah The only trouble with this method is that the thistles tickle your throat and make you cough and you have to spray the vocal cords twice a day which is considerable trouble especially when traveling as I always am I should think it would be said Buddie Won t you sing something else I m a little hoarse apologized the singer That s what you want to be isn t it said Buddie misunderstanding him Hee haw laughed the Donkey Is that a joke I mean my throat is hoarse And the rest of you is donkey cried Buddie who could see a point as quickly as any one of her age There s something to that said the other thoughtfully Now if the hoarseness should spread And you became horse all over Why then Why then Think of another old saw said the Donkey picking up his lute No I don t believe I can remember any more old saws said Buddie after racking her small brain for a minute or two Pooh said the Donkey They re as common as Pass the butter or Some more tea please Ever hear Fair words butter no parsnips Buddie shook her head The wolf does something every day that keeps him from church on Sunday Again Buddy shook her head It is hard to shave an egg Still another shake A miss is as good as a mile You can not drive a windmill with a pair of bellows Help the lame dog over the stile A hand saw is a good thing but not to shave with Nothing venture nothing have Well you haven t heard much for a fact said the Donkey contemptuously as Buddie shook her head after each proverb I ll try a few more there s no end to them Ever hear When the sky falls we shall all catch larks Too many cooks spoil the broth I ve heard that said Buddie eagerly It s a wonder returned the Donkey Well I have a very nice setting of that And he sang Some said Stir it fast Some said Slow Some said Skim it off Some said No Some said Pepper Some said Salt All gave good advice All found fault Poor little Tommy Trottett Couldn t eat it when he got it I like that said Buddie Oh and I ve just thought of another old ax I mean saw if it is one Don t count your chickens before they are hatched Do you sing that One of my best replied the Donkey And again he sang Thirteen eggs said Sammy Patch Are thirteen chickens when they hatch The hen gave a cluck but said no more For the hen had heard such things before The eggs fall out from tilted pail And leave behind a yellow trail But Sammy counting as he goes Upon his fingers never knows Oh Sammy Patch your rithmetic Won t hatch a solitary chick I like that the best said Buddie who knew what it was to tip over a pail of eggs and felt as sorry for Sammy Patch as if he really existed It s one of my best said the Donkey I don t call it my very best Personally I prefer Look before you leap You ve heard that old saw I dare say No but that doesn t matter I shall like it just as well replied Buddie That doesn t follow but this does said the Donkey and once more he sang A foolish Frog one summer day While splashing round in careless way Observed a man With large tin can And manner most suspicious I think I know remarked the Frog A safer place than on this log For when a man Comes with a can His object is malicious Thus far the foolish Frog was wise But had he better used his eyes He would have seen Close by a lean Old Pike his nose just showing Kersplash The Pike made just one bite The moral I need scarce recite Before you leap Just take a peep To see where you are going Buddie however clung to her former opinion I like Sammy Patch the best said she That rejoined the singer is a matter of taste as the donkey said to the horse who preferred hay to thistles Usually the public likes best the very piece the composer himself cares least about So wherever I go I hear Oh Professor do sing us that beautiful song about Sammy Patch And I can t poke my head inside the Thistle Club but some donkey bawls out Here s Bray Now we ll have a song Sing us Sammy Patch old fellow Really I ve sung that song so many times I m tired of the sound of it It must be nice to be such a favorite said Buddie Suppose we go up to the Corner and see what s stirring suggested the Donkey with a yawn Oh are you going up to the Corner too cried Buddie I am to meet the Rabbit there at two o clock I hope it isn t late The Donkey glanced skyward It isn t noon yet said he How do you tell time inquired Buddie By the way it flies Time flies you know You can tell a great many birds that way too As he spoke the Donkey put his lute into one of his bags and took down his sign You can ride if you wish he offered graciously Thank you said Buddie And leaving the White Blackbird asleep on his perch for as Buddie said he was having such a lovely nap it would be a pity to wake him they set off through the wood It was bad traveling for a short distance but presently they came out on an old log road and along this the Donkey ambled at an easy pace On both sides grew wild flowers in wonderful abundance but as Buddie noticed they were all of one kind Enchanter s Nightshade Buddie had also noticed when she climbed to her comfortable seat a peculiar marking on the Donkey s broad back It was bronze in color and in shape like a cross Perhaps it s a strawberry mark she thought and he may not want to talk about it But curiosity got the better of her Oh that said the Donkey carelessly in reply to a question That s a Victoria Cross I served three months with the British army in South Africa and was decorated for gallantry in leading a charge of the ambulance corps I shall have to ask you not to hang things on my neck It s all I can do to hold up my head Oh excuse me said Buddie untying the sign OLD SAWS RESET WHILE YOU WAIT Hang it round your own neck said the Donkey and Buddie did so I often wonder she said whether a horse doesn t sometimes get tired holding his head out at the end of his neck And as for a giraffe I don t see how he stands it Well a giraffe s neck runs out at a more convenient angle said the Donkey Still it is tiresome without a check rein You hear a great deal about a check rein being a cruel invention but on the contrary it s a great blessing Now a nose bag is a positive outrage and the more oats it contains the more of an imposition it is People have the queerest ideas SELECTING THE FACULTY

none	none	 Our Board of Trustees it will be remembered had been directed by the Legislature to procure as the ordinance called it Teachers for the commencement of the State College at Woodville That business by the Board was committed to doctor Sylvan and Robert Carlton the most learned gentleman of the body and of the New Purchase Our honorable Board will be more specially introduced hereafter at present we shall bring forward certain rejected candidates that like rejected prize essays they may be published and thus have their revenge None can tell us how plenty good things are till he looks for them and hence to the great surprise of the Committee there seemed to be a sudden growth and a large crop of persons even in and around Woodville either already qualified for the Professorships as we named them in our publication or who could qualify by the time of election As to the chair named also in our publications one very worthy and disinterested schoolmaster offered as a great collateral inducement for his being elected to find his own chair a vast saving to the State if the same chair I saw in mister Whackum s school room 
5635_58137_000004_000002	train-clean-360	For his chair there was one with a hickory bottom and doubtless he would have filled it and even lapped over its edges with equal dignity in the recitation room of Big College 
none	none	The Committee had at an early day given an invitation to the reverend Charles Clarence A M of New Jersey and his answer had been affirmative yet for political reasons we had been obliged to invite competitors or make them and we found and created a right smart sprinkle Hopes of success were built on many things for instance on poverty a plea being entered that something ought to be done for the poor fellow on one s having taught a common school all his born days who now deserved to rise a peg on political or religious or fanatical partizan qualifications and on pure patriotic principles such as a person s having been born in a canebrake and rocked in a sugar trough On the other hand a fat dull headed and modest Englishman asked for a place because he had been born in Liverpool and had seen the world beyond the woods and waters too And another fussy talkative pragmatical little gentleman rested his pretensions on his ability to draw and paint maps not projecting them in roundabout scientific processes but in that speedy and elegant style in which young ladies copy maps at first chop boarding schools Nay so transcendent seemed mister Merchator s claims when his show or sample maps were exhibited to us that some in our Board and nearly everybody out of it were confident he would do for Professor of Mathematics and even Principal 
5635_58137_000007_000000	train-clean-360	But of all our unsuccessful candidates we shall introduce by name only two mister 
5635_58137_000007_000001	train-clean-360	James Jimmy A S S and mister Solomon Rapid A to Z 
5635_58137_000009_000001	train-clean-360	mister Jimmy 
5635_58137_000008_000000	train-clean-360	mister Jimmy who aspired to the mathematical chair was master of a small school of all sexes near Woodville 
5635_58137_000008_000001	train-clean-360	At the first he was kindly yet honestly told his knowledge was too limited and inaccurate yet notwithstanding this and some almost rude repulses afterward he persisted in his application and his hopes 
5635_58137_000008_000002	train-clean-360	To give evidence of competency he once told me he was arranging a new spelling book the publication of which would make him known as a literary man and be an unspeakable advantage to the rising generation And this naturally brought on the following colloquy about the work 
5635_58137_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah indeed 
none	none	mister Jimmy Yes indeed mister Carlton
5635_58137_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 On what new principle do you go sir 
none	none	Why sir on the principles of nature and common sense 
5635_58137_000012_000001	train-clean-360	I allow school books for schools are all too powerful obstruse and hard like to be understood without exemplifying illustrations 
5635_58137_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but mister Jimmy how is a child s spelling book to be made any plainer 
5635_58137_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Why sir by clear explifications of the words in one column by exemplifying illustrations in the other 
5635_58137_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 I do not understand you mister Jimmy give me a specimen 
none	none	Sir
5635_58137_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 An example 
none	none	To be sure here s a spes a example you see for instance I put in the spelling column C r e a m cream and here in the explification column I put the exemplifying illustration Unctious part of milk We had asked at our first interview if our candidate was an algebraist and his reply was negative but he allowed he could qualify by the time of election as he was powerful good at figures and had cyphered clean through every arithmetic he had ever seen the rule of promiscuous questions and all Hence some weeks after as I was passing his door on my way to a squirrel hunt with a party of friends mister Jimmy hurrying out with a slate in his hand begged me to stop a moment and thus addressed me
5635_58137_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Well mister Carlton this algebra is a most powerful thing ain t it 
5635_58137_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Indeed it is mister Jimmy have you been looking into it 
5635_58137_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 looking into it 
none	none	Looking into it I have been all through this here fust part and by election time I allow I ll be ready for examination Indeed
5635_58137_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes sir but it is such a pretty thing 
5635_58137_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Only to think of cyphering by letters 
5635_58137_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Why sir the sums come out and bring the answers exactly like figures 
none	none	Jist stop a minute look here a stands for six and b stands for eight and c stands for four and d stands for figure ten now if I say a plus b minus c equals d it is all the same as if I said six is six and eight makes fourteen and four subtracted leaves ten 
5635_58137_000024_000004	train-clean-360	Why sir I done a whole slate full of letters and signs and afterward when I tried by figures they every one of them came out right and brung the answer 
5635_58137_000024_000005	train-clean-360	I mean to cypher by letters altogether 
5635_58137_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Jimmy my company is nearly out of sight if you can get along this way through simple and quadratic equations by our meeting your chance will not be so bad good morning sir 
5635_58137_000026_000000	train-clean-360	But our man of letters quit cyphering the new way and returned to plain figures long before reaching equations and so he could not become our professor 
none	none	Yet anxious to do us all the good in his power after our college opened he waited on me a leading trustee with a proposal to board our students and authorized me to publish as how mister James Jimmy will take strange students students not belonging to Woodville to board at one dollar a week and find everything washing included and will black their shoes three times a week to boot and give them their dog wood and cherry bitters every morning into the bargain 
5635_58137_000027_000000	train-clean-360	The most extraordinary candidate however was mister Solomon Rapid 
5635_58137_000027_000001	train-clean-360	He was now somewhat advanced into the shaving age and was ready to assume offices the most opposite in character although justice compels us to say mister Rapid was as fit for one thing as another 
5635_58137_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Deeming it waste of time to prepare for any station till he was certain of obtaining it he wisely demanded the place first and then set to work to become qualified for its duties being I suspect the very man or some relation of his who is recorded as not knowing whether he could read Greek as he had never tried 
none	none	And besides mister Solomon Rapid contended that all offices from president down to fence viewer were open to every white American citizen and that every republican had a blood bought right to seek any that struck his fancy and if the profits were less or the duties more onerous than had been anticipated that a man ought to resign and try another Naturally therefore mister Rapid thought he would like to sit in our chair of languages or have some employment in the State college and hence he called for that purpose on doctor Sylvan who knowing the candidate s character maliciously sent him to me Accordingly the young gentleman presented himself and without ceremony instantly made known his business thus
5635_58137_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 I heerd sir you wanted somebody to teach the State school and I m come to let you know I m willing to take the place 
5635_58137_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes sir we are going to elect a professor of languages who is to be the principal and a professor 
none	none	Well I don t care which I take but I m willing to be the principal I can teach sifring reading writing joggerfee surveying grammur spelling definition parsin
5635_58137_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Are you a linguist 
none	none	Sir
5635_58137_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 You of course understand the dead languages 
none	none	Well can t say I ever seed much of them though I have heerd tell of them but I can soon larn them they ain t more than a few of them I allow
5635_58137_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh my dear sir it is not possible we can t 
none	none	Well I never seed what I couldn t larn about as smart as anybody
5635_58137_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Rapid I do not mean to question your abilities but if you are now wholly unacquainted with the dead languages it is impossible for you or any other talented man to learn them under four or five years 
none	none	Pshoo foo I ll bet I larn one in three weeks 
5635_58137_000039_000002	train-clean-360	Try me sir let s have the furst one furst how many are there 
5635_58137_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Rapid it is utterly impossible but if you insist I will loan you a Latin book 
5635_58137_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 That s your sort let s have it that s all I want fair play 
none	none	Accordingly I handed him a copy of Historiae Sacrae with which he soon went away saying he didn t allow it would take long to git through Latin if twas only sich a thin patch of a book as that 
5635_58137_000043_000000	train-clean-360	In a few weeks to my no small surprise mister Solomon Rapid again presented himself and drawing forth the book began with a triumphant expression of countenance 
5635_58137_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Well sir I have done the Latin 
5635_58137_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 done the Latin 
none	none	Done the Latin Yes I can read it as fast as English Read it as fast as English
5635_58137_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes as fast as English and I didn t find it hard at all 
5635_58137_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 May I try you on a page 
5635_58137_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Try away try away that s what I ve come for 
none	none	Please read here then mister Rapid and in order to give him a fair chance I pointed to the first lines of the first chapter viz In principio Deus creavit coelum et terram intra sex dies primo die fecit lucem et cetera That sir and then he read thus In prinspo duse creevit kalelum et terrum intra sex dyes primmo dye fe fe sit looseum et cetera
5635_58137_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 That will do mister Rapid 
none	none	Ah ha 
5635_58137_000054_000001	train-clean-360	I told you so 
5635_58137_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes yes but translate 
5635_58137_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Translate eyebrows elevating 
5635_58137_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes translate render it 
5635_58137_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Render it how s that forehead more wrinkled 
5635_58137_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Why yes render it into English give me the meaning of it 
none	none	MEANING staring full in my face his eyes like saucers and forehead wrinkled with the furrows of eighty MEANING I didn t know it had any meaning I thought it was a DEAD language Well reader I am glad you are not laughing at mister Rapid for how should anything dead speak out so as to be understood And indeed does not his definition suit the vexed feelings of some young gentlemen attempting to read Latin without any interlinear translation and who inwardly cursing both book and teacher blast their souls if they can make any sense out of it The ancients may yet speak in their own languages to a few but to most who boast the honor of their acquaintance they are certainly dead in the sense of Solomon Rapid LITTLE ORPHANT ANNIE BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY Little Orphant Annie s come

that rowing machine out into the hall and come to me It is time for you to learn to read Then Rollo s father opened the book which he had sent home on a truck and talked to the little boy about it It was Bancroft s History of the United States half complete in twenty three volumes Rollo s father explained to Rollo and Mary his system of education with special reference to Rollo s learning to read His plan was that Mary should teach Rollo fifteen hours a day for ten years and by that time Rollo would be half through the beginning of the first volume and would like it very much indeed Rollo was delighted at the prospect He cried aloud Oh papa thank you very much When I read this book clear through all the way to the end of the last volume may I have another little book to read No replied his father that may not be because you will never get to the last volume of this one For as fast as you read one volume the author of this history or his heirs executors administrators or assigns will write another as an appendix So even though you should live to be a very old man like the boy preacher this history will always be twenty three volumes ahead of you Now Mary and Rollo this will be a hard task pronounced tawsk for both of you and Mary must remember that Rollo is a very little boy and must be very patient and gentle The next morning after the one preceding it Mary began the first lesson In the beginning she was so gentle and patient that her mother went away and cried because she feared her dear little daughter was becoming too good for this sinful world and might soon spread her wings and fly away and be an angel But in the space of a short time the novelty of the expedition wore off and Mary resumed running her temper which was of the old fashioned low pressure kind just forward of the fire box on its old schedule When she pointed to A for the seventh time and Rollo said W she tore the page out by the roots hit her little brother such a whack over the head with the big book that it set his birthday back six weeks slapped him twice and was just going to bite him when her mother came in Mary told her that Rollo had fallen down stairs and torn his book and raised that dreadful lump on his head This time Mary s mother restrained her emotion and Mary cried But it was not because she feared her mother was pining away Oh no it was her mother s rugged health and virile strength that grieved Mary as long as the seance lasted which was during the entire performance That evening Rollo s father taught Rollo his lesson and made Mary sit by and observe his methods because he said that would be normal instruction for her He said Mary you must learn to control your temper and curb your impatience if you want to wear low neck dresses and teach school You must be

ELIZABETH ELIZA WRITES A PAPER BY LUCRETIA P HALE Elizabeth Eliza joined the Circumambient Club with the idea that it would be a long time before she a new member would have to read a paper She would have time to hear the other papers read and to see how it was done and she would find it easy when her turn came By that time she would have some ideas and long before she would be called upon she would have leisure to sit down and write out something But a year passed away and the time was drawing near She had meanwhile devoted herself to her studies and had tried to inform herself on all subjects by way of preparation She had consulted one of the old members of the Club as to the choice of a subject Oh write about anything was the answer anything you have been thinking of Elizabeth Eliza was forced to say she had not been thinking lately She had not had time The family had moved and there was always an excitement about something that prevented her sitting down to think Why not write on your family adventures asked the old member Elizabeth Eliza was sure her mother would think it made them too public and most of the Club papers she observed had some thought in them She preferred to find an idea So she set herself to the occupation of thinking She went out on the piazza to think she stayed in the house to think She tried a corner of the china closet She tried thinking in the cars and lost her pocket book she tried it in the garden and walked into the strawberry bed In the house and out of the house it seemed to be the same she could not think of anything to think of For many weeks she was seen sitting on the sofa or in the window and nobody disturbed her She is thinking about her paper the family would say but she only knew that she could not think of anything Agamemnon told her that many writers waited till the last moment when inspiration came which was much finer than anything studied Elizabeth Eliza thought it would be terrible to wait till the last moment if the inspiration should not come She might combine the two ways wait till a few days before the last and then sit down and write anyhow This would give a chance for inspiration while she would not run the risk of writing nothing She was much discouraged Perhaps she had better give it up But no everybody wrote a paper if not now she would have to do it some time And at last the idea of a subject came to her But it was as hard to find a moment to write as to think The morning was noisy till the little boys had gone to school for they had begun again upon their regular course with the plan of taking up the study of cider in October And after the little boys had gone to school now it was one thing now it was another the china closet to be cleaned or one of the neighbors in to look at the sewing machine She tried after dinner but would fall asleep She felt that evening would be the true time after the cares of the day were over The Peterkins had wire mosquito nets all over the house at every door and every window They were as eager to keep out the flies as the mosquitoes The doors were all furnished with strong springs that pulled the doors to as soon as they were opened The little boys had practised running in and out of each door and slamming it after them This made a good deal of noise for they had gained great success in making one door slam directly after another and at times would keep up a running volley of artillery as they called it with the slamming of the doors mister Peterkin however preferred it to flies So Elizabeth Eliza felt she would venture to write of a summer evening with all the windows open She seated herself one evening in the library between two large kerosene lamps with paper pen and ink before her It was a beautiful night with the smell of the roses coming in through the mosquito nets and just the faintest odor of kerosene by her side She began upon her work But what was her dismay She found herself immediately surrounded with mosquitoes They attacked her at every point They fell upon her hand as she moved it to the inkstand they hovered buzzing over her head they planted themselves under the lace of her sleeve If she moved her left hand to frighten them off from one point another band fixed themselves upon her right hand Not only did they flutter and sting but they sang in a heathenish manner distracting her attention as she tried to write as she tried to waft them off Nor was this all Myriads of June bugs and millers hovered round flung themselves into the lamps and made disagreeable funeral pyres of themselves tumbling noisily on her paper in their last unpleasant agonies Occasionally one darted with a rush toward Elizabeth Eliza s head If there was anything Elizabeth Eliza had a terror of it was a June bug She had heard that they had a tendency to get into the hair One had been caught in the hair of a friend of hers who had long luxuriant hair But the legs of the June bug were caught in it like fishhooks and it had to be cut out and the June bug was only extricated by sacrificing large masses of the flowing locks Elizabeth Eliza flung her handkerchief over her head Could she sacrifice what hair she had to the claims of literature She gave a cry of dismay The little boys rushed in a moment to the rescue They flapped newspapers flung sofa cushions they offered to stand by her side with fly whisks that she might be free to write But the struggle was too exciting for her and the flying insects seemed to increase Moths of every description large brown moths small delicate white millers whirled about her while the irritating hum of the mosquito kept on more than ever mister Peterkin and the rest of the family came in to inquire about the trouble It was discovered that each of the little boys had been standing in the opening of a wire door for some time watching to see when Elizabeth Eliza would have made her preparations and would begin to write Countless numbers of dorbugs and winged creatures of every description had taken occasion to come in It was found that they were in every part of the house We might open all the blinds and screens suggested Agamemnon and make a vigorous onslaught and drive them all out at once I do believe there are more inside than out now said Solomon John The wire nets of course said Agamemnon keep them in now We might go outside proposed Solomon John and drive in all that are left Then to morrow morning when they are all torpid kill them and make collections of them Agamemnon had a tent which he had provided in case he should ever go to the Adirondacks and he proposed using it for the night The little boys were wild for this missus Peterkin thought she and Elizabeth Eliza would prefer trying to sleep in the house But perhaps Elizabeth Eliza would go on with her paper with more comfort out of doors A student s lamp was carried out and she was established on the steps of the back piazza while screens were all carefully closed to prevent the mosquitoes and insects from flying out But it was no use There were outside still swarms of winged creatures that plunged themselves about her and she had not been there long before a huge miller flung himself into the lamp and put it out She gave up for the evening Still the paper went on How fortunate exclaimed Elizabeth Eliza that I did not put it off till the last evening Having once begun she persevered in it at every odd moment of the day Agamemnon presented her with a volume of Synonymes which was a great service to her She read her paper in its various stages to Agamemnon first for his criticism then to her father in the library then to mister and missus Peterkin together next to Solomon John and afterward to the whole family assembled She was almost glad that the lady from Philadelphia was not in town as she wished it to be her own unaided production She declined all invitations for the week before the night of the Club and on the very day she kept her room with eau sucree that she might save her voice Solomon John provided her with Brown s Bronchial Troches when the evening came and missus Peterkin advised a handkerchief over her head in case of June bugs It was however a cool night Agamemnon escorted her to the house The Club met at Ann Maria Bromwick s No gentlemen were admitted to the regular meetings There were what Solomon John called occasional annual meetings to which they were invited when all the choicest papers of the year were re read Elizabeth Eliza was placed at the head of the room at a small table with a brilliant gas jet on one side It was so cool the windows could be closed missus Peterkin as a guest sat in the front row This was her paper as Elizabeth Eliza read it for she frequently inserted fresh expressions THE SUN It is impossible that much can be known about it This is why we have taken it up as a subject We mean the sun that lights us by day and leaves us by night In the first place it is so far off No measuring tapes could reach it and both the earth and the sun are moving about us that it would be difficult to adjust ladders to reach it if we could Of course people have written about it and there are those who have told us how many miles off it is But it is a very large number with a great many figures in it and though it is taught in most if not all of our public schools it is a chance if any one of the scholars remembers exactly how much it is It is the same with its size We can not as we have said reach it by ladders to measure it and if we did reach it we should have no measuring tapes large enough and those that shut up with springs are difficult to use in a high places We are told it is true in a great many of the school books the size of the sun but again very few of those who have learned the number have been able to remember it after they have recited it even if they remembered it then And almost all of the scholars have lost their school books or have neglected to carry them home and so they are not able to refer to them I mean after leaving school I must say that is the case with me I should say with us though it was different The older ones gave their school books to the younger ones who took them back to school to lose them or who have destroyed them when there were no younger ones to go to school I should say there are such families What I mean is the fact that in some families there are no younger children to take off the school books But even then they are put away on upper shelves in closets or in attics and seldom found if wanted if then dusty Of course we all know of a class of persons called astronomers who might be able to give us information on the subject in hand and who probably do furnish what information is found in school books It should be observed however that these astronomers carry on their observations always in the night Now it is well known that the sun does not shine in the night Indeed that is one of the peculiarities of the night that there is no sun to light us so we have to go to bed as long as there is nothing else we can do without its light unless we use lamps gas or kerosene which is very well for the evening but would be expensive all night long the same with candles How then can we depend upon their statements if not made from their own observation I mean if they never saw the sun We can not expect that astronomers should give us any valuable information with regard to the sun which they never see their occupation compelling them to be up at night It is quite likely that they never see it for we should not expect them to sit up all day as well as all night as under such circumstances their lives would not last long Indeed we are told that their name is taken from the word aster which means star the word is aster know more This doubtless means that they know more about the stars than other things We see therefore that their knowledge is confined to the stars and we can not trust what they have to tell us of the sun There are other asters which should not be mixed up with these we mean those growing by the wayside in the fall of the year The astronomers from their nocturnal habits can scarcely be acquainted with them but as it does not come within our province we will not inquire We are left then to seek our own information about the sun But we are met with a difficulty To know a thing we must look at it How can we look at the sun It is so very bright that our eyes are dazzled in gazing upon it We have to turn away or they would be put out the sight I mean It is true we might use smoked glass but that is apt to come off on the nose How then if we can not look at it can we find out about it The noonday would seem to be the better hour when it is the sunniest but besides injuring the eyes it is painful to the neck to look up for a long time It is easy to say that our examination of this heavenly body should take place at sunrise when we could look at it more on a level without having to endanger the spine But how many people are up at sunrise Those who get up early do it because they are compelled to and have something else to do than look at the sun The milkman goes forth to carry the daily milk the ice man to leave the daily ice But either of these would be afraid of exposing their vehicles to the heating orb of day the milkman afraid of turning the milk the ice man timorous of melting his ice and they probably avoid those directions where they shall meet the sun s rays The student who might inform us has been burning the midnight oil The student is not in the mood to consider the early sun There remains to us the evening also the leisure hour of the day But alas our houses are not built with an adaptation to this subject They are seldom made to look toward the sunset A careful inquiry and close observation such as have been called for in preparation of this paper have developed the fact that not a single house in this town faces the sunset There may be windows looking that way but in such a case there is always a barn between I can testify to this from personal observations because with my brothers we have walked through the several streets of this town with note books carefully noting every house looking upon the sunset and have found none from which the sunset could be studied Sometimes it was the next house sometimes a row of houses or its own wood house that stood in the way Of course a study of the sun might be pursued out of doors But in summer sunstroke would be likely to follow in winter neuralgia and cold And how could you consult your books your dictionaries your encyclopaedias There seems to be no hour of the day for studying the sun You might go to the East to see it at its rising or to the West to gaze upon its setting but you don t Here Elizabeth Eliza came to a pause She had written five different endings and had brought them all thinking when the moment came she would choose one of them She was pausing to select one and inadvertently said to close the phrase you don t She had not meant to use the expression which she would not have thought sufficiently imposing it dropped out unconsciously but it was received as a close with rapturous applause She had read slowly and now that the audience applauded at such a length she had time to feel she was much exhausted and glad of an end Why not stop there though there were some pages more Applause too was heard from the outside Some of the gentlemen had come mister Peterkin Agamemnon and Solomon John with others and demanded admission Since it is all over let them in said Ann Maria Bromwick Elizabeth Eliza assented and rose to shake hands with her applauding friends mister STIVER S HORSE BY JAMES MONTGOMERY BAILEY 
6035-58142-0000	train-other-500	The other morning at breakfast missus Perkins observed that mister Stiver in whose house we live had been called away and wanted to know if I would see to his horse through the day
6035-58142-0001	train-other-500	I knew that mister Stiver owned a horse because I occasionally saw him drive out of the yard and I saw the stable every day but what kind of a horse I didn t know I never went into the stable for two reasons in the first place
6035-58142-0002	train-other-500	I had no desire to and secondly I didn t know as the horse cared particularly for company I never took care of a horse in my life and had I been of a less hopeful nature
6035-58142-0003	train-other-500	the charge mister Stiver had left with me might have had a very depressing effect but I told missus Perkins I would do it You know how to take care of a horse don t you said she I gave her a reassuring wink
6035-58142-0004	train-other-500	In fact I knew so little about it that I didn t think it safe to converse more fluently than by winks After breakfast I seized a toothpick and walked out towards the stable
6035-58142-0005	train-other-500	There was nothing particular to do as Stiver had given him his breakfast and I found him eating it so I looked around The horse looked around too and stared pretty hard at me There was but little said on either side
6035-58142-0006	train-other-500	I hunted up the location of the feed and then sat down on a peck measure and fell to studying the beast There is a wide difference in horses Some of them will kick you over and never look around to see what becomes of you
6035-58142-0007	train-other-500	I don t like a disposition like that and I wondered if Stiver s horse was one of them When I came home at noon I went straight to the stable The animal was there all right Stiver hadn t told me what to give him for dinner
6035-58142-0008	train-other-500	and I had not given the subject any thought but I went to the oat box and filled the peck measure and sallied boldly up to the manger When he saw the oats he almost smiled this pleased and amused him I emptied them into the trough
6035-58142-0009	train-other-500	and left him above me to admire the way I parted my hair behind I just got my head up in time to save the whole of it He had his ears back his mouth open
6035-58142-0010	train-other-500	and looked as if he were on the point of committing murder I went out and filled the measure again and climbed up the side of the stall and
none	none	 emptied it on top of him He brought his head up so suddenly at this that I immediately got down 
6035-58142-0011	train-other-500	letting go of everything to do it I struck on the sharp edge of a barrel rolled over a couple of times then disappeared under a hay cutter The peck measure went down on the other side and got mysteriously tangled up in that animal s heels
6035-58142-0012	train-other-500	and he went to work at it and then ensued the most dreadful noise I ever heard in all my life and I have been married eighteen years It did seem as if I never would get out from under that hay cutter
6035-58142-0013	train-other-500	and all the while I was struggling and wrenching myself and the cutter apart
none	none	 that awful beast was kicking around in the stall and making the most appalling sound imaginable 
6035-58142-0014	train-other-500	When I got out I found missus Perkins at the door She had heard the racket and had sped out to the stable her only thought being of me and three stove lids which she had under her arm and one of which she was about to fire at the beast
6035-58142-0015	train-other-500	This made me mad Go away you unfortunate idiot I shouted do you want to knock my brains out For I remembered seeing missus Perkins sling a missile once before
6035-58142-0016	train-other-500	and that I nearly lost an eye by the operation although standing on the other side of the house at the time She retired at once And at the same time the animal quieted down but there was nothing left of that peck measure
none	none	 not even the maker s name 
6035-58142-0017	train-other-500	I followed missus Perkins into the house and had her do me up and then I sat down in a chair and fell into a profound strain of meditation After a while I felt better and went out to the stable again
6035-58142-0018	train-other-500	The horse was leaning against the stable stall with eyes half closed and appeared to be very much engrossed in thought Step off to the left I said rubbing his back He didn t step
6035-58142-0019	train-other-500	I got the pitchfork and punched him in the leg with the handle He immediately raised up both hind legs at once and that fork flew out of my hands and went rattling up against the timbers above
6035-58142-0020	train-other-500	and came down again in an instant the end of the handle rapping me with such force on the top of the head that I sat right down on the floor under the impression that I was standing in front of a drug store in the evening
none	none	 I went back to the house and got some more stuff on me 
6035-58142-0021	train-other-500	But I couldn t keep away from that stable I went out there again The thought struck me that what the horse wanted was exercise If that thought had been an empty glycerin can
none	none	 it would have saved a windfall of luck for me 
6035-58142-0022	train-other-500	But exercise would tone him down and exercise him I should I laughed to myself to think how I would trounce him around the yard I didn t laugh again that afternoon
6035-58142-0023	train-other-500	I got him unhitched and then wondered how I was to get him out of the stall without carrying him out I pushed but he wouldn t budge I stood looking at him in the face thinking of something to say
6035-58142-0024	train-other-500	when he suddenly solved the difficulty by veering about and plunging for the door I followed as a matter of course because I had a tight hold on the rope and hit about every partition stud worth speaking of on that side of the barn
6035-58142-0025	train-other-500	missus Perkins was at the window and saw us come out of the door She subsequently remarked that we came out skipping like two innocent children The skipping was entirely unintentional on my part
6035-58142-0026	train-other-500	I felt as if I stood on the verge of eternity My legs may have skipped but my mind was filled with awe I took the animal out to exercise him He exercised me before I got through with it
6035-58142-0027	train-other-500	He went around a few times in a circle then he stopped suddenly spread out his forelegs and looked at me Then he leaned forward a little and hoisted both hind legs and threw about two coal hods of mud
none	none	 over a line full of clothes missus Perkins had just hung out 
6035-58142-0028	train-other-500	That excellent lady had taken a position at the window and whenever the evolutions of the awful beast permitted I caught a glance of her features She appeared to be very much interested in the proceedings but the instant that the mud flew
6035-58142-0029	train-other-500	she disappeared from the window and a moment later she appeared on the stoop
none	none	 with a long poker in her hand and fire enough in her eye to heat it red hot 
6035-58142-0030	train-other-500	Just then Stiver s horse stood up on his hind legs and tried to hug me with the others This scared me A horse never shows his strength to such advantage as when he is coming down on you like a frantic pile driver
6035-58142-0031	train-other-500	I instantly dodged and the cold sweat fairly boiled out of me It suddenly came over me that I had once figured in a similar position years ago
6035-58142-0032	train-other-500	My grandfather owned a little white horse that would get up from a meal at Delmonico s to kick the President of the United States He sent me to the lot one day and unhappily suggested that I often went after that horse
6035-58142-0033	train-other-500	and suffered all kinds of defeat in getting him out of the pasture but I had never tried to ride him Heaven knows I never thought of it I had my usual trouble with him that day He tried to jump over me and push me down in a mud hole
6035-58142-0034	train-other-500	and finally got up on his hind legs and came waltzing after me with facilities enough to convert me into hash but I turned and just made for that fence with all the agony a prospect of instant death could crowd into me
none	none	 If our candidate for the Presidency had run one half as well 
6035-58142-0035	train-other-500	there would be seventy five postmasters in Danbury to day instead of one I got him out finally and then he was quiet enough and I took him up alongside the fence and got on him He stopped an instant
6035-58142-0036	train-other-500	one brief instant and then tore off down the road at a frightful speed I lay down on him and clasped my hands tightly around his neck and thought of my home
6035-58142-0037	train-other-500	When we got to the stable I was confident he would stop but he didn t He drove straight at the door It was a low door just high enough to permit him to go in at lightning speed but there was no room for me
6035-58142-0038	train-other-500	I saw if I struck that stable the struggle would be a very brief one I thought this all over in an instant and then spreading put my arms and legs emitted a scream and the next moment I was
6035-58142-0039	train-other-500	bounding about in the filth of that stable yard All this passed through my mind as Stiver s horse went up into the air It frightened missus Perkins dreadfully Why you old fool she said
6035-58142-0040	train-other-500	why don t you get rid of him How can I said I in desperation Why there are a thousand ways said she This is just like a woman How differently a statesman would have answered
6035-58142-0041	train-other-500	But I could think of only two ways to dispose of the beast I could either swallow him where he stood and then sit down on him or I could crawl inside of him and kick him to death
none	none	 But I was saved either of these expedients by his coming towards me so abruptly that I dropped the rope in terror 
6035-58142-0042	train-other-500	and then he turned about and kicking me full of mud shot for the gate
none	none	 ripping the clothes line in two and went on down the street at a horrible gallop 
6035-58142-0043	train-other-500	with two of missus Perkins garments which he hastily snatched from the line floating over his neck in a very picturesque manner So I was afterwards told
none	none	 I was too full of mud myself to see the way into the house Stiver got his horse all right and stays at home to care for him missus Perkins has gone to her mother s to recuperate and I am healing as fast as possible THE CRIMSON CORD one BY ELLIS PARKER BUTLER I had not seen Perkins for six months or so and things were dull I was beginning to tire of sitting indolently in my office with nothing to do but clip coupons from my bonds Money is good enough in its way but it is not interesting unless it is doing something lively doubling itself or getting lost What I wanted was excitement an adventure and I knew that if I could find Perkins I could have both A scheme is a business adventure and Perkins was the greatest schemer in or out of Chicago Just then Perkins walked into my office Perkins I said as soon as he had arranged his feet comfortably on my desk I m tired I m restless I have been wishing for you for a month I want to go into a big scheme and make a lot of new up to date cash I m sick of this tame old cash that I have It isn t interesting No cash is interesting except the coming cash I m with you said Perkins what is your scheme I have none I said sadly that is just my trouble I have sat here for days trying to think of a good practical scheme but I can t I don t believe there is an unworked scheme in the whole wide wide world Perkins waved his hand My boy he exclaimed there are millions You ve thousands of em right here in your office You re falling over them sitting on them walking on them Schemes Everything is a scheme Everything has money in it I shrugged my shoulders Yes I said for you But you are a genius Genius yes Perkins said smiling cheerfully else why Perkins the Great Why Perkins the originator Why the Great and Only Perkins of Portland All right I said what I want is for your genius to get busy I ll give you a week to work up a good scheme Perkins pushed back his hat and brought his feet to the floor with a smack Why the delay he queried time is money Hand me something from your desk I looked in my pigeonholes and pulled from one a small ball of string Perkins took it in his hand and looked at it with great admiration What is it he asked seriously That I said humoring him for I knew something great would be evolved from his wonderful brain is a ball of red twine I bought at the ten cent store I bought it last Saturday It was sold to me by a freckled young lady in a white shirtwaist I paid Stop Perkins cried what is it I looked at the ball of twine curiously I tried to see something remarkable in it I couldn t It remained a simple ball of red twine and I told Perkins so The difference declared Perkins between mediocrity and genius Mediocrity always sees red twine genius sees a ball of Crimson Cord He leaned back in his chair and looked at me triumphantly He folded his arms as if he had settled the matter His attitude seemed to say that he had made a fortune for us Suddenly he reached forward and grasping my scissors began snipping off small lengths of the twine The Crimson Cord he ejaculated What does it suggest I told him that it suggested a parcel from the druggist s I had often seen just such twine about a druggist s parcel Perkins sniffed disdainfully Druggists he exclaimed with disgust Mystery Blood The Crimson Cord Daggers Murder Strangling Clues The Crimson Cord He motioned wildly with his hands as if the possibilities of the phrase were quite beyond his power of expression It sounds like a book I suggested Great cried Perkins A novel The novel Think of the words A Crimson Cord in blood red letters six feet high on a white ground He pulled his hat over his eyes and spread out his hands and I think he shuddered Think of A Crimson Cord he muttered in blood red letters on a ground of dead sepulchral black with a crimson cord writhing through them like a serpent He sat up suddenly and threw one hand in the air Think he cried of the words in black on white with a crimson cord drawn taut across the whole ad He beamed upon me The cover of the book he said quite calmly will be white virgin spotless white with black lettering and the cord in crimson With each copy we will give a crimson silk cord for a book mark Each copy will be done up in a white box and tied with crimson cord He closed his eyes and tilted his head upward A thick book he said with deckel edges and pictures by Christy No pictures by Pyle Deep mysterious pictures Shadows and gloom And wide wide margins And a gloomy foreword One fifty per copy at all booksellers Perkins opened his eyes and set his hat straight with a quick motion of his hand He arose and pulled on his gloves Where are you going I asked Contracts he said Contracts for advertising We must boom The Crimson Cord We must boom her big He went out and closed the door Presently when I supposed him well on the way down town he opened the door and inserted his head Gilt tops he announced One million copies the first impression And then he was gone II A week later Chicago and the greater part of the United States was placarded with The Crimson Cord Perkins did his work thoroughly and well and great was the interest in the mysterious title It was an old dodge but a good one Nothing appeared on the advertisements but the mere title No word as to what The Crimson Cord was Perkins merely announced the words and left them to rankle in the reader s mind and as a natural consequence each new advertisement served to excite new interest When we made our contracts for magazine advertising and we took a full page in every worthy magazine the publishers were at a loss to classify the advertisement and it sometimes appeared among the breakfast foods and sometimes sandwiched in between the automobiles and the hot water heaters Only one publication placed it among the books But it was all good advertising and Perkins was a busy man He racked his inventive brain for new methods of placing the title before the public In fact so busy was he at his labor of introducing the title that he quite forgot the book itself One day he came to the office with a small rectangular package He unwrapped it in his customary enthusiastic manner and set on my desk a cigar box bound in the style he had selected for the binding of The Crimson Cord It was then I spoke of the advisability of having something to the book besides the cover and a boom Perkins I said don t you think it is about time we got hold of the novel the reading the words For a moment he seemed stunned It was clear that he had quite forgotten that book buyers like to have a little reading matter in their books But he was only dismayed for a moment Tut he cried presently All in good time The novel is easy Anything will do I m no literary man I don t read a book in a year You get the novel But I don t read a book in five years I exclaimed I don t know anything about books I don t know where to get a novel Advertise he exclaimed Advertise You can get anything from an apron to an ancestor if you advertise for it Offer a prize offer a thousand dollars for the best novel There must be thousands of novels not in use Perkins was right I advertised as he suggested and learned that there were thousands of novels not in use They came to us by basketfuls and cartloads We had novels of all kinds historical and hysterical humorous and numerous but particularly numerous You would be surprised to learn how many ready made novels can be had on short notice It beats quick lunch And most of them are equally indigestible I read one or two but I was no judge of novels Perkins suggested that we draw lots to see which we should use It really made little difference what the story was about The Crimson Cord fits almost any kind of a book It is a nice non committal sort of title and might mean the guilt that bound two sinners or the tie of affection that binds lovers or a blood relationship or it might be a mystification title with nothing in the book about it But the choice settled itself One morning a manuscript arrived that was tied with a piece of red twine and we chose that one for good luck because of the twine Perkins said that was a sufficient excuse for the title too We would publish the book anonymously and let it be known that the only clue to the writer was the crimson cord with which the manuscript was tied when we received it It would be a first class advertisement Perkins however was not much interested in the story and he left me to settle the details I wrote to the author asking him to call and he turned out to be a young woman Our interview was rather shy I was a little doubtful about the proper way to talk to a real author being purely a Chicagoan myself and I had an idea that while my usual vocabulary was good enough for business purposes it might be too easy going to impress a literary person properly and in trying to talk up to her standard I had to be very careful in my choice of words No publisher likes to have his authors think he is weak in the grammar line Miss Rosa Belle Vincent however was quite as flustered as I was She seemed ill at ease and anxious to get away which I supposed was because she had not often conversed with publishers who paid a thousand dollars cash in advance for a manuscript She was not at all what I had thought an author would look like She didn t even wear glasses If I had met her on the street I should have said There goes a pretty flip stenographer She was that kind big picture hat and high pompadour I was afraid she would try to run the talk into literary lines and Ibsen and Gorky where I would have been swamped in a minute but she didn t and although I had wondered how to break the subject of money when conversing with one who must be thinking of nobler things I found she was less shy when on that subject than when talking about her book Well now I said as soon as I had got her seated we have decided to buy this novel of yours Can you recommend it as a thoroughly respectable and intellectual production She said she could Haven t you read it she asked in some surprise No I stammered At least not yet I m going to as soon as I can find the requisite leisure You see we are very busy just now very busy But if you can vouch for the story being a first class article something say like The Vicar of Wakefield or David Harum we ll take it Now you re talking she said And do I get the check now Wait I said not so fast I have forgotten one thing and I saw her face fall We want the privilege of publishing the novel under a title of our own and anonymously If that is not satisfactory the deal is off She brightened in a moment It s a go if that s all she said Call it whatever you please and the more anonymous it is the better it will suit yours truly So we settled the matter then and there and when I gave her our check for a thousand she said I was all right III Half an hour after Miss Vincent had left the office Perkins came in with his arms full of bundles which he opened spreading their contents on my desk He had a pair of suspenders with nickel silver mountings a tie a lady s belt a pair of low shoes a shirt a box of cigars a package of cookies and a half dozen other things of divers and miscellaneous character I poked them over and examined them while he leaned against the desk with his legs crossed He was beaming upon me Well I said what is it a bargain sale Perkins leaned over and tapped the pile with his long fore finger Aftermath he crowed aftermath The dickens it is I exclaimed and what has aftermath got to do with this truck It looks like the aftermath of a notion store He tipped his Air the Hair hat over one ear and put his thumbs in the armholes of his ready tailored vest Genius he announced Brains Foresight Else why Perkins the Great Why not Perkins the Nobody He raised the suspenders tenderly from the pile and fondled them in his hands See this he asked running his finger along the red corded edge of the elastic He took up the tie and ran his nail along the red stripe that formed the selvedge on the back and said See this He pointed to the red laces of the low shoes and asked See this And so through the whole collection What is it he asked It s genius It s foresight He waved his hand over the pile The aftermath he exclaimed These suspenders are the Crimson Cord suspenders These shoes are the Crimson Cord shoes This tie is the Crimson Cord tie These crackers are the Crimson Cord brand Perkins company get out a great book The Crimson Cord Sell five million copies Dramatized it runs three hundred nights Everybody talking Crimson Cord Country goes Crimson Cord crazy Result up jump Crimson Cord this and Crimson Cord that Who gets the benefit Perkins company No We pay the advertising bills and the other man sells his Crimson Cord cigars That is usual Yes I said I m smoking a David Harum cigar this minute and I am wearing a Carvel collar How prevent it asked Perkins One way only discovered by Perkins Copyright the words Crimson Cord as trade mark for every possible thing Sell the trade mark on royalty ten per cent of all receipts for Crimson Cord brands comes to Perkins company Get a cinch on the aftermath Perkins I cried I admire you You are a genius And have you contracts with all these notions Yes said Perkins that s Perkins method Who originated the Crimson Cord Perkins did Who is entitled to the profits on the Crimson Cord Perkins is Perkins is wide awake all the time Perkins gets a profit on the aftermath and the math and the before the math And so he did He made his new contracts with the magazines on the exchange plan we gave a page of advertising in the Crimson Cord for a page of advertising in the magazine We guaranteed five million circulation We arranged with all the manufacturers of the Crimson Cord brands of goods to give coupons one hundred of which entitled the holder to a copy of The Crimson Cord With a pair of Crimson Cord suspenders you get five coupons with each Crimson Cord cigar one coupon and so on IV On the first of October we announced in our advertisement that The Crimson Cord was a book the greatest novel of the century a thrilling exciting tale of love Miss Vincent had told me it was a love story Just to make everything sure however I sent the manuscript to Professor Wiggins who is the most erudite man I ever met He knows eighteen languages and reads Egyptian as easily as I read English In fact his specialty is old Egyptian ruins and so on He has written several books on them Professor said the novel seemed to him very light and trashy but grammatically O K He said he never read novels not having time but he thought that The Crimson Cord was just about the sort of thing a silly public that refused to buy his Some Light on the Dynastic Proclivities of the Hyksos would scramble for On the whole I considered the report satisfactory We found we would be unable to have Pyle illustrate the book he being too busy so we turned it over to a young man at the Art Institute That was the fifteenth of October and we had promised the book to the public for the first of November but we had it already in type and the young man his name was Gilkowsky promised to work night and day on the illustrations The next morning almost as soon as I reached the office Gilkowsky came in He seemed a little hesitant but I welcomed him warmly and he spoke up I have a girl to go with he said and I wondered what I had to do with mister Gilkowsky s girl but he continued She s a nice girl and a good looker but she s got bad taste in some things She s too loud in hats and too trashy in literature I don t like to say this about her but it s true and I m trying to educate her in good hats and good literature So I thought it would be a good thing to take around this Crimson Cord and let her read it to me I nodded Did she like it I asked mister Gilkowsky looked at me closely She did he said but not so enthusiastically as I had expected It s her favorite book Now I don t know what your scheme is and I suppose you know what you are doing better than I do but I thought perhaps I had better come around before I got to work on the illustrations and see if perhaps you hadn t given me the wrong manuscript No that was the right manuscript I said Was there anything wrong about it mister Gilkowsky laughed nervously Oh no he said But did you read it I told him I had not because I had been so rushed with details connected with advertising the book Well he said I ll tell you This girl of mine reads pretty trashy stuff and she knows about all the cheap novels there are She dotes on The Duchess and puts her last dime into Braddon She knows them all by heart Have you ever read Lady Audley s Secret I see I said One is a sequel to the other No said mister Gilkowsky One is the other Some one has flim flammed you and sold you a typewritten copy of Lady Audley s Secret as a new novel V When I told Perkins he merely remarked that he thought every publishing house ought to have some one in it who knew something about books apart from the advertising end although that was of course the most important He said we might go ahead and publish Lady Audley s Secret under the title of The Crimson Cord as such things had been done before but the best thing to do would be to charge Rosa Belle Vincent s thousand dollars to Profit and Loss and hustle for another novel something reliable and not shop worn Perkins had been studying the literature market a little and he advised me to get something from Indiana this time so I telegraphed an advertisement to the Indianapolis papers and two days later we had ninety eight historical novels by Indiana authors from which to choose Several were of the right length and we chose one and sent it to mister Gilkowsky with a request that he read it to his sweetheart She had never read it before We sent a detective to Dillville Indiana where the author lived and the report we received was most satisfactory The author was a sober industrious young man just out of the high school and bore a first class reputation for honesty He had never been in Virginia where the scene of his story was laid and they had no library in Dillville and our detective assured us that the young man was in every way fitted to write a historical novel The Crimson Cord made an immense success You can guess how it boomed when I say that although it was published at a dollar and a half it was sold by every department store for fifty four cents away below cost just like sugar or Vandeventer s Baby Food or Q Z Corsets or any other staple We sold our first edition of five million copies inside of three months and got out another edition of two million and a specially illustrated holiday edition and an edition de luxe and The Crimson Cord is still selling in paper covered cheap edition With the royalties received from the aftermath and the profit on the book itself we made well Perkins has a country place at Lakewood and I have my cottage at Newport Footnote one Copyright nineteen oh four by Leslie s Magazine THE

yit MORRIS AND THE HONORABLE TIM three BY MYRA KELLY On the first day of school after the Christmas holidays teacher found herself surrounded by a howling mob of little savages in which she had much difficulty in recognizing her cherished First Reader Class Isidore Belchatosky s face was so wreathed in smiles and foreign matter as to be beyond identification Nathan Spiderwitz had placed all his trust in a solitary suspender and two unstable buttons Eva Kidansky had entirely freed herself from restraining hooks and eyes Isidore Applebaum had discarded shoe laces and Abie Ashnewsky had bartered his only necktie for a yard of shoe string licorice Miss Bailey was greatly disheartened by this reversion to the original type She delivered daily lectures on nail brushes hair ribbons shoe polish pins buttons elastic and other means to grace Her talks on soap and water became almost personal in tone and her insistence on a close union between such garments as were meant to be united led to a lively traffic in twisted and disreputable safety pins And yet the First Reader Class in all other branches of learning so receptive and responsive made but halting and uncertain progress toward that state of virtue which is next to godliness Early in January came the report that Gum Shoe Tim was on the war path and might be expected at any time Miss Bailey heard the tidings in calm ignorance until Miss Blake who ruled over the adjoining kingdom interpreted the warning A license to teach in the public schools of New York is good for only one year Its renewal depends upon the reports of the Principal in charge of the school and of the Associate Superintendent in whose district the school chances to be After three such renewals the license becomes permanent but Miss Bailey was as a teacher barely four months old The Associate Superintendent for her vicinity was the Honorable Timothy O Shea known and dreaded as Gum Shoe Tim owing to his engaging way of creeping softly up back stairs and appearing all unheralded and unwelcome upon the threshold of his intended victim This Miss Blake explained was in defiance of all the rules of etiquette governing such visits of inspection The proper procedure had been that of mister O Shea s predecessor who had always given timely notice of his coming and a hint as to the subjects in which he intended to examine the children Some days later he would amble from room to room accompanied by the amiable Principal and followed by the gratitude of smiling and unruffled teachers This kind old gentleman was now retired and had been succeeded by mister O Shea who in addition to his unexpectedness was adorned by an abominable temper an overbearing manner and a sense of cruel humor He had almost finished his examinations at the nearest school where during a brisk campaign of eight days he had caused five dismissals nine cases of nervous exhaustion and an epidemic of hysteria Day by day nerves grew more tense tempers more unsure sleep and appetite more fugitive Experienced teachers went stolidly on with the ordinary routine while beginners devoted time and energy to the more spectacular portions of the curriculum But no one knew the Honorable Timothy s pet subjects and so no one could specialize to any great extent Miss Bailey was one of the beginners and Room eighteen was made to shine as the sun Morris Mogilewsky Monitor of the Gold Fish Bowl wrought busily until his charges glowed redly against the water plants in their shining bowl Creepers crept plants grew and ferns waved under the care of Nathan Spiderwitz Monitor of the Window Boxes There was such a martial swing and strut in Patrick Brennan s leadership of the line that it inflamed even the timid heart of Isidore Wishnewsky with a war like glow and his feet with a spasmodic but well meant tramp Sadie Gonorowsky and Eva her cousin sat closely side by side no longer mad on theirselves but mit kind feelings The work of the preceding term was laid in neat and docketed piles upon the low book case The children were enjoined to keep clean and entire And Teacher a nervous and unsmiling Teacher waited dully A week passed thus and then the good hearted and experienced Miss Blake hurried ponderously across the hall to put Teacher on her guard I ve just had a note from one of the grammar teachers she panted Gum Shoe Tim is up in Miss Green s room He ll take this floor next Now see here child don t look so frightened The Principal is with Tim Of course you re nervous but try not to show it and you ll be all right His lay is discipline and reading Well good luck to you Miss Bailey took heart of grace The children read surprisingly well were absolutely good and the enemy under convoy of the friendly Principal would be much less terrifying than the enemy at large and alone It was therefore with a manner almost serene that she turned to greet the kindly concerned Principal and the dreaded Gum Shoe Tim The latter she found less ominous of aspect than she had been led to fear and the Principal s charming little speech of introduction made her flush with quick pleasure And the anxious eyes of Sadie Gonorowsky noting the flush grew calm as Sadie whispered to Eva her close cousin Say Teacher has a glad She s red on the face It could to be her papa No It s comp ny answered Eva sagely It ain t her papa It s comp ny the whiles Teacher takes him by the hand The children were not in the least disconcerted by the presence of the large man They always enjoyed visitors and they liked the heavy gold chain which festooned the wide waistcoat of this guest and as they watched him the Associate Superintendent began to superintend He looked at the children all in their clean and smiling rows he looked at the flowers and the gold fish at the pictures and the plaster casts he looked at the work of the last term and he looked at Teacher As he looked he swayed gently on his rubber heels and decided that he was going to enjoy the coming quarter of an hour Teacher pleased him from the first She was neither old nor ill favored and she was most evidently nervous The combination appealed both to his love of power and his peculiar sense of humor Settling deliberately in the chair of state he began Can the children sing Miss Bailey They could sing very prettily and they did Very nice indeed said the voice of visiting authority Very nice Their music is exceptionally good And are they drilled Children will you march for me Again they could and did Patrick marshaled his line in time and triumph up and down the aisles to the evident interest and approval of the comp ny and then Teacher led the class through some very energetic Swedish movements While arms and bodies were bending and straightening at Teacher s command and example the door opened and a breathless boy rushed in He bore an unfolded note and as Teacher had no hand to spare the boy placed the paper on the desk under the softening eyes of the Honorable Timothy who glanced down idly and then pounced upon the note and read its every word For you Miss Bailey he said in the voice before which even the school janitor had been known to quail Your friend was thoughtful though a little late And poor palpitating Miss Bailey read Watch out Gum Shoe Tim is in the building The Principal caught him on the back stairs and they re going round together He s as cross as a bear Greene in dead faint in the dressing room Says he s going to fire her Watch out for him and send the news on His lay is reading and discipline Miss Bailey grew cold with sick and unreasoning fear As she gazed wide eyed at the living confirmation of the statement that Gum Shoe Tim was as cross as a bear the gentle hearted Principal took the paper from her nerveless grasp It s all right he assured her mister O Shea understands that you had no part in this It s all right You are not responsible But Teacher had no ears for his soothing She could only watch with fascinated eyes as the Honorable Timothy reclaimed the note and wrote across it s damning face Miss Greene may come to She is not fired T O S Here boy he called take this to your teacher The puzzled messenger turned to obey and the Associate Superintendent saw that though his dignity had suffered his power had increased To the list of those whom he might if so disposed devour he had now added the name of the Principal who was quick to understand that an unpleasant investigation lay before him If Miss Bailey could not be held responsible for this system of inter classroom communication it was clear that the Principal could Every trace of interest had left mister O Shea s voice as he asked Can they read Oh yes they read responded Teacher but her spirit was crushed and the children reflected her depression Still they were marvelously good and that blundering note had said Discipline is his lay Well here he had it There was one spectator of this drama who understanding no word nor incident therein yet dismissed no shade of the many emotions which had stirred the light face of his lady Toward the front of the room sat Morris Mogilewsky with every nerve tuned to Teacher s and with an appreciation of the situation in which the other children had no share On the afternoon of one of those dreary days of waiting for the evil which had now come Teacher had endeavored to explain the nature and possible result of this ordeal to her favorite It was clear to him now that she was troubled and he held the large and unaccustomed presence of the comp ny mit whiskers responsible Countless generations of ancestors had followed and fostered the instinct which now led Morris to propitiate an angry power Luckily he was prepared with an offering of a suitable nature He had meant to enjoy it for yet a few days and then to give it to Teacher She was such a sensible person about presents One might give her one s most cherished possession with a brave and cordial heart for on each Friday afternoon she returned the gifts she had received during the week And this with no abatement of gratitude Morris rose stealthily crept forward and placed a bright blue bromo seltzer bottle in the fat hand which hung over the back of the chair of state The hand closed instinctively as with dawning curiosity the Honorable Timothy studied the small figure at his side It began in a wealth of loosely curling hair which shaded a delicate face very pointed as to chin and monopolized by a pair of dark eyes sad and deep and beautiful A faded blue jumper was buttoned tightly across the narrow chest frayed trousers were precariously attached to the jumper and impossible shoes and stockings supplemented the trousers Glancing from boy to bottle the comp ny mit whiskers asked What s this for For you What s in it A present mister O Shea removed the cork and proceeded to draw out incredible quantities of absorbent cotton When there was no more to come a faint tinkle sounded within the blue depths and mister O Shea reversing the bottle found himself possessed of a trampled and disfigured sleeve link of most palpable brass It s from gold Morris assured him You puts it in your scuse me shirt Wish you health to wear it Thank you said the Honorable Tim and there was a tiny break in the gloom which had enveloped him And then with a quick memory of the note and of his anger Miss Bailey who is this young man And Teacher of whose hobbies Morris was one answered warmly That is Morris Mogilewsky the best of boys He takes care of the gold fish and does all sorts of things for me Don t you dear Teacher yiss ma an Morris answered I m lovin much mit you I gives presents on the comp ny over you Ain t he rather big to speak such broken English asked mister O Shea I hope you remember that it is part of your duty to stamp out the dialect Yes I know Miss Bailey answered But Morris has been in America for so short a time Nine months is it not Teacher yiss ma an I comes out of Russia responded Morris on the verge of tears and with his face buried in Teacher s dress Now mister O Shea had his prejudices strong and deep He had been given jurisdiction over that particular district because it was his native heath and the Board of Education considered that he would be more in sympathy with the inhabitants than a stranger The truth was absolutely the reverse Because he had spent his early years in a large old house on East Broadway because he now saw his birthplace changed to a squalid tenement and the happy hunting grounds of his youth grown ragged and foreign swarming with strange faces and noisy with strange tongues mister O Shea bore a sullen grudge against the usurping race He resented the caressing air with which Teacher held the little hand placed so confidently within her own and he welcomed the opportunity of gratifying his still ruffled temper and his racial antagonism at the same time He would take a rise out of this young woman about her little Jew She would be comforted later on mister O Shea rather fancied himself in the role of comforter when the sufferer was neither old nor ill favored And so he set about creating the distress which he would later change to gratitude and joy Assuredly the Honorable Timothy had a well developed sense of humor His English is certainly dreadful remarked the voice of authority and it was not an English voice nor is O Shea distinctively an English name Dreadful And by the way I hope you are not spoiling these youngsters You must remember that you are fitting them for the battle of life Don t coddle your soldiers Can you reconcile your present attitude with discipline With Morris yes Teacher answered He is gentle and tractable beyond words Well I hope you re right grunted mister O Shea but don t coddle them And so the incident closed The sleeve link was tucked before Morris s yearning eyes into the reluctant pocket of the wide white waistcoat and Morris returned to his place He found his reader and the proper page and the lesson went on with brisk serenity real on the children s part but bravely assumed on Teacher s Child after child stood up read sat down again and it came to be the duty of Bertha Binderwitz to read the entire page of which the others had each read a line She began jubilantly but soon stumbled hesitated and wailed Stands a fierce word I don t know what it is and Teacher turned to write the puzzling word upon the blackboard Morris s heart stopped with a sickening suddenness and then rushed madly on again He had a new and dreadful duty to perform All his mother s counsel all his father s precepts told him that it was his duty Yet fear held him in his little seat behind his little desk while his conscience insisted on this unalterable decree of the social code So somebody s clothes is wrong it s polite you says scuse and tells it out And here was Teacher whom he dearly loved whose ideals of personal adornment extended to full sets of buttons on jumpers and to laces in both shoes here was his immaculate lady fair in urgent need of assistance and advice and all because she had on that day inaugurated a delightfully vigorous exercise for which architecturally she was not designed There was yet room for hope that some one else would see the breach and brave the danger But no The visitor sat stolidly in the chair of state the Principal sat serenely beside him the children sat each in his own little place behind his own little desk keeping his own little eyes on his own little book No Morris s soul cried with Hamlet s The time is out of joint O cursed spite That ever I was born to set it right Up into the quiet air went his timid hand Teacher knowing him in his more garrulous moods ignored the threatened interruption of Bertha s spirited resume but the windmill action of the little arm attracted the Honorable Tim s attention The best of boys wants you he suggested and Teacher perforce asked Well Morris what is it Not until he was on his feet did the Monitor of the Gold Fish Bowl appreciate the enormity of the mission he had undertaken The other children began to understand and watched his struggle for words and breath with sympathy or derision as their natures prompted But there are no words in which one may politely mention ineffective safety pins to one s glass of fashion Morris s knees trembled queerly his breathing grew difficult and Teacher seemed a very great way off as she asked again Well what is it dear Morris panted a little smiled weakly and then sat down Teacher was evidently puzzled the comp ny alert the Principal uneasy Now Morris Teacher remonstrated you must tell me what you want But Morris had deserted his etiquette and his veracity and murmured only Nothings Just wanted to be noticed said the Honorable Tim It is easy to spoil them And he watched the best of boys rather closely for a habit of interrupting reading lessons wantonly and without reason was a trait in the young of which he disapproved When this disapprobation manifested itself in mister O Shea s countenance the loyal heart of Morris interpreted it as a new menace to his sovereign No later than yesterday she had warned them of the vital importance of coherence Every one knows she had said that only common little boys and girls come apart No one ever likes them and the big stranger was even now misjudging her Again his short arm agitated the quiet air Again his trembling legs upheld a trembling boy Again authority urged Again Teacher asked Well Morris what is it dear All this was as before but not as before was poor harassed Miss Bailey s swoop down the aisle her sudden taking Morris s troubled little face between her soft hands the quick near meeting with her kind eyes the note of pleading in her repetition What do you want Morris He was beginning to answer when it occurred to him that the truth might make her cry There was an unsteadiness about her upper lip which seemed to indicate the possibility Suddenly he found that he no longer yearned for words in which to tell her of her disjointment but for something else anything else to say His miserable eyes escaped from hers and wandered to the wall in desperate search for conversation There was no help in the pictures no inspiration in the plaster casts but on the blackboard he read Tuesday January twenty first nineteen oh two Only the date but he must make it serve With teacher close beside him with the hostile eye of the Honorable Tim upon him hedged round about by the frightened or admiring regard of the First Reader Class Morris blinked rapidly swallowed resolutely and remarked Teacher this year s Nineteen hundred and two and knew that all was over The caressing clasp of Teacher s hands grew into a grip of anger The countenance of mister O Shea took on the beautiful expression of the prophet who has found honor and verification in his own country The best of boys has his off days and this is one of them he remarked Morris said Teacher did you stop a reading lesson to tell me that Do you think I don t know what the year is I m ashamed of you Never had she spoken thus If the telling had been difficult to Morris when she was glad on him it was impossible now that she was a prey to such evident mad feelings And yet he must make some explanation So he murmured Teacher I tells you scuse I know you knows what year stands on y it s polite I tells you something und I had a fraid And so you bothered your Teacher with that nonsense said Tim You re a nice boy Morris s eyes were hardly more appealing than Teacher s as the two culprits for so they felt themselves turned to their judge Morris is a strange boy Miss Bailey explained He can t be managed by ordinary methods And extraordinary methods don t seem to work to day mister O Shea interjected And I think Teacher continued that it might be better not to press the point Oh if you have no control over him mister O Shea was beginning pleasantly when the Principal suggested You d better let us hear what he has to say Miss Bailey make him understand that you are master here And Teacher with a heart sick laugh at the irony of this advice in the presence of the Associate Superintendent turned to obey But Morris would utter no words but these dozens of times repeated I have a fraid Miss Bailey coaxed bribed threatened and cajoled shook him surreptitiously petted him openly The result was always the same It s polite I tells you something out on y I had a fraid But Morris dear of what cried Teacher Are you afraid of me Stop crying now and answer Are you afraid of Miss Bailey N o o oh m a a an Are you afraid of the Principal N o o oh m a a an Are you afraid with a slight pause during which a native hue of honesty was foully done to death of the kind gentleman we are all so glad to see N o o oh m a a an Well then what is the matter with you Are you sick Don t you think you would like to go home to your mother No o o oh m a a an I ain t sick I tells you scuse The repeated imitation of a sorrowful goat was too much for the Honorable Tim Bring that boy to me he commanded I ll show you how to manage refractory and rebellious children With much difficulty and many assurances that the gentleman was not going to hurt him Miss Bailey succeeded in untwining Morris s legs from the supports of the desk and in half carrying half leading him up to the chair of state An ominous silence had settled over the room Eva Gonorowsky was weeping softly and the redoubtable Isidore Applebaum was stiffened in a frozen calm Morris began the Associate Superintendent in his most awful tones will you tell me why you raised your hand Come here sir Teacher urged him gently and like dog to heel he went He halted within a pace or two of mister O Shea and lifted a beseeching face toward him I couldn t to tell nothing out said he I tells you scuse I m got a fraid The Honorable Tim lunged quickly and caught the terrified boy preparatory to shaking him but Morris escaped and fled to his haven of safety his Teacher s arms When Miss Bailey felt the quick clasp of the thin little hands the heavy beating of the over tired heart and the deep convulsive sobs she turned on the Honorable Timothy O Shea and spoke I must ask you to leave this room at once she announced The Principal started and then sat back Teacher s eyes were dangerous and the Honorable Tim might profit by a lesson You ve frightened the child until he can t breathe I can do nothing with him while you remain The examination is ended You may go Now mister O Shea saw he had gone a little too far in his effort to create the proper dramatic setting for his clemency He had not expected the young woman to rise quite so far and high His deprecating half apology half eulogy gave Morris the opportunity he craved Teacher he panted I wants to whisper mit you in the ear With a dexterous movement he knelt upon her lap and tore out his solitary safety pin He then clasped her tightly and made his explanation He began in the softest of whispers which increased in volume as it did in interest so that he reached the climax at the full power of his boy soprano voice Teacher Missis Bailey I know you know what year stands On y it s polite I tells you something und I had a fraid the while the comp ny mit the whiskers sets und rubbers But Teacher it s like this your jumper s sticking out und you could to take mine safety pin He had understood so little of all that had passed that he was beyond being surprised by the result of this communication Miss Bailey had gathered him into her arms and had cried in a queer helpless way And as she cried she had said over and over again Morris how could you Oh how could you dear How could you The Principal and the comp ny mit whiskers looked solemnly at one another for a struggling moment and had then broken into laughter long and loud until the visiting authority was limp and moist The children waited in polite uncertainty but when Miss Bailey after some indecision had contributed a wan smile which later grew into a shaky laugh the First Reader Class went wild Then the Honorable Timothy arose to say good by He reiterated his praise of the singing and reading the blackboard work and the moral tone An awkward pause ensued during which the Principal engaged the young Gonorowskys in impromptu conversation The Honorable Tim crossed over to Miss Bailey s side and steadied himself for a great effort Teacher he began meekly I tells you scuse This sort of thing makes a man feel like a bull in a china shop Do you think the little fellow will shake hands with me I was really only joking But surely he will said Miss Bailey as she glanced down at the tangle of dark curls resting against her breast Morris dear aren t you going to say good by to the gentleman Morris relaxed one hand from its grasp on his lady and bestowed it on mister O Shea Good by said he gently I gives you presents from gold presents the while you re friends mit Teacher I m loving much mit her too At this moment the Principal turned and mister O Shea in a desperate attempt to retrieve his dignity began As to class management and discipline But the Principal was not to be deceived Don t you think mister O Shea said he that you and I had better leave the management of the little ones to the women You have noticed perhaps that this is Nature s method Footnote three From Little Citizens reprinted by permission of McClure Phillips Company Copyright nineteen oh three by

recently published criticism of a comic opera There have been thirty nine new comic operas produced this year and four of em were worth seeing It is very evident that the Gilbert and Sullivan industry hasn t gone to the wall whatever slumps other enterprises have suffered from That is a goodly number said the Poet Thirty nine eh I knew there was a raft of them but I had no idea there were as many as that Why don t you go in and do one mister Poet suggested the Idiot They tell me it s as easy as rolling off a log All you ve got to do is to forget all your ideas and remember all the old jokes you ever heard Slap em together around a lot of dances write two dozen lyrics about some Googoo Belle hire a composer and there you are Hanged if I haven t thought of writing one myself I fancy it isn t as easy as it looks observed the Poet It requires just as much thought to be thoughtless as it does to be thoughtful Nonsense said the Idiot I d undertake the job cheerfully if some manager would make it worth my while and what s more if I ever got into the swing of the business I ll bet I could turn out a libretto a day for three days of the week for the next two months If I had your confidence I d try it laughed the Poet but alas in making me Nature did not design a confidence man Nonsense again said the Idiot Any man who can get the editors to print Sonnets to Diana s Eyebrow and little lyrics of Madison Square Longacre Square Battery Place and Boston Common the way you do has a right to consider himself an adept at bunco I tell you what I ll do with you I ll swap off my confidence for your lyrical facility and see what I can do Why can t we collaborate and get up a libretto for next season They tell me there s large money in it There certainly is if you catch on said the Poet Vastly more than in any other kind of writing that I know I don t know but that I would like to collaborate with you on something of the sort What is your idea Mind s a blank on the subject sighed the Idiot That s the reason I think I can turn the trick As I said before you don t need ideas Better off without em Just sit down and write But you must have some kind of a story persisted the Poet Not to begin with said the Idiot Just write your choruses and songs slap in your jokes fasten em together and the thing is done First act get your hero and heroine into trouble Second act get em out And for the third queried the Poet Don t have a third said the Idiot A third is always superfluous but if you must have it make up some kind of a vaudeville show and stick it in between the first and second Tush said the Bibliomaniac That would make a gay comic opera Of course it would mister Bib the Idiot agreed And that s what we want If there s anything in this world that I hate more than another it is a sombre comic opera I ve been to a lot of em and I give you my word of honor that next to a funeral a comic opera that lacks gaiety is one of the most depressing functions known to modern science Some of em are enough to make an undertaker weep with jealous rage I went to one of em last week called The Skylark with an old chum of mine who is a surgeon You can imagine what sort of a thing it was when I tell you that after the first act he suggested we leave the theater and come back here and have some fun cutting my leg off He vowed that if he ever went to another opera by the same people he d take ether beforehand I shouldn t think that would be necessary sneered the Bibliomaniac If it was as bad as all that why didn t it put you to sleep It did said the Idiot But the music kept waking us up again There was no escape from it except that of actual physical flight Well about this collaboration of ours suggested the Poet What do you think we should do first Write an opening chorus of course said the Idiot What did you suppose A finale Something like this If you want to know who we are Just ask the Evening Star As he smiles on high In the deep blue sky With his tralala la la la We are maidens sweet With tripping feet And the Googoo eyes Of the Skippity hi s And the smile of the fair Gazoo And you ll find our names Mongst the wondrous dames Of the Whos Who hoo hoo hoo Get that sung with spirit by sixty five ladies with blonde wigs and gold slippers otherwise dressed up in the uniform of a troop of Russian Cavalry and you ve got your venture launched Where can you find people like that asked the Bibliomaniac New York s full of em replied the Idiot I don t mean the people to act that sort of thing but where would you lay your scene explained the Bibliomaniac Oh any old place in the Pacific Ocean said the Idiot Make your own geography everybody else does There s a million islands out there of one kind or another and as defenseless as a two weeks old infant If you want a real one fish it out and fire ahead If you don t make one up for yourself and call it The Isle of Piccolo or something of that sort After you ve got your chorus going introduce your villain who should be a man with a deep bass voice and a piratical past He s the chap who rules the roost and is going to marry the heroine to morrow That will make a bully song I m a pirate bold With a heart so cold That it turns the biggest joys to solemn sorrow And the hero ine With her eyes so fine I am going to marry to morrow CHORUS He is go ing to marry to morrow The maid with a heart full of sorrow For her we are sorry For she weds to morry She is go ing to marry to morrow Gee added the Idiot enthusiastically Can t you almost hear that already I am sorry to say said mister Brief that I can You ought to call your heroine Drivelina Splendid cried the Idiot Drivelina goes Well then on comes Drivelina and this beast of a Pirate grabs her by the hand and makes love to her as if he thought wooing was a game of snap the whip She sings a soprano solo of protest and the Pirate summons his hirelings to cast Drivelina into a Donjuan cell when boom an American warship appears on the horizon The crew under the leadership of a man with a squeaky tenor voice named Lieutenant Somebody or other comes ashore puts Drivelina under the protection of the American flag while his crew sings the following We are Jackies Jackies Jackies And we smoke the best tobaccys You can find from Zanzibar to Honeyloo And we fight for Uncle Sammy Yes indeed we do for damme You can bet your life that that s the thing to do doodle do You can bet your life that that s the thing to doodle doodle doodle doodle do Eh What demanded the Idiot Well what yourself asked the Lawyer This is your job What next Well the Pirate gets lively tries to assassinate the Lieutenant who kills half the natives with his sword and is about to slay the Pirate when he discovers that he is his long lost father said the Idiot The heroine then sings a pathetic love song about her Baboon Baby in a green light to the accompaniment of a lot of pink satin monkeys banging cocoa nut shells together This drowsy lullaby puts the Lieutenant and his forces to sleep and the curtain falls on their capture by the Pirate and his followers with the chorus singing Hooray for the Pirate bold With his pockets full of gold He s going to marry to morrow To morrow he ll marry Yes by the Lord Harry He s go ing to marry to mor row And that s a thing to doodle doodle doo There said the Idiot after a pause How is that for a first act It s about as lucid as most of them said the Poet but after all you have got a story there and you said you didn t need one I said you didn t need one to start with corrected the Idiot And I ve proved it I didn t have that story in mind when I started That s where the easiness of the thing comes in Why I didn t even have to think of a name for the heroine The inspiration for that popped right out of mister Brief s mouth as smoothly as though the name Drivelina had been written on his heart for centuries Then the title Isle of Piccolo that s a dandy and I give you my word of honor I d never even thought of a title for the opera until that revealed itself like a flash from the blue and as for the coon song My Baboon Baby there s a chance there for a Zanzibar act that will simply make Richard Wagner and Reginald De Koven writhe with jealousy Can t you imagine the lilt of it My Bab boon ba habee My Bab boon ba habee I love you dee her lee Yes dee hee hee er lee My Baboon ba ha bee My Baboon ba ha bee My baboon Ba hay hay hay hay hay hay bee bee And all those pink satin monkeys bumping their cocoanut shells together in the green moonlight Well after the first act what asked the Bibliomaniac The usual intermission said the Idiot You don t have to write that The audience generally knows what to do But your second act asked the Poet Oh come off said the Idiot rising We were to do this thing in collaboration So far I ve done the whole blooming business I ll leave the second act to you When you collaborate mister Poet you ve got to do a little collabbing on your own account What did you think you were to do collect the royalties I m told said the Lawyer that that is sometimes the hardest thing to do in a comic opera Well I ll be self sacrificing said the Idiot and bear my full share of it It seems to me said the Bibliomaniac that that opera produced in the right place might stand a chance of a run Thank you said the Idiot After all mister Bib you are a man of some penetration How long a run One consecutive night said the Bibliomaniac Ah and where demanded the Idiot with a smile At Bloomingdale answered the Bibliomaniac severely That s a very good idea said the Idiot When you go back there mister Bib I wish you d suggest it to the Superintendent WAMSLEY S AUTOMATIC PASTOR BY FRANK CRANE Yes sir said the short chunky man as he leaned back against the gorgeous upholstery of his seat in the smoking compartment of the sleeping car yes sir I knew you was a preacher the minute I laid eyes on you You don t wear your collar buttoned behind nor a black thingumbob over your shirt front nor Presbyterian whiskers nor a little gold cross on a black string watch chain them s the usual marks I know and you hain t got any of em But I knew you just the same You can t fool J P Wamsley You see there s a peculiar air about a man that s accustomed to handle any particular line of goods You can tell em all if you ll just notice any of em white goods counter lawyer doctor travelin man politician railroad every one of em s got his sign out and it don t take a Sherlock Holmes to read it neither It s the same way with them gospel goods You ll excuse me but when I saw you come in here and light a cigar with an air of I will now give you a correct imitation of a human being I says to myself There s one of my gospel friends Murder will out as the feller says Experience did you say I must have had considerable experience Well I guess yes Didn t you never hear of my invention Wamsley s Automatic Pastor Self feedin Preacher and Lightning Caller Say that was the hottest scheme ever I ll tell you about it You see it s this way I m not a church member myself believe in it you know and all that sort of thing I m for religion strong and when it comes to payin I m right there with the goods My wife is a member and a good one in fact she s so blame good that we average up pretty well Well one day they elected me to the board of trustees at the church because I was the heaviest payer I suppose I kicked some not bein anxious to pose as a pious individual owin to certain brethren in the town who had a little confidential information on J P and might be inclined to get funny But they insisted allowin that me bein the most prominent and successful merchant in the town and similar rot I ought to line up and help out the cause and so on so finally I give in I went to two or three of their meetin s and say honest they were the fiercest things ever The minister smiled knowingly You re on I see Ain t those official meetin s of a church the limit Gee Once I went a cold winter night waded through snow knee deep to a giraffe and sat there two hours while they discussed whether they d fix the pastor s back fence or not price six dollars I didn t say anything bein sort o new you know but I made up my mind that next time I d turn loose on em if it was the last thing I did I says to my wife when I got home Em says I if gittin religion gives a man softenin of the brain like I see it workin on them men there to night I m afraid I ain t on prayin ground and intercedin terms as the feller says The men in that bunch to night was worth over eight hundred thousand dollars and they took eleven dollars and a half s worth o my time chewin the rag over fixin the parson s fence I m goin to bed I says and if I shouldn t wake up in the mornin if you should miss petty in the mornin you may know his vital powers was exhausted by the hilarious proceedin s of this evenin But I must get along to my story about my automatic pastor One day the preacher resigned life probably hectored out of him by a lot o cheap skates whose notion of holdin office in church consisted in cuttin down expenses and findin fault with the preacher because he didn t draw in sinners enough to fill the pews and pay their bills for em When it come to selectin a committee to get a new pastor I butted right in I had an idea so me to the front leadin trumps and bangin my cards down hard on the table Excuse my gay and festive reference to playin cards but what I mean is that I thought the fullness of time had arrived and was a hollerin for J P Wamsley Well sir it was right then and there I invented my automatic pastor continuous revolving hand shaker and circular jolly hander I brung it before the official brethren one night and explained its modus operandi I had a wax figger made by the same firm that supplies me with the manikins for my show windows And it was a peach if I do say it myself Tall handsome figger benevolent face elegant smile that won t come off as the feller says Chauncey Depew spinnage in front of each ear It was a sure lu lu Now I says to em gentlemen speakin o pastors I got one here I want to recommend It has one advantage anyhow it won t cost you a cent I ll make you a present of it and also chip in as heretofore toward operatin expenses That caught old Jake Hicks worth a hundred thousand dollars and stingier n all git out He leaned over and listened same as if he was takin em right off the bat He s a retired farmer If you ll find me a closer boy than a retired farmer moved to town you can have the best plug hat in my store You observe I says that he has the leadin qualifications of all and comes a heap cheaper than most He is swivel mounted that is the torso so to speak is pinioned onto the legs so that the upper part of the body can revolve This enables him to rotate freely without bustin his pants the vest bein unconnected with the trousers Now you stand this here whom we will call John Henry at the door of the church as the congregation enters havin previously wound him up and there he stays turning around and givin the glad hand and cheery smile and so doth his unchangin power display as the unwearied sun from day to day as the feller says Nobody neglected all pleased You remember the last pastor wasn t sociable enough and there was considerable complaint because he didn t hike right down after the benediction and jolly the flock as they passed out We ll have a wire run the length of the meetin house with a gentle slant from the pulpit to the front door and as soon as meetin s over up goes John Henry and slides down to the front exit and there he stands gyratin and handin out pleasant greeting to all merry Christmas and happy New Year to beat the band Now as for preachin I continued you see all you have to do is to raise up the coat tails and insert a record on the phonograph concealed here in the back of the chest with a speakin tube runnin up to the mouth John Henry bein a regular minister he can get the Homiletic Review at a dollar and a half a year we can subscribe for that get the up to datest sermons by the most distinguished divines get some gent that s afflicted with elocution to say em into a record and on Sunday our friend and pastor here will reel em off fine You press the button he does the rest as the feller says How about callin on the members inquires Andy Robinson Easy says I Hire a buggy of Brother Jinks here who keeps a livery stable at one dollar per P M Get a nigger to chauffeur the pastor at fifty cents per same There you are Let the boy be provided with an assortment of records to suit the people pleasant and sad consolatory and gay encouragin or reprovin and so forth The coon drives up puts in a cartridge sets the pastor in the door and when the family gets through with him they sets him out again There are say about three hundred callin days in the year He can easy make fifteen calls a day on an average equals four thousand five hundred calls a year at four hundred fifty dollars Of course there s the records but they won t cost over fifty dollars at the outside you can shave em off and use em over again you know But there s the personality of the pastor somebody speaks up It s that which attracts folks and fills the pews Personality shucks says I Haven t we had personality enough For every man it attracts it repels two Your last preacher was one of the best fellers that ever struck this town He was a plum brick and had lots o horse sense to boot He could preach too like a house afire But you kicked him out because he wasn t sociable enough You re askin an impossibility No man can be a student and get up the rattlin sermons he did and put in his time trottin around callin on the sisters Now let s apply business sense to this problem That s the way I run my store Find out what the people want and give it to em is my motto Now people ain t comin to church unless there s somethin to draw em We ve tried preachin and it won t draw They say they want sociability so let s give it to em strong They want attention paid to em You turn my friend here loose in the community and he ll make each and every man woman and child think they re it in less n a month If anybody gets disgruntled you sic John Henry here on em and you ll have em come right back a runnin and payin their pew rent in advance Then I continued that ain t all There s another idea I propose to go along with the pastor as a sort of side line That s tradin stamps Simple ain t it Wonder why you never thought of it yourselves don t you That s the way with all bright ideas People drink soda water all their lives and along comes a genius and hears the fizz and goes and invents a Westinghouse brake Same as Newton and the apple and Columbus and the egg All you have to do is to give tradin stamps for attendance and your church fills right up and John Henry keeps em happy Stamps can be redeemed at any store So many stamps gets say a parlor lamp or a masterpiece of Italian art in a gilt frame so many more draws a steam cooker or an oil stove so many more and you have a bicycle or a hair mattress or a what not and so on up to where a hat full of em gets an automobile I tell you when a family has a what not in their eye they ain t goin to let a little rain keep em home from church If they re all really too sick to go they ll hire a substitute And I opine these here stamps will have a powerful alleviatin effect on Sunday sickness And then I went on waxin eloquent and leanin the pastor against the wall so I could put one hand in my coat and gesture with the other and make it more impressive and then I says just think of them other churches We won t do a thing to em That Baptist preacher thinks he s a wizz because he makes six hundred calls a year You just wait till the nigger gets to haulin John Henry here around town and loadin him up with rapid fire conversations That Baptist gent will look like thirty cents that s what he ll look like He ll think he s Rojessvinsky and the Japanese fleet s after him And the Campbellites think they done it when they got their new pastor with a voice like a Bull o Bashan comin down hill Just wait till we load a few of them extra sized records with megaphone attachment into our pastor and gear him up to two hundred and fifty words a minute and then where oh where is Mister Campbellite as the feller says Besides brethren this pastor havin no family won t need his back fence fixed in fact he won t need the parsonage we can rent it and the proceeds will go toward operatin expenses What we need to do I says in conclusion is to get in line get up to date give the people what they want We have no way of judgin the future but by the past as the feller says We know they ain t no human bein can measure up to our requirements so let s take a fall out of science and have enterprise and business sense J P Wamsley reached for a match Did they accept your offer asked his companion I am anxious to know how your plan worked It has many points in its favor I confess No replied J P Wamsley as he meditatively puffed his cigar and seemed to be lovingly reviewing the past No they didn t I m kind o sorry too I d like to have seen the thing tried myself But he added with a slow and solemn wink they passed a unanimous resolution callin back the old pastor at an increased salary I should say then that your invention was a success Well I didn t lose out on it anyhow I ve got John Henry rigged up with a new bunch of whiskers and posin in my show window as Dewitt signin the peace treaty in an elegant suit of all wool at eleven dollars fifty cents THE BOHEMIANS OF BOSTON BY GELETT BURGESS The Orchids were as tough a crowd As Boston anywhere allowed It was a club of wicked men The oldest twelve the youngest ten They drank their soda colored green They talked of Art and Philistine They wore buff wescoats and their hair It used to make the waiters stare They were so shockingly behaved And Boston thought them so depraved Policemen stationed at the door Would raid them every hour or more They used to smoke and laugh out loud They were a very devilish crowd They formed a Cult far subtler brainier Than ordinary Anglomania For all as Jacobites were reckoned And gaily toasted Charles the Second What would the Bonnie Charlie say If he could see that crowd to day Fitz Willieboy McFlubadub Was Regent of the Orchids Club A wild Bohemian was he And spent his money fast and free He thought no more of spending dimes On some debauch of pickled limes Than you would think of spending nickels To buy a pint of German pickles The Boston maiden passed him by With sidelong glances of her eye She dared not speak he was so wild Yet worshipped this Lotharian child Fitz Willieboy was so blase He burned a Transcript up one day The Orchids fashioned all their style On Flubadub s infernal guile That awful Boston oath was his He used to jaculate Gee Whiz He showed them that immoral haunt The dirty Chinese Restaurant And there they d find him even when It got to be as late as ten He ate chopped suey with a fork You should have heard the villain talk Of one reporter that he knew An artist and an actor too The Orchids went from bad to worse Made epigrams attempted verse Boston was horrified and shocked To hear the way those Orchids mocked For they made fun of Boston ways And called good men Provincial Jays The end must come to such a story Gone is the wicked Orchids glory The room was raided by police One night for breaches of the Peace There had been laughter long and loud In Boston this is not allowed And there the sergeant of the squad Found awful evidence my God Fitz Willieboy McFlubadub The Regent of the Orchids Club Had written on the window sill This shocking outrage Beacon H ll A LETTER FROM HOME four From the Princess Boo Lally at Gumbo Goo South Sea Islands to Her Brother Prince Umbobo a

relations I couldn t It s absurd to shed sobs over things which occurd during the rain of Henry the Three Let us be cheerful I continnered Look at the festiv Warders in their red flannil jackets They are cheerful and why should it not be thusly with us A Warder now took us in charge and showed us the Trater s Gate the armers and things The Trater s Gate is wide enuff to admit about twenty traters abrest I should jedge but beyond this I couldn t see that it was superior to gates in general ral Traters I will here remark are a onfornit class of peple If they wasn t they wouldn t be traters They conspire to bust up a country they fail and they re traters They bust her and they become statesmen and heroes Take the case of Gloster afterward Old Dick the Three who may be seen at the Tower on horseback in a heavy tin overcoat take mister Gloster s case mister G was a conspirator of the basist dye and if he d failed he would have been hung on a sour apple tree But mister G succeeded and became great He was slewed by colonel Richmond but he lives in history and his equestrian figger may be seen daily for a sixpence in conjunction with other em nent persons and no extra charge for the Warder s able and bootiful lectur There s one king in this room who is mounted onto a foaming steed his right hand graspin a barber s pole I didn t learn his name The room where the daggers and pistils and other weppins is kept is interestin Among this collection of choice cuttlery I notist the bow and arrer which those hot heded old chaps used to conduct battles with It is quite like the bow and arrer used at this day by certain tribes of American Injuns and they shoot em off with such a excellent precision that I almost sigh d to be an Injun when I was in the Rocky Mountain regin They are a pleasant lot them Injuns mister Cooper and doctor Catlin have told us of the red man s wonerful eloquence and I found it so Our party was stopt on the plains of Utah by a band of Shoshones whose chief said Brothers the pale face is welcome Brothers the sun is sinking in the west and Wa na bucky she will soon cease speakin Brothers the poor red man belongs to a race which is fast becomin extink He then whooped in a shrill manner stole all our blankets and whisky and fled to the primeval forest to conceal his emotions I will remark here while on the subjeck of Injuns that they are in the main a very shaky set with even less sense than the Fenians and when I hear philanthropists be wailin the fack that every year carries the noble red man nearer the settin sun I simply have to say I m glad of it tho it is rough on the settin sun They call you by the sweet name of Brother one minit and the next they scalp you with their Thomas hawks But I wander Let us return to the Tower At one end of the room where the weppins is kept is a wax figger of Queen Elizabeth mounted on a fiery stuffed hoss whose glass eye flashes with pride and whose red morocker nostril dilates hawtily as if conscious of the royal burden he bears I have associated Elizabeth with the Spanish Armady She s mixed up with it at the Surrey Theater where Troo to the Core is bein acted and in which a full bally core is introjooced on board the Spanish Admiral s ship giving the audiens the idee that he intends openin a moosic hall in Plymouth the moment he conkers that town But a very interesting drammer is Troo to the Core notwithstandin the eccentric conduct of the Spanish Admiral and very nice it is in Queen Elizabeth to make Martin Truegold a baronet The Warder shows us some instrooments of tortur such as thumbscrews throat collars et cetera statin that these was conkered from the Spanish Armady and addin what a crooil peple the Spaniards was in them days which elissited from a bright eyed little girl of about twelve summers the remark that she tho t it was rich to talk about the crooilty of the Spaniards usin thumbscrews when he was in a Tower where so many poor peple s heads had been cut off This made the Warder stammer and turn red I was so pleased with the little girl s brightness that I could have kissed the dear child and I would if she d been six years older I think my companions intended makin a day of it for they all had sandwiches sassiges et cetera The sad lookin man who had wanted us to drop a tear afore we started to go round fling d such quantities of sassige into his mouth that I expected to see him choke hisself to death he said to me in the Beauchamp Tower where the poor prisoners writ their onhappy names on the cold walls This is a sad sight It is indeed I anserd You re black in the face You shouldn t eat sassige in public without some rehearsals beforehand You manage it orkwardly No he said I mean this sad room Indeed he was quite right Tho so long ago all these drefful things happened I was very glad to git away from this gloomy room and go where the rich and sparklin Crown Jewils is kept I was so pleased with the Queen s Crown that it occurd to me what a agree ble surprise it would be to send a sim lar one home to my wife and I asked the Warder what was the vally of a good well constructed Crown like that He told me but on cypherin up with a pencil the amount of funs I have in the Jint Stock Bank I conclooded I d send her a genteel silver watch instid And so I left the Tower It is a solid and commandin edifis but I deny that it is cheerful I bid it adoo without a pang I was droven to my hotel by the most melancholly driver of a four wheeler that I ever saw He heaved a deep sigh as I gave him two shillings I ll give you six d s more I said if it hurts you so It isn t that he said with a hart rendin groan it s only a way I have My mind s upset to day I at one time tho t I d drive you into the Thames I ve been readin all the daily papers to try and understand about Governor Eyre and my mind is totterin It s really wonderful I didn t drive you into the Thames I asked the onhappy man what his number was so I could redily find him in case I should want him agin and bad him good by And then I tho t what a frollicsome day I d made of it Respectably et cetera ARTEMUS WARD Punch eighteen sixty six SCIENCE AND NATURAL HISTORY mister PUNCH My Dear Sir I was a little disapinted at not receivin a invitation to jine in the meetins of the Social Science Congress I prepared an Essy on Animals to read before the Social Science meetins It is a subjeck I may troothfully say I have successfully wrastled with I tackled it when only nineteen years old At that tender age I writ a Essy for a lit ry Institoot entitled Is Cats to be trusted Of the merits of that Essy it doesn t becum me to speak but I may be excoos d for mentionin that the Institoot parsed a resolution that whether we look upon the length of this Essy or the manner in which it is written we feel that we will not express any opinion of it and we hope it will be read in other towns Of course the Essy I writ for the Social Science Society is a more finisheder production than the one on Cats which was wroten when my mind was crood and afore I had masterd a graceful and ellygant stile of composition I could not even punctooate my sentences proper at that time and I observe with pane on lookin over this effort of my youth that its beauty is in one or two instances mar d by ingrammaticisms This was inexcusable and I m surprised I did it A writer who can t write in a grammerly manner better shut up shop You shall hear this Essy on Animals Some day when you have four hours to spare I ll read it to you I think you ll enjoy it Or what will be much better if I may suggest omit all picturs in next week s Punch and do not let your contributors write eny thing whatever let them have a holiday they can go to the British Mooseum and publish my Essy intire It will fill all your collumes full and create comment Does this proposition strike you Is it a go In case I had read the Essy to the Social Sciencers I had intended it should be the closin attraction I intended it should finish the proceedins I think it would have finished them I understand animals better than any other class of human creatures I have a very animal mind and I ve been identified with em doorin my entire perfessional career as a showman more especial bears wolves leopards and serpunts The leopard is as lively a animal as I ever came into contack with It is troo he cannot change his spots but you can change em for him with a paint brush as I once did in the case of a leopard who wasn t nat rally spotted in a attractive manner In exhibitin him I used to stir him up in his cage with a protracted pole and for the purpuss of makin him yell and kick up in a leopardy manner I used to casionally whack him over the head This would make the children inside the booth scream with fright which would make fathers of families outside the booth very anxious to come in because there is a large class of parents who have a uncontrollable passion for takin their children to places where they will stand a chance of being frightened to death One day I whacked this leopard more than ushil which elissited a remonstrance from a tall gentleman in spectacles who said My good man do not beat the poor caged animal Rather fondle him I ll fondle him with a club I ansered hitting him another whack I prithy desist said the gentleman stand aside and see the effeck of kindness I understand the idiosyncracies of these creeturs better than you do With that he went up to the cage and thrustin his face in between the iron bars he said soothingly Come hither pretty creetur The pretty creetur come hithered rayther speedy and seized the gentleman by the whiskers which he tore off about enuff to stuff a small cushion with He said You vagabone I ll have you indicted for exhibitin dangerous and immoral animals I replied Gentle Sir there isn t a animal here that hasn t a beautiful moral but you mustn t fondle em You mustn t meddle with their idiotsyncracies The gentleman was a dramatic cricket and he wrote a article for a paper in which he said my entertainment wos a decided failure As regards Bears you can teach em to do interestin things but they re onreliable I had a very large grizzly bear once who would dance and larf and lay down and bow his head in grief and give a mournful wale etsetry But he often annoyed me It will be remembered that on the occasion of the first battle of Bull Run it suddenly occurd to the Fed ral soldiers that they had business in Washington which ought not to be neglected and they all started for that beautiful and romantic city maintainin a rate of speed durin the entire distance that would have done credit to the celebrated French steed Gladiateur Very nat rally our Gov ment was deeply grieved at this defeat and I said to my Bear shortly after as I was givin a exhibition in Ohio I said Brewin are you not sorry the National arms has sustained a defeat His business was to wale dismal and bow his head down the band a barrel origin and a wiolin playing slow and melancholy moosic What did the grizzly old cuss do however but commence darncin and larfin in the most joyous manner I had a narrer escape from being imprisoned for disloyalty DISLIKES BY OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES I want it to be understood that I consider that a certain number of persons are at liberty to dislike me peremptorily without showing cause and that they give no offense whatever in so doing If I did not cheerfully acquiesce in this sentiment towards myself on the part of others I should not feel at liberty to indulge my own aversions I try to cultivate a Christian feeling to all my fellow creatures but inasmuch as I must also respect truth and honesty I confess to myself a certain number of inalienable dislikes and prejudices some of which may possibly be shared by others Some of these are purely instinctive for others I can assign a reason Our likes and dislikes play so important a part in the order of things that it is well to see on what they are founded There are persons I meet occasionally who are too intelligent by half for my liking They know my thoughts beforehand and tell me what I was going to say Of course they are masters of all my knowledge and a good deal besides have read all the books I have read and in later editions have had all the experiences I have been through and more too In my private opinion every mother s son of them will lie at any time rather than confess ignorance I have a kind of dread rather than hatred of persons with a large excess of vitality great feeders great laughers great story tellers who come sweeping over their company with a huge tidal wave of animal spirits and boisterous merriment I have pretty good spirits myself and enjoy a little mild pleasantry but I am oppressed and extinguished by these great lusty noisy creatures and feel as if I were a mute at a funeral when they get into full blast I can not get along much better with those drooping languid people whose vitality falls short as much as that of the others is in excess I have not life enough for two I wish I had It is not very enlivening to meet a fellow creature whose expression and accents say You are the hair that breaks the camel s back of my endurance you are the last drop that makes my cup of woe run over persons whose heads drop on one side like those of toothless infants whose voices recall the tones in which our old snuffling choir used to wail out the verses of Life is the time to serve the Lord There is another style which does not captivate me I recognize an attempt at the grand manner now and then in persons who are well enough in their way but of no particular importance socially or otherwise Some family tradition of wealth or distinction is apt to be at the bottom of it and it survives all the advantages that used to set it off I like family pride as well as my neighbors and respect the high born fellow citizen whose progenitors have not worked in their shirt sleeves for the last two generations full as much as I ought to But grand pere oblige a person with a known grandfather is too distinguished to find it necessary to put on airs The few Royal Princes I have happened to know were very easy people to get along with and had not half the social knee action I have often seen in the collapsed dowagers who lifted their eyebrows at me in my earlier years My heart does not warm as it should do towards the persons not intimates who are always too glad to see me when we meet by accident and discover all at once that they have a vast deal to unbosom themselves of to me There is one blameless person whom I can not love and have no excuse for hating It is the innocent fellow creature otherwise inoffensive to me whom I find I have involuntarily joined on turning a corner I suppose the Mississippi which was flowing quietly along minding its own business hates the Missouri for coming into it all at once with its muddy stream I suppose the Missouri in like manner hates the Mississippi for diluting with its limpid but insipid current the rich reminiscences of the varied soils through which its own stream has wandered I will not compare myself to the clear or the turbid current but I will own that my heart sinks when I find all of a sudden I am in for a corner confluence and I cease loving my neighbor as myself until I can get away from him UNCLE SIMON AND UNCLE JIM BY ARTEMUS WARD Uncle Simon he Clumb up a tree To see What he could see When presentlee Uncle Jim Clumb up beside of him And squatted down by he THE

gleaming eyes are bits of heaven Slim are her hands yet not too wee I could not fancy useless fingers Her hands are all that hands should be And own a touch whose memory lingers The hue that lights her oval cheeks Recalls the pink that tints a cherry Upon her chin a dimple speaks A disposition blithe and merry Her laughter ripples like a brook Its sound a heart of stone would soften Though sweetness shines in every look Her laugh is never loud nor often Though golden locks have won renown With bards I never heed their raving The girl I love hath locks of brown Not tightly curled but gently waving Her mouth Perhaps you d term it large Is firmly molded full and curving Her quiet lips are Cupid s charge But in the cause of truth unswerving Though little of her neck is seen That little is both smooth and sightly And fair as marble is its sheen Above her bodice gleaming whitely Her nose is just the proper size Without a trace of upward turning Her shell like ears are wee and wise The tongue of scandal ever spurning In mirth and woe her voice is low Her calm demeanor never fluttered Her every accent seems to go Straight to one s heart as soon as uttered She ne er coquets as others do Her tender heart would never let her Where does she dwell I would I knew As yet alas I ve never met her THE AUTO RUBAIYAT five BY REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN Move Or the Devil Red who puts

CAROLYN WELLS Once on a Time there were Two Ladies at a Shop where Gorgeous and Expensive Silks were temptingly displayed Only Six Dollars a Yard Madam said the Shopman to One of the Ladies as he held up the Lustrous Breadths in those Tempting Fan shaped Folds peculiar to Shopmen The Lady hesitated and looked Dubiously at the Silk for she knew it was Beyond her Means The Shopman Continued Very Cheap at the Price and I have Only this One Dress Pattern remaining You will Take it Yes Certainly I will Send it at Once The Lady went away filled with Deep Regret because she had squandered her Money so Foolishly and wished she had been Firm in her Refusal to buy the Goods The Other Lady saw a similar Silk She felt it Between her Fingers Measured its Width with her Eye and then said Impulsively Oh That is just What I Want I will Take Twenty Yards No Sooner was the Silk cut off than the Lady felt Sharp Twinges of Remorse for she knew she must Pay for it with the Money she had

none	none	 O Love Love Love 
5456_58161_000014_000003	train-clean-100	What times were those Long ere the age of belles and beaux And Brussels lace and silken hose When in the green Arcadian close You married Psyche under the rose With only the grass for bedding Heart to heart and hand to hand You followed Nature s sweet command Roaming lovingly through the land Nor sighed for a Diamond Wedding 
none	none	So have we read in classic Ovid How Hero watched for her beloved Impassioned youth Leander She was the fairest of the fair And wrapt him round with her golden hair Whenever he landed cold and bare With nothing to eat and nothing to wear And wetter than any gander For Love was Love and better than money The slyer the theft the sweeter the honey And kissing was clover all the world over Wherever Cupid might wander 
5456_58161_000016_000000	train-clean-100	So thousands of years have come and gone And still the moon is shining on Still Hymen s torch is lighted And hitherto in this land of the West Most couples in love have thought it best To follow the ancient way of the rest And quietly get united 
none	none	But now True Love you re growing old Bought and sold with silver and gold Like a house or a horse and carriage Midnight talks Moonlight walks The glance of the eye and sweetheart sigh The shadowy haunts with no one by I do not wish to disparage But every kiss Has a price for its bliss In the modern code of marriage And the compact sweet Is not complete Till the high contracting parties meet Before the altar of Mammon And the bride must be led to a silver bower Where pearls and rubies fall in a shower That would frighten Jupiter Ammon I need not tell How it befell Since Jenkins has told the story Over and over and over again In a style I can not hope to attain And covered himself with glory How it befell one summer s day The king of the Cubans strolled this way King January s his name they say And fell in love with the Princess May The reigning belle of Manhattan Nor how he began to smirk and sue And dress as lovers who come to woo Or as Max Maretzek and Julien do When they sit full bloomed in the ladies view And flourish the wondrous baton He wasn t one of your Polish nobles Whose presence their country somehow troubles And so our cities receive them Nor one of your make believe Spanish grandees Who ply our daughters with lies and candies Until the poor girls believe them No he was no such charlatan Count de Hoboken Flash in the pan Full of gasconade and bravado But a regular rich Don Rataplan Santa Claus de la Muscovado Senor Grandissimo Bastinado His was the rental of half Havana And all Matanzas and Santa Anna Rich as he was could hardly hold A candle to light the mines of gold Our Cuban owned choke full of diggers And broad plantations that in round figures Were stocked with at least five thousand niggers Gather ye rosebuds while ye may The Senor swore to carry the day To capture the beautiful Princess May With his battery of treasure Velvet and lace she should not lack Tiffany Haughwout Ball Black Genin and Stewart his suit should back And come and go at her pleasure Jet and lava silver and gold Garnets emeralds rare to behold Diamonds sapphires wealth untold All were hers to have and to hold Enough to fill a peck measure He didn t bring all his forces on At once but like a crafty old Don Who many a heart had fought and won Kept bidding a little higher And every time he made his bid And what she said and all they did Twas written down For the good of the town By Jeems of The Daily Flyer A coach and horses you d think would buy For the Don an easy victory But slowly our Princess yielded A diamond necklace caught her eye But a wreath of pearls first made her sigh She knew the worth of each maiden glance And like young colts that curvet and prance She led the Don a deuce of a dance In spite of the wealth he wielded She stood such a fire of silks and laces Jewels and gold dressing cases And ruby brooches and jets and pearls That every one of her dainty curls Brought the price of a hundred common girls Folks thought the lass demented But at last a wonderful diamond ring An infant Kohinoor did the thing And sighing with love or something the same What s in a name The Princess May consented Ring ring the bells and bring The people to see the marrying Let the gaunt and hungry and ragged poor Throng round the great cathedral door To wonder what all the hubbub s for And sometimes stupidly wonder At so much sunshine and brightness which Fall from the church upon the rich While the poor get all the thunder Ring ring merry bells ring O fortunate few With letters blue Good for a seat and a nearer view Fortunate few whom I dare not name Dilettanti Creme de la Creme We commoners stood by the street facade And caught a glimpse of the cavalcade We saw the bride In diamond pride With jeweled maidens to guard her side Six lustrous maidens in tarletan She led the van of the caravan Close behind her her mother Dressed in gorgeous moire antique That told as plainly as words could speak She was more antique than the other Leaned on the arm of Don Rataplan Santa Claus de la Muscovado Senor Grandissimo Bastinado Happy mortal fortunate man And Marquis of El Dorado In they swept all riches and grace Silks and satins jewels and lace In they swept from the dazzled sun And soon in the church the deed was done Three prelates stood on the chancel high A knot that gold and silver can buy Gold and silver may yet untie Unless it is tightly fastened What s worth doing at all s worth doing well And the sale of a young Manhattan belle Is not to be pushed or hastened So two Very Reverends graced the scene And the tall Archbishop stood between By prayer and fasting chastened The Pope himself would have come from Rome But Garibaldi kept him at home Haply those robed prelates thought Their words were the power that tied the knot But another power that love knot tied And I saw the chain round the neck of the bride A glistening priceless marvelous chain Coiled with diamonds again and again As befits a diamond wedding Yet still twas a chain and I thought she knew it And half way longed for the will to undo it By the secret tears she was shedding But isn t it odd to think whenever We all go through that terrible River Whose sluggish tide alone can sever The Archbishop says the Church decree By floating one into Eternity And leaving the other alive as ever As each wades through that ghastly stream The satins that rustle and gems that gleam Will grow pale and heavy and sink away To the noisome River s bottom clay Then the costly bride and her maidens six Will shiver upon the banks of the Styx Quite as helpless as they were born Naked souls and very forlorn The Princess then must shift for herself And lay her royalty on the shelf She and the beautiful Empress yonder Whose robes are now the wide world s wonder And even ourselves and our dear little wives Who calico wear each morn of their lives And the sewing girls and les chiffonniers In rags and hunger a gaunt array And all the grooms of the caravan Ay even the great Don Rataplan Santa Claus de la Muscavado Senor Grandissimo Bastinado That gold encrusted fortunate man All will land in naked equality The lord of a ribboned principality Will mourn the loss of his cordon Nothing to eat and nothing to wear Will certainly be the fashion there Ten to one and I ll go it alone Those most used to a rag and a bone Though here on earth they labor and groan Will stand it best as they wade abreast To the other side of Jordan AN ARKANSAS PLANTER BY OPIE READ Slowly and heavily the Major walked out upon the veranda He stood upon the steps leading down into the yard and he saw Louise afar off standing upon the river s yellow edge She had thrown her hat upon the sand and she stood with her hands clasped upon her brown head A wind blew down the stream and the water lapped at her feet The Major looked back into the library at the door wherein Pennington had stood and sighed with relief upon finding that he was gone He looked back toward the river The girl was walking along the shore meditatively swinging her hat He stepped to the corner of the house and gazing down the road saw Pennington on a horse now sitting straight now bending low over the horn of the saddle The old gentleman had a habit of making a sideward motion with his hand as if he would put all unpleasant thoughts behind him and now he made the motion not only once but many times And it seemed that his thoughts would not obey him for he became more imperative in his pantomimic demand At one corner of the large yard where the smooth ground broke off into a steep slope to the river there stood a small office built of brick It was the Major s executive chamber and thither he directed his steps Inside this place his laugh was never heard at the door his smile always faded In this commercial sanctuary were enforced the exactions that made the plantation thrive Outside in the yard in the big house elsewhere under the sky a plea of distress might moisten his eyes and soften his heart to his own financial disadvantage but under the moss grown shingles of the office all was business hard uncompromising It was told in the neighborhood that once in this inquisition of affairs he demanded the last cent possessed by a widowed woman but that while she was on her way home he overtook her graciously returned the money and magnanimously tore to pieces a mortgage that he held against her small estate Just as he entered the office there came across the yard a loud and impatient voice Here Bill confound you come and take this horse Don t you hear me you idiot You infernal niggers are getting to be so no account that the last one of you ought to be driven off the place Trot confound you Here take this horse to the stable and feed him Where is the Major In the office The devil he is Toward the office slowly strode old Gideon Batts fanning himself with his white slouch hat He was short fat and bald he was bow legged with a comical squat his eyes stuck out like the eyes of a swamp frog his nose was enormous shapeless and red To the Major s family he traced the dimmest line of kinship During twenty years he had operated a small plantation that belonged to the Major and he was always at least six years behind with his rent He had married the widow Martin and afterward swore that he had been disgracefully deceived by her that he had expected much but had found her moneyless and after this he had but small faith in woman His wife died and he went into contented mourning and out of gratitude to his satisfied melancholy swore that he would pay his rent but failed Upon the Major he held a strong hold and this was a puzzle to his neighbors Their characters stood at fantastic and whimsical variance one never in debt the other never out of debt one clamped by honor the other feeling not its restraining pinch But together they would ride abroad laughing along the road To missus Cranceford old Gid was a pest With the shrewd digs of a woman the blood letting side stabs of her sex she had often shown her disapproval of the strong favor in which the Major held him she vowed that her husband had gathered many an oath from Gid s swollen store of execration when in truth Gid had been an apt pupil under the Major and she had hoped that the Major s attachment to the church would of necessity free him from the humiliating association with the old sinner but it did not for they continued to ride abroad laughing along the road Like a skittish horse old Gid shied at the office door Once he had crossed that threshold and it had cost him a crop of cotton How are you John was Gid s salutation as he edged off still fanning himself How are you sir was the Major s stiff recognition of the fact that Gid was on earth Getting hotter I believe John I presume it is sir The Major sat with his elbow resting on a desk and about him were stacked threatening bundles of papers and old Gid knew that in those commercial romances he himself was a familiar character Are you busy John Yes but you may come in No I thank you Don t believe I ve got time Then take time I want to talk to you Come in No not to day John Fact is I m not feeling very well Head s all stopped up with a cold and these summer colds are awful I tell you It was a summer cold that took my father off How s your cotton in that low strip along the bayou Tolerable John tolerable Come in I want to talk to you about it Don t believe I can stand the air in there John Head all stopped up Don t believe I m going to live very long Nonsense You are as strong as a buck You may think so John but I m not I thought father was strong too but a summer cold got him I am getting along in years John and I find that I have to take care of myself But if you really want to talk to me about that piece of cotton come out where it s cool The Major shoved back his papers and arose but hesitated and Gid stood looking on fanning himself The Major stepped out and Gid s face was split asunder with a broad smile I gad I ve been up town and had a set to with old Baucum and the rest of them Pulled up fifty winner at poker and jumped Devilish glad to see you miss you every minute of the time I m away Let s go over here and sit down on that bench They walked toward a bench under a live oak tree and upon Gid s shoulder the Major s hand affectionately rested They halted to laugh and old Gid shoved the Major away from him then seized him and drew him back They sat down still laughing but suddenly the Major became serious Gid I m in trouble he said Nonsense my boy there is no such thing as trouble Throw it off Look at me I ve had enough of what the world calls trouble to kill a dozen ordinary men but just look at me getting stronger every day Throw it off What is it anyway Louise declares that she is going to marry Pennington What old Gid exclaimed turning with a bouncing flounce and looking straight at the Major Marry Pennington Why she shan t John That s all there is of it We object and that settles it Why what the deuce can she be thinking about Thinking about him the Major answered Yes but she must quit it Why it s outrageous for as sensible a girl as she is to think of marrying that fellow You leave it to me hear what I said Leave it to me This suggested shift of responsibility did not remove the shadow of sadness that had fallen across the Major s countenance You leave it to me and I ll give her a talk she ll not forget I ll make her understand that she s a queen and a woman is pretty devilish skittish about marrying anybody when you convince her that she s a queen What does your wife say about it She hasn t said anything She s out visiting and I haven t seen her since Louise told me of her determination to marry him Don t say determination John Say foolish notion But it s all right No it s not all right What have you failed to trust me Is it possible that you have lost faith in me Don t do that John for if you do it will be a never failing source of regret You don t seem to remember what my powers of persuasion have accomplished in the past When I was in the legislature chairman of the Committee on County and County Lines what did my protest do It kept them from cutting off a ten foot strip of this county and adding it to Jefferson You must remember those things John for in the factors of persuasion lie the shaping of human life I ve been riding in the hot sun and I think that a mint julep would hit me now just about where I live Say there Bill bring us some mint sugar and whisky And cold water mind you Ah said old Gideon sipping his scented drink virtue may become wearisome and we may gape during the most fervent prayer but I gad John there is always the freshness of youth in a mint julep Pour just a few more drops of liquor into mine if you please want it to rassle me a trifle you know Recollect those come all ye songs we used to sing going down the river Remember the time I snatched the sword out of my cane and lunged at a horse trader from Tennessee Scoundrel grabbed it and broke it off and it was all I could do to keep him from establishing a close and intimate relationship with me Great old days John and I gad they ll never come again I remember it all Gid and it was along there that you fell in love with a woman that lived at Mortimer s Bend Easy now John A trifle more liquor if you please Thank you Yes I used to call her the wild plum Sweet thing and I had no idea that she was married until her lout of a husband came down to the landing with a double barrel gun Ah Lord if she had been single and worth money I could have made her very happy Fate hasn t always been my friend John Possibly not Gid but you know that fate to be just should divide her favors and this time she leaned toward the woman Slow John I gad there s your wife A carriage drew up at the yard gate and a woman stepped out She did not go into the house but seeing the Major came toward him She was tall with large black eyes and very gray hair In her step was suggested the pride of an old Kentucky family belles judges and generals She smiled at the Major and bowed stiffly at old Gid The two men arose Thank you I don t care to sit down she said Where is Louise I saw her down by the river just now the Major answered I wish to see her at once said his wife Shall I go and call her madam Gid asked She gave him a look of surprise and answered No I thank you No trouble I assure you Gid persisted I am pleased to say that age has not affected my voice except to mellow it with more of reverence when I address the wife of a noble man and the mother of a charming girl She had dignity but humor was never lost upon her and she smiled This was encouraging and old Gid proceeded I was just telling the Major of my splendid prospects for a bountiful crop this year and I feel that with this blessing of Providence I shall soon be able to meet all my obligations I saw our rector mister Mills this morning and he spoke of how thankful I ought to be he had just passed my bayou field and I told him that I would not only assert my gratitude but would prove it with a substantial donation to the church at the end of the season In the glance which she gave him there was refined and gentle contempt and then she looked down upon the decanter of whisky Old Gideon drew down the corners of his mouth as was his wont when he strove to excite compassion Yes he said with a note of pity forced upon his voice I am exceedingly thankful for all the blessings that have come to me but I haven t been very well of late rather feeble to day and the kind Major noticing it insisted upon my taking a little liquor the medicine of our sturdy and gallant fathers madam The Major sprawled himself back with a roaring laugh and hereupon Gid added It takes the Major a long time to get over a joke Told him one just now and it tickled him mighty nigh to death Well I must be going now and madam if I should chance to see anything of your charming daughter I will tell her that you desire a conference with her William he called my horse if you please The Major s wife went into the house as Batts came up glancing back at him as she passed through the door and in her eyes there was nothing as soft as a tear The old fellow winced as he nearly always did when she gave him a direct look Are you all well Gideon asked lifting the tails of his long coat and seating himself in a rocking chair First rate the Major answered drawing forward another rocker and when he had sat down he added Somewhat of an essence of November in the air Yes Gid assented felt it in my joints before I got up this morning From his pocket he took a plug of tobacco I thought you d given up chewing said the Major Last time I saw you I understood you to say that you had thrown your tobacco away I did John but I gad I watched pretty close where I threw it Fellow over here gave me some stuff that he said would cure me of the appetite and I took it until I was afraid it would and then threw it away I find that when a man quits tobacco he hasn t anything to look forward to I quit for three days once and on the third day about the time I got up from the dinner table I asked myself Well now got anything to come next And all I could see before me was hours of hankering and I gad I slapped a negro boy on a horse and told him to gallop over to the store and fetch me a hunk of tobacco And after I broke my resolution I thought I d have a fit there in the yard waiting for that boy to come back I don t believe that it s right for a man to kill any appetite that the Lord has given him Of course I don t believe in the abuse of a good thing but it s better to abuse it a little sometimes than not to have it at all If virtue consists in deadening the nervous system to all pleasurable influences why you may just mark my name off the list There was old man Haskill I sat up with him the night after he died and one of the men with me was harping upon the great life the old fellow had lived never chewed never smoked never was drunk never gambled never did anything except to stand still and be virtuous and I couldn t help but feel that he had lost nothing by dying THE TWO YOUNG MEN BY CAROLYN WELLS Once on a Time there were Two Young Men of Promising Capabilities One pursued no Especial Branch of Education but Contented himself with a Smattering of many different Arts and Sciences exhibiting a Moderate Proficiency in Each When he Came to Make a Choice of some means of Earning a Livelihood he found he was Unsuccessful for he had no Specialty and Every Employer seemed to Require an Expert in his Line The Other from his Earliest Youth bent all his Energies toward Learning to play the Piano He studied at Home and Abroad with Greatest Masters and he Achieved Wonderful Success But as he was about to Begin his Triumphant and Profitable Career he had the Misfortune to lose both Thumbs in a Railway Accident Thus he was Deprived of his Intended Means of Earning a Living and as he had no other Accomplishment he was Forced to Subsist on Charity MORALS This Fable teaches that a Jack of all Trades is Master of None and that It Is Not Well to put All our Eggs in One Basket THE TWO HOUSEWIVES BY CAROLYN WELLS Once on a Time there were Two Housewives who must Needs go to Market to purchase the Day s Supplies One of Them who was of a Dilatory Nature said I will not Hurry Myself for I Doubt Not the Market contains Plenty for all who come She therefore Sauntered Forth at her Leisure and on reaching the Market she found to her Dismay that the Choicest Cuts and the Finest Produce had All been Sold and there remained for her only the Inferior Meats and Some Withered Vegetables The Other who was One of the Hustling Wide awake Sort said I will Bestir myself Betimes and Hasten to Market that I may Take my Pick ere my Neighbors appear on the Scene She did so and when she Reached the Market she Discovered that the Fresh Produce had not yet Arrived and she must Content herself with the Remnants of Yesterday s Stock MORALS This Fable teaches that The Early Bird Gets the Worm and that There Are Always as Good Fish In the Sea as Ever were Caught IN PHILISTIA BY BLISS CARMAN Of all the places on the map Some queer and others queerer Arcadia is dear to me Philistia is dearer There dwell the few who never knew The pangs of heavenly hunger As fresh and fair and fond and frail As when the world was younger If there is any sweeter sound Than bobolinks or thrushes It is the frou frou of their silks The roll of their barouches I love them even when they re good As well as when they re sinners When they are sad and worldly wise And when they are beginners I say I do of course the fact For better or for worse is My unerratic life denies My too erotic verses I dote upon their waywardness Their foibles and their follies If there s a madder pate than Di s Perhaps it may be Dolly s They have no problems to discuss No theories to discover They are not new and I I am Their very grateful lover I care not if their minds confuse Alastor with Aladdin And Cimabue is far less To them than Chimmie Fadden They never heard of William Blake Nor saw a Botticelli Yet one is Yours till death Louise And one Your loving Nelly They never tease me for my views Nor tax me with my grammar Nor test me on the latest news Until I have to stammer They never talk about their moods They never know they have them The world is good enough for them And that is why I love them They never puzzle me with Greek Nor drive me mad with Ibsen Yet over forms as fair as Eve s They wear the gowns of Gibson THE DYING GAG BY JAMES L FORD There was an affecting scene on the stage of a New York theater the other night a scene invisible to the audience and not down on the bills but one far more touching and pathetic than anything enacted before the footlights that night although it was a minstrel company that gave the entertainment It was a wild blustering night and the wind howled mournfully around the street corners blinding the pedestrians with the clouds of dust that it caught up from the gutters and hurled into their faces Old man Sweeny the stage doorkeeper dozing in his little glazed box was awakened by a sudden gust that banged the stage door and then went howling along the corridor almost extinguishing the gas jets and making the minstrels shiver in their dressing rooms What You here to night exclaimed old man Sweeny as a frail figure muffled up in a huge ulster staggered through the doorway and stood leaning against the wall trying to catch his breath Yes I felt that I couldn t stay away from the footlights to night They tell me I m old and worn out and had better take a rest but I ll go on till I drop and with a hollow cough the Old Gag plodded slowly down the dim and drafty corridor and sank wearily on a sofa in the big dressing room where the other Gags and Conundrums were awaiting their cues Poor old fellow said one of them sadly He can t hold out much longer He ought not to go on except at matinees replied another veteran who was standing in front of the mirror trimming his long silvery beard and just then an attendant came in with several basins of gruel and the old Jests tucked napkins under their chins and sat down to partake of a little nourishment before going on The bell tinkled and the entertainment began One after another the Jokes and Conundrums heard their cues went on and returned to the dressing room for they all had to go on again in the after piece The house was crowded to the dome and there was scarcely a dry eye in the vast audience as one after another of the old Quips and Jests that had been treasured household words in many a family came on and then disappeared to make room for others of their kind As the evening wore on the whisper ran through the theater that the Old Gag was going on that night perhaps for the last time and many an eye grew dim many a pulse beat quicker at the thought of listening once more to that hoary Jest about whose head were clustered so many sacred memories Meanwhile the Old Gag was sitting in his corner of the dressing room his head bowed on his breast his gruel untasted on the tray before him The other Gags came and went but he heeded them not His thoughts were far away He was dreaming of old days of his early struggles for fame and of his friends and companions of years ago Where are they now he asked himself sadly Some are wanderers on the face of the earth in comic operas Two of them found ignoble graves in the Tourists company Others are sleeping beneath the daisies in Harper s Editor s Drawer You re called sir The Old Gag awoke from his reverie started to his feet and throwing aside his heavy ulster staggered to the entrance and stood there patiently waiting for his cue You re hardly strong enough to go on to night said a Merry Jest touching him kindly on the arm but the gray bearded one shook him off saying hoarsely Let be Let be I must read those old lines once more it may be for the last time And now a solemn hush fell upon the vast audience as a sad faced minstrel uttered in tear compelling accents the most pathetic words in all the literature of minstrelsy And so you say mister Johnson that all the people on the ship were perishing of hunger and yet you were eating fried eggs How do you account for that For one moment a deathlike silence prevailed Then the Old Gag stepped forward and in clear ringing tones replied The ship lay to and I got one A wild heartrending sob came from the audience and relieved the tension as the Old Gag staggered back into the entrance and fell into the friendly arms that were waiting to receive him Sobbing Conundrums bore him to a couch in the dressing room Weeping Jokes strove in vain to bring back the spark of life to his inanimate form But all to no avail The Old Gag was dead IN ELIZABETH S DAY BY WALLACE RICE Who would not give the treasure Of very many lives If some kind fate would pleasure To let him be where Ben is A playing Kit at tennis Or playing Will at

Previous Records Accordingly he did So and he Flew through the Small Town like a Red Dragon Pursuing his Prey Unheeding all Obstacles in his Mad Career his Automobile ran into a Wall of Rock and was

Run into Something The Result was that Two Automobiles and an Ice Wagon ran into him from behind spoiling his Car and Killing the Cautious Young Man MORALS This Fable teaches Us The More Haste The Less Speed and Delays Are Dangerous THE NEW VERSION BY W J LAMPTON A soldier of the Russians Lay japanned at Tschrtzvkjskivitch There was lack of woman s nursing And other comforts which Might add to his last moments And smooth the final way But a comrade stood beside him To hear what he might say The japanned Russian faltered As he took that comrade s hand And he said I never more shall see My own my native land Take a message and a token To some distant friends of mine For I was born at Smnlxzrskgqrxzski Fair Smnlxzrskgqrxzski on the Irkztrvzkimnov SOUTHERN SKETCHES BY BILL ARP JIM ALLCORN I was only thinkin how much better it is to be in a lively humor than be goin about like a disappointed offis seeker Good humor is a blessed thing in a family and smooths down a heap of trubble I never was mad but a few times in my life and then I wasn t mad long Foaks thought I was mad when I fout Jim Allcorn but I wasent I never had had any grudge agin Jim He had never done me any harm but I could hear of his sayin around in the naborhood that Bill Arp had played cock of the walk long enuf So one day I went over to Chulio court ground to joak with the boys and shore enuf Jim was there and I soon perseeved that the devil was in him He had never been whipped by anybody in the distrikt and he outweighed me by about fifteen pounds A drink or two had made him sassy and so he commenced walkin around first to one crowd and then to another darin anybody to fite him He would pint to his forrerd and say I ll give anybody five dollars to hit that I was standin tawkin to Frank Air and John Johnsin and as nobody took up Jim s offer thinks says I to myself if he cums round here a huntin for a fite he shall have one by golly If he dares me to hit him I ll do it if it s the last lick I ever strike on this side of Jordin Frank Air looked at me and seemed to know what I was a thinkin and says he Bill jest let Allcorn alone He s too big for you and besides there ain t nothin to fite about By this time Jim was makin rite towards us I put myself in position and by the time he got to us every muscle in my body was strung as tite as a banjo I was worked up powerful and felt like I could whip a campmeetin of wild cats Shore enuf Jim stepped up defiantly and lookin me rite in the eye says he I dare anybody to hit that and he touched his knuckles to his forrerd He had barely straightened before I took him rite in the left eye with a sock dolyger that popped like a wagin whip It turned him half round and as quick as lightnin I let him hav another on the right temple and followed it up with a leap that sprawled him as flat as a foot mat I knowed my customer and I never giv him time to rally If ever a man was diligent in business it was me I took him so hard and so fast in the eyes with my fists and in his bred basket with my knees that he didn t hav a chance to see or to breathe and he was the worst whipped man in two minets I ever seed in my life When he hollered I helped him up and breshed the dirt off his clothes and he was as umble as a ded nigger and as sober as a Presbyterian preacher We took a dram on the strength of it and was always good frends afterwards But I dident start to tell you about that JIM PERKINS COUSIN OF ELI I jist wanted to say that I wasent mad with Jim Allcorn as sum peepul supposed but it do illustrate the onsertainty of human kalkulashuns in this subloonery world The disappintments of life are amazin and if a man wants to fret and grumble at his luck he can find a reesunable oppertunity to do so every day that he lives Them sort of constitutional grumblers ain t much cumpany to me I d rather be Jim Perkins with a bullit hole through me and take my chances Jim you know was shot down at Gains Mill and the ball went in at the umbilikus as doctor Battey called it and cum out at the backbone The Doktor sounded him and sez he Jeems my friend your wound is mortal Jim looked at the Doktor and then at me and sez he That s bad ain t it Mighty bad sez I and I was as sorry for him as I ever was for anybody in my life Sez he Bill I d make a will if it warn t for one thing What s that Jim sez I He sorter smiled and sez I hain t got nothin to will He then raised up on his elbow and sez he Doktor is there one chance in a hundred for me and the Doktor sez Jest about Jim Well then sez he I ll git well I feel it in my gizzard He looked down at the big hole in his umbilikus and sez he If I do get well won t it be a great naval viktry Doktor Battey Well shore enuff he did git well and in two months he was fitin the Yanks away up in Maryland But I didn t start to tell you about that IKE MACKOY I jest stuck it in by way of illustratin the good effeks of keepin up one s spirits My motto has always been to never say die as general Nelson sed at the battle of Madagascar or sum other big river All things considered I ve had a power of good luck in my life I don t mean money luck by no means for most of my life I ve been so ded poor that Lazarus would hev been considered a note shaver compared with me But I ve been in a heap of close places and sumhow always cum out rite side up with keer Speakin of luck I don t know that I ever told you about that rassel I had with Ike McKoy at Bob Hide s barbyku You see Ike was perhaps the best rasler in all Cherokee and he jest hankered after a chance to break a bone or two in my body Now you know I never hunted for a fite nor a fuss in my life but I never dodged one I dident want a tilt with Ike for my opinyun was that he was the best man of the two but I never sed anything and jest trusted to luck We was both at the barbyku and he put on a heap of airs and strutted around with his shirt collar open clean down to his waist and his hat cocked on one side as sassy as a confedrit quartermaster He took a dram or two and stuffed himself full of fresh meat at dinner time Purty soon it was norated around that Ike was going to banter me for a rassel and shore enuff he did The boys were all up for some fun and Ike hollered out I ll bet ten dollars I can paster the length of any man on the ground and I ll giv Bill Arp five dollars to take up the bet Of course there was no gittin around the like of that The banter got my blood up and so without waitin for preliminaries I shucked myself and went in The boys was all powerfully excited and was a bettin evry dollar they could raise and Bob Moore the feller I had licked about a year before jumped on a stump and sed hed bet twenty dollars to ten that Ike would knock the breath out of me the first fall I jest walked over to him with the money and sed I ll take that bet The river was right close to the ring and the bank was purty steep I had on a pair of old breeches that had been sained in and dried so often they was about half rotten When we hitched Ike took good britches hold and lifted me up and down a few times like I was a child He was the heaviest but I had the most spring in me and so I jest let him play round for sum time limber like until he suddenly took a notion to make short work of it by one of his backleg movements He drawed me up to his body and lifted me in the air with a powerful twist Just at that minit his back was close to the river bank and as my feet touched the ground I giv a tremenjius jerk backwards and a shuv forwards and my britches busted plum open on the back and tore clean off in front and he fell from me and tumbled into the water kerchug and went out of sight as clean as a mud turtle in a mill pond Such hollerin as them boys done I rekon never heard in them woods I jumped in and helped Ike get out as he riz to the top He had took in a quart or two of water on top of his barbyku and he set on the bank and throwed up enuf vittels to feed a pack of houns for a week When he got over it he laffd and sed Sally told him before he left home he d better let Bill Arp alone for nobody could run agin his luck Ike always believed he would hav throwd me if britches holt hadent broke and I rekon may be he would One thing is sertin it cured him of braggin and that helps anybody I never did like a braggin man As a genrul thing they ain t much akkount and remind me of a dog I used to have named Cesar DOGS But I dident start to tell you a dog story only now since I ve mentioned him I must tell you a circumstance about Cees He was a middlin size broot with fox ears and yaller spots over his eyes and could out bark and out brag all creation when he was inside the yard If another dog was goin along he d run up and down the palins and bark and take on like he d give the world if that fence wasent there So one day when he was showin off in that way I caught him by the nap of the neck as he run by me and jest histed him right over and drapped him He struck the ground like an injun rubber ball and was back agin on my side in a jiffy If he had ever jumped that fence before I dident know it The other dog run a quarter of a mile without stoppin Now that s the way with sum foaks If you want to hear war tawk jest put a fence between em and if you want it stopped jest take the fence away Dogs is mighty like peepul anyhow They ve got karacter Sum of em are good honest trusty dogs that bark mity little and bite at the right time Sum are good pluk and will fite like the dickens when their masters is close by to back em but ain t worth a cent by themselves Sum make it a bizness to make other dogs fite You ve seen these little fices a runnin around growlin and snappin when two big dogs cum together They are jest as keen to get up a row and see a big dog fite as a store clerk or a shoemaker and seem to enjoy it as much And then there s them mean yaller eyed bull terriers that don t care who they bite so they bite sumbody They are no respekter of persons and I never had much respekt for a man who kept one on his premises But of all mean triflin contemptible dogs in the world the meanest of all is a country nigger s houn one that will kill sheep and suck eggs and lick the skillet and steal everything he can find and try to do as nigh like his master as possibul Sum dogs are filosofers and study other dogs natur just like foaks study foaks It s amazin to see a town dog trot up to a country dog and interview him How quick he finds out whether it will do to attack him or not If the country dog shows fite jest notis the consequential dignity with which the town dog retires He goes off like there was a sudden emergency of bisness a callin him away Town dogs sumtimes combine agin a country dog jest like town boys try to run over country boys I wish you could see doctor Miller s dog Cartoosh He jest lays in the piazzer all day watchin out for a stray dog and as soon as he sees him he goes for him and he can tell in half a minit whether he can whip him or run him and if he can he does it instanter and if he can t he runs to the next yard where there s two more dogs that nabor with him and in a minit they all cum a tarin out together and that country dog has to run or take a whippin shore I ve seen Cartoosh play that game many a time These town pups remind me powerfully of small editurs prowlin around for news In my opinyun they is the inventors of the interview bisness INTERVIEWERS If it ain t a doggish sort of bisnes I m mistaken in my idees of the proprietes of life When a man gits into trubble these sub editurs go fur him right strait and they force their curosity away down into his heart strings and bore into his buzzom with an augur as hard and as cold as chilld iron Then away they go to skatter his feelins and sekrets to the wide wide world You see the poor feller can t help himself for if he won t talk they ll go off and slander him and make the publik beleeve he s dun sumthing mean and is ashamed to own it I ve knowd em to go into a dungeon and interview a man who dident have two hours to live Dot rot em I wish one of em would try to interview me If he didn t catch leather under his coat tail it would be bekaus he retired prematurely that s all But I like editurs sorter especially sum I like them that is the guardeens of sleepin liberty and good morals and publik welfare and sich like but there s sum kinds I don t like Them what makes sensation a bizness feedin the peepul on skandal and crime and gossip and private quarrels and them what levies black mail on polytiks and won t go for a man who won t pay em and will go for a man that will Them last watch for elekshun times jest like a sick frog waitin for rain As Bill Nations used to say I d drather be a luniak and gnaw chains in an asylum than to be an editur that everybody feard and nobody respekted THE TWO BUSINESS MEN BY CAROLYN WELLS Once on a Time two Business Men were Each
