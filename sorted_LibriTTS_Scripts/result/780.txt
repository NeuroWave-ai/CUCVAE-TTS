5506-69895-0000	train-other-500	He was sitting on the fence at the end of his garden and surveying the great Bun Hill gas works with an eye that neither praised nor blamed Above the clustering gasometers three unfamiliar shapes appeared thin wallowing bladders that flapped and rolled about and grew bigger and bigger and rounder and rounder
5506-69895-0001	train-other-500	balloons in course of inflation for the South of England Aero Club s Saturday afternoon ascent They goes up every Saturday
none	none	 said his neighbour mister Stringer the milkman It s only yestiday so to speak when all London turned out to see a balloon go over 
5506-69895-0002	train-other-500	and now every little place in the country has its weekly outings uppings rather It s been the salvation of them gas companies Larst Satiday I got three barrer loads of gravel off my petaters said mister Tom Smallways
none	none	 Three barrer loads 
5506-69895-0003	train-other-500	What they dropped as ballase
none	none	 Some of the plants was broke and some was buried Ladies they say goes up 
5506-69895-0004	train-other-500	I suppose we got to call em ladies said mister Tom Smallways
none	none	 Still it ain t hardly my idea of a lady flying about in the air and 
5506-69895-0005	train-other-500	throwing gravel at people It ain t what I been accustomed to consider ladylike whether or no mister Stringer nodded his head approvingly and for a time they continued to regard the swelling bulks with expressions that had changed from indifference to disapproval
5506-69895-0006	train-other-500	mister Tom Smallways was a green grocer by trade and a gardener by disposition his little wife Jessica saw to the shop and Heaven had planned him for a peaceful world
5506-69895-0007	train-other-500	Unfortunately Heaven had not planned a peaceful world for him He lived in a world of obstinate and incessant change and in parts where its operations were unsparingly conspicuous Vicissitude was in the very soil he tilled
none	none	 even his garden was upon a yearly tenancy 
5506-69895-0008	train-other-500	and overshadowed by a huge board that proclaimed it not so much a garden as an eligible building site He was horticulture under notice to quit the last patch of country in a district flooded by new and other things
5506-69895-0009	train-other-500	He did his best to console himself to imagine matters near the turn of the tide You d hardly think it could keep on he said mister Smallways aged father could remember Bun Hill
5506-69895-0010	train-other-500	as an idyllic Kentish village He had driven Sir Peter Bone until he was fifty and then he took to drink a little and driving the station bus
none	none	 which lasted him until he was seventy eight 
5506-69895-0011	train-other-500	Then he retired He sat by the fireside a shrivelled very very old coachman full charged with reminiscences and ready for any careless stranger He could tell you of the vanished estate of Sir Peter Bone long since cut up for building
5506-69895-0012	train-other-500	and how that magnate ruled the country side when it was country side of shooting and hunting and of caches along the high road of how where the gas works is was a cricket field and of the coming of the Crystal Palace
5506-69895-0013	train-other-500	The Crystal Palace was six miles away from Bun Hill a great facade that glittered in the morning and was a clear blue outline against the sky in the afternoon and of a night a source of gratuitous fireworks for all the population of Bun Hill
5506-69895-0014	train-other-500	And then had come the railway
none	none	 and then villas and villas and then the gas works and the water works and a great ugly sea of workmen s houses 
5506-69895-0015	train-other-500	and then drainage and the water vanished out of the Otterbourne and left it a dreadful ditch and then a second railway station Bun Hill South and more houses and more more shops more competition
5506-69895-0016	train-other-500	plate glass shops a school board rates omnibuses tramcars going right away into London itself bicycles motor cars and then more motor cars a Carnegie library
5506-69895-0017	train-other-500	You d hardly think it could keep on said mister Tom Smallways growing up among these marvels But it kept on
5506-69895-0018	train-other-500	Even from the first the green grocer s shop which he had set up in one of the smallest of the old surviving village houses in the tail of the High Street had a submerged air an air of hiding from something that was looking for it
none	none	 When they had made up the pavement of the High Street 
5506-69895-0019	train-other-500	they levelled that up so that one had to go down three steps into the shop Tom did his best to sell only his own excellent but limited range of produce but Progress came shoving things into his window
none	none	 French artichokes and aubergines 
5506-69895-0020	train-other-500	foreign apples apples from the State of New York apples from California apples from Canada apples from New Zealand pretty lookin fruit but not what I should call English apples said Tom bananas unfamiliar nuts
5506-69895-0021	train-other-500	grape fruits mangoes The motor cars that went by northward and southward grew more and more powerful and efficient whizzed faster and smelt worse
5506-69895-0022	train-other-500	there appeared great clangorous petrol trolleys delivering coal and parcels in the place of vanishing horse vans motor omnibuses ousted the horse omnibuses even the Kentish strawberries going Londonward in the night took to machinery
5506-69895-0023	train-other-500	and clattered instead of creaking and became affected in flavour by progress and petrol And then young Bert Smallways got a motor bicycle two
5506-69895-0024	train-other-500	Bert it is necessary to explain was a progressive Smallways Nothing speaks more eloquently of the pitiless insistence of progress and expansion in our time than that it should get into the Smallways blood
5506-69895-0025	train-other-500	But there was something advanced and enterprising about young Smallways before he was out of short frocks He was lost for a whole day before he was five
5506-69896-0026	train-other-500	five
none	none	 and nearly drowned in the reservoir of the new water works before he was seven 
5506-69895-0026	train-other-500	He had a real pistol taken away from him by a real policeman when he was ten And he learnt to smoke not with pipes and brown paper and cane as Tom had done but with a penny packet of Boys of England American cigarettes His language shocked his father before he was twelve
none	none	 and by that age what with touting for parcels at the station and selling the Bun Hill Weekly Express he was making three shillings a week or more 
5506-69895-0027	train-other-500	and spending it on Chips Comic Cuts Ally Sloper s Half holiday cigarettes and all the concomitants of a life of pleasure and enlightenment All of this without hindrance to his literary studies which carried him up to the seventh standard
5506-69895-0028	train-other-500	at an exceptionally early age I mention these things so that you may have no doubt at all concerning the sort of stuff Bert had in him He was six years younger than Tom
5506-69895-0029	train-other-500	and for a time there was an attempt to utilise him in the green grocer s shop when Tom at twenty one married Jessica who was thirty and had saved a little money in service But it was not Bert s forte to be utilised He hated digging
5506-69895-0030	train-other-500	and when he was given a basket of stuff to deliver a nomadic instinct arose irresistibly it became his pack and he did not seem to care how heavy it was nor where he took it so long as he did not take it to its destination
5506-69895-0031	train-other-500	Glamour filled the world and he strayed after it basket and all So Tom took his goods out himself and sought employers for Bert who did not know of this strain of poetry in his nature
5506-69895-0032	train-other-500	And Bert touched the fringe of a number of trades in succession draper s porter chemist s boy doctor s page junior assistant gas fitter
none	none	 envelope addresser 
5506-69895-0033	train-other-500	milk cart assistant golf caddie and at last helper in a bicycle shop Here apparently he found the progressive quality his nature had craved His employer was a pirate souled young man named Grubb
5506-69895-0034	train-other-500	with a black smeared face by day and a music hall side in the evening who dreamt of a patent lever chain and it seemed to Bert that he was the perfect model of a gentleman of spirit
5506-69895-0035	train-other-500	He hired out quite the dirtiest and unsafest bicycles in the whole south of England and conducted the subsequent discussions with astonishing verve Bert and he settled down very well together Bert lived in became almost a trick rider
5506-69895-0036	train-other-500	he could ride bicycles for miles that would have come to pieces instantly under you or me
none	none	 took to washing his face after business 
5506-69895-0037	train-other-500	and spent his surplus money upon remarkable ties and collars cigarettes and shorthand classes at the Bun Hill Institute
5506-69895-0038	train-other-500	He would go round to Tom at times and look and talk so brilliantly that Tom and Jessie who both had a natural tendency to be respectful to anybody or anything looked up to him immensely
5506-69895-0039	train-other-500	He s a go ahead chap is Bert said Tom He knows a thing or two Let s hope he don t know too much said Jessica who had a fine sense of limitations It s go ahead Times said Tom Noo petaters and English at that
none	none	 we ll be having em in March if things go on as they do go I never see such Times 
5506-69895-0040	train-other-500	See his tie last night It wasn t suited to him Tom It was a gentleman s tie He wasn t up to it not the rest of him It wasn t becoming Then presently
5506-69895-0041	train-other-500	Bert got a cyclist s suit cap badge and all and to see him and Grubb going down to Brighton and back heads down handle bars down backbones curved was a revelation in the possibilities of the Smallways blood
5506-69895-0042	train-other-500	Go ahead Times Old Smallways would sit over the fire mumbling of the greatness of other days of old Sir Peter who drove his coach to Brighton and back in eight and twenty hours
5506-69895-0043	train-other-500	of old Sir Peter s white top hats of Lady Bone who never set foot to ground except to walk in the garden of the great prize fights at Crawley He talked of pink and pig skin breeches of
none	none	 foxes at Ring s Bottom where now the County Council pauper lunatics were enclosed 
5506-69895-0044	train-other-500	of Lady Bone s chintzes and crinolines Nobody heeded him The world had thrown up a new type of gentleman altogether a gentleman of most ungentlemanly energy a gentleman in dusty oilskins and motor goggles
5506-69895-0045	train-other-500	and a wonderful cap a stink making gentleman a swift high class badger who fled perpetually along high roads from the dust and stink he perpetually made And his lady as they were able to see her at Bun Hill
5506-69895-0046	train-other-500	was a weather bitten goddess as free from refinement as a gipsy
none	none	 not so much dressed as packed for transit at a high velocity So Bert grew up filled with ideals of speed and enterprise and became so far as he became anything a kind of bicycle engineer of the let s have a look at it and enamel chipping variety Even a road racer geared to a hundred and twenty failed to satisfy him and for a time he pined in vain at twenty miles an hour along roads that were continually more dusty and more crowded with mechanical traffic 
5506-69895-0047	train-other-500	But at last his savings accumulated and his chance came The hire purchase system bridged a financial gap and one bright and memorable Sunday morning he wheeled his new possession through the shop into the road
5506-69895-0048	train-other-500	got on to it with the advice and assistance of Grubb and
none	none	 teuf teuffed off into the haze of the traffic tortured high road 
5506-69895-0049	train-other-500	to add himself as one more voluntary public danger to the amenities of the south of England
none	none	 Orf to Brighton said old Smallways regarding his youngest son from the sitting room window over the green grocer s shop with something between pride and reprobation 
5506-69895-0050	train-other-500	When I was is age I d never been to London never bin south of Crawley
none	none	 never bin anywhere on my own where I couldn t walk 
5506-69895-0051	train-other-500	And nobody didn t go Not unless they was gentry
none	none	 Now every body s orf everywhere the whole dratted country sims flying to pieces 
5506-69895-0052	train-other-500	Wonder they all get back Orf to Brighton indeed
none	none	 Anybody want to buy orses 
5506-69895-0053	train-other-500	You can t say I bin to Brighton father said Tom
none	none	 Nor don t want to go said Jessica sharply 
5506-69895-0054	train-other-500	creering about and spendin your money three
none	none	 For a time the possibilities of the motor bicycle so occupied Bert s mind that he remained 
5506-69895-0055	train-other-500	regardless of the new direction in which the striving soul of man was finding exercise and refreshment He failed to observe that the type of motor car like the type of bicycle was settling down and losing its adventurous quality
none	none	 Indeed it is as true as it is remarkable that Tom was the first to observe the new development 
5506-69895-0056	train-other-500	But his gardening made him attentive to the heavens and the proximity of the Bun Hill gas works and the Crystal Palace from which ascents were continually being made and presently the descent of ballast upon his potatoes conspired to bear in upon
5506-69895-0057	train-other-500	his unwilling mind the fact that the Goddess of Change was turning her disturbing attention to the sky The first great boom in aeronautics was beginning Grubb and Bert heard of it in a music hall
5506-69895-0058	train-other-500	then it was driven home to their minds by the cinematograph then Bert s imagination was stimulated by a sixpenny edition of that aeronautic classic mister George Griffith s Clipper of the Clouds and so the thing really got hold of them
5506-69895-0059	train-other-500	At first the most obvious aspect was the multiplication of balloons The sky of Bun Hill began to be infested by balloons On Wednesday and Saturday afternoons particularly you could scarcely look skyward for a quarter of an hour without discovering a balloon somewhere
5506-69895-0060	train-other-500	And then one bright day Bert motoring toward Croydon was arrested by the insurgence of a huge bolster shaped monster from the Crystal Palace grounds and obliged to dismount and watch it
5506-69895-0061	train-other-500	It was like a bolster with a broken nose and below it and comparatively small was a stiff framework bearing a man and an engine with a screw that whizzed round in front and a sort of canvas rudder behind
5506-69895-0062	train-other-500	The framework had an air of dragging the reluctant gas cylinder after it like a brisk little terrier towing a shy gas distended elephant into society The combined monster certainly travelled and steered
5506-69895-0063	train-other-500	It went overhead perhaps a thousand feet up Bert heard the engine sailed away southward vanished over the hills reappeared a little blue outline far off in the east going now very fast before a gentle south west gale
5506-69895-0064	train-other-500	returned above the Crystal Palace towers circled round them chose a position for descent and sank down out of sight Bert sighed deeply and turned to his motor bicycle again And
none	none	 that was only the beginning of a succession of strange phenomena in the heavens 
5506-69895-0065	train-other-500	cylinders cones pear shaped monsters even at last a thing of aluminium that glittered wonderfully and that Grubb through some confusion of ideas about armour plates was inclined to consider a war machine
5506-69895-0066	train-other-500	There followed actual flight This however was not an affair that was visible from Bun Hill it was something that occurred in private grounds or other enclosed places
none	none	 and under favourable conditions and it was brought home to Grubb and Bert Smallways only by means of the magazine page of the half penny newspapers 
5506-69895-0067	train-other-500	or by cinematograph records
none	none	 But it was brought home very insistently 
5506-69895-0068	train-other-500	and in those days if ever one heard a man saying in a public place in a loud reassuring confident tone It s bound to come the chances were ten to one he was talking of flying And Bert got a box lid and wrote out in correct window ticket style
5506-69895-0069	train-other-500	and Grubb put in the window this inscription Aeroplanes made and repaired It quite upset Tom it seemed taking one s shop so lightly but most of the neighbours
5506-69895-0070	train-other-500	and all the sporting ones approved of it as being very good indeed Everybody talked of flying everybody repeated over and over again Bound to come
5506-69895-0071	train-other-500	and then you know it didn t come There was a hitch They flew that was all right they flew in machines heavier than air But they smashed Sometimes they smashed the engine sometimes they smashed the aeronaut usually they smashed both
5506-69895-0072	train-other-500	Machines that made flights of three or four miles and came down safely went up the next time to headlong disaster There seemed no possible trusting to them The breeze upset them
5506-69895-0073	train-other-500	the eddies near the ground upset them a passing thought in the mind of the aeronaut upset them Also they upset simply It s this stability does em said Grubb repeating his newspaper
none	none	 They pitch and they pitch till they pitch themselves to pieces 
5506-69895-0074	train-other-500	Experiments fell away after two expectant years of this sort of success the public and then the newspapers tired of the expensive photographic reproductions the optimistic reports
5506-69895-0075	train-other-500	the perpetual sequence of triumph and disaster and silence Flying slumped even ballooning fell away to some extent
5506-69895-0076	train-other-500	though it remained a fairly popular sport and continued to lift gravel from the wharf of the Bun Hill gas works and drop it upon deserving people s lawns and gardens There were half a dozen reassuring years for Tom at least so far as flying was concerned
5506-69895-0077	train-other-500	But that was the great time of mono rail development and his anxiety was only diverted from the high heavens by the most urgent threats and symptoms of change in the lower sky There had been talk of mono rails for several years
none	none	 But the real mischief began when Brennan sprang his gyroscopic mono rail car upon the Royal Society It was the leading sensation of the nineteen oh seven soirees that celebrated demonstration room was all too small for its exhibition 
5506-69895-0079	train-other-500	Brave soldiers leading Zionists deserving novelists noble ladies congested the narrow passage and thrust distinguished elbows into ribs the world would not willingly let break deeming themselves fortunate
5506-69895-0080	train-other-500	if they could see just a little bit of the rail Inaudible but convincing the great inventor expounded his discovery and sent his obedient little model of the trains of the future up gradients round curves and across a sagging wire
5506-69895-0081	train-other-500	It ran along its single rail on its single wheels simple and sufficient it stopped reversed stood still balancing perfectly
5506-69895-0082	train-other-500	It maintained its astounding equilibrium amidst a thunder of applause The audience dispersed at last discussing how far they would enjoy crossing an abyss on a wire cable Suppose the gyroscope stopped
none	none	 Few of them anticipated a tithe of what the Brennan mono rail would do for their railway securities and the face of the world 
5506-69895-0083	train-other-500	In a few years they realised better In a little while no one thought anything of crossing an abyss on a wire and the mono rail was superseding the tram lines railways and indeed every form of track for mechanical locomotion
none	none	 Where land was cheap the rail ran along the ground where it was dear the rail lifted up on iron standards and passed overhead its swift convenient cars went everywhere and did everything that had once been done 
5506-69895-0084	train-other-500	along made tracks upon the ground
none	none	 When old Smallways died 
5506-69895-0085	train-other-500	Tom could think of nothing more striking to say of him than that When he was a boy there wasn t nothing higher than your chimbleys there wasn t a wire nor a cable in the sky Old Smallways went to his grave under an intricate network of wires and cables
5506-69895-0086	train-other-500	for Bun Hill became not only a sort of minor centre of power distribution the Home Counties Power Distribution Company set up transformers and a generating station close beside the old gas works but also a junction on the suburban mono rail system
5506-69895-0087	train-other-500	Moreover every tradesman in the place and indeed nearly every house had its own telephone The mono rail cable standard became a striking fact in urban landscape for the most part stout iron erections rather like tapering trestles
5506-69895-0088	train-other-500	and painted a bright bluish green One it happened bestrode Tom s house which looked still more retiring and apologetic beneath its immensity and another giant stood just inside the corner of his garden
5506-69895-0089	train-other-500	which was still not built upon and unchanged except for a couple of advertisement boards one recommending a two and sixpenny watch and one a nerve restorer These by the bye were placed almost horizontally to catch the eye of the passing mono rail passengers above
5506-69895-0090	train-other-500	and so served admirably to roof over a tool shed and a mushroom shed for Tom All day and all night the fast cars from Brighton and Hastings went murmuring by overhead
5506-69895-0091	train-other-500	long broad comfortable looking cars that were brightly lit after dusk As they flew by at night transient flares of light and a rumbling sound of passage they kept up a perpetual summer lightning
5506-69895-0092	train-other-500	and thunderstorm in the street below Presently the English Channel was bridged a series of great iron Eiffel Tower pillars carrying mono rail cables at a height of a hundred and fifty feet above the water
5506-69895-0093	train-other-500	except near the middle where they rose higher to allow the passage of the London and Antwerp shipping and the Hamburg America liners Then heavy motor cars began to run about on only a couple of wheels one behind the other
5506-69895-0094	train-other-500	which for some reason upset Tom dreadfully and made him gloomy for days after the first one passed the shop All this gyroscopic and mono rail development naturally absorbed a vast amount of public attention
5506-69895-0095	train-other-500	and there was also a huge excitement consequent upon the amazing gold discoveries off the coast of Anglesea made by a submarine prospector Miss Patricia Giddy
none	none	 She had taken her degree in geology and mineralogy in the University of London and while working upon the auriferous rocks of North Wales after a brief holiday spent in agitating for women s suffrage 
5506-69895-0096	train-other-500	she had been struck by the possibility of these reefs cropping up again under the water She had set herself to verify this supposition by the use of the submarine crawler invented by Doctor Alberto Cassini
5506-69895-0097	train-other-500	By a happy mingling of reasoning and intuition peculiar to her sex she found gold at her first descent and emerged after three hours submersion with about two hundredweight of ore containing gold
5506-69895-0098	train-other-500	in the unparalleled quantity of seventeen ounces to the ton But the whole story of her submarine mining intensely interesting as it is must be told at some other time
none	none	 suffice it now to remark simply that it was during the consequent great rise of prices confidence and enterprise that the revival of interest in flying occurred 
5506-69896-0000	train-other-500	It is curious how that revival began It was like the coming of a breeze on a quiet day nothing started it it came People began to talk of flying with an air of never having for one moment dropped the subject
5506-69896-0001	train-other-500	Pictures of flying and flying machines returned to the newspapers articles and allusions increased and multiplied in the serious magazines People asked in mono rail trains When are we going to fly
5506-69896-0002	train-other-500	A new crop of inventors sprang up in a night or so like fungi The Aero Club announced the project of a great Flying Exhibition in a large area of ground that the removal of slums in Whitechapel had rendered available
5506-69896-0003	train-other-500	The advancing wave soon produced a sympathetic ripple in the Bun Hill establishment Grubb routed out his flying machine model again
none	none	 tried it in the yard behind the shop got a kind of flight out of it and broke seventeen panes of glass and nine flower pots in the greenhouse that occupied the next yard but one 
5506-69896-0004	train-other-500	And then springing from nowhere sustained one knew not how came a persistent disturbing rumour
none	none	 that the problem had been solved that the secret was known 
5506-69896-0005	train-other-500	Bert met it one early closing afternoon as he refreshed himself in an inn near Nutfield whither his motor bicycle had brought him There smoked and meditated a person in khaki
5506-69896-0006	train-other-500	an engineer who presently took an interest in Bert s machine It was a sturdy piece of apparatus
none	none	 and it had acquired a kind of documentary value in these quick changing times 
5506-69896-0007	train-other-500	it was now nearly eight years old Its points discussed the soldier broke into a new topic with My next s going to be an aeroplane so far as I can see I ve had enough of roads and ways They TORK said Bert
5506-69896-0008	train-other-500	They talk and they do said the soldier The thing s coming It keeps ON coming said Bert I shall believe when I see it That won t be long said the soldier
5506-69896-0009	train-other-500	The conversation seemed degenerating into an amiable wrangle of contradiction I tell you they ARE flying the soldier insisted I see it myself
none	none	 We ve all seen it said Bert I don t mean flap up and 
5506-69896-0010	train-other-500	smash up I mean real safe steady controlled flying against the wind good and right You ain t seen that
none	none	 I AVE Aldershot They try to keep it a secret They got it right enough You bet our War Office isn t going to be caught napping this time 
5506-69896-0011	train-other-500	Bert s incredulity was shaken He asked questions and the soldier expanded
none	none	 I tell you they got nearly a square mile fenced in a sort of valley Fences of barbed wire ten feet high and inside that they do things 
5506-69896-0012	train-other-500	Chaps about the camp now and then we get a peep It isn t only us neither There s the Japanese you bet they got it too and the Germans The soldier stood with his legs very wide apart and filled his pipe thoughtfully
none	none	 Bert sat on the low wall against which his motor bicycle was leaning 
5506-69896-0013	train-other-500	Funny thing fighting ll be he said Flying s going to break out said the soldier When it DOES come when the curtain does go up I tell you you ll find every one on the stage busy
5506-69896-0014	train-other-500	Such fighting too I suppose you don t read the papers about this sort of thing I read em a bit said Bert
none	none	 Well have you noticed what one might call the remarkable case of the disappearing inventor 
5506-69896-0015	train-other-500	the inventor who turns up in a blaze of publicity fires off a few successful experiments and vanishes
none	none	 Can t say I ave said Bert Well I ave anyhow You get anybody come along who does anything striking in this line and you bet he vanishes Just goes off quietly out of sight After a bit you don t hear anything more of em at all See 
5506-69896-0016	train-other-500	They disappear Gone no address First oh it s an old story now there was those Wright Brothers out in America They glided they glided miles and miles Finally they glided off stage
5506-69896-0017	train-other-500	Why it must be nineteen hundred and four or five THEY vanished Then there was those people in Ireland no I forget their names Everybody said they could fly THEY went They ain t dead that I ve heard tell but you can t say they re alive
5506-69896-0018	train-other-500	Not a feather of em can you see Then that chap who flew round Paris and upset in the Seine De Booley was it I forget That was a grand fly in spite of the accident but where s he got to
none	none	 The accident didn t hurt him Eh E s gone to cover 
5506-69896-0019	train-other-500	The soldier prepared to light his pipe Looks like a secret society got hold of them said Bert
none	none	 Secret society NAW The soldier lit his match 
5506-69896-0020	train-other-500	and drew Secret society he repeated with his pipe between his teeth and the match flaring in response to his words
none	none	 War Departments that s more like it 
5506-69896-0021	train-other-500	He threw his match aside and walked to his machine I tell you sir he said there isn t a big Power in Europe OR Asia OR America
none	none	 OR Africa 
5506-69896-0022	train-other-500	that hasn t got at least one or two flying machines hidden up its sleeve at the present time Not one Real workable flying machines And the spying
none	none	 The spying and manoeuvring to find out what the others have got I tell you sir a foreigner 
5506-69896-0023	train-other-500	or for the matter of that an unaccredited native can t get within four miles of Lydd nowadays not to mention our little circus at Aldershot and the experimental camp in Galway No
5506-69896-0024	train-other-500	Well said Bert I d like to see one of them anyhow Jest to help believing I ll believe when I see that I ll promise you
none	none	 You ll see em fast enough said the soldier and led his machine out into the road 
5506-69896-0025	train-other-500	He left Bert on his wall grave and pensive with his cap on the back of his head and a cigarette smouldering in the corner of his mouth If what he says is true said Bert me and Grubb
none	none	 we been wasting our blessed old time Besides incurring expense with that green ouse five It was while this mysterious talk with the soldier still stirred in Bert Smallways imagination that the most astounding incident in the whole of that dramatic chapter of human history 
5506-69896-0027	train-other-500	the coming of flying occurred People talk glibly enough of epoch making events this was an epoch making event It was the unanticipated and entirely successful flight
5506-69896-0028	train-other-500	of mister Alfred Butteridge from the Crystal Palace to Glasgow and back in a small businesslike looking machine heavier than air an entirely manageable and controllable machine that could fly as well as a pigeon
5506-69896-0029	train-other-500	It wasn t one felt a fresh step forward in the matter so much as a giant stride a leap mister Butteridge remained in the air altogether for about nine hours and during that time
5506-69896-0030	train-other-500	he flew with the ease and assurance of a bird His machine was however neither bird like nor butterfly like nor had it the wide lateral expansion of the ordinary aeroplane The effect upon the observer was rather something
5506-69896-0031	train-other-500	in the nature of a bee or wasp Parts of the apparatus were spinning very rapidly and gave one a hazy effect of transparent wings but parts including two
5506-69896-0032	train-other-500	peculiarly curved wing cases if one may borrow a figure from the flying beetles remained expanded stiffly
none	none	 In the middle was a long rounded body like the body of a moth and on this mister Butteridge 
5506-69896-0033	train-other-500	could be seen sitting astride much as a man bestrides a horse The wasp like resemblance was increased by the fact that the apparatus flew with a deep booming hum exactly the sound made by a wasp at a windowpane
5506-69896-0034	train-other-500	mister Butteridge took the world by surprise He was one of those gentlemen from nowhere Fate still succeeds in producing for the stimulation of mankind He came it was variously said from Australia
5506-69896-0035	train-other-500	and America and the South of France He was also described quite incorrectly as the son of a man who had amassed a comfortable fortune in the manufacture of gold nibs and the Butteridge fountain pens
none	none	 But this was an entirely different strain of Butteridges For some years in spite of a loud voice a large presence an aggressive swagger 
5506-69896-0036	train-other-500	and an implacable manner he had been an undistinguished member of most of the existing aeronautical associations Then one day he wrote to all the London papers to announce that he had made arrangements for an ascent from the Crystal Palace
5506-69896-0037	train-other-500	of a machine that would demonstrate satisfactorily that the outstanding difficulties in the way of flying were finally solved Few of the papers printed his letter still fewer were the people who believed in his claim
5506-69896-0038	train-other-500	No one was excited even when a fracas on the steps of a leading hotel in Piccadilly in which he tried to horse whip a prominent German musician upon some personal account delayed his promised ascent The quarrel was
5506-69896-0039	train-other-500	inadequately reported and his name spelt variously Betteridge and Betridge Until his flight indeed he did not and could not contrive to exist in the public mind
5506-69896-0040	train-other-500	There were scarcely thirty people on the look out for him in spite of all his clamour when about six o clock one summer morning the doors of the big shed in which he had been putting together his apparatus opened it was near the
5506-69896-0041	train-other-500	big model of a megatherium in the Crystal Palace grounds and his giant insect came droning out into a negligent and incredulous world
5506-69896-0042	train-other-500	But before he had made his second circuit of the Crystal Palace towers Fame was lifting her trumpet she drew a deep breath as the startled tramps who sleep
5506-69896-0043	train-other-500	on the seats of Trafalgar Square were roused by his buzz and awoke to discover him circling the Nelson column and by the time he had got to Birmingham which place he crossed about half past ten
5506-69896-0044	train-other-500	her deafening blast was echoing throughout the country The despaired of thing was done A man was flying securely and well Scotland was agape for his coming
none	none	 Glasgow he reached by one o clock and it is related that scarcely a ship yard or factory in that busy hive of industry 
5506-69896-0045	train-other-500	resumed work before half past two The public mind was just sufficiently educated
none	none	 in the impossibility of flying 
5506-69896-0046	train-other-500	to appreciate mister Butteridge at his proper value He circled the University buildings and dropped to within shouting distance of the crowds in West End Park and on the slope of Gilmorehill
5506-69896-0047	train-other-500	The thing flew quite steadily at a pace of about three miles an hour in a wide circle making a deep hum
none	none	 that would have drowned his full rich voice completely had he not provided himself with a megaphone He avoided churches buildings and mono rail cables with consummate ease as he conversed Me name s Butteridge he shouted B U T T E R I D G E Got it Me mother was Scotch And having assured himself that he had been understood he rose amidst cheers and shouting and patriotic cries and then flew up very swiftly and easily into the south eastern sky rising and falling with long easy undulations in an extraordinarily wasp like manner His return to London he visited and hovered over Manchester and Liverpool and Oxford on his way and spelt his name out to each place was an occasion of unparalleled excitement Every one was staring heavenward More people were run over in the streets upon that one day than in the previous three months and a County Council steamboat the Isaac Walton collided with a pier of Westminster Bridge and narrowly escaped disaster by running ashore it was low water on the mud on the south side He returned to the Crystal Palace grounds that classic starting point of aeronautical adventure about sunset re entered his shed without disaster and had the doors locked immediately upon the photographers and journalists who been waiting his return Look here you chaps he said as his assistant did so I m tired to death and saddle sore I can t give you a word of talk I m too done My name s Butteridge B U T T E R I D G E Get that right I m an Imperial Englishman I ll talk to you all to morrow Foggy snapshots still survive to record that incident His assistant struggles in a sea of aggressive young men carrying note books or upholding cameras and wearing bowler hats and enterprising ties He himself towers up in the doorway a big figure with a mouth an eloquent cavity beneath a vast black moustache distorted by his shout to these relentless agents of publicity He towers there the most famous man in the country Almost symbolically he holds and gesticulates with a megaphone in his left hand six Tom and Bert Smallways both saw that return They watched from the crest of Bun Hill from which they had so often surveyed the pyrotechnics of the Crystal Palace Bert was excited Tom kept calm and lumpish but neither of them realised how their own lives were to be invaded by the fruits of that beginning P raps old Grubb ll mind the shop a bit now he said and put his blessed model in the fire Not that that can save us if we don t tide over with Steinhart s account Bert knew enough of things and the problem of aeronautics to realise that this gigantic imitation of a bee would to use his own idiom give the newspapers fits The next day it was clear the fits had been given even as he said their magazine pages were black with hasty photographs their prose was convulsive they foamed at the headline The next day they were worse Before the week was out they were not so much published as carried screaming into the street The dominant fact in the uproar was the exceptional personality of mister Butteridge and the extraordinary terms he demanded for the secret of his machine For it was a secret and he kept it secret in the most elaborate fashion He built his apparatus himself in the safe privacy of the great Crystal Palace sheds with the assistance of inattentive workmen and the day next following his flight he took it to pieces single handed packed certain portions and then secured unintelligent assistance in packing and dispersing the rest Sealed packing cases went north and east and west to various pantechnicons and the engines were boxed with peculiar care It became evident these precautions were not inadvisable in view of the violent demand for any sort of photograph or impressions of his machine But mister Butteridge having once made his demonstration intended to keep his secret safe from any further risk of leakage He faced the British public now with the question whether they wanted his secret or not he was he said perpetually an Imperial Englishman and his first wish and his last was to see his invention the privilege and monopoly of the Empire Only It was there the difficulty began mister Butteridge it became evident was a man singularly free from any false modesty indeed from any modesty of any kind singularly willing to see interviewers answer questions upon any topic except aeronautics volunteer opinions criticisms and autobiography supply portraits and photographs of himself and generally spread his personality across the terrestrial sky The published portraits insisted primarily upon an immense black moustache and secondarily upon a fierceness behind the moustache The general impression upon the public was that Butteridge was a small man No one big it was felt could have so virulently aggressive an expression though as a matter of fact Butteridge had a height of six feet two inches and a weight altogether proportionate to that Moreover he had a love affair of large and unusual dimensions and irregular circumstances and the still largely decorous British public learnt with reluctance and alarm that a sympathetic treatment of this affair was inseparable from the exclusive acquisition of the priceless secret of aerial stability by the British Empire The exact particulars of the similarity never came to light but apparently the lady had in a fit of high minded inadvertence had gone through the ceremony of marriage with one quotes the unpublished discourse of mister Butteridge a white livered skunk and this zoological aberration did in some legal and vexatious manner mar her social happiness He wanted to talk about the business to show the splendour of her nature in the light of its complications It was really most embarrassing to a press that has always possessed a considerable turn for reticence that wanted things personal indeed in the modern fashion Yet not too personal It was embarrassing I say to be inexorably confronted with mister Butteridge s great heart to see it laid open in relentlesss self vivisection and its pulsating dissepiments adorned with emphatic flag labels Confronted they were and there was no getting away from it He would make this appalling viscus beat and throb before the shrinking journalists no uncle with a big watch and a little baby ever harped upon it so relentlessly whatever evasion they attempted he set aside He gloried in his love he said and compelled them to write it down That s of course a private affair mister Butteridge they would object The injustice sorr is public I do not care either I am up against institutions or individuals I do not care if I am up against the universal All I am pleading the cause of a woman a woman I lurve sorr a noble woman misunderstood I intend to vindicate her sorr to the four winds of heaven I lurve England he used to say lurve England but Puritanism sorr I abhor It fills me with loathing It raises my gorge Take my own case He insisted relentlessly upon his heart and upon seeing proofs of the interview If they had not done justice to his erotic bellowings and gesticulations he stuck in in a large inky scrawl all and more than they had omitted It was a strangely embarrassing thing for British journalism Never was there a more obvious or uninteresting affair never had the world heard the story of erratic affection with less appetite or sympathy On the other hand it was extremely curious about mister Butteridge s invention But when mister Butteridge could be deflected for a moment from the cause of the lady he championed then he talked chiefly and usually with tears of tenderness in his voice about his mother and his childhood his mother who crowned a complete encyclopedia of maternal virtue by being largely Scotch She was not quite neat but nearly so I owe everything in me to me mother he asserted everything Eh and ask any man who s done anything You ll hear the same story All we have we owe to women They are the species sorr Man is but a dream He comes and goes The woman s soul leadeth us upward and on He was always going on like that What in particular he wanted from the Government for his secret did not appear nor what beyond a money payment could be expected from a modern state in such an affair The general effect upon judicious observers indeed was not that he was treating for anything but that he was using an unexampled opportunity to bellow and show off to an attentive world Rumours of his real identity spread abroad It was said that he had been the landlord of an ambiguous hotel in Cape Town and had there given shelter to and witnessed the experiments and finally stolen the papers and plans of an extremely shy and friendless young inventor named Palliser who had come to South Africa from England in an advanced stage of consumption and died there This at any rate was the allegation of the more outspoken American press But the proof or disproof of that never reached the public mister Butteridge also involved himself passionately in a tangle of disputes for the possession of a great number of valuable money prizes Some of these had been offered so long ago as nineteen oh six for successful mechanical flight By the time of mister Butteridge s success a really very considerable number of newspapers tempted by the impunity of the pioneers in this direction had pledged themselves to pay in some cases quite overwhelming sums to the first person to fly from Manchester to Glasgow from London to Manchester one hundred miles two hundred miles in England and the like Most had hedged a little with ambiguous conditions and now offered resistance one or two paid at once and vehemently called attention to the fact and mister Butteridge plunged into litigation with the more recalcitrant while at the same time sustaining a vigorous agitation and canvass to induce the Government to purchase his invention One fact however remained permanent throughout all the developments of this affair behind Butteridge s preposterous love interest his politics and personality and all his shouting and boasting and that was that so far as the mass of people knew he was in sole possession of the secret of the practicable aeroplane in which for all one could tell to the contrary the key of the future empire of the world resided And presently to the great consternation of innumerable people including among others mister Bert Smallways it became apparent that whatever negotiations were in progress for the acquisition of this precious secret by the British Government were in danger of falling through The London Daily Requiem first voiced the universal alarm and published an interview under the terrific caption of mister Butteridge Speaks his Mind Therein the inventor if he was an inventor poured out his heart I came from the end of the earth he said which rather seemed to confirm the Cape Town story bringing me Motherland the secret that would give her the empire of the world And what do I get He paused I am sniffed at by elderly mandarins And the woman I love is treated like a leper I am an Imperial Englishman he went on in a splendid outburst subsequently written into the interview by his own hand but there there are limits to the human heart There are younger nations living nations Nations that do not snore and gurgle helplessly in paroxysms of plethora upon beds of formality and red tape There are nations that will not fling away the empire of earth in order to slight an unknown man and insult a noble woman whose boots they are not fitted to unlatch There are nations not blinded to Science not given over hand and foot to effete snobocracies and Degenerate Decadents In short mark my words THERE ARE OTHER NATIONS This speech it was that particularly impressed Bert Smallways If them Germans or them Americans get hold of this he said impressively to his brother the British Empire s done It s U P The Union Jack so to speak won t be worth the paper it s written on Tom I suppose you couldn t lend us a hand this morning said Jessica in his impressive pause Everybody in Bun Hill seems wanting early potatoes at once Tom can t carry half of them We re living on a volcano said Bert disregarding the suggestion At any moment war may come such a war He shook his head portentously You d better take this lot first Tom said Jessica She turned briskly on Bert Can you spare us a morning she asked I dessay I can said Bert The shop s very quiet s morning Though all this danger to the Empire worries me something frightful Work ll take it off your mind said Jessica And presently he too was going out into a world of change and wonder bowed beneath a load of potatoes and patriotic insecurity that merged at last into a very definite irritation at the weight and want of style of the potatoes and a very clear conception of the entire detestableness of Jessica CHAPTER II HOW BERT SMALLWAYS GOT INTO DIFFICULTIES It did not occur to either Tom or Bert Smallways that this remarkable aerial performance of mister Butteridge was likely to affect either of their lives in any special manner that it would in any way single them out from the millions about them and when they had witnessed it from the crest of Bun Hill and seen the fly like mechanism its rotating planes a golden haze in the sunset sink humming to the harbour of its shed again they turned back towards the sunken green grocery beneath the great iron standard of the London to Brighton mono rail and their minds reverted to the discussion that had engaged them before mister Butteridge s triumph had come in sight out of the London haze It was a difficult and unsuccessful discussions They had to carry it on in shouts because of the moaning and roaring of the gyroscopic motor cars that traversed the High Street and in its nature it was contentious and private The Grubb business was in difficulties and Grubb in a moment of financial eloquence had given a half share in it to Bert whose relations with his employer had been for some time unsalaried and pallish and informal Bert was trying to impress Tom with the idea that the reconstructed Grubb Smallways offered unprecedented and unparalleled opportunities to the judicious small investor It was coming home to Bert as though it were an entirely new fact that Tom was singularly impervious to ideas In the end he put the financial issues on one side and making the thing entirely a matter of fraternal affection succeeded in borrowing a sovereign on the security of his word of honour The firm of Grubb Smallways formerly Grubb had indeed been singularly unlucky in the last year or so For many years the business had struggled along with a flavour of romantic insecurity in a small dissolute looking shop in the High Street adorned with brilliantly coloured advertisements of cycles a display of bells trouser clips oil cans pump clips frame cases wallets and other accessories and the announcement of Bicycles on Hire Repairs Free inflation Petrol and similar attractions They were agents for several obscure makes of bicycle two samples constituted the stock and occasionally they effected a sale they also repaired punctures and did their best though luck was not always on their side with any other repairing that was brought to them They handled a line of cheap gramophones and did a little with musical boxes The staple of their business was however the letting of bicycles on hire It was a singular trade obeying no known commercial or economic principles indeed no principles There was a stock of ladies and gentlemen s bicycles in a state of disrepair that passes description and these the hiring stock were let to unexacting and reckless people inexpert in the things of this world at a nominal rate of one shilling for the first hour and sixpence per hour afterwards But really there were no fixed prices and insistent boys could get bicycles and the thrill of danger for an hour for so low a sum as threepence provided they could convince Grubb that that was all they had The saddle and handle bar were then sketchily adjusted by Grubb a deposit exacted except in the case of familiar boys the machine lubricated and the adventurer started upon his career Usually he or she came back but at times when the accident was serious Bert or Grubb had to go out and fetch the machine home Hire was always charged up to the hour of return to the shop and deducted from the deposit It was rare that a bicycle started out from their hands in a state of pedantic efficiency Romantic possibilities of accident lurked in the worn thread of the screw that adjusted the saddle in the precarious pedals in the loose knit chain in the handle bars above all in the brakes and tyres Tappings and clankings and strange rhythmic creakings awoke as the intrepid hirer pedalled out into the country Then perhaps the bell would jam or a brake fail to act on a hill or the seat pillar would get loose and the saddle drop three or four inches with a disconcerting bump or the loose and rattling chain would jump the cogs of the chain wheel as the machine ran downhill and so bring the mechanism to an abrupt and disastrous stop without at the same time arresting the forward momentum of the rider or a tyre would bang or sigh quietly and give up the struggle for efficiency When the hirer returned a heated pedestrian Grubb would ignore all verbal complaints and examine the machine gravely This ain t ad fair usage he used to begin He became a mild embodiment of the spirit of reason You can t expect a bicycle to take you up in its arms and carry you he used to say You got to show intelligence After all it s machinery Sometimes the process of liquidating the consequent claims bordered on violence It was always a very rhetorical and often a trying affair but in these progressive times you have to make a noise to get a living It was often hard work but nevertheless this hiring was a fairly steady source of profit until one day all the panes in the window and door were broken and the stock on sale in the window greatly damaged and disordered by two over critical hirers with no sense of rhetorical irrelevance They were big coarse stokers from Gravesend One was annoyed because his left pedal had come off and the other because his tyre had become deflated small and indeed negligible accidents by Bun Hill standards due entirely to the ungentle handling of the delicate machines entrusted to them and they failed to see clearly how they put themselves in the wrong by this method of argument It is a poor way of convincing a man that he has let you a defective machine to throw his foot pump about his shop and take his stock of gongs outside in order to return them through the window panes It carried no real conviction to the minds of either Grubb or Bert it only irritated and vexed them One quarrel makes many and this unpleasantness led to a violent dispute between Grubb and the landlord upon the moral aspects of and legal responsibility for the consequent re glazing In the end Grubb and Smallways were put to the expense of a strategic nocturnal removal to another position It was a position they had long considered It was a small shed like shop with a plate glass window and one room behind just at the sharp bend in the road at the bottom of Bun Hill and here they struggled along bravely in spite of persistent annoyance from their former landlord hoping for certain eventualities the peculiar situation of the shop seemed to promise Here too they were doomed to disappointment The High Road from London to Brighton that ran through Bun Hill was like the British Empire or the British Constitution a thing that had grown to its present importance Unlike any other roads in Europe the British high roads have never been subjected to any organised attempts to grade or straighten them out and to that no doubt their peculiar picturesqueness is to be ascribed The old Bun Hill High Street drops at its end for perhaps eighty or a hundred feet of descent at an angle of one in five turns at right angles to the left runs in a curve for about thirty yards to a brick bridge over the dry ditch that had once been the Otterbourne and then bends sharply to the right again round a dense clump of trees and goes on a simple straightforward peaceful high road There had been one or two horse and van and bicycle accidents in the place before the shop Bert and Grubb took was built and to be frank it was the probability of others that attracted them to it Its possibilities had come to them first with a humorous flavour Here s one of the places where a chap might get a living by keeping hens said Grubb You can t get a living by keeping hens said Bert You d keep the hen and have it spatch cocked said Grubb The motor chaps would pay for it When they really came to take the place they remembered this conversation Hens however were out of the question there was no place for a run unless they had it in the shop It would have been obviously out of place there The shop was much more modern than their former one and had a plate glass front Sooner or later said Bert we shall get a motor car through this That s all right said Grubb Compensation I don t mind when that motor car comes along I don t mind even if it gives me a shock to the system And meanwhile said Bert with great artfulness I m going to buy myself a dog He did He bought three in succession He surprised the people at the Dogs Home in Battersea by demanding a deaf retriever and rejecting every candidate that pricked up its ears I want a good deaf slow moving dog he said A dog that doesn t put himself out for things They displayed inconvenient curiosity they declared a great scarcity of deaf dogs You see they said dogs aren t deaf Mine s got to be said Bert I ve HAD dogs that aren t deaf All I want It s like this you see I sell gramophones Naturally I got to make em talk and tootle a bit to show em orf Well a dog that isn t deaf doesn t like it gets excited smells round barks growls That upsets the customer See Then a dog that has his hearing fancies things Makes burglars out of passing tramps Wants to fight every motor that makes a whizz All very well if you want livening up but our place is lively enough I don t want a dog of that sort I want a quiet dog In the end he got three in succession but none of them turned out well The first strayed off into the infinite heeding no appeals the second was killed in the night by a fruit motor waggon which fled before Grubb could get down the third got itself entangled in the front wheel of a passing cyclist who came through the plate glass and proved to be an actor out of work and an undischarged bankrupt He demanded compensation for some fancied injury would hear nothing of the valuable dog he had killed or the window he had broken obliged Grubb by sheer physical obduracy to straighten his buckled front wheel and pestered the struggling firm with a series of inhumanly worded solicitor s letters Grubb answered them stingingly and put himself Bert thought in the wrong Affairs got more and more exasperating and strained under these pressures The window was boarded up and an unpleasant altercation about their delay in repairing it with the new landlord a Bun Hill butcher and a loud bellowing unreasonable person at that served to remind them of their unsettled troubles with the old Things were at this pitch when Bert bethought himself of creating a sort of debenture capital in the business for the benefit of Tom But as I have said Tom had no enterprise in his composition His idea of investment was the stocking he bribed his brother not to keep the offer open And then ill luck made its last lunge at their crumbling business and brought it to the ground two It is a poor heart that never rejoices and Whitsuntide had an air of coming as an agreeable break in the business complications of Grubb Smallways Encouraged by the practical outcome of Bert s negotiations with his brother and by the fact that half the hiring stock was out from Saturday to Monday they decided to ignore the residuum of hiring trade on Sunday and devote that day to much needed relaxation and refreshment to have in fact an unstinted good time a beano on Whit Sunday and return invigorated to grapple with their difficulties and the Bank Holiday repairs on the Monday No good thing was ever done by exhausted and dispirited men It happened that they had made the acquaintance of two young ladies in employment in Clapham Miss Flossie Bright and Miss Edna Bunthorne and it was resolved therefore to make a cheerful little cyclist party of four into the heart of Kent and to picnic and spend an indolent afternoon and evening among the trees and bracken between Ashford and Maidstone Miss Bright could ride a bicycle and a machine was found for her not among the hiring stock but specially in the sample held for sale Miss Bunthorne whom Bert particularly affected could not ride and so with some difficulty he hired a basket work trailer from the big business of Wray s in the Clapham Road To see our young men brightly dressed and cigarettes alight wheeling off to the rendezvous Grubb guiding the lady s machine beside him with one skilful hand and Bert teuf teuffing steadily was to realise how pluck may triumph even over insolvency Their landlord the butcher said Gurr as they passed and shouted Go it in a loud savage tone to their receding backs Much they cared The weather was fine and though they were on their way southward before nine o clock there was already a great multitude of holiday people abroad upon the roads There were quantities of young men and women on bicycles and motor bicycles and a majority of gyroscopic motor cars running bicycle fashion on two wheels mingled with old fashioned four wheeled traffic Bank Holiday times always bring out old stored away vehicles and odd people one saw tricars and electric broughams and dilapidated old racing motors with huge pneumatic tyres Once our holiday makers saw a horse and cart and once a youth riding a black horse amidst the badinage of the passersby And there were several navigable gas air ships not to mention balloons in the air It was all immensely interesting and refreshing after the dark anxieties of the shop Edna wore a brown straw hat with poppies that suited her admirably and sat in the trailer like a queen and the eight year old motor bicycle ran like a thing of yesterday Little it seemed to matter to mister Bert Smallways that a newspaper placard proclaimed GERMANY DENOUNCES THE MONROE DOCTRINE AMBIGUOUS ATTITUDE OF JAPAN WHAT WILL BRITAIN DO IS IT WAR This sort of thing was alvays going on and on holidays one disregarded it as a matter of course Week davs in the slack time after the midday meal then perhaps one might worry about the Empire and international politics but not on a sunny Sunday with a pretty girl trailing behind one and envious cyclists trying to race you Nor did our young people attach any great importance to the flitting suggestions of military activity they glimpsed ever and again Near Maidstone they came on a string of eleven motor guns of peculiar construction halted by the roadside with a number of businesslike engineers grouped about them watching through field glasses some sort of entrenchment that was going on near the crest of the downs It signified nothing to Bert What s up said Edna Oh manoeuvres said Bert Oh I thought they did them at Easter said Edna and troubled no more The last great British war the Boer war was over and forgotten and the public had lost the fashion of expert military criticism Our four young people picnicked cheerfully and were happy in the manner of a happiness that was an ancient mode in Nineveh Eyes were bright Grubb was funny and almost witty and Bert achieved epigrams the hedges were full of honeysuckle and dog roses in the woods the distant toot toot toot of the traffic on the dust hazy high road might have been no more than the horns of elf land They laughed and gossiped and picked flowers and made love and talked and the girls smoked cigarettes Also they scuffled playfully Among other things they talked aeronautics and how thev would come for a picnic together in Bert s flying machine before ten years were out The world seemed full of amusing possibilities that afternoon They wondered what their great grandparents would have thought of aeronautics In the evening about seven the party turned homeward expecting no disaster and it was only on the crest of the downs between Wrotham and Kingsdown that disaster came They had come up the hill in the twilight Bert was anxious to get as far as possible before he lit or attempted to light for the issue was a doubtful one his lamps and they had scorched past a number of cyclists and by a four wheeled motor car of the old style lamed by a deflated tyre Some dust had penetrated Bert s horn and the result was a curious amusing wheezing sound had got into his honk honk For the sake of merriment and glory he was making this sound as much as possible and Edna was in fits of laughter in the trailer They made a sort of rushing cheerfulness along the road that affected their fellow travellers variously according to their temperaments She did notice a good lot of bluish evil smelling smoke coming from about the bearings between his feet but she thought this was one of the natural concomitants of motor traction and troubled no more about it until abruptly it burst into a little yellow tipped flame Bert she screamed But Bert had put on the brakes with such suddenness that she found herself involved with his leg as he dismounted She got to the side of the road and hastily readjusted her hat which had suffered Gaw said Bert He stood for some fatal seconds watching the petrol drip and catch and the flame which was now beginning to smell of enamel as well as oil spread and grew His chief idea was the sorrowful one that he had not sold the machine second hand a year ago and that he ought to have done so a good idea in its way but not immediately helpful He turned upon Edna sharply Get a lot of wet sand he said Then he wheeled the machine a little towards the side of the roadway and laid it down and looked about for a supply of wet sand The flames received this as a helpful attention and made the most of it They seemed to brighten and the twilight to deepen about them The road was a flinty road in the chalk country and ill provided with sand Edna accosted a short fat cyclist We want wet sand she said and added our motor s on fire The short fat cyclist stared blankly for a moment then with a helpful cry began to scrabble in the road grit Whereupon Bert and Edna also scrabbled in the road grit Other cyclists arrived dismounted and stood about and their flame lit faces expressed satisfaction interest curiosity Wet sand said the short fat man scrabbling terribly wet sand One joined him They threw hard earned handfuls of road grit upon the flames which accepted them with enthusiasm Grubb arrived riding hard He was shouting something He sprang off and threw his bicycle into the hedge Don t throw water on it he said don t throw water on it He displayed commanding presence of mind He became captain of the occasion Others were glad to repeat the things he said and imitate his actions Don t throw water on it they cried Also there was no water Beat it out you fools he said He seized a rug from the trailer it was an Austrian blanket and Bert s winter coverlet and began to beat at the burning petrol For a wonderful minute he seemed to succeed But he scattered burning pools of petrol on the road and others fired by his enthusiasm imitated his action Bert caught up a trailer cushion and began to beat there was another cushion and a table cloth and these also were seized A young hero pulled off his jacket and joined the beating For a moment there was less talking than hard breathing and a tremendous flapping Flossie arriving on the outskirts of the crowd cried Oh my God and burst loudly into tears Help she said and Fire The lame motor car arrived and stopped in consternation A tall goggled grey haired man who was driving inquired with an Oxford intonation and a clear careful enunciation Can WE help at all It became manifest that the rug the table cloth the cushions the jacket were getting smeared with petrol and burning The soul seemed to go out of the cushion Bert was swaying and the air was full of feathers like a snowstorm in the still twilight Bert had got very dusty and sweaty and strenuous It seemed to him his weapon had been wrested from him at the moment of victory The fire lay like a dying thing close to the ground and wicked it gave a leap of anguish at every whack of the beaters But now Grubb had gone off to stamp out the burning blanket the others were lacking just at the moment of victory One had dropped the cushion and was running to the motor car ERE cried Bert keep on He flung the deflated burning rags of cushion aside whipped off his jacket and sprang at the flames with a shout He stamped into the ruin until flames ran up his boots Edna saw him a red lit hero and thought it was good to be a man A bystander was hit by a hot halfpenny flying out of the air Then Bert thought of the papers in his pockets and staggered back trying to extinguish his burning jacket checked repulsed dismayed Edna was struck by the benevolent appearance of an elderly spectator in a silk hat and Sabbatical garments Oh she cried to him Help this young man How can you stand and see it A cry of The tarpaulin arose An earnest looking man in a very light grey cycling suit had suddenly appeared at the side of the lame motor car and addressed the owner Have you a tarpaulin he said Yes said the gentlemanly man Yes We ve got a tarpaulin That s it said the earnest looking man suddenly shouting Let s have it quick The gentlemanly man with feeble and deprecatory gestures and in the manner of a hypnotised person produced an excellent large tarpaulin Here cried the earnest looking man to Grubb Ketch holt Then everybody realised that a new method was to be tried A number of willing hands seized upon the Oxford gentleman s tarpaulin The others stood away with approving noises The tarpaulin was held over the burning bicycle like a canopy and then smothered down upon it We ought to have done this before panted Grubb There was a moment of triumph The flames vanished Every one who could contrive to do so touched the edge of the tarpaulin Bert held down a corner with two hands and a foot The tarpaulin bulged up in the centre seemed to be suppressing triumphant exultation Then its self approval became too much for it it burst into a bright red smile in the centre It was exactly like the opening of a mouth It laughed with a gust of flames They were reflected redly in the observant goggles of the gentleman who owned the tarpaulin Everybody recoiled Save the trailer cried some one and that was the last round in the battle But the trailer could not be detached its wicker work had caught and it was the last thing to burn A sort of hush fell upon the gathering The petrol burnt low the wicker work trailer banged and crackled The crowd divided itself into an outer circle of critics advisers and secondary characters who had played undistinguished parts or no parts at all in the affair and a central group of heated and distressed principals A young man with an inquiring mind and a considerable knowledge of motor bicycles fixed on to Grubb and wanted to argue that the thing could not have happened Grubb wass short and inattentive with him and the young man withdrew to the back of the crowd and there told the benevolent old gentleman in the silk hat that people who went out with machines they didn t understand had only themselves to blame if things went wrong The old gentleman let him talk for some time and then remarked in a tone of rapturous enjoyment Stone deaf and added Nasty things A rosy faced man in a straw hat claimed attention I DID save the front wheel he said you d have had that tyre catch too if I hadn t kept turning it round It became manifest that this was so The front wheel had retained its tyre was intact was still rotating slowly among the blackened and twisted ruins of the rest of the machine It had something of that air of conscious virtue of unimpeachable respectability that distinguishes a rent collector in a low neighbourhood That wheel s worth a pound said the rosy faced man making a song of it I kep turning it round Newcomers kept arriving from the south with the question What s up until it got on Grubb s nerves Londonward the crowd was constantly losing people they would mount their various wheels with the satisfied manner of spectators who have had the best Their voices would recede into the twilight one would hear a laugh at the memory of this particularly salient incident or that I m afraid said the gentleman of the motor car my tarpaulin s a bit done for Grubb admitted that the owner was the best judge of that Nothin else I can do for you said the gentleman of the motor car it may be with a suspicion of irony Bert was roused to action Look here he said There s my young lady If she ain t ome by ten they lock her out See Well all my money was in my jacket pocket and it s all mixed up with the burnt stuff and that s too ot to touch Is Clapham out of your way All in the day s work said the gentleman with the motor car and turned to Edna Very pleased indeed he said if you ll come with us We re late for dinner as it is so it won t make much difference for us to go home by way of Clapham We ve got to get to Surbiton anyhow I m afraid you ll find us a little slow But what s Bert going to do said Edna I don t know that we can accommodate Bert said the motor car gentleman though we re tremendously anxious to oblige You couldn t take the whole lot said Bert waving his hand at the deboshed and blackened ruins on the ground I m awfully afraid I can t said the Oxford man Awfully sorry you know Then I ll have to stick ere for a bit said Bert I got to see the thing through You go on Edna Don t like leavin you Bert You can t elp it Edna The last Edna saw of Bert was his figure in charred and blackened shirtsleeves standing in the dusk He was musing deeply by the mixed ironwork and ashes of his vanished motor bicycle a melancholy figure His retinue of spectators had shrunk now to half a dozen figures Flossie and Grubb were preparing to follow her desertion Cheer up old Bert cried Edna with artificial cheerfulness So long So long Edna said Bert See you to morrer See you to morrer said Bert though he was destined as a matter of fact to see much of the habitable globe before he saw her again Bert began to light matches from a borrowed boxful and search for a half crown that still eluded him among the charred remains His face was grave and melancholy I WISH that adn t appened said Flossie riding on with Grubb And at last Bert was left almost alone a sad blackened Promethean figure cursed by the gift of fire He had entertained vague ideas of hiring a cart of achieving miraculous repairs of still snatching some residual value from his one chief possession Now in the darkening night he perceived the vanity of such intentions Truth came to him bleakly and laid her chill conviction upon him He took hold of the handle bar stood the thing up tried to push it forward The tyreless hind wheel was jammed hopelessly even as he feared For a minute or so he stood upholding his machine a motionless despair Then with a great effort he thrust the ruins from him into the ditch kicked at it once regarded it for a moment and turned his face resolutely Londonward He did not once look back That s the end of THAT game said Bert No more teuf teuf teuf for Bert Smallways for a year or two Good bye olidays Oh I ought to ave sold the blasted thing when I had a chance three years ago three The next morning found the firm of Grubb Smallways in a state of profound despondency It seemed a small matter to them that the newspaper and cigarette shop opposite displayed such placards as this REPORTED AMERICAN ULTIMATUM BRITAIN MUST FIGHT OUR INFATUATED WAR OFFICE STILL REFUSES TO LISTEN TO mister BUTTERIDGE GREAT MONO RAIL DISASTER AT TIMBUCTOO or this WAR A QUESTION OF HOURS NEW YORK CALM EXCITEMENT IN BERLIN or again WASHINGTON STILL SILENT WHAT WILL PARIS DO THE PANIC ON THE BOURSE THE KING S GARDEN PARTY TO THE MASKED TWAREGS mister BUTTERIDGE TAKES AN OFFER LATEST BETTING FROM TEHERAN or this WILL AMERICA FIGHT ANTI GERMAN RIOT IN BAGDAD THE MUNICIPAL SCANDALS AT DAMASCUS mister BUTTERIDGE S INVENTION FOR AMERICA Bert stared at these over the card of pump clips in the pane in the door with unseeing eyes He wore a blackened flannel shirt and the jacketless ruins of the holiday suit of yesterday The boarded up shop was dark and depressing beyond words the few scandalous hiring machines had never looked so hopelessly disreputable He thought of their fellows who were out and of the approaching disputations of the afternoon He thought of their new landlord and of their old landlord and of bills and claims Life presented itself for the first time as a hopeless fight against fate Grubb o man he said distilling the quintessence I m fair sick of this shop So m I said Grubb I m out of conceit with it I don t seem to care ever to speak to a customer again There s that trailer said Grubb after a pause Blow the trailer said Bert Anyhow I didn t leave a deposit on it I didn t do that Still He turned round on his friend Look ere he said we aren t gettin on here We been losing money hand over fist We got things tied up in fifty knots What can we do said Grubb Clear out Sell what we can for what it will fetch and quit See It s no good anging on to a losing concern No sort of good Jest foolishness That s all right said Grubb that s all right but it ain t your capital been sunk in it No need for us to sink after our capital said Bert ignoring the point I m not going to be held responsible for that trailer anyhow That ain t my affair Nobody arst you to make it your affair If you like to stick on here well and good I m quitting I ll see Bank Holiday through and then I m O R P H See Leavin me Leavin you If you must be left Grubb looked round the shop It certainly had become distasteful Once upon a time it had been bright with hope and new beginnings and stock and the prospect of credit Now now it was failure and dust Very likely the landlord would be round presently to go on with the row about the window Where d you think of going Bert Grubb asked Bert turned round and regarded him I thought it out as I was walking ome and in bed I couldn t sleep a wink What did you think out Plans What plans Oh You re for stickin here Not if anything better was to offer It s only an ideer said Bert You made the girls laugh yestiday that song you sang Seems a long time ago now said Grubb And old Edna nearly cried over that bit of mine She got a fly in her eye said Grubb I saw it But what s this got to do with your plan No end said Bert Ow Don t you see Not singing in the streets Streets No fear But ow about the Tour of the Waterin Places of England Grubb Singing Young men of family doing it for a lark You ain t got a bad voice you know and mine s all right I never see a chap singing on the beach yet that I couldn t ave sung into a cocked hat And we both know how to put on the toff a bit Eh Well that s my ideer Me and you Grubb with a refined song and a breakdown Like we was doing for foolery yestiday That was what put it into my ead Easy make up a programme easy Six choice items and one or two for encores and patter I m all right for the patter anyhow Grubb remained regarding his darkened and disheartening shop he thought of his former landlord and his present landlord and of the general disgustingness of business in an age which re echoes to The Bitter Cry of the Middle Class and then it seemed to him that afar off he heard the twankle twankle of a banjo and the voice of a stranded siren singing He had a sense of hot sunshine upon sand of the children of at least transiently opulent holiday makers in a circle round about him of the whisper They are really gentlemen and then dollop dollop came the coppers in the hat Sometimes even silver It was all income no outgoings no bills I m on Bert he said Right O said Bert and Now we shan t be long We needn t start without capital neither said Grubb If we take the best of these machines up to the Bicycle Mart in Finsbury we d raise six or seven pounds on em We could easy do that to morrow before anybody much was about Nice to think of old Suet and Bones coming round to make his usual row with us and finding a card up Closed for Repairs We ll do that said Grubb with zest we ll do that And we ll put up another notice and jest arst all inquirers to go round to im and inquire See Then they ll know all about us Before the day was out the whole enterprise was planned They decided at first that they would call themselves the Naval mister O s a plagiarism and not perhaps a very good one from the title of the well known troupe of Scarlet mister E s and Bert rather clung to the idea of a uniform of bright blue serge with a lot of gold lace and cord and ornamentation rather like a naval officer s but more so But that had to be abandoned as impracticable it would have taken too much time and money to prepare They perceived they must wear some cheaper and more readily prepared costume and Grubb fell back on white dominoes They entertained the notion for a time of selecting the two worst machines from the hiring stock painting them over with crimson enamel paint replacing the bells by the loudest sort of motor horn and doing a ride about to begin and end the entertainment They doubted the advisability of this step There s people in the world said Bert who wouldn t recognise us who d know them bicycles again like a shot and we don t want to go on with no old stories We want a fresh start I do said Grubb badly We want to forget things and cut all these rotten old worries They ain t doin us good Nevertheless they decided to take the risk of these bicycles and they decided their costumes should be brown stockings and sandals and cheap unbleached sheets with a hole cut in the middle and wigs and beards of tow The rest their normal selves The Desert Dervishes they would call themselves and their chief songs would be those popular ditties In my Trailer and What Price Hair pins Now They decided to begin with small seaside places and gradually as they gained confidence attack larger centres To begin with they selected Littlestone in Kent chiefly because of its unassuming name So they planned and it seemed a small and unimportant thing to them that as they clattered the governments of half the world and more were drifting into war About midday they became aware of the first of the evening paper placards shouting to them across the street THE WAR CLOUD DARKENS Nothing else but that Always rottin about war now said Bert They ll get it in the neck in real earnest one of these days if they ain t precious careful four So you will understand the sudden apparition that surprised rather than delighted the quiet informality of Dymchurch sands Dymchurch was one of the last places on the coast of England to be reached by the mono rail and so its spacious sands were still at the time of this story the secret and delight of quite a limited number of people They went there to flee vulgarity and extravagances and to bathe and sit and talk and play with their children in peace and the Desert Dervishes did not please them at all The two white figures on scarlet wheels came upon them out of the infinite along the sands from Littlestone grew nearer and larger and more audible honk honking and emitting weird cries and generally threatening liveliness of the most aggressive type Good heavens said Dymchurch what s this Then our young men according to a preconcerted plan wheeled round from file to line dismounted and stood it attention Ladies and gentlemen they said we beg to present ourselves the Desert Dervishes They bowed profoundly The few scattered groups upon the beach regarded them with horror for the most part but some of the children and young people were interested and drew nearer There ain t a bob on the beach said Grubb in an undertone and the Desert Dervishes plied their bicycles with comic business that got a laugh from one very unsophisticated little boy Then they took a deep breath and struck into the cheerful strain of What Price Hair pins Now Grubb sang the song Bert did his best to make the chorus a rousing one and it the end of each verse they danced certain steps skirts in hand that they had carefully rehearsed Ting a ling a ting a ling a ting a ling a tang What Price Hair pins Now So they chanted and danced their steps in the sunshine on Dymchurch beach and the children drew near these foolish young men marvelling that they should behave in this way and the older people looked cold and unfriendly All round the coasts of Europe that morning banjos were ringing voices were bawling and singing children were playing in the sun pleasure boats went to and fro the common abundant life of the time unsuspicious of all dangers that gathered darkly against it flowed on its cheerful aimless way In the cities men fussed about their businesses and engagements The newspaper placards that had cried wolf so often cried wolf now in vain five Now as Bert and Grubb bawled their chorus for the third time they became aware of a very big golden brown balloon low in the sky to the north west and coming rapidly towards them Jest as we re gettin hold of em muttered Grubb up comes a counter attraction Go it Bert Ting a ling a ting a ling a ting a ling a tang What Price Hair pins Now The balloon rose and fell went out of sight landed thank goodness said Grubb re appeared with a leap ENG said Grubb Step it Bert or they ll see it They finished their dance and then stood frankly staring There s something wrong with that balloon said Bert Everybody now was looking at the balloon drawing rapidly nearer before a brisk north westerly breeze The song and dance were a dead frost Nobody thought any more about it Even Bert and Grubb forgot it and ignored the next item on the programme altogether The balloon was bumping as though its occupants were trying to land it would approach sinking slowly touch the ground and instantly jump fifty feet or so in the air and immediately begin to fall again Its car touched a clump of trees and the black figure that had been struggling in the ropes fell back or jumped back into the car In another moment it was quite close It seemed a huge affair as big as a house and it floated down swiftly towards the sands a long rope trailed behind it and enormous shouts came from the man in the car He seemed to be taking off his clothes then his head came over the side of the car Catch hold of the rope they heard quite plain Salvage Bert cried Grubb and started to head off the rope Bert followed him and collided without upsetting with a fisherman bent upon a similar errand A woman carrying a baby in her arms two small boys with toy spades and a stout gentleman in flannels all got to the trailing rope at about the same time and began to dance over it in their attempts to secure it Bert came up to this wriggling elusive serpent and got his foot on it went down on all fours and achieved a grip In half a dozen seconds the whole diffused population of the beach had as it were crystallised on the rope and was pulling against the balloon under the vehement and stimulating directions of the man in the car Pull I tell you said the man in the car pull For a second or so the balloon obeyed its momentum and the wind and tugged its human anchor seaward It dropped touched the water and made a flat silvery splash and recoiled as one s finger recoils when one touches anything hot Pull her in said the man in the car SHE S FAINTED He occupied himself with some unseen object while the people on the rope pulled him in Bert was nearest the balloon and much excited and interested He kept stumbling over the tail of the Dervish costume in his zeal He had never imagined before what a big light wallowing thing a balloon was The car was of brown coarse wicker work and comparatively small The rope he tugged at was fastened to a stout looking ring four or five feet above the car At each tug he drew in a yard or so of rope and the waggling wicker work was drawn so much nearer Out of the car came wrathful bellowings Fainted she has and then It s her heart broken with all she s had to go through The balloon ceased to struggle and sank downward Bert dropped the rope and ran forward to catch it in a new place In another moment he had his hand on the car Lay hold of it said the man in the car and his face appeared close to Bert s a strangely familiar face fierce eyebrows a flattish nose a huge black moustache He had discarded coat and waistcoat perhaps with some idea of presently having to swim for his life and his black hair was extraordinarily disordered Will all you people get hold round the car he said There s a lady here fainted or got failure of the heart Heaven alone knows which My name is Butteridge Butteridge my name is in a balloon Now please all on to the edge This is the last time I trust myself to one of these paleolithic contrivances The ripping cord failed and the valve wouldn t act If ever I meet the scoundrel who ought to have seen He stuck his head out between the ropes abruptly and said in a note of earnest expostulation Get some brandy some neat brandy Some one went up the beach for it In the car sprawling upon a sort of bed bench in an attitude of elaborate self abandonment was a large blond lady wearing a fur coat and a big floriferous hat Her head lolled back against the padded corner of the car and her eyes were shut and her mouth open Me dear said mister Butteridge in a common loud voice we re safe She gave no sign Me dear said mister Butteridge in a greatly intensified loud voice we re safe She was still quite impassive Then mister Butteridge showed the fiery core of his soul If she is dead he said slowly lifting a fist towards the balloon above him and speaking in an immense tremulous bellow if she is dead I will r r rend the heavens like a garment I must get her out he cried his nostrils dilated with emotion I must get her out I cannot have her die in a wicker work basket nine feet square she who was made for kings palaces Keep holt of this car Is there a strong man among ye to take her if I hand her out He swept the lady together by a powerful movement of his arms and lifted her Keep the car from jumping he said to those who clustered about him Keep your weight on it She is no light woman and when she is out of it it will be relieved Bert leapt lightly into a sitting position on the edge of the car The others took a firmer grip upon the ropes and ring Are you ready said mister Butteridge He stood upon the bed bench and lifted the lady carefully Then he sat down on the wicker edge opposite to Bert and put one leg over to dangle outside A rope or so seemed to incommode him Will some one assist me he said If they would take this lady It was just at this moment with mister Butteridge and the lady balanced finely on the basket brim that she came to She came to suddenly and violently with a loud heart rending cry of Alfred Save me And she waved her arms searchingly and then clasped mister Butteridge about It seemed to Bert that the car swayed for a moment and then buck jumped and kicked him Also he saw the boots of the lady and the right leg of the gentleman describing arcs through the air preparatory to vanishing over the side of the car His impressions were complex but they also comprehended the fact that he had lost his balance and was going to stand on his head inside this creaking basket He spread out clutching arms He did stand on his head more or less his tow beard came off and got in his mouth and his cheek slid along against padding His nose buried itself in a bag of sand The car gave a violent lurch and became still Confound it he said He had an impression he must be stunned because of a surging in his ears and because all the voices of the people about him had become small and remote They were shouting like elves inside a hill He found it a little difficult to get on his feet His limbs were mixed up with the garments mister Butteridge had discarded when that gentleman had thought he must needs plunge into the sea Bert bawled out half angry half rueful You might have said you were going to tip the basket Then he stood up and clutched the ropes of the car convulsively Below him far below him shining blue were the waters of the English Channel Far off a little thing in the sunshine and rushing down as if some one was bending it hollow was the beach and the irregular cluster of houses that constitutes Dymchurch He could see the little crowd of people he had so abruptly left Grubb in the white wrapper of a Desert Dervish was running along the edge of the sea mister Butteridge was knee deep in the water bawling immensely The lady was sitting up with her floriferous hat in her lap shockingly neglected The beach east and west was dotted with little people they seemed all heads and feet looking up And the balloon released from the twenty five stone or so of mister Butteridge and his lady was rushing up into the sky at the pace of a racing motor car My crikey said Bert here s a go He looked down with a pinched face at the receding beach and reflected that he wasn t giddy then he made a superficial survey of the cords and ropes about him with a vague idea of doing something I m not going to mess about with the thing he said at last and sat down upon the mattress I m not going to touch it I wonder what one ought to do Soon he got up again and stared for a long time it the sinking world below at white cliffs to the east and flattening marsh to the left at a minute wide prospect of weald and downland at dim towns and harbours and rivers and ribbon like roads at ships and ships decks and foreshortened funnels upon the ever widening sea and at the great mono rail bridge that straddled the Channel from Folkestone to Boulogne until at last first little wisps and then a veil of filmy cloud hid the prospect from his eyes He wasn t at all giddy nor very much frightened only in a state of enormous consternation CHAPTER III THE BALLOON I Bert Smallways was a vulgar little creature the sort of pert limited soul that the old civilisation of the early twentieth century produced by the million in every country of the world He had lived all his life in narrow streets and between mean houses he could not look over and in a narrow circle of ideas from which there was no escape He thought the whole duty of man was to be smarter than his fellows get his hands as he put it on the dibs and have a good time He was in fact the sort of man who had made England and America what they were The luck had been against him so far but that was by the way He was a mere aggressive and acquisitive individual with no sense of the State no habitual loyalty no devotion no code of honour no code even of courage Now by a curious accident he found himself lifted out of his marvellous modern world for a time out of all the rush and confused appeals of it and floating like a thing dead and disembodied between sea and sky It was as if Heaven was experimenting with him had picked him out as a sample from the English millions to look at him more nearly and to see what was happening to the soul of man But what Heaven made of him in that case I cannot profess to imagine for I have long since abandoned all theories about the ideals and satisfactions of Heaven To be alone in a balloon at a height of fourteen or fifteen thousand feet and to that height Bert Smallways presently rose is like nothing else in human experience It is one of the supreme things possible to man No flying machine can ever better it It is to pass extraordinarily out of human things It is to be still and alone to an unprecedented degree It is solitude without the suggestion of intervention it is calm without a single irrelevant murmur It is to see the sky No sound reaches one of all the roar and jar of humanity the air is clear and sweet beyond the thought of defilement No bird no insect comes so high No wind blows ever in a balloon no breeze rustles for it moves with the wind and is itself a part of the atmosphere Once started it does not rock nor sway you cannot feel whether it rises or falls Bert felt acutely cold but he wasn t mountain sick he put on the coat and overcoat and gloves Butteridge had discarded put them over the Desert Dervish sheet that covered his cheap best suit and sat very still for a long time overawed by the new found quiet of the world Above him was the light translucent billowing globe of shining brown oiled silk and the blazing sunlight and the great deep blue dome of the sky Below far below was a torn floor of sunlit cloud slashed by enormous rents through which he saw the sea If you had been watching him from below you would have seen his head a motionless little black knob sticking out from the car first of all for a long time on one side and then vanishing to reappear after a time at some other point He wasn t in the least degree uncomfortable nor afraid He did think that as this uncontrollable thing had thus rushed up the sky with him it might presently rush down again but this consideration did not trouble him very much Essentially his state was wonder There is no fear nor trouble in balloons until they descend Gollys he said at last feeling a need for talking it s better than a motor bike It s all right I suppose they re telegraphing about about me The second hour found him examining the equipment of the car with great particularity Above him was the throat of the balloon bunched and tied together but with an open lumen through which Bert could peer up into a vast empty quiet interior and out of which descended two fine cords of unknown import one white one crimson to pockets below the ring The netting about the balloon ended in cords attached to the ring a big steel bound hoop to which the car was slung by ropes From it depended the trail rope and grapnel and over the sides of the car were a number of canvas bags that Bert decided must be ballast to chuck down if the balloon fell Not much falling just yet said Bert There were an aneroid and another box shaped instrument hanging from the ring The latter had an ivory plate bearing statoscope and other words in French and a little indicator quivered and waggled between Montee and Descente That s all right said Bert That tells if you re going up or down On the crimson padded seat of the balloon there lay a couple of rugs and a Kodak and in opposite corners of the bottom of the car were an empty champagne bottle and a glass Refreshments said Bert meditatively tilting the empty bottle Then he had a brilliant idea The two padded bed like seats each with blankets and mattress he perceived were boxes and within he found mister Butteridge s conception of an adequate equipment for a balloon ascent a hamper which included a game pie a Roman pie a cold fowl tomatoes lettuce ham sandwiches shrimp sandwiches a large cake knives and forks and paper plates self heating tins of coffee and cocoa bread butter and marmalade several carefully packed bottles of champagne bottles of Perrier water and a big jar of water for washing a portfolio maps and a compass a rucksack containing a number of conveniences including curling tongs and hair pins a cap with ear flaps and so forth A ome from ome said Bert surveying this provision as he tied the ear flaps under his chin He looked over the side of the car Far below were the shining clouds They had thickened so that the whole world was hidden Southward they were piled in great snowy masses so that he was half disposed to think them mountains northward and eastward they were in wavelike levels and blindingly sunlit Wonder how long a balloon keeps up he said He imagined he was not moving so insensibly did the monster drift with the air about it No good coming down till we shift a bit he said He consulted the statoscope Still Monty he said Wonder what would happen if you pulled a cord No he decided I ain t going to mess it about Afterwards he did pull both the ripping and the valve cords but as mister Butteridge had already discovered they had fouled a fold of silk in the throat Nothing happened But for that little hitch the ripping cord would have torn the balloon open as though it had been slashed by a sword and hurled mister Smallways to eternity at the rate of some thousand feet a second No go he said giving it a final tug Then he lunched He opened a bottle of champagne which as soon as he cut the wire blew its cork out with incredible violence and for the most part followed it into space Bert however got about a tumblerful Atmospheric pressure said Bert finding a use at last for the elementary physiography of his seventh standard days I ll have to be more careful next time No good wastin drink Then he routed about for matches to utilise mister Butteridge s cigars but here again luck was on his side and he couldn t find any wherewith to set light to the gas above him Or else he would have dropped in a flare a splendid but transitory pyrotechnic display Eng old Grubb said Bert slapping unproductive pockets E didn t ought to ave kep my box E s always sneaking matches He reposed for a time Then he got up paddled about rearranged the ballast bags on the floor watched the clouds for a time and turned over the maps on the locker Bert liked maps and he spent some time in trying to find one of France or the Channel but they were all British ordnance maps of English counties That set him thinking about languages and trying to recall his seventh standard French Je suis Anglais C est une meprise Je suis arrive par accident ici he decided upon as convenient phrases Then it occurred to him that he would entertain himself by reading mister Butteridge s letters and examining his pocket book and in this manner he whiled away the afternoon two He sat upon the padded locker wrapped about very carefully for the air though calm was exhilaratingly cold and clear He was wearing first a modest suit of blue serge and all the unpretending underwear of a suburban young man of fashion with sandal like cycling shoes and brown stockings drawn over his trouser ends then the perforated sheet proper to a Desert Dervish then the coat and waistcoat and big fur trimmed overcoat of mister Butteridge then a lady s large fur cloak and round his knees a blanket Over his head was a tow wig surmounted by a large cap of mister Butteridge s with the flaps down over his ears And some fur sleeping boots of mister Butteridge s warmed his feet The car of the balloon was small and neat some bags of ballast the untidiest of its contents and he had found a light folding table and put it at his elbow and on that was a glass with champagne And about him above and below was space such a clear emptiness and silence of space as only the aeronaut can experience He did not know where he might be drifting or what might happen next He accepted this state of affairs with a serenity creditable to the Smallways courage which one might reasonably have expected to be of a more degenerate and contemptible quality altogether His impression was that he was bound to come down somewhere and that then if he wasn t smashed some one some society perhaps would probably pack him and the balloon back to England If not he would ask very firmly for the British Consul Le consuelo Britannique he decided this would be Apportez moi a le consuelo Britannique s il vous plait he would say for he was by no means ignorant of French In the meanwhile he found the intimate aspects of mister Butteridge an interesting study There were letters of an entirely private character addressed to mister Butteridge and among others several love letters of a devouring sort in a large feminine hand These are no business of ours and one remarks with regret that Bert read them When he had read them he remarked Gollys in an awestricken tone and then after a long interval I wonder if that was her Lord He mused for a time He resumed his exploration of the Butteridge interior It included a number of press cuttings of interviews and also several letters in German then some in the same German handwriting but in English Hul LO said Bert One of the latter the first he took began with an apology to Butteridge for not writing to him in English before and for the inconvenience and delay that had been caused him by that and went on to matter that Bert found exciting in the highest degree We can understand entirely the difficulties of your position and that you shall possibly be watched at the present juncture But sir we do not believe that any serious obstacles will be put in your way if you wished to endeavour to leave the country and come to us with your plans by the customary routes either via Dover Ostend Boulogne or Dieppe We find it difficult to think you are right in supposing yourself to be in danger of murder for your invaluable invention Funny said Bert and meditated Then he went through the other letters They seem to want him to come said Bert but they don t seem hurting themselves to get im Or else they re shamming don t care to get his prices down They don t quite seem to be the gov ment he reflected after an interval It s more like some firm s paper All this printed stuff at the top Drachenflieger Drachenballons Ballonstoffe Kugelballons Greek to me But he was trying to sell his blessed secret abroad That s all right No Greek about that Gollys Here IS the secret He tumbled off the seat opened the locker and had the portfolio open before him on the folding table It was full of drawings done in the peculiar flat style and conventional colours engineers adopt And in addition there were some rather under exposed photographs obviously done by an amateur at close quarters of the actual machine s mutterings had made in its shed near the Crystal Palace Bert found he was trembling Lord he said here am I and the whole blessed secret of flying lost up here on the roof of everywhere Let s see He fell to studying the drawings and comparing them with the photographs They puzzled him Half of them seemed to be missing He tried to imagine how they fitted together and found the effort too great for his mind It s tryin said Bert I wish I d been brought up to the engineering If I could only make it out He went to the side of the car and remained for a time staring with unseeing eyes at a huge cluster of great clouds a cluster of slowly dissolving Monte Rosas sunlit below His attention was arrested by a strange black spot that moved over them It alarmed him It was a black spot moving slowly with him far below following him down there indefatigably over the cloud mountains Why should such a thing follow him What could it be He had an inspiration Uv course he said It was the shadow of the balloon But he still watched it dubiously for a time He returned to the plans on the table He spent a long afternoon between his struggles to understand them and fits of meditation He evolved a remarkable new sentence in French Voici Mossoo Je suis un inventeur Anglais Mon nom est Butteridge Beh oo teh teh eh arr I deh geh eh J avais ici pour vendre le secret de le flying machine Comprenez Vendre pour l argent tout suite l argent en main Comprenez C est le machine a jouer dans l air Comprenez C est le machine a faire l oiseau Comprenez Balancer Oui exactement Battir l oiseau en fait a son propre jeu Je desire de vendre ceci a votre government national Voulez vous me directer la Bit rummy I expect from the point of view of grammar said Bert but they ought to get the hang of it all right But then if they arst me to explain the blessed thing He returned in a worried way to the plans I don t believe it s all here he said He got more and more perplexed up there among the clouds as to what he should do with this wonderful find of his At any moment so far as he knew he might descend among he knew not what foreign people It s the chance of my life he said It became more and more manifest to him that it wasn t Directly I come down they ll telegraph put it in the papers Butteridge ll know of it and come along on my track Butteridge would be a terrible person to be on any one s track Bert thought of the great black moustaches the triangular nose the searching bellow and the glare His afternoon s dream of a marvellous seizure and sale of the great Butteridge secret crumpled up in his mind dissolved and vanished He awoke to sanity again Wouldn t do What s the good of thinking of it He proceeded slowly and reluctantly to replace the Butteridge papers in pockets and portfolio as he had found them He became aware of a splendid golden light upon the balloon above him and of a new warmth in the blue dome of the sky He stood up and beheld the sun a great ball of blinding gold setting upon a tumbled sea of gold edged crimson and purple clouds strange and wonderful beyond imagining Eastward cloud land stretched for ever darkling blue and it seemed to Bert the whole round hemisphere of the world was under his eyes Then far away over the blue he caught sight of three long dark shapes like hurrying fish that drove one after the other as porpoises follow one another in the water They were very fish like indeed with tails It was an unconvincing impression in that light He blinked his eyes stared again and they had vanished For a long time he scrutinised those remote blue levels and saw no more Wonder if I ever saw anything he said and then There ain t such things Down went the sun and down not diving steeply but passing northward as it sank and then suddenly daylight and the expansive warmth of daylight had gone altogether and the index of the statoscope quivered over to Descente three NOW what s going to appen said Bert He found the cold grey cloud wilderness rising towards him with a wide slow steadiness As he sank down among them the clouds ceased to seem the snowclad mountain slopes they had resembled heretofore became unsubstantial confessed an immense silent drift and eddy in their substance For a moment when he was nearly among their twilight masses his descent was checked Then abruptly the sky was hidden the last vestiges of daylight gone and he was falling rapidly in an evening twilight through a whirl of fine snowflakes that streamed past him towards the zenith that drifted in upon the things about him and melted that touched his face with ghostly fingers He shivered His breath came smoking from his lips and everything was instantly bedewed and wet He had an impression of a snowstorm pouring with unexampled and increasing fury UPWARD then he realised that he was falling faster and faster Imperceptibly a sound grew upon his ears The great silence of the world was at an end What was this confused sound He craned his head over the side concerned perplexed First he seemed to see and then not to see Then he saw clearly little edges of foam pursuing each other and a wide waste of weltering waters below him Far away was a pilot boat with a big sail bearing dim black letters and a little pinkish yellow light and it was rolling and pitching rolling and pitching in a gale while he could feel no wind at all Soon the sound of waters was loud and near He was dropping dropping into the sea He became convulsively active Ballast he cried and seized a little sack from the floor and heaved it overboard He did not wait for the effect of that but sent another after it He looked over in time to see a minute white splash in the dim waters below him and then he was back in the snow and clouds again He sent out quite needlessly a third sack of ballast and a fourth and presently had the immense satisfaction of soaring up out of the damp and chill into the clear cold upper air in which the day still lingered Thang God he said with all his heart A few stars now had pierced the blue and in the east there shone brightly a prolate moon four That first downward plunge filled Bert with a haunting sense of boundless waters below It was a summer s night but it seemed to him nevertheless extraordinarily long He had a feeling of insecurity that he fancied quite irrationally the sunrise would dispel Also he was hungry He felt in the dark in the locker put his fingers in the Roman pie and got some sandwiches and he also opened rather successfully a half bottle of champagne That warmed and restored him he grumbled at Grubb about the matches wrapped himself up warmly on the locker and dozed for a time He got up once or twice to make sure that he was still securely high above the sea The first time the moonlit clouds were white and dense and the shadow of the balloon ran athwart them like a dog that followed afterwards they seemed thinner As he lay still staring up at the huge dark balloon above he made a discovery His or rather mister Butteridge s waistcoat rustled as he breathed It was lined with papers But Bert could not see to get them out or examine them much as he wished to do so He was awakened by the crowing of cocks the barking of dogs and a clamour of birds He was driving slowly at a low level over a broad land lit golden by sunrise under a clear sky He stared out upon hedgeless well cultivated fields intersected by roads each lined with cable bearing red poles He had just passed over a compact whitewashed village with a straight church tower and steep red tiled roofs A number of peasants men and women in shiny blouses and lumpish footwear stood regarding him arrested on their way to work He was so low that the end of his rope was trailing He stared out at these people I wonder how you land he thought S pose I OUGHT to land He found himself drifting down towards a mono rail line and hastily flung out two or three handfuls of ballast to clear it Lemme see One might say just Pre nez Wish I knew the French for take hold of the rope I suppose they are French He surveyed the country again Might be Holland Or Luxembourg Or Lorraine s far as I know Wonder what those big affairs over there are Some sort of kiln Prosperous looking country The respectability of the country s appearance awakened answering chords in his nature Make myself a bit ship shape first he said He resolved to rise a little and get rid of his wig which now felt hot on his head and so forth He threw out a bag of ballast and was astonished to find himself careering up through the air very rapidly Blow said mister Smallways I ve over done the ballast trick Wonder when I shall get down again brekfus on board anyhow He removed his cap and wig for the air was warm and an improvident impulse made him cast the latter object overboard The statoscope responded with a vigorous swing to Monte The blessed thing goes up if you only LOOK overboard he remarked and assailed the locker He found among other items several tins of liquid cocoa containing explicit directions for opening that he followed with minute care He pierced the bottom with the key provided in the holes indicated and forthwith the can grew from cold to hotter and hotter until at last he could scarcely touch it and then he opened the can at the other end and there was his cocoa smoking without the use of match or flame of any sort It was an old invention but new to Bert There was also ham and marmalade and bread so that he had a really very tolerable breakfast indeed Then he took off his overcoat for the sunshine was now inclined to be hot and that reminded him of the rustling he had heard in the night He took off the waistcoat and examined it Old Butteridge won t like me unpicking this He hesitated and finally proceeded to unpick it He found the missing drawings of the lateral rotating planes on which the whole stability of the flying machine depended An observant angel would have seen Bert sitting for a long time after this discovery in a state of intense meditation Then at last he rose with an air of inspiration took mister Butteridge s ripped demolished and ransacked waistcoat and hurled it from the balloon whence it fluttered down slowly and eddyingly until at last it came to rest with a contented flop upon the face of German tourist sleeping peacefully beside the Hohenweg near Wildbad Also this sent the balloon higher and so into a position still more convenient for observation by our imaginary angel who would next have seen mister Smallways tear open his own jacket and waistcoat remove his collar open his shirt thrust his hand into his bosom and tear his heart out or at least if not his heart some large bright scarlet object If the observer overcoming a thrill of celestial horror had scrutinised this scarlet object more narrowly one of Bert s most cherished secrets one of his essential weaknesses would have been laid bare It was a red flannel chest protector one of those large quasi hygienic objects that with pills and medicines take the place of beneficial relics and images among the Protestant peoples of Christendom Always Bert wore this thing it was his cherished delusion based on the advice of a shilling fortune teller at Margate that he was weak in the lungs He now proceeded to unbutton his fetish to attack it with a penknife and to thrust the new found plans between the two layers of imitation Saxony flannel of which it was made Then with the help of mister Butteridge s small shaving mirror and his folding canvas basin he readjusted his costume with the gravity of a man who has taken an irrevocable step in life buttoned up his jacket cast the white sheet of the Desert Dervish on one side washed temperately shaved resumed the big cap and the fur overcoat and much refreshed by these exercises surveyed the country below him It was indeed a spectacle of incredible magnificence If perhaps it was not so strange and magnificent as the sunlit cloudland of the previous day it was at any rate infinitely more interesting The air was at its utmost clearness and except to the south and south west there was not a cloud in the sky The country was hilly with occasional fir plantations and bleak upland spaces but also with numerous farms and the hills were deeply intersected by the gorges of several winding rivers interrupted at intervals by the banked up ponds and weirs of electric generating wheels It was dotted with bright looking steep roofed villages and each showed a distinctive and interesting church beside its wireless telegraph steeple here and there were large chateaux and parks and white roads and paths lined with red and white cable posts were extremely conspicuous in the landscape There were walled enclosures like gardens and rickyards and great roofs of barns and many electric dairy centres The uplands were mottled with cattle At places he would see the track of one of the old railroads converted now to mono rails dodging through tunnels and crossing embankments and a rushing hum would mark the passing of a train Everything was extraordinarily clear as well as minute Once or twice he saw guns and soldiers and was reminded of the stir of military preparations he had witnessed on the Bank Holiday in England but there was nothing to tell him that these military preparations were abnormal or to explain an occasional faint irregular firing Of guns that drifted up to him Wish I knew how to get down said Bert ten thousand feet or so above it all and gave himself to much futile tugging at the red and white cords Afterwards he made a sort of inventory of the provisions Life in the high air was giving him an appalling appetite and it seemed to him discreet at this stage to portion out his supply into rations So far as he could see he might pass a week in the air At first all the vast panorama below had been as silent as a painted picture But as the day wore on and the gas diffused slowly from the balloon it sank earthward again details increased men became more visible and he began to hear the whistle and moan of trains and cars sounds of cattle bugles and kettle drums and presently even men s voices And at last his guide rope was trailing again and he found it possible to attempt a landing Once or twice as the rope dragged over cables he found his hair erect with electricity and once he had a slight shock and sparks snapped about the car He took these things among the chances of the voyage He had one idea now very clear in his mind and that was to drop the iron grapnel that hung from the ring From the first this attempt was unfortunate perhaps because the place for descent was ill chosen A balloon should come down in an empty open space and he chose a crowd He made his decision suddenly and without proper reflection As he trailed Bert saw ahead of him one of the most attractive little towns in the world a cluster of steep gables surmounted by a high church tower and diversified with trees walled and with a fine large gateway opening out upon a tree lined high road All the wires and cables of the countryside converged upon it like guests to entertainment It had a most home like and comfortable quality and it was made gayer by abundant flags Along the road a quantity of peasant folk in big pair wheeled carts and afoot were coming and going besides an occasional mono rail car and at the car junction under the trees outside the town was a busy little fair of booths It seemed a warm human well rooted and altogether delightful place to Bert He came low over the tree tops with his grapnel ready to throw and so anchor him a curious interested and interesting guest so his imagination figured it in the very middle of it all He thought of himself performing feats with the sign language and chance linguistics amidst a circle of admiring rustics And then the chapter of adverse accidents began The rope made itself unpopular long before the crowd had fully realised his advent over the trees An elderly and apparently intoxicated peasant in a shiny black hat and carrying a large crimson umbrella caught sight of it first as it trailed past him and was seized with a discreditable ambition to kill it He pursued it briskly with unpleasant cries It crossed the road obliquely splashed into a pail of milk upon a stall and slapped its milky tail athwart a motor car load of factory girls halted outside the town gates They screamed loudly People looked up and saw Bert making what he meant to be genial salutations but what they considered in view of the feminine outcry to be insulting gestures Then the car hit the roof of the gatehouse smartly snapped a flag staff played a tune upon some telegraph wires and sent a broken wire like a whip lash to do its share in accumulating unpopularity Bert by clutching convulsively just escaped being pitched headlong Two young soldiers and several peasants shouted things up to him and shook fists at him and began to run in pursuit as he disappeared over the wall into the town Admiring rustics indeed The balloon leapt at once in the manner of balloons when part of their weight is released by touching down with a sort of flippancy and in another moment Bert was over a street crowded with peasants and soldiers that opened into a busy market square The wave of unfriendliness pursued him Grapnel said Bert and then with an afterthought shouted TETES there you I say I say TETES Eng it The grapnel smashed down a steeply sloping roof followed by an avalanche of broken tiles jumped the street amidst shrieks and cries and smashed into a plate glass window with an immense and sickening impact The balloon rolled nauseatingly and the car pitched But the grapnel had not held It emerged at once bearing on one fluke with a ridiculous air of fastidious selection a small child s chair and pursued by a maddened shopman It lifted its catch swung about with an appearance of painful indecision amidst a roar of wrath and dropped it at last neatly and as if by inspiration over the head of a peasant woman in charge of an assortment of cabbages in the market place Everybody now was aware of the balloon Everybody was either trying to dodge the grapnel or catch the trail rope With a pendulum like swoop through the crowd that sent people flying right and left the grapnel came to earth again tried for and missed a stout gentleman in a blue suit and a straw hat smacked away a trestle from under a stall of haberdashery made a cyclist soldier in knickerbockers leap like a chamois and secured itself uncertainly among the hind legs of a sheep which made convulsive ungenerous efforts to free itself and was dragged into a position of rest against a stone cross in the middle of the place The balloon pulled up with a jerk In another moment a score of willing hands were tugging it earthward At the same instant Bert became aware for the first time of a fresh breeze blowing about him For some seconds he stood staggering in the car which now swayed sickeningly surveying the exasperated crowd below him and trying to collect his mind He was extraordinarily astonished at this run of mishaps Were the people really so annoyed Everybody seemed angry with him No one seemed interested or amused by his arrival A disproportionate amount of the outcry had the flavour of imprecation had indeed a strong flavour of riot Several greatly uniformed officials in cocked hats struggled in vain to control the crowd Fists and sticks were shaken And when Bert saw a man on the outskirts of the crowd run to a haycart and get a brightly pronged pitch fork and a blue clad soldier unbuckle his belt his rising doubt whether this little town was after all such a good place for a landing became a certainty He had clung to the fancy that they would make something of a hero of him Now he knew that he was mistaken He was perhaps ten feet above the people when he made his decision His paralysis ceased He leapt up on the seat and at imminent risk of falling headlong released the grapnel rope from the toggle that held it sprang on to the trail rope and disengaged that also A hoarse shout of disgust greeted the descent of the grapnel rope and the swift leap of the balloon and something he fancied afterwards it was a turnip whizzed by his head The trail rope followed its fellow The crowd seemed to jump away from him With an immense and horrifying rustle the balloon brushed against a telephone pole and for a tense instant he anticipated either an electric explosion or a bursting of the oiled silk or both But fortune was with him In another second he was cowering in the bottom of the car and released from the weight of the grapnel and the two ropes rushing up once more through the air For a time he remained crouching and when at last he looked out again the little town was very small and travelling with the rest of lower Germany in a circular orbit round and round the car or at least it appeared to be doing that When he got used to it he found this rotation of the balloon rather convenient it saved moving about in the car five Late in the afternoon of a pleasant summer day in the year one hundred ninety one if one may borrow a mode of phrasing that once found favour with the readers of the late G P R James a solitary balloonist replacing the solitary horseman of the classic romances might have been observed wending his way across Franconia in a north easterly direction and at a height of about eleven thousand feet above the sea and still spindling slowly His head was craned over the side of the car and he surveyed the country below with an expression of profound perplexity ever and again his lips shaped inaudible words Shootin at a chap for example and I ll come down right enough soon as I find out ow Over the side of the basket the robe of the Desert Dervish was hanging an appeal for consideration an ineffectual white flag He was now very distinctly aware that the world below him so far from being the naive countryside of his earlier imaginings that day sleepily unconscious of him and capable of being amazed and nearly reverential at his descent was acutely irritated by his career and extremely impatient with the course he was taking But indeed it was not he who took that course but his masters the winds of heaven Mysterious voices spoke to him in his ear jerking the words up to him by means of megaphones in a weird and startling manner in a great variety of languages Official looking persons had signalled to him by means of flag flapping and arm waving On the whole a guttural variant of English prevailed in the sentences that alighted upon the balloon chiefly he was told to gome down or you will be shot All very well said Bert but ow Then they shot a little wide of the car Latterly he had been shot at six or seven times and once the bullet had gone by with a sound so persuasively like the tearing of silk that he had resigned himself to the prospect of a headlong fall But either they were aiming near him or they had missed and as yet nothing was torn but the air about him and his anxious soul He was now enjoying a respite from these attentions but he felt it was at best an interlude and he was doing what he could to appreciate his position Incidentally he was having some hot coffee and pie in an untidy inadvertent manner with an eye fluttering nervously over the side of the car At first he had ascribed the growing interest in his career to his ill conceived attempt to land in the bright little upland town but now he was beginning to realise that the military rather than the civil arm was concerned about him He was quite involuntarily playing that weird mysterious part the part of an International Spy He was seeing secret things He had in fact crossed the designs of no less a power than the German Empire he had blundered into the hot focus of Welt Politik he was drifting helplessly towards the great Imperial secret the immense aeronautic park that had been established at a headlong pace in Franconia to develop silently swiftly and on an immense scale the great discoveries of Hunstedt and Stossel and so to give Germany before all other nations a fleet of airships the air power and the Empire of the world Later just before they shot him down altogether Bert saw that great area of passionate work warm lit in the evening light a great area of upland on which the airships lay like a herd of grazing monsters at their feed It was a vast busy space stretching away northward as far as he could see methodically cut up into numbered sheds gasometers squad encampments storage areas interlaced with the omnipresent mono rail lines and altogether free from overhead wires or cables Everywhere was the white black and yellow of Imperial Germany everywhere the black eagles spread their wings Even without these indications the large vigorous neatness of everything would have marked it German Vast multitudes of men went to and fro many in white and drab fatigue uniforms busy about the balloons others drilling in sensible drab Here and there a full uniform glittered The airships chiefly engaged his attention and he knew at once it was three of these he had seen on the previous night taking advantage of the cloud welkin to manoeuvre unobserved They were altogether fish like For the great airships with which Germany attacked New York in her last gigantic effort for world supremacy before humanity realized that world supremacy was a dream were the lineal descendants of the Zeppelin airship that flew over Lake Constance in nineteen oh six and of the Lebaudy navigables that made their memorable excursions over Paris in nineteen oh seven and nineteen oh eight These German airships were held together by rib like skeletons of steel and aluminium and a stout inelastic canvas outer skin within which was an impervious rubber gas bag cut up by transverse dissepiments into from fifty to a hundred compartments These were all absolutely gas tight and filled with hydrogen and the entire aerostat was kept at any level by means of a long internal balloonette of oiled and toughened silk canvas into which air could be forced and from which it could be pumped So the airship could be made either heavier or lighter than air and losses of weight through the consumption of fuel the casting of bombs and so forth could also be compensated by admitting air to sections of the general gas bag Ultimately that made a highly explosive mixture but in all these matters risks must be taken and guarded against There was a steel axis to the whole affair a central backbone which terminated in the engine and propeller and the men and magazines were forward in a series of cabins under the expanded headlike forepart The engine which was of the extraordinarily powerful Pforzheim type that supreme triumph of German invention was worked by wires from this forepart which was indeed the only really habitable part of the ship If anything went wrong the engineers went aft along a rope ladder beneath the frame The tendency of the whole affair to roll was partly corrected by a horizontal lateral fin on either side and steering was chiefly effected by two vertical fins which normally lay back like gill flaps on either side of the head It was indeed a most complete adaptation of the fish form to aerial conditions the position of swimming bladder eyes and brain being however below instead of above A striking and unfish like feature was the apparatus for wireless telegraphy that dangled from the forward cabin that is to say under the chin of the fish These monsters were capable of ninety miles an hour in a calm so that they could face and make headway against nearly everything except the fiercest tornado They varied in length from eight hundred to two thousand feet and they had a carrying power of from seventy to two hundred tons How many Germany possessed history does not record but Bert counted nearly eighty great bulks receding in perspective during his brief inspection Such were the instruments on which she chiefly relied to sustain her in her repudiation of the Monroe Doctrine and her bold bid for a share in the empire of the New World But not altogether did she rely on these she had also a one man bomb throwing Drachenflieger of unknown value among the resources But the Drachenflieger were away in the second great aeronautic park east of Hamburg and Bert Smallways saw nothing of them in the bird s eye view he took of the Franconian establishment before they shot him down very neatly The bullet tore past him and made a sort of pop as it pierced his balloon a pop that was followed by a rustling sigh and a steady downward movement And when in the confusion of the moment he dropped a bag of ballast the Germans very politely but firmly overcame his scruples by shooting his balloon again twice CHAPTER IV THE GERMAN AIR FLEET one Of all the productions of the human imagination that make the world in which mister Bert Smallways lived confusingly wonderful there was none quite so strange so headlong and disturbing so noisy and persuasive and dangerous as the modernisations of patriotism produced by imperial and international politics In the soul of all men is a liking for kind a pride in one s own atmosphere a tenderness for one s Mother speech and one s familiar land Before the coming of the Scientific Age this group of gentle and noble emotions had been a fine factor in the equipment of every worthy human being a fine factor that had its less amiable aspect in a usually harmless hostility to strange people and a usually harmless detraction of strange lands But with the wild rush of change in the pace scope materials scale and possibilities of human life that then occurred the old boundaries the old seclusions and separations were violently broken down All the old settled mental habits and traditions of men found themselves not simply confronted by new conditions but by constantly renewed and changing new conditions They had no chance of adapting themselves They were annihilated or perverted or inflamed beyond recognition Bert Smallways grandfather in the days when Bun Hill was a village under the sway of Sir Peter Bone s parent had known his place to the uttermost farthing touched his hat to his betters despised and condescended to his inferiors and hadn t changed an idea from the cradle to the grave He was Kentish and English and that meant hops beer dog rose s and the sort of sunshine that was best in the world Newspapers and politics and visits to Lunnon weren t for the likes of him Then came the change These earlier chapters have given an idea of what happened to Bun Hill and how the flood of novel things had poured over its devoted rusticity Bert Smallways was only one of countless millions in Europe and America and Asia who instead of being born rooted in the soil were born struggling in a torrent they never clearly understood All the faiths of their fathers had been taken by surprise and startled into the strangest forms and reactions Particularly did the fine old tradition of patriotism get perverted and distorted in the rush of the new times Instead of the sturdy establishment in prejudice of Bert s grandfather to whom the word Frenchified was the ultimate term of contempt there flowed through Bert s brain a squittering succession of thinly violent ideas about German competition about the Yellow Danger about the Black Peril about the White Man s Burthen that is to say Bert s preposterous right to muddle further the naturally very muddled politics of the entirely similar little cads to himself except for a smear of brown who smoked cigarettes and rode bicycles in Buluwayo Kingston Jamaica or Bombay These were Bert s Subject Races and he was ready to die by proxy in the person of any one who cared to enlist to maintain his hold upon that right It kept him awake at nights to think that he might lose it The essential fact of the politics of the age in which Bert Smallways lived the age that blundered at last into the catastrophe of the War in the Air was a very simple one if only people had had the intelligence to be simple about it The development of Science had altered the scale of human affairs By means of rapid mechanical traction it had brought men nearer together so much nearer socially economically physically that the old separations into nations and kingdoms were no longer possible a newer wider synthesis was not only needed but imperatively demanded Just as the once independent dukedoms of France had to fuse into a nation so now the nations had to adapt themselves to a wider coalescence they had to keep what was precious and possible and concede what was obsolete and dangerous A saner world would have perceived this patent need for a reasonable synthesis would have discussed it temperately achieved and gone on to organise the great civilisation that was manifestly possible to mankind The world of Bert Smallways did nothing of the sort Its national governments its national interests would not hear of anything so obvious they were too suspicious of each other too wanting in generous imaginations They began to behave like ill bred people in a crowded public car to squeeze against one another elbow thrust dispute and quarrel Vain to point out to them that they had only to rearrange themselves to be comfortable Everywhere all over the world the historian of the early twentieth century finds the same thing the flow and rearrangement of human affairs inextricably entangled by the old areas the old prejudices and a sort of heated irascible stupidity and everywhere congested nations in inconvenient areas slopping population and produce into each other annoying each other with tariffs and every possible commercial vexation and threatening each other with navies and armies that grew every year more portentous It is impossible now to estimate how much of the intellectual and physical energy of the world was wasted in military preparation and equipment but it was an enormous proportion Great Britain spent upon army and navy money and capacity that directed into the channels of physical culture and education would have made the British the aristocracy of the world Her rulers could have kept the whole population learning and exercising up to the age of eighteen and made a broad chested and intelligent man of every Bert Smallways in the islands had they given the resources they spent in war material to the making of men Instead of which they waggled flags at him until he was fourteen incited him to cheer and then turned him out of school to begin that career of private enterprise we have compactly recorded France achieved similar imbecilities Germany was if possible worse Russia under the waste and stresses of militarism festered towards bankruptcy and decay All Europe was producing big guns and countless swarms of little Smallways The Asiatic peoples had been forced in self defence into a like diversion of the new powers science had brought them On the eve of the outbreak of the war there were six great powers in the world and a cluster of smaller ones each armed to the teeth and straining every nerve to get ahead of the others in deadliness of equipment and military efficiency The great powers were first the United States a nation addicted to commerce but roused to military necessities by the efforts of Germany to expand into South America and by the natural consequences of her own unwary annexations of land in the very teeth of Japan She maintained two immense fleets east and west and internally she was in violent conflict between Federal and State governments upon the question of universal service in a defensive militia Next came the great alliance of Eastern Asia a close knit coalescence of China and Japan advancing with rapid strides year by year to predominance in the world s affairs Then the German alliance still struggled to achieve its dream of imperial expansion and its imposition of the German language upon a forcibly united Europe These were the three most spirited and aggressive powers in the world Far more pacific was the British Empire perilously scattered over the globe and distracted now by insurrectionary movements in Ireland and among all its Subject Races It had given these subject races cigarettes boots bowler hats cricket race meetings cheap revolvers petroleum the factory system of industry halfpenny newspapers in both English and the vernacular inexpensive university degrees motor bicycles and electric trams it had produced a considerable literature expressing contempt for the Subject Races and rendered it freely accessible to them and it had been content to believe that nothing would result from these stimulants because somebody once wrote the immemorial east and also in the inspired words of Kipling East is east and west is west And never the twain shall meet Instead of which Egypt India and the subject countries generally had produced new generations in a state of passionate indignation and the utmost energy activity and modernity The governing class in Great Britain was slowly adapting itself to a new conception of the Subject Races as waking peoples and finding its efforts to keep the Empire together under these strains and changing ideas greatly impeded by the entirely sporting spirit with which Bert Smallways at home by the million cast his vote and by the tendency of his more highly coloured equivalents to be disrespectful to irascible officials Their impertinence was excessive it was no mere stone throwing and shouting They would quote Burns at them and Mill and Darwin and confute them in arguments Even more pacific than the British Empire were France and its allies the Latin powers heavily armed states indeed but reluctant warriors and in many ways socially and politically leading western civilisation Russia was a pacific power perforce divided within itself torn between revolutionaries and reactionaries who were equally incapable of social reconstruction and so sinking towards a tragic disorder of chronic political vendetta Wedged in among these portentous larger bulks swayed and threatened by them the smaller states of the world maintained a precarious independence each keeping itself armed as dangerously as its utmost ability could contrive So it came about that in every country a great and growing body of energetic and inventive men was busied either for offensive or defensive ends in elaborating the apparatus of war until the accumulating tensions should reach the breaking point Each power sought to keep its preparations secret to hold new weapons in reserve to anticipate and learn the preparations of its rivals The feeling of danger from fresh discoveries affected the patriotic imagination of every people in the world Now it was rumoured the British had an overwhelming gun now the French an invincible rifle now the Japanese a new explosive now the Americans a submarine that would drive every ironclad from the seas Each time there would be a war panic The strength and heart of the nations was given to the thought of war and yet the mass of their citizens was a teeming democracy as heedless of and unfitted for fighting mentally morally physically as any population has ever been or one ventures to add could ever be That was the paradox of the time It was a period altogether unique in the world s history The apparatus of warfare the art and method of fighting changed absolutely every dozen years in a stupendous progress towards perfection and people grew less and less warlike and there was no war And then at last it came It came as a surprise to all the world because its real causes were hidden Relations were strained between Germany and the United States because of the intense exasperation of a tariff conflict and the ambiguous attitude of the former power towards the Monroe Doctrine and they were strained between the United States and Japan because of the perennial citizenship question But in both cases these were standing causes of offence The real deciding cause it is now known was the perfecting of the Pforzheim engine by Germany and the consequent possibility of a rapid and entirely practicable airship At that time Germany was by far the most efficient power in the world better organised for swift and secret action better equipped with the resources of modern science and with her official and administrative classes at a higher level of education and training These things she knew and she exaggerated that knowledge to the pitch of contempt for the secret counsels of her neighbours It may be that with the habit of self confidence her spying upon them had grown less thorough Moreover she had a tradition of unsentimental and unscrupulous action that vitiated her international outlook profoundly With the coming of these new weapons her collective intelligence thrilled with the sense that now her moment had come Once again in the history of progress it seemed she held the decisive weapon Now she might strike and conquer before the others had anything but experiments in the air Particularly she must strike America swiftly because there if anywhere lay the chance of an aerial rival It was known that America possessed a flying machine of considerable practical value developed out of the Wright model but it was not supposed that the Washington War Office had made any wholesale attempts to create an aerial navy It was necessary to strike before they could do so France had a fleet of slow navigables several dating from nineteen oh eight that could make no possible headway against the new type They had been built solely for reconnoitring purposes on the eastern frontier they were mostly too small to carry more than a couple of dozen men without arms or provisions and not one could do forty miles an hour Great Britain it seemed in an access of meanness temporised and wrangled with the imperial spirited Butteridge and his extraordinary invention That also was not in play and could not be for some months at the earliest From Asia there came no sign The Germans explained this by saying the yellow peoples were without invention No other competitor was worth considering Now or never said the Germans now or never we may seize the air as once the British seized the seas While all the other powers are still experimenting Swift and systematic and secret were their preparations and their plan most excellent So far as their knowledge went America was the only dangerous possibility America which was also now the leading trade rival of Germany and one of the chief barriers to her Imperial expansion So at once they would strike at America They would fling a great force across the Atlantic heavens and bear America down unwarned and unprepared Altogether it was a well imagined and most hopeful and spirited enterprise having regard to the information in the possession of the German government The chances of it being a successful surprise were very great The airship and the flying machine were very different things from ironclads which take a couple of years to build Given hands given plant they could be made innumerably in a few weeks Once the needful parks and foundries were organised air ships and Drachenflieger could be poured into the sky Indeed when the time came they did pour into the sky like as a bitter French writer put it flies roused from filth The attack upon America was to be the first move in this tremendous game But no sooner had it started than instantly the aeronautic parks were to proceed to put together and inflate the second fleet which was to dominate Europe and manoeuvre significantly over London Paris Rome saint Petersburg or wherever else its moral effect was required A World Surprise it was to be no less a World Conquest and it is wonderful how near the calmly adventurous minds that planned it came to succeeding in their colossal design Von Sternberg was the Moltke of this War in the Air but it was the curious hard romanticism of Prince Karl Albert that won over the hesitating Emperor to the scheme Prince Karl Albert was indeed the central figure of the world drama He was the darling of the Imperialist spirit in German and the ideal of the new aristocratic feeling the new Chivalry as it was called that followed the overthrow of Socialism through its internal divisions and lack of discipline and the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few great families He was compared by obsequious flatterers to the Black Prince to Alcibiades to the young Caesar To many he seemed Nietzsche s Overman revealed He was big and blond and virile and splendidly non moral The first great feat that startled Europe and almost brought about a new Trojan war was his abduction of the Princess Helena of Norway and his blank refusal to marry her Then followed his marriage with Gretchen Krass a Swiss girl of peerless beauty Then came the gallant rescue which almost cost him his life of three drowning sailors whose boat had upset in the sea near Heligoland For that and his victory over the American yacht Defender C C I the Emperor forgave him and placed him in control of the new aeronautic arm of the German forces This he developed with marvellous energy and ability being resolved as he said to give to Germany land and sea and sky The national passion for aggression found in him its supreme exponent and achieved through him its realisation in this astounding war But his fascination was more than national all over the world his ruthless strength dominated minds as the Napoleonic legend had dominated minds Englishmen turned in disgust from the slow complex civilised methods of their national politics to this uncompromising forceful figure Frenchmen believed in him Poems were written to him in American He made the war Quite equally with the rest of the world the general German population was taken by surprise by the swift vigour of the Imperial government A considerable literature of military forecasts beginning as early as nineteen oh six with Rudolf Martin the author not merely of a brilliant book of anticipations but of a proverb The future of Germany lies in the air had however partially prepared the German imagination for some such enterprise two Of all these world forces and gigantic designs Bert Smallways knew nothing until he found himself in the very focus of it all and gaped down amazed on the spectacle of that giant herd of air ships Each one seemed as long as the Strand and as big about as Trafalgar Square Some must have been a third of a mile in length He had never before seen anything so vast and disciplined as this tremendous park For the first time in his life he really had an intimation of the extraordinary and quite important things of which a contemporary may go in ignorance He had always clung to the illusion that Germans were fat absurd men who smoked china pipes and were addicted to knowledge and horseflesh and sauerkraut and indigestible things generally His bird s eye view was quite transitory He ducked at the first shot and directly his balloon began to drop his mind ran confusedly upon how he might explain himself and whether he should pretend to be Butteridge or not O Lord he groaned in an agony of indecision Then his eye caught his sandals and he felt a spasm of self disgust They ll think I m a bloomin idiot he said and then it was he rose up desperately and threw over the sand bag and provoked the second and third shots It flashed into his head as he cowered in the bottom of the car that he might avoid all sorts of disagreeable and complicated explanations by pretending to be mad That was his last idea before the airships seemed to rush up about him as if to look at him and his car hit the ground and bounded and pitched him out on his head He awoke to find himself famous and to hear a voice crying Booteraidge Ja Ja Herr Booteraidge Selbst He was lying on a little patch of grass beside one of the main avenues of the aeronautic park The airships receded down a great vista an immense perspective and the blunt prow of each was adorned with a black eagle of a hundred feet or so spread Down the other side of the avenue ran a series of gas generators and big hose pipes trailed everywhere across the intervening space Close at hand was his now nearly deflated balloon and the car on its side looking minutely small a mere broken toy a shrivelled bubble in contrast with the gigantic bulk of the nearer airship This he saw almost end on rising like a cliff and sloping forward towards its fellow on the other side so as to overshadow the alley between them There was a crowd of excited people about him big men mostly in tight uniforms Everybody was talking and several were shouting in German he knew that because they splashed and aspirated sounds like startled kittens Only one phrase repeated again and again could he recognize the name of Herr Booteraidge Gollys said Bert They ve spotted it Besser said some one and some rapid German followed He perceived that close at hand was a field telephone and that a tall officer in blue was talking thereat about him Another stood close beside him with the portfolio of drawings and photographs in his hand They looked round at him Do you spik Cherman Herr Booteraidge Bert decided that he had better be dazed He did his best to seem thoroughly dazed Where AM I he asked Volubility prevailed Der Prinz was mentioned A bugle sounded far away and its call was taken up by one nearer and then by one close at hand This seemed to increase the excitement greatly A mono rail car bumbled past The telephone bell rang passionately and the tall officer seemed to engage in a heated altercation Then he approached the group about Bert calling out something about mitbringen An earnest faced emaciated man with a white moustache appealed to Bert Herr Booteraidge sir we are chust to start Where am I Bert repeated Some one shook him by the other shoulder Are you Herr Booteraidge he asked Herr Booteraidge we are chust to start repeated the white moustache and then helplessly What is de goot What can we do The officer from the telephone repeated his sentence about Der Prinz and mitbringen The man with the moustache stared for a moment grasped an idea and became violently energetic stood up and bawled directions at unseen people Questions were asked and the doctor at Bert s side answered Ja Ja several times also something about Kopf With a certain urgency he got Bert rather unwillingly to his feet Two huge soldiers in grey advanced upon Bert and seized hold of him Ullo said Bert startled What s up It is all right the doctor explained they are to carry you Where asked Bert unanswered Put your arms roundt their hals round them Yes but where Hold tight Before Bert could decide to say anything more he was whisked up by the two soldiers They joined hands to seat him and his arms were put about their necks Vorwarts Some one ran before him with the portfolio and he was borne rapidly along the broad avenue between the gas generators and the airships rapidly and on the whole smoothly except that once or twice his bearers stumbled over hose pipes and nearly let him down He was wearing mister Butteridge s Alpine cap and his little shoulders were in mister Butteridge s fur lined overcoat and he had responded to mister Butteridge s name The sandals dangled helplessly Gaw Everybody seemed in a devil of a hurry Why He was carried joggling and gaping through the twilight marvelling beyond measure The systematic arrangement of wide convenient spaces the quantities of business like soldiers everywhere the occasional neat piles of material the ubiquitous mono rail lines and the towering ship like hulls about him reminded him a little of impressions he had got as a boy on a visit to Woolwich Dockyard The whole camp reflected the colossal power of modern science that had created it A peculiar strangeness was produced by the lowness of the electric light which lay upon the ground casting all shadows upwards and making a grotesque shadow figure of himself and his bearers on the airship sides fusing all three of them into a monstrous animal with attenuated legs and an immense fan like humped body The lights were on the ground because as far as possible all poles and standards had been dispensed with to prevent complications when the airships rose It was deep twilight now a tranquil blue skyed evening everything rose out from the splashes of light upon the ground into dim translucent tall masses within the cavities of the airships small inspecting lamps glowed like cloud veiled stars and made them seem marvellously unsubstantial Each airship had its name in black letters on white on either flank and forward the Imperial eagle sprawled an overwhelming bird in the dimness Bugles sounded mono rail cars of quiet soldiers slithered burbling by The cabins under the heads of the airships were being lit up doors opened in them and revealed padded passages Now and then a voice gave directions to workers indistinctly seen There was a matter of sentinels gangways and a long narrow passage a scramble over a disorder of baggage and then Bert found himself lowered to the ground and standing in the doorway of a spacious cabin it was perhaps ten feet square and eight high furnished with crimson padding and aluminium A tall bird like young man with a small head a long nose and very pale hair with his hands full of things like shaving strops boot trees hair brushes and toilet tidies was saying things about Gott and thunder and Dummer Booteraidge as Bert entered He was apparently an evicted occupant Then he vanished and Bert was lying back on a couch in the corner with a pillow under his head and the door of the cabin shut upon him He was alone Everybody had hurried out again astonishingly Gollys said Bert What next He stared about him at the room Butteridge Shall I try to keep it up or shan t I The room he was in puzzled him Tisn t a prison and tisn t a norfis Then the old trouble came uppermost I wish to eaven I adn t these silly sandals on he cried querulously to the universe They give the whole blessed show away three His door was flung open and a compact young man in uniform appeared carrying mister Butteridge s portfolio rucksac and shaving glass I say he said in faultless English as he entered He had a beaming face and a sort of pinkish blond hair Fancy you being Butteridge He slapped Bert s meagre luggage down We d have started he said in another half hour You didn t give yourself much time He surveyed Bert curiously His gaze rested for a fraction of a moment on the sandals You ought to have come on your flying machine mister Butteridge He didn t wait for an answer The Prince says I ve got to look after you Naturally he can t see you now but he thinks your coming s providential Last grace of Heaven Like a sign Hullo He stood still and listened Outside there was a going to and fro of feet a sound of distant bugles suddenly taken up and echoed close at hand men called out in loud tones short sharp seemingly vital things and were answered distantly A bell jangled and feet went down the corridor Then came a stillness more distracting than sound and then a great gurgling and rushing and splashing of water The young man s eyebrows lifted He hesitated and dashed out of the room Presently came a stupendous bang to vary the noises without then a distant cheering The young man re appeared They re running the water out of the ballonette already What water asked Bert The water that anchored us Artful dodge Eh Bert tried to take it in Of course said the compact young man You don t understand A gentle quivering crept upon Bert s senses That s the engine said the compact young man approvingly Now we shan t be long Another long listening interval The cabin swayed By Jove we re starting already he cried We re starting Starting cried Bert sitting up Where But the young man was out of the room again There were noises of German in the passage and other nerve shaking sounds The swaying increased The young man reappeared We re off right enough I say said Bert where are we starting I wish you d explain What s this place I don t understand What cried the young man you don t understand No I m all dazed like from that crack on the nob I got Where ARE we WHERE are we starting Don t you know where you are what this is Not a bit of it What s all the swaying and the row What a lark cried the young man I say What a thundering lark Don t you know We re off to America and you haven t realised You ve just caught us by a neck You re on the blessed old flagship with the Prince You won t miss anything Whatever s on you bet the Vaterland will be there Us off to America Ra ther In an airship What do YOU think Me going to America on an airship After that balloon Ere I say I don t want to go I want to walk about on my legs Let me get out I didn t understand He made a dive for the door The young man arrested Bert with a gesture took hold of a strap lifted up a panel in the padded wall and a window appeared Look he said Side by side they looked out Gaw said Bert We re going up We are said the young man cheerfully fast They were rising in the air smoothly and quietly and moving slowly to the throb of the engine athwart the aeronautic park Down below it stretched dimly geometrical in the darkness picked out at regular intervals by glow worm spangles of light One black gap in the long line of grey round backed airships marked the position from which the Vaterland had come Beside it a second monster now rose softly released from its bonds and cables into the air Then taking a beautifully exact distance a third ascended and then a fourth Too late mister Butteridge the young man remarked We re off I daresay it is a bit of a shock to you but there you are The Prince said you d have to come Look ere said Bert I really am dazed What s this thing Where are we going This mister Butteridge said the young man taking pains to be explicit is an airship It s the flagship of Prince Karl Albert This is the German air fleet and it is going over to America to give that spirited people what for The only thing we were at all uneasy about was your invention And here you are But you a German asked Bert Lieutenant Kurt Luft lieutenant Kurt at your service But you speak English Mother was English went to school in England Afterwards Rhodes scholar German none the less for that Detailed for the present mister Butteridge to look after you You re shaken by your fall It s all right really They re going to buy your machine and everything You sit down and take it quite calmly You ll soon get the hang of the position four Bert sat down on the locker collecting his mind and the young man talked to him about the airship He was really a very tactful young man indeed in a natural sort of way Daresay all this is new to you he said not your sort of machine These cabins aren t half bad He got up and walked round the little apartment showing its points Here is the bed he said whipping down a couch from the wall and throwing it back again with a click Here are toilet things and he opened a neatly arranged cupboard Not much washing No water we ve got no water at all except for drinking No baths or anything until we get to America and land Rub over with loofah One pint of hot for shaving That s all In the locker below you are rugs and blankets you will need them presently They say it gets cold I don t know Never been up before Except a little work with gliders which is mostly going down Three quarters of the chaps in the fleet haven t Here s a folding chair and table behind the door Compact eh He took the chair and balanced it on his little finger Pretty light eh Aluminium and magnesium alloy and a vacuum inside All these cushions stuffed with hydrogen Foxy The whole ship s like that And not a man in the fleet except the Prince and one or two others over eleven stone Couldn t sweat the Prince you know We ll go all over the thing to morrow I m frightfully keen on it He beamed at Bert You DO look young he remarked I always thought you d be an old man with a beard a sort of philosopher I don t know why one should expect clever people always to be old I do Bert parried that compliment a little awkwardly and then the lieutenant was struck with the riddle why Herr Butteridge had not come in his own flying machine It s a long story said Bert Look here he said abruptly I wish you d lend me a pair of slippers or something I m regular sick of these sandals They re rotten things I ve been trying them for a friend Right O The ex Rhodes scholar whisked out of the room and reappeared with a considerable choice of footwear pumps cloth bath slippers and a purple pair adorned with golden sun flowers But these he repented of at the last moment I don t even wear them myself he said Only brought em in the zeal of the moment He laughed confidentially Had em worked for me in Oxford By a friend Take em everywhere So Bert chose the pumps The lieutenant broke into a cheerful snigger Here we are trying on slippers he said and the world going by like a panorama below Rather a lark eh Look Bert peeped with him out of the window looking from the bright pettiness of the red and silver cabin into a dark immensity The land below except for a lake was black and featureless and the other airships were hidden See more outside said the lieutenant Let s go There s a sort of little gallery He led the way into the long passage which was lit by one small electric light past some notices in German to an open balcony and a light ladder and gallery of metal lattice overhanging empty space Bert followed his leader down to the gallery slowly and cautiously From it he was able to watch the wonderful spectacle of the first air fleet flying through the night They flew in a wedge shaped formation the Vaterland highest and leading the tail receding into the corners of the sky They flew in long regular undulations great dark fish like shapes showing hardly any light at all the engines making a throb throb throbbing sound that was very audible out on the gallery They were going at a level of five or six thousand feet and rising steadily Below the country lay silent a clear darkness dotted and lined out with clusters of furnaces and the lit streets of a group of big towns The world seemed to lie in a bowl the overhanging bulk of the airship above hid all but the lowest levels of the sky They watched the landscape for a space Jolly it must be to invent things said the lieutenant suddenly How did you come to think of your machine first Worked it out said Bert after a pause Jest ground away at it Our people are frightfully keen on you They thought the British had got you Weren t the British keen In a way said Bert Still it s a long story I think it s an immense thing to invent I couldn t invent a thing to save my life They both fell silent watching the darkened world and following their thoughts until a bugle summoned them to a belated dinner Bert was suddenly alarmed Don t you ave to dress and things he said I ve always been too hard at Science and things to go into Society and all that No fear said Kurt Nobody s got more than the clothes they wear We re travelling light You might perhaps take your overcoat off They ve an electric radiator each end of the room And so presently Bert found himself sitting to eat in the presence of the German Alexander that great and puissant Prince Prince Karl Albert the War Lord the hero of two hemispheres He was a handsome blond man with deep set eyes a snub nose upturned moustache and long white hands a strange looking man He sat higher than the others under a black eagle with widespread wings and the German Imperial flags he was as it were enthroned and it struck Bert greatly that as he ate he did not look at people but over their heads like one who sees visions Twenty officers of various ranks stood about the table and Bert They all seemed extremely curious to see the famous Butteridge and their astonishment at his appearance was ill controlled The Prince gave him a dignified salutation to which by an inspiration he bowed Standing next the Prince was a brown faced wrinkled man with silver spectacles and fluffy dingy grey side whiskers who regarded Bert with a peculiar and disconcerting attention The company sat after ceremonies Bert could not understand At the other end of the table was the bird faced officer Bert had dispossessed still looking hostile and whispering about Bert to his neighbour Two soldiers waited The dinner was a plain one a soup some fresh mutton and cheese and there was very little talk A curious solemnity indeed brooded over every one Partly this was reaction after the intense toil and restrained excitement of starting partly it was the overwhelming sense of strange new experiences of portentous adventure The Prince was lost in thought He roused himself to drink to the Emperor in champagne and the company cried Hoch like men repeating responses in church No smoking was permitted but some of the officers went down to the little open gallery to chew tobacco No lights whatever were safe amidst that bundle of inflammable things Bert suddenly fell yawning and shivering He was overwhelmed by a sense of his own insignificance amidst these great rushing monsters of the air He felt life was too big for him too much for him altogether He said something to Kurt about his head went up the steep ladder from the swaying little gallery into the airship again and so as if it were a refuge to bed five Bert slept for a time and then his sleep was broken by dreams Mostly he was fleeing from formless terrors down an interminable passage in an airship a passage paved at first with ravenous trap doors and then with openwork canvas of the most careless description Gaw said Bert turning over after his seventh fall through infinite space that night He sat up in the darkness and nursed his knees The progress of the airship was not nearly so smooth as a balloon he could feel a regular swaying up up up and then down down down and the throbbing and tremulous quiver of the engines His mind began to teem with memories more memories and more Through them like a struggling swimmer in broken water came the perplexing question what am I to do to morrow To morrow Kurt had told him the Prince s secretary the Graf Von Winterfeld would come to him and discuss his flying machine and then he would see the Prince He would have to stick it out now that he was Butteridge and sell his invention And then if they found him out He had a vision of infuriated Butteridges Suppose after all he owned up Pretended it was their misunderstanding He began to scheme devices for selling the secret and circumventing Butteridge What should he ask for the thing Somehow twenty thousand pounds struck him as about the sum indicated He fell into that despondency that lies in wait in the small hours He had got too big a job on too big a job Memories swamped his scheming Where was I this time last night He recapitulated his evenings tediously and lengthily Last night he had been up above the clouds in Butteridge s balloon He thought of the moment when he dropped through them and saw the cold twilight sea close below He still remembered that disagreeable incident with a nightmare vividness And the night before he and Grubb had been looking for cheap lodgings at Littlestone in Kent How remote that seemed now It might be years ago For the first time he thought of his fellow Desert Dervish left with the two red painted bicycles on Dymchurch sands E won t make much of a show of it not without me Any ow e did ave the treasury such as it was in his pocket The night before that was Bank Holiday night and they had sat discussing their minstrel enterprise drawing up a programme and rehearsing steps And the night before was Whit Sunday Lord cried Bert what a doing that motor bicycle give me He recalled the empty flapping of the eviscerated cushion the feeling of impotence as the flames rose again From among the confused memories of that tragic flare one little figure emerged very bright and poignantly sweet Edna crying back reluctantly from the departing motor car See you to morrer Bert Other memories of Edna clustered round that impression They led Bert s mind step by step to an agreeable state that found expression in I ll marry ER if she don t look out And then in a flash it followed in his mind that if he sold the Butteridge secret he could Suppose after all he did get twenty thousand pounds such sums have been paid With that he could buy house and garden buy new clothes beyond dreaming buy a motor travel have every delight of the civilised life as he knew it for himself and Edna Of course risks were involved I ll ave old Butteridge on my track I expect He meditated upon that He declined again to despondency As yet he was only in the beginning of the adventure He had still to deliver the goods and draw the cash And before that Just now he was by no means on his way home He was flying off to America to fight there Not much fighting he considered all our own way Still if a shell did happen to hit the Vaterland on the underside S pose I ought to make my will He lay back for some time composing wills chiefly in favour of Edna He had settled now it was to be twenty thousand pounds He left a number of minor legacies The wills became more and more meandering and extravagant He woke from the eighth repetition of his nightmare fall through space This flying gets on one s nerves he said He could feel the airship diving down down down then slowly swinging to up up up Throb throb throb throb quivered the engine He got up presently and wrapped himself about with mister Butteridge s overcoat and all the blankets for the air was very keen Then he peeped out of the window to see a grey dawn breaking over clouds then turned up his light and bolted his door sat down to the table and produced his chest protector He smoothed the crumpled plans with his hand and contemplated them Then he referred to the other drawings in the portfolio Twenty thousand pounds If he worked it right It was worth trying anyhow Presently he opened the drawer in which Kurt had put paper and writing materials Bert Smallways was by no means a stupid person and up to a certain limit he had not been badly educated His board school had taught him to draw up to certain limits taught him to calculate and understand a specification If at that point his country had tired of its efforts and handed him over unfinished to scramble for a living in an atmosphere of advertisments and individual enterprise that was really not his fault He was as his State had made him and the reader must not imagine because he was a little Cockney cad that he was absolutely incapable of grasping the idea of the Butteridge flying machine But he found it stiff and perplexing His motor bicycle and Grubb s experiments and the mechanical drawing he had done in standard seven all helped him out and moreover the maker of these drawings whoever he was had been anxious to make his intentions plain Bert copied sketches he made notes he made a quite tolerable and intelligent copy of the essential drawings and sketches of the others Then he fell into a meditation upon them At last he rose with a sigh folded up the originals that had formerly been in his chest protector and put them into the breast pocket of his jacket and then very carefully deposited the copies he had made in the place of the originals He had no very clear plan in his mind in doing this except that he hated the idea of altogether parting with the secret For a long time he meditated profoundly nodding Then he turned out his light and went to bed again and schemed himself to sleep six The hochgeboren Graf von Winterfeld was also a light sleeper that night but then he was one of these people who sleep little and play chess problems in their heads to while away the time and that night he had a particularly difficult problem to solve He came in upon Bert while he was still in bed in the glow of the sunlight reflected from the North Sea below consuming the rolls and coffee a soldier had brought him He had a portfolio under his arm and in the clear early morning light his dingy grey hair and heavy silver rimmed spectacles made him look almost benevolent He spoke English fluently but with a strong German flavour He was particularly bad with his b s and his th s softened towards weak z ds He called Bert explosively Pooterage He began with some indistinct civilities bowed took a folding table and chair from behind the door put the former between himself and Bert sat down on the latter coughed drily and opened his portfolio Then he put his elbows on the table pinched his lower lip with his two fore fingers and regarded Bert disconcertingly with magnified eyes You came to us Herr Pooterage against your will he said at last Ow d you make that out asked Bert after a pause of astonishment I chuge by ze maps in your car They were all English And your provisions They were all picnic Also your cords were entangled You haf been tugging but no good You could not manage ze balloon and anuzzer power than yours prought you to us Is it not so Bert thought Also where is ze laty Ere what lady You started with a laty That is evident You shtarted for an afternoon excursion a picnic A man of your temperament he would take a laty She was not wiz you in your balloon when you came down at Dornhof No Only her chacket It is your affair Still I am curious Bert reflected Ow d you know that I chuge by ze nature of your farious provisions I cannot account mister Pooterage for ze laty what you haf done with her Nor can I tell why you should wear nature sandals nor why you should wear such cheap plue clothes These are outside my instructions Trifles perhaps Officially they are to be ignored Laties come and go I am a man of ze worldt I haf known wise men wear sandals and efen practice vegetarian habits I haf known men or at any rate I haf known chemists who did not schmoke You haf no doubt put ze laty down somewhere Well Let us get to business A higher power his voice changed its emotional quality his magnified eyes seemed to dilate has prought you and your secret straight to us So he bowed his head so pe it It is ze Destiny of Chermany and my Prince I can undershtandt you always carry zat secret You are afraidt of roppers and spies So it comes wiz you to us mister Pooterage Chermany will puy it Will she She will said the secretary looking hard at Bert s abandoned sandals in the corner of the locker He roused himself consulted a paper of notes for a moment and Bert eyed his brown and wrinkled face with expectation and terror Chermany I am instructed to say said the secretary with his eyes on the table and his notes spread out has always been willing to puy your secret We haf indeed peen eager to acquire it fery eager and it was only ze fear that you might be on patriotic groundts acting in collusion with your Pritish War Office zat has made us discreet in offering for your marvellous invention through intermediaries We haf no hesitation whatefer now I am instructed in agreeing to your proposal of a hundert tousand poundts Crikey said Bert overwhelmed I peg your pardon Jest a twinge said Bert raising his hand to his bandaged head Ah Also I am instructed to say that as for that noble unrightly accused laty you haf championed so brafely against Pritish hypocrisy and coldness all ze chivalry of Chermany is on her site Lady said Bert faintly and then recalled the great Butteridge love story Had the old chap also read the letters He must think him a scorcher if he had Oh that s aw right he said about er I adn t any doubts about that I He stopped The secretary certainly had a most appalling stare It seemed ages before he looked down again Well ze laty as you please She is your affair I haf performt my instructions And ze title of Paron zat also can pe done It can all pe done Herr Pooterage He drummed on the table for a second or so and resumed I haf to tell you sir zat you come to us at a crisis in Welt Politik There can be no harm now for me to put our plans before you Pefore you leafe this ship again they will be manifest to all ze worldt War is perhaps already declared We go to America Our fleet will descend out of ze air upon ze United States it is a country quite unprepared for war eferywhere eferywhere Zey have always relied on ze Atlantic And their navy We have selected a certain point it is at present ze secret of our commanders which we shall seize and zen we shall establish a depot a sort of inland Gibraltar It will be what will it be an eagle s nest Zere our airships will gazzer and repair and thence they will fly to and fro ofer ze United States terrorising cities dominating Washington levying what is necessary until ze terms we dictate are accepted You follow me Go on said Bert We could haf done all zis wiz such Luftschiffe and Drachenflieger as we possess but ze accession of your machine renders our project complete It not only gifs us a better Drachenflieger but it remofes our last uneasiness as to Great Pritain Wizout you sir Great Pritain ze land you lofed so well and zat has requited you so ill zat land of Pharisees and reptiles can do nozzing nozzing You see I am perfectly frank wiz you Well I am instructed that Chermany recognises all this We want you to place yourself at our disposal We want you to become our Chief Head Flight Engineer We want you to manufacture we want to equip a swarm of hornets under your direction We want you to direct this force And it is at our depot in America we want you So we offer you simply and without haggling ze full terms you demanded weeks ago one hundert tousand poundts in cash a salary of three tousand poundts a year a pension of one tousand poundts a year and ze title of Paron as you desired These are my instructions He resumed his scrutiny of Bert s face That s all right of course said Bert a little short of breath but otherwise resolute and calm and it seemed to him that now was the time to bring his nocturnal scheming to the issue The secretary contemplated Bert s collar with sustained attention Only for one moment did his gaze move to the sandals and back Jes lemme think a bit said Bert finding the stare debilitating Look ere he said at last with an air of great explicitness I GOT the secret Yes But I don t want the name of Butteridge to appear see I been thinking that over A little delicacy Exactly You buy the secret leastways I give it you from Bearer see His voice failed him a little and the stare continued I want to do the thing Enonymously See Still staring Bert drifted on like a swimmer caught by a current Fact is I m going to edop the name of Smallways I don t want no title of Baron I ve altered my mind And I want the money quiet like I want the hundred thousand pounds paid into benks thirty thousand into the London and County Benk Branch at Bun Hill in Kent directly I and over the plans twenty thousand into the Benk of England arf the rest into a good French bank the other arf the German National Bank see I want it put there right away I don t want it put in the name of Butteridge I want it put in the name of Albert Peter Smallways that s the name I m going to edop That s condition one Go on said the secretary The nex condition said Bert is that you don t make any inquiries as to title I mean what English gentlemen do when they sell or let you land You don t arst ow I got it See Ere I am I deliver you the goods that s all right Some people ave the cheek to say this isn t my invention see It is you know THAT S all right but I don t want that gone into I want a fair and square agreement saying that s all right See His See faded into a profound silence The secretary sighed at last leant back in his chair and produced a tooth pick and used it to assist his meditation on Bert s case What was that name he asked at last putting away the tooth pick I must write it down Albert Peter Smallways said Bert in a mild tone The secretary wrote it down after a little difficulty about the spelling because of the different names of the letters of the alphabet in the two languages And now mister Schmallvays he said at last leaning back and resuming the stare tell me how did you ket hold of Mister Pooterage s balloon seven When at last the Graf von Winterfold left Bert Smallways he left him in an extremely deflated condition with all his little story told He had as people say made a clean breast of it He had been pursued into details He had had to explain the blue suit the sandals the Desert Dervishes everything For a time scientific zeal consumed the secretary and the question of the plans remained in suspense He even went into speculation about the previous occupants of the balloon I suppose he said the laty WAS the laty Bot that is not our affair It is fery curious and amusing yes but I am afraid the Prince may be annoyt He acted wiz his usual decision always he acts wiz wonterful decision Like Napoleon Directly he was tolt of your descent into the camp at Dornhof he said Pring him pring him It is my schtar His schtar of Destiny You see He will be dthwarted He directed you to come as Herr Pooterage and you haf not done so You haf triet of course but it has peen a poor try His chugments of men are fery just and right and it is better for men to act up to them gompletely Especially now Particularly now He resumed that attitude of his with his underlip pinched between his forefingers He spoke almost confidentially It will be awkward I triet to suggest some doubt but I was over ruled The Prince does not listen He is impatient in the high air Perhaps he will think his schtar has been making a fool of him Perhaps he will think I haf been making a fool of him He wrinkled his forehead and drew in the corners of his mouth I got the plans said Bert Yes There is that Yes But you see the Prince was interested in Herr Pooterage because of his romantic seit Herr Pooterage was so much more ah in the picture I am afraid you are not equal to controlling the flying machine department of our aerial park as he wished you to do He hadt promised himself that And der was also the prestige the worldt prestige of Pooterage with us Well we must see what we can do He held out his hand Gif me the plans A terrible chill ran through the being of mister Smallways To this day he is not clear in his mind whether he wept or no but certainly there was weeping in his voice Ere I say he protested Ain t I to ave nothin for em The secretary regarded him with benevolent eyes You do not deserve anyzing he said I might ave tore em up Zey are not yours They weren t Butteridge s No need to pay anyzing Bert s being seemed to tighten towards desperate deeds Gaw he said clutching his coat AIN T there Pe galm said the secretary Listen You shall haf five hundert poundts You shall haf it on my promise I will do that for you and that is all I can do Take it from me Gif me the name of that bank Write it down So I tell you the Prince is no choke I do not think he approffed of your appearance last night No I can t answer for him He wanted Pooterage and you haf spoilt it The Prince I do not understand quite he is in a strange state It is the excitement of the starting and this great soaring in the air I cannot account for what he does But if all goes well I will see to it you shall haf five hundert poundts Will that do Then gif me the plans Old beggar said Bert as the door clicked Gaw what an ole beggar SHARP He sat down in the folding chair and whistled noiselessly for a time Nice old swindle for im if I tore em up I could ave He rubbed the bridge of his nose thoughtfully I gave the whole blessed show away If I d j es kep quiet about being Enonymous Gaw Too soon Bert my boy too soon and too rushy I d like to kick my silly self I couldn t ave kep it up After all it ain t so very bad he said After all five undred pounds It isn t MY secret anyhow It s jes a pickup on the road Five undred Wonder what the fare is from America back home eight And later in the day an extremely shattered and disorganised Bert Smallways stood in the presence of the Prince Karl Albert The proceedings were in German The Prince was in his own cabin the end room of the airship a charming apartment furnished in wicker work with a long window across its entire breadth looking forward He was sitting at a folding table of green baize with Von Winterfeld and two officers sitting beside him and littered before them was a number of American maps and mister Butteridge s letters and his portfolio and a number of loose papers Bert was not asked to sit down and remained standing throughout the interview Von Winterfeld told his story and every now and then the words Ballon and Pooterage struck on Bert s ears The Prince s face remained stern and ominous and the two officers watched it cautiously or glanced at Bert There was something a little strange in their scrutiny of the Prince a curiosity an apprehension Then presently he was struck by an idea and they fell discussing the plans The Prince asked Bert abruptly in English Did you ever see this thing go op Bert jumped Saw it from Bun Ill your Royal Highness Von Winterfeld made some explanation How fast did it go Couldn t say your Royal Highness The papers leastways the Daily Courier said eighty miles an hour They talked German over that for a time Couldt it standt still Op in the air That is what I want to know It could ovver your Royal Highness like a wasp said Bert Viel besser nicht wahr said the Prince to Von Winterfeld and then went on in German for a time Presently they came to an end and the two officers looked at Bert One rang a bell and the portfolio was handed to an attendant who took it away Then they reverted to the case of Bert and it was evident the Prince was inclined to be hard with him Von Winterfeld protested Apparently theological considerations came in for there were several mentions of Gott Some conclusions emerged and it was apparent that Von Winterfeld was instructed to convey them to Bert mister Schmallvays you haf obtained a footing in this airship he said by disgraceful and systematic lying Ardly systematic said Bert I The Prince silenced him by a gesture And it is within the power of his Highness to dispose of you as a spy Ere I came to sell Ssh said one of the officers However in consideration of the happy chance that mate you the instrument unter Gott of this Pooterage flying machine reaching his Highness s hand you haf been spared Yes you were the pearer of goot tidings You will be allowed to remain on this ship until it is convenient to dispose of you Do you understandt We will bring him said the Prince and added terribly with a terrible glare als Ballast You are to come with us said Winterfeld as pallast Do you understandt Bert opened his mouth to ask about the five hundred pounds and then a saving gleam of wisdom silenced him He met Von Winterfeld s eye and it seemed to him the secretary nodded slightly Go said the Prince with a sweep of the great arm and hand towards the door Bert went out like a leaf before a gale nine But in between the time when the Graf von Winterfeld had talked to him and this alarming conference with the Prince Bert had explored the Vaterland from end to end He had found it interesting in spite of grave preoccupations Kurt like the greater number of the men upon the German air fleet had known hardly anything of aeronautics before his appointment to the new flagship But he was extremely keen upon this wonderful new weapon Germany had assumed so suddenly and dramatically He showed things to Bert with a boyish eagerness and appreciation It was as if he showed them over again to himself like a child showing a new toy Let s go all over the ship he said with zest He pointed out particularly the lightness of everything the use of exhausted aluminium tubing of springy cushions inflated with compressed hydrogen the partitions were hydrogen bags covered with light imitation leather the very crockery was a light biscuit glazed in a vacuum and weighed next to nothing Where strength was needed there was the new Charlottenburg alloy German steel as it was called the toughest and most resistant metal in the world There was no lack of space Space did not matter so long as load did not grow The habitable part of the ship was two hundred and fifty feet long and the rooms in two tiers above these one could go up into remarkable little white metal turrets with big windows and airtight double doors that enabled one to inspect the vast cavity of the gas chambers This inside view impressed Bert very much He had never realised before that an airship was not one simple continuous gas bag containing nothing but gas Now he saw far above him the backbone of the apparatus and its big ribs like the neural and haemal canals said Kurt who had dabbled in biology Rather said Bert appreciatively though he had not the ghost of an idea what these phrases meant Little electric lights could be switched on up there if anything went wrong in the night There were even ladders across the space But you can t go into the gas protested Bert You can t breve it The lieutenant opened a cupboard door and displayed a diver s suit only that it was made of oiled silk and both its compressed air knapsack and its helmet were of an alloy of aluminium and some light metal We can go all over the inside netting and stick up bullet holes or leaks he explained There s netting inside and out The whole outer case is rope ladder so to speak Aft of the habitable part of the airship was the magazine of explosives coming near the middle of its length They were all bombs of various types mostly in glass none of the German airships carried any guns at all except one small pom pom to use the old English nickname dating from the Boer war which was forward in the gallery upon the shield at the heart of the eagle From the magazine amidships a covered canvas gallery with aluminium treads on its floor and a hand rope ran back underneath the gas chamber to the engine room at the tail but along this Bert did not go and from first to last he never saw the engines But he went up a ladder against a gale of ventilation a ladder that was encased in a kind of gas tight fire escape and ran right athwart the great forward air chamber to the little look out gallery with a telephone that gallery that bore the light pom pom of German steel and its locker of shells This gallery was all of aluminium magnesium alloy the tight front of the air ship swelled cliff like above and below and the black eagle sprawled overwhelmingly gigantic its extremities all hidden by the bulge of the gas bag And far down under the soaring eagles was England four thousand feet below perhaps and looking very small and defenceless indeed in the morning sunlight The realisation that there was England gave Bert sudden and unexpected qualms of patriotic compunction He was struck by a quite novel idea After all he might have torn up those plans and thrown them away These people could not have done so very much to him And even if they did ought not an Englishman to die for his country It was an idea that had hitherto been rather smothered up by the cares of a competitive civilisation He became violently depressed He ought he perceived to have seen it in that light before Why hadn t he seen it in that light before Indeed wasn t he a sort of traitor He wondered how the aerial fleet must look from down there Tremendous no doubt and dwarfing all the buildings He was passing between Manchester and Liverpool Kurt told him a gleaming band across the prospect was the Ship Canal and a weltering ditch of shipping far away ahead the Mersey estuary Bert was a Southerner he had never been north of the Midland counties and the multitude of factories and chimneys the latter for the most part obsolete and smokeless now superseded by huge electric generating stations that consumed their own reek old railway viaducts mono rail net works and goods yards and the vast areas of dingy homes and narrow streets spreading aimlessly struck him as though Camberwell and Rotherhithe had run to seed Here and there as if caught in a net were fields and agricultural fragments It was a sprawl of undistinguished population There were no doubt museums and town halls and even cathedrals of a sort to mark theoretical centres of municipal and religious organisation in this confusion but Bert could not see them they did not stand out at all in that wide disorderly vision of congested workers houses and places to work and shops and meanly conceived chapels and churches And across this landscape of an industrial civilisation swept the shadows of the German airships like a hurrying shoal of fishes Kurt and he fell talking of aerial tactics and presently went down to the undergallery in order that Bert might see the Drachenflieger that the airships of the right wing had picked up overnight and were towing behind them each airship towing three or four They looked like big box kites of an exaggerated form soaring at the ends of invisible cords They had long square heads and flattened tails with lateral propellers Much skill is required for those much skill Rather Pause Your machine is different from that mister Butteridge Quite different said Bert More like an insect and less like a bird And it buzzes and don t drive about so What can those things do Kurt was not very clear upon that himself and was still explaining when Bert was called to the conference we have recorded with the Prince And after that was over the last traces of Butteridge fell from Bert like a garment and he became Smallways to all on board The soldiers ceased to salute him and the officers ceased to seem aware of his existence except Lieutenant Kurt He was turned out of his nice cabin and packed in with his belongings to share that of Lieutenant Kurt whose luck it was to be junior and the bird headed officer still swearing slightly and carrying strops and aluminium boot trees and weightless hair brushes and hand mirrors and pomade in his hands resumed possession Bert was put in with Kurt because there was nowhere else for him to lay his bandaged head in that close packed vessel He was to mess he was told with the men Kurt came and stood with his legs wide apart and surveyed him for a moment as he sat despondent in his new quarters What s your real name then said Kurt who was only imperfectly informed of the new state of affairs Smallways I thought you were a bit of a fraud even when I thought you were Butteridge You re jolly lucky the Prince took it calmly He s a pretty tidy blazer when he s roused He wouldn t stick a moment at pitching a chap of your sort overboard if he thought fit No They ve shoved you on to me but it s my cabin you know I won t forget said Bert Kurt left him and when he came to look about him the first thing he saw pasted on the padded wall was a reproduction of the great picture by Siegfried Schmalz of the War God that terrible trampling figure with the viking helmet and the scarlet cloak wading through destruction sword in hand which had so strong a resemblance to Karl Albert the prince it was painted to please CHAPTER V THE BATTLE OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC one The Prince Karl Albert had made a profound impression upon Bert He was quite the most terrifying person Bert had ever encountered He filled the Smallways soul with passionate dread and antipathy For a long time Bert sat alone in Kurt s cabin doing nothing and not venturing even to open the door lest he should be by that much nearer that appalling presence So it came about that he was probably the last person on board to hear the news that wireless telegraphy was bringing to the airship in throbs and fragments of a great naval battle in progress in mid Atlantic He learnt it at last from Kurt Kurt came in with a general air of ignoring Bert but muttering to himself in English nevertheless Stupendous Bert heard him say Here he said get off this locker And he proceeded to rout out two books and a case of maps He spread them on the folding table and stood regarding them For a time his Germanic discipline struggled with his English informality and his natural kindliness and talkativeness and at last lost They re at it Smallways he said At what sir said Bert broken and respectful Fighting The American North Atlantic squadron and pretty nearly the whole of our fleet Our Eiserne Kreuz has had a gruelling and is sinking and their Miles Standish she s one of their biggest has sunk with all hands Torpedoes I suppose She was a bigger ship than the Karl der Grosse but five or six years older Gods I wish we could see it Smallways a square fight in blue water guns or nothing and all of em steaming ahead He spread his maps he had to talk and so he delivered a lecture on the naval situation to Bert Here it is he said latitude thirty degrees fifty minutes N longitude thirty degrees fifty minutes W It s a good day off us anyhow and they re all going south west by south at full pelt as hard as they can go We shan t see a bit of it worse luck Not a sniff we shan t get two The naval situation in the North Atlantic at that time was a peculiar one The United States was by far the stronger of the two powers upon the sea but the bulk of the American fleet was still in the Pacific It was in the direction of Asia that war had been most feared for the situation between Asiatic and white had become unusually violent and dangerous and the Japanese government had shown itself quite unprecedentedly difficult The German attack therefore found half the American strength at Manila and what was called the Second Fleet strung out across the Pacific in wireless contact between the Asiatic station and San Francisco The North Atlantic squadron was the sole American force on her eastern shore it was returning from a friendly visit to France and Spain and was pumping oil fuel from tenders in mid Atlantic for most of its ships were steamships when the international situation became acute It was made up of four battleships and five armoured cruisers ranking almost with battleships not one of which was of a later date than nineteen thirteen The Americans had indeed grown so accustomed to the idea that Great Britain could be trusted to keep the peace of the Atlantic that a naval attack on the eastern seaboard found them unprepared even in their imaginations But long before the declaration of war indeed on Whit Monday the whole German fleet of eighteen battleships with a flotilla of fuel tenders and converted liners containing stores to be used in support of the air fleet had passed through the straits of Dover and headed boldly for New York Not only did these German battleships outnumber the Americans two to one but they were more heavily armed and more modern in construction seven of them having high explosive engines built of Charlottenburg steel and all carrying Charlottenburg steel guns The fleets came into contact on Wednesday before any actual declaration of war The Americans had strung out in the modern fashion at distances of thirty miles or so and were steaming to keep themselves between the Germans and either the eastern states or Panama because vital as it was to defend the seaboard cities and particularly New York it was still more vital to save the canal from any attack that might prevent the return of the main fleet from the Pacific No doubt said Kurt this was now making records across that ocean unless the Japanese have had the same idea as the Germans It was obviously beyond human possibility that the American North Atlantic fleet could hope to meet and defeat the German but on the other hand with luck it might fight a delaying action and inflict such damage as to greatly weaken the attack upon the coast defences Its duty indeed was not victory but devotion the severest task in the world Meanwhile the submarine defences of New York Panama and the other more vital points could be put in some sort of order This was the naval situation and until Wednesday in Whit week it was the only situation the American people had realised It was then they heard for the first time of the real scale of the Dornhof aeronautic park and the possibility of an attack coming upon them not only by sea but by the air But it is curious that so discredited were the newspapers of that period that a large majority of New Yorkers for example did not believe the most copious and circumstantial accounts of the German air fleet until it was actually in sight of New York Kurt s talk was half soliloquy He stood with a map on Mercator s projection before him swaying to the swinging of the ship and talking of guns and tonnage of ships and their build and powers and speed of strategic points and bases of operation A certain shyness that reduced him to the status of a listener at the officers table no longer silenced him Bert stood by saying very little but watching Kurt s finger on the map They ve been saying things like this in the papers for a long time he remarked Fancy it coming real Kurt had a detailed knowledge of the Miles Standish She used to be a crack ship for gunnery held the record I wonder if we beat her shooting or how I wish I was in it I wonder which of our ships beat her Maybe she got a shell in her engines It s a running fight I wonder what the Barbarossa is doing he went on She s my old ship Not a first rater but good stuff I bet she s got a shot or two home by now if old Schneider s up to form Just think of it There they are whacking away at each other great guns going shells exploding magazines bursting ironwork flying about like straw in a gale all we ve been dreaming of for years I suppose we shall fly right away to New York just as though it wasn t anything at all I suppose we shall reckon we aren t wanted down there It s no more than a covering fight on our side All those tenders and store ships of ours are going on southwest by west to New York to make a floating depot for us See He dabbed his forefinger on the map Here we are Our train of stores goes there our battleships elbow the Americans out of our way there When Bert went down to the men s mess room to get his evening ration hardly any one took notice of him except just to point him out for an instant Every one was talking of the battle suggesting contradicting at times until the petty officers hushed them it rose to a great uproar There was a new bulletin but what it said he did not gather except that it concerned the Barbarossa Some of the men stared at him and he heard the name of Booteraidge several times but no one molested him and there was no difficulty about his soup and bread when his turn at the end of the queue came He had feared there might be no ration for him and if so he did not know what he would have done Afterwards he ventured out upon the little hanging gallery with the solitary sentinel The weather was still fine but the wind was rising and the rolling swing of the airship increasing He clutched the rail tightly and felt rather giddy They were now out of sight of land and over blue water rising and falling in great masses A dingy old brigantine under the British flag rose and plunged amid the broad blue waves the only ship in sight three In the evening it began to blow and the air ship to roll like a porpoise as it swung through the air Kurt said that several of the men were sea sick but the motion did not inconvenience Bert whose luck it was to be of that mysterious gastric disposition which constitutes a good sailor He slept well but in the small hours the light awoke him and he found Kurt staggering about in search of something He found it at last in the locker and held it in his hand unsteadily a compass Then he compared his map We ve changed our direction he said and come into the wind I can t make it out We ve turned away from New York to the south Almost as if we were going to take a hand He continued talking to himself for some time Day came wet and windy The window was bedewed externally and they could see nothing through it It was also very cold and Bert decided to keep rolled up in his blankets on the locker until the bugle summoned him to his morning ration That consumed he went out on the little gallery but he could see nothing but eddying clouds driving headlong by and the dim outlines of the nearer airships Only at rare intervals could he get a glimpse of grey sea through the pouring cloud drift Later in the morning the Vaterland changed altitude and soared up suddenly in a high clear sky going Kurt said to a height of nearly thirteen thousand feet Bert was in his cabin and chanced to see the dew vanish from the window and caught the gleam of sunlight outside He looked out and saw once more that sunlit cloud floor he had seen first from the balloon and the ships of the German air fleet rising one by one from the white as fish might rise and become visible from deep water He stared for a moment and then ran out to the little gallery to see this wonder better Below was cloudland and storm a great drift of tumbled weather going hard away to the north east and the air about him was clear and cold and serene save for the faintest chill breeze and a rare drifting snow flake Throb throb throb throb went the engines in the stillness That huge herd of airships rising one after another had an effect of strange portentous monsters breaking into an altogether unfamiliar world Either there was no news of the naval battle that morning or the Prince kept to himself whatever came until past midday Then the bulletins came with a rush bulletins that made the lieutenant wild with excitement Barbarossa disabled and sinking he cried Gott im Himmel Der alte Barbarossa Aber welch ein braver krieger He walked about the swinging cabin and for a time he was wholly German Then he became English again Think of it Smallways The old ship we kept so clean and tidy All smashed about and the iron flying about in fragments and the chaps one knew Gott flying about too Scalding water squirting fire and the smash smash of the guns They smash when you re near Like everything bursting to pieces Wool won t stop it nothing And me up here so near and so far Der alte Barbarossa Any other ships asked Smallways presently Gott Yes We ve lost the Karl der Grosse our best and biggest Run down in the night by a British liner that blundered into the fighting in trying to blunder out They re fighting in a gale The liner s afloat with her nose broken sagging about There never was such a battle never before Good ships and good men on both sides and a storm and the night and the dawn and all in the open ocean full steam ahead No stabbing No submarines Guns and shooting Half our ships we don t hear of any more because their masts are shot away Latitude thirty degrees forty minutes N longitude forty degrees thirty minutes W where s that He routed out his map again and stared at it with eyes that did not see Der alte Barbarossa I can t get it out of my head with shells in her engine room and the fires flying out of her furnaces and the stokers and engineers scalded and dead Men I ve messed with Smallways men I ve talked to close And they ve had their day at last And it wasn t all luck for them Disabled and sinking I suppose everybody can t have all the luck in a battle Poor old Schneider I bet he gave em something back So it was the news of the battle came filtering through to them all that morning The Americans had lost a second ship name unknown the Hermann had been damaged in covering the Barbarossa Kurt fretted like an imprisoned animal about the airship now going up to the forward gallery under the eagle now down into the swinging gallery now poring over his maps He infected Smallways with a sense of the immediacy of this battle that was going on just over the curve of the earth But when Bert went down to the gallery the world was empty and still a clear inky blue sky above and a rippled veil of still thin sunlit cirrus below through which one saw a racing drift of rain cloud and never a glimpse of sea Throb throb throb throb went the engines and the long undulating wedge of airships hurried after the flagship like a flight of swans after their leader Save for the quiver of the engines it was as noiseless as a dream And down there somewhere in the wind and rain guns roared shells crashed home and after the old manner of warfare men toiled and died four As the afternoon wore on the lower weather abated and the sea became intermittently visible again The air fleet dropped slowly to the middle air and towards sunset they had a glimpse of the disabled Barbarossa far away to the east Smallways heard men hurrying along the passage and was drawn out to the gallery where he found nearly a dozen officers collected and scrutinising the helpless ruins of the battleship through field glasses Two other vessels stood by her one an exhausted petrol tank very high out of the water and the other a converted liner Kurt was at the end of the gallery a little apart from the others Gott he said at last lowering his binocular it is like seeing an old friend with his nose cut off waiting to be finished Der Barbarossa With a sudden impulse he handed his glass to Bert who had peered beneath his hands ignored by every one seeing the three ships merely as three brown black lines upon the sea Never had Bert seen the like of that magnified slightly hazy image before It was not simply a battered ironclad that wallowed helpless it was a mangled ironclad It seemed wonderful she still floated Her powerful engines had been her ruin In the long chase of the night she had got out of line with her consorts and nipped in between the Susquehanna and the Kansas City They discovered her proximity dropped back until she was nearly broadside on to the former battleship and signalled up the Theodore Roosevelt and the little Monitor As dawn broke she had found herself hostess of a circle The fight had not lasted five minutes before the appearance of the Hermann to the east and immediately after of the Furst Bismarck in the west forced the Americans to leave her but in that time they had smashed her iron to rags They had vented the accumulated tensions of their hard day s retreat upon her As Bert saw her she seemed a mere metal worker s fantasy of frozen metal writhings He could not tell part from part of her except by its position Gott murmured Kurt taking the glasses Bert restored to him Gott Da waren Albrecht der gute Albrecht und der alte Zimmermann und von Rosen Long after the Barbarosa had been swallowed up in the twilight and distance he remained on the gallery peering through his glasses and when he came back to his cabin he was unusually silent and thoughtful This is a rough game Smallways he said at last this war is a rough game Somehow one sees it different after a thing like that Many men there were worked to make that Barbarossa and there were men in it one does not meet the like of them every day Albrecht there was a man named Albrecht played the zither and improvised I keep on wondering what has happened to him He and I we were very close friends after the German fashion Smallways woke the next night to discover the cabin in darkness a draught blowing through it and Kurt talking to himself in German He could see him dimly by the window which he had unscrewed and opened peering down That cold clear attenuated light which is not so much light as a going of darkness which casts inky shadows and so often heralds the dawn in the high air was on his face What s the row said Bert Shut up said the lieutenant Can t you hear Into the stillness came the repeated heavy thud of guns one two a pause then three in quick succession Gaw said Bert guns and was instantly at the lieutenant s side The airship was still very high and the sea below was masked by a thin veil of clouds The wind had fallen and Bert following Kurt s pointing finger saw dimly through the colourless veil first a red glow then a quick red flash and then at a little distance from it another They were it seemed for a while silent flashes and seconds after when one had ceased to expect them came the belated thuds thud thud Kurt spoke in German very quickly A bugle call rang through the airship Kurt sprang to his feet saying something in an excited tone still using German and went to the door I say What s up cried Bert What s that The lieutenant stopped for an instant in the doorway dark against the light passage You stay where you are Smallways You keep there and do nothing We re going into action he explained and vanished Bert s heart began to beat rapidly He felt himself poised over the fighting vessels far below In a moment were they to drop like a hawk striking a bird Gaw he whispered at last in awestricken tones Thud thud He discovered far away a second ruddy flare flashing guns back at the first He perceived some difference on the Vaterland for which he could not account and then he realised that the engines had slowed to an almost inaudible beat He stuck his head out of the window it was a tight fit and saw in the bleak air the other airships slowed down to a scarcely perceptible motion A second bugle sounded was taken up faintly from ship to ship Out went the lights the fleet became dim dark bulks against an intense blue sky that still retained an occasional star For a long time they hung for an interminable time it seemed to him and then began the sound of air being pumped into the balloonette and slowly slowly the Vaterland sank down towards the clouds He craned his neck but he could not see if the rest of the fleet was following them the overhang of the gas chambers intervened There was something that stirred his imagination deeply in that stealthy noiseless descent The obscurity deepened for a time the last fading star on the horizon vanished and he felt the cold presence of cloud Then suddenly the glow beneath assumed distinct outlines became flames and the Vaterland ceased to descend and hung observant and it would seem unobserved just beneath a drifting stratum of cloud a thousand feet perhaps over the battle below In the night the struggling naval battle and retreat had entered upon a new phase The Americans had drawn together the ends of the flying line skilfully and dexterously until at last it was a column and well to the south of the lax sweeping pursuit of the Germans Then in the darkness before the dawn they had come about and steamed northward in close order with the idea of passing through the German battle line and falling upon the flotilla that was making for New York in support of the German air fleet Much had altered since the first contact of the fleets By this time the American admiral O Connor was fully informed of the existence of the airships and he was no longer vitally concerned for Panama since the submarine flotilla was reported arrived there from Key West and the Delaware and Abraham Lincoln two powerful and entirely modern ships were already at Rio Grande on the Pacific side of the canal His manoeuvre was however delayed by a boiler explosion on board the Susquehanna and dawn found this ship in sight of and indeed so close to the Bremen and Weimar that they instantly engaged There was no alternative to her abandonment but a fleet engagement O Connor chose the latter course It was by no means a hopeless fight The Germans though much more numerous and powerful than the Americans were in a dispersed line measuring nearly forty five miles from end to end and there were many chances that before they could gather in for the fight the column of seven Americans would have ripped them from end to end The day broke dim and overcast and neither the Bremen nor the Weimar realised they had to deal with more than the Susquehanna until the whole column drew out from behind her at a distance of a mile or less and bore down on them This was the position of affairs when the Vaterland appeared in the sky The red glow Bert had seen through the column of clouds came from the luckless Susquehanna she lay almost immediately below burning fore and aft but still fighting two of her guns and steaming slowly southward The Bremen and the Weimar both hit in several places were going west by south and away from her The American fleet headed by the Theodore Roosevelt was crossing behind them pounding them in succession steaming in between them and the big modern Furst Bismarck which was coming up from the west To Bert however the names of all these ships were unknown and for a considerable time indeed misled by the direction in which the combatants were moving he imagined the Germans to be Americans and the Americans Germans He saw what appeared to him to be a column of six battleships pursuing three others who were supported by a newcomer until the fact that the Bremen and Weimar were firing into the Susquehanna upset his calculations Then for a time he was hopelessly at a loss The noise of the guns too confused him they no longer seemed to boom they went whack whack whack whack and each faint flash made his heart jump in anticipation of the instant impact He saw these ironclads too not in profile as he was accustomed to see ironclads in pictures but in plan and curiously foreshortened For the most part they presented empty decks but here and there little knots of men sheltered behind steel bulwarks The long agitated noses of their big guns jetting thin transparent flashes and the broadside activity of the quick firers were the chief facts in this bird s eye view The Americans being steam turbine ships had from two to four blast funnels each the Germans lay lower in the water having explosive engines which now for some reason made an unwonted muttering roar Because of their steam propulsion the American ships were larger and with a more graceful outline He saw all these foreshortened ships rolling considerably and fighting their guns over a sea of huge low waves and under the cold explicit light of dawn The whole spectacle waved slowly with the long rhythmic rising and beat of the airship At first only the Vaterland of all the flying fleet appeared upon the scene below She hovered high over the Theodore Roosevelt keeping pace with the full speed of that ship From that ship she must have been intermittently visible through the drifting clouds The rest of the German fleet remained above the cloud canopy at a height of six or seven thousand feet communicating with the flagship by wireless telegraphy but risking no exposure to the artillery below It is doubtful at what particular time the unlucky Americans realised the presence of this new factor in the fight No account now survives of their experience We have to imagine as well as we can what it must have been to a battled strained sailor suddenly glancing upward to discover that huge long silent shape overhead vaster than any battleship and trailing now from its hinder quarter a big German flag Presently as the sky cleared more of such ships appeared in the blue through the dissolving clouds and more all disdainfully free of guns or armour all flying fast to keep pace with the running fight below From first to last no gun whatever was fired at the Vaterland and only a few rifle shots It was a mere adverse stroke of chance that she had a man killed aboard her Nor did she take any direct share in the fight until the end She flew above the doomed American fleet while the Prince by wireless telegraphy directed the movements of her consorts Meanwhile the Vogel stern and Preussen each with half a dozen drachenflieger in tow went full speed ahead and then dropped through the clouds perhaps five miles ahead of the Americans The Theodore Roosevelt let fly at once with the big guns in her forward barbette but the shells burst far below the Vogel stern and forthwith a dozen single man drachenflieger were swooping down to make their attack Bert craning his neck through the cabin port hole saw the whole of that incident that first encounter of aeroplane and ironclad He saw the queer German drachenflieger with their wide flat wings and square box shaped heads their wheeled bodies and their single man riders soar down the air like a flight of birds Gaw he said One to the right pitched extravagantly shot steeply up into the air burst with a loud report and flamed down into the sea another plunged nose forward into the water and seemed to fly to pieces as it hit the waves He saw little men on the deck of the Theodore Roosevelt below men foreshortened in plan into mere heads and feet running out preparing to shoot at the others Then the foremost flying machine was rushing between Bert and the American s deck and then bang came the thunder of its bomb flung neatly at the forward barbette and a thin little crackling of rifle shots in reply Whack whack whack went the quick firing guns of the Americans battery and smash came an answering shell from the Furst Bismarck Then a second and third flying machine passed between Bert and the American ironclad dropping bombs also and a fourth its rider hit by a bullet reeled down and dashed itself to pieces and exploded between the shot torn funnels blowing them apart Bert had a momentary glimpse of a little black creature jumping from the crumpling frame of the flying machine hitting the funnel and falling limply to be instantly caught and driven to nothingness by the blaze and rush of the explosion Smash came a vast explosion in the forward part of the flagship and a huge piece of metalwork seemed to lift out of her and dump itself into the sea dropping men and leaving a gap into which a prompt drachenflieger planted a flaring bomb And then for an instant Bert perceived only too clearly in the growing pitiless light a number of minute convulsively active animalcula scorched and struggling in the Theodore Roosevelt s foaming wake What were they Not men surely not men Those drowning mangled little creatures tore with their clutching fingers at Bert s soul Oh Gord he cried Oh Gord almost whimpering He looked again and they had gone and the black stem of the Andrew Jackson a little disfigured by the sinking Bremen s last shot was parting the water that had swallowed them into two neatly symmetrical waves For some moments sheer blank horror blinded Bert to the destruction below Then with an immense rushing sound bearing as it were a straggling volley of crashing minor explosions on its back the Susquehanna three miles and more now to the east blew up and vanished abruptly in a boiling steaming welter For a moment nothing was to be seen but tumbled water and then there came belching up from below with immense gulping noises eructations of steam and air and petrol and fragments of canvas and woodwork and men That made a distinct pause in the fight It seemed a long pause to Bert He found himself looking for the drachenflieger The flattened ruin of one was floating abeam of the Monitor the rest had passed dropping bombs down the American column several were in the water and apparently uninjured and three or four were still in the air and coming round now in a wide circle to return to their mother airships The American ironclads were no longer in column formation the Theodore Roosevelt badly damaged had turned to the southeast and the Andrew Jackson greatly battered but uninjured in any fighting part was passing between her and the still fresh and vigorous Furst Bismarck to intercept and meet the latter s fire Away to the west the Hermann and the Germanicus had appeared and were coming into action In the pause after the Susquehanna s disaster Bert became aware of a trivial sound like the noise of an ill greased ill hung door that falls ajar the sound of the men in the Furst Bismarck cheering And in that pause in the uproar too the sun rose the dark waters became luminously blue and a torrent of golden light irradiated the world It came like a sudden smile in a scene of hate and terror The cloud veil had vanished as if by magic and the whole immensity of the German air fleet was revealed in the sky the air fleet stooping now upon its prey Whack bang whack bang the guns resumed but ironclads were not built to fight the zenith and the only hits the Americans scored were a few lucky chances in a generally ineffectual rifle fire Their column was now badly broken the Susquehanna had gone the Theodore Roosevelt had fallen astern out of the line with her forward guns disabled in a heap of wreckage and the Monitor was in some grave trouble These two had ceased fire altogether and so had the Bremen and Weimar all four ships lying within shot of each other in an involuntary truce and with their respective flags still displayed Only four American ships now with the Andrew Jackson leading kept to the south easterly course And the Furst Bismarck the Hermann and the Germanicus steamed parallel to them and drew ahead of them fighting heavily The Vaterland rose slowly in the air in preparation for the concluding act of the drama Then falling into place one behind the other a string of a dozen airships dropped with unhurrying swiftness down the air in pursuit of the American fleet They kept at a height of two thousand feet or more until they were over and a little in advance of the rearmost ironclad and then stooped swiftly down into a fountain of bullets and going just a little faster than the ship below pelted her thinly protected decks with bombs until they became sheets of detonating flame So the airships passed one after the other along the American column as it sought to keep up its fight with the Furst Bismarck the Hermann and the Germanicus and each airship added to the destruction and confusion its predecessor had made The American gunfire ceased except for a few heroic shots but they still steamed on obstinately unsubdued bloody battered and wrathfully resistant spitting bullets at the airships and unmercifully pounded by the German ironclads But now Bert had but intermittent glimpses of them between the nearer bulks of the airships that assailed them It struck Bert suddenly that the whole battle was receding and growing small and less thunderously noisy The Vaterland was rising in the air steadily and silently until the impact of the guns no longer smote upon the heart but came to the ear dulled by distance until the four silenced ships to the eastward were little distant things but were there four Bert now could see only three of those floating blackened and smoking rafts of ruin against the sun But the Bremen had two boats out the Theodore Roosevelt was also dropping boats to where the drift of minute objects struggled rising and falling on the big broad Atlantic waves The Vaterland was no longer following the fight The whole of that hurrying tumult drove away to the south eastward growing smaller and less audible as it passed One of the airships lay on the water burning a remote monstrous fount of flames and far in the south west appeared first one and then three other German ironclads hurrying in support of their consorts five Steadily the Vaterland soared and the air fleet soared with her and came round to head for New York and the battle became a little thing far away an incident before the breakfast It dwindled to a string of dark shapes and one smoking yellow flare that presently became a mere indistinct smear upon the vast horizon and the bright new day that was at last altogether lost to sight So it was that Bert Smallways saw the first fight of the airship and the last fight of those strangest things in the whole history of war the ironclad battleships which began their career with the floating batteries of the Emperor Napoleon III in the Crimean war and lasted with an enormous expenditure of human energy and resources for seventy years In that space of time the world produced over twelve thousand five hundred of these strange monsters in schools in types in series each larger and heavier and more deadly than its predecessors Each in its turn was hailed as the last birth of time most in their turn were sold for old iron Only about five per cent of them ever fought in a battle Some foundered some went ashore and broke up several rammed one another by accident and sank The lives of countless men were spent in their service the splendid genius and patience of thousands of engineers and inventors wealth and material beyond estimating to their account we must put stunted and starved lives on land millions of children sent to toil unduly innumerable opportunities of fine living undeveloped and lost Money had to be found for them at any cost that was the law of a nation s existence during that strange time Surely they were the weirdest most destructive and wasteful megatheria in the whole history of mechanical invention And then cheap things of gas and basket work made an end of them altogether smiting out of the sky Never before had Bert Smallways seen pure destruction never had he realised the mischief and waste of war His startled mind rose to the conception this also is in life Out of all this fierce torrent of sensation one impression rose and became cardinal the impression of the men of the Theodore Roosevelt who had struggled in the water after the explosion of the first bomb Gaw he said at the memory it might ave been me and Grubb I suppose you kick about and get the water in your mouf I don t suppose it lasts long He became anxious to see how Kurt was affected by these things Also he perceived he was hungry He hesitated towards the door of the cabin and peeped out into the passage Down forward near the gangway to the men s mess stood a little group of air sailors looking at something that was hidden from him in a recess One of them was in the light diver s costume Bert had already seen in the gas chamber turret and he was moved to walk along and look at this person more closely and examine the helmet he carried under his arm But he forgot about the helmet when he got to the recess because there he found lying on the floor the dead body of the boy who had been killed by a bullet from the Theodore Roosevelt Bert had not observed that any bullets at all had reached the Vaterland or indeed imagined himself under fire He could not understand for a time what had killed the lad and no one explained to him The boy lay just as he had fallen and died with his jacket torn and scorched his shoulder blade smashed and burst away from his body and all the left side of his body ripped and rent There was much blood The sailors stood listening to the man with the helmet who made explanations and pointed to the round bullet hole in the floor and the smash in the panel of the passage upon which the still vicious missile had spent the residue of its energy All the faces were grave and earnest they were the faces of sober blond blue eyed men accustomed to obedience and an orderly life to whom this waste wet painful thing that had been a comrade came almost as strangely as it did to Bert A peal of wild laughter sounded down the passage in the direction of the little gallery and something spoke almost shouted in German in tones of exultation Other voices at a lower more respectful pitch replied Der Prinz said a voice and all the men became stiffer and less natural Down the passage appeared a group of figures Lieutenant Kurt walking in front carrying a packet of papers He stopped point blank when he saw the thing in the recess and his ruddy face went white So said he in surprise The Prince was following him talking over his shoulder to Von Winterfeld and the Kapitan Eh he said to Kurt stopping in mid sentence and followed the gesture of Kurt s hand He glared at the crumpled object in the recess and seemed to think for a moment He made a slight careless gesture towards the boy s body and turned to the Kapitan Dispose of that he said in German and passed on finishing his sentence to Von Winterfeld in the same cheerful tone in which it had begun six The deep impression of helplessly drowning men that Bert had brought from the actual fight in the Atlantic mixed itself up inextricably with that of the lordly figure of Prince Karl Albert gesturing aside the dead body of the Vaterland sailor Hitherto he had rather liked the idea of war as being a jolly smashing exciting affair something like a Bank Holiday rag on a large scale and on the whole agreeable and exhilarating Now he knew it a little better The next day there was added to his growing disillusionment a third ugly impression trivial indeed to describe a mere necessary everyday incident of a state of war but very distressing to his urbanised imagination One writes urbanised to express the distinctive gentleness of the period It was quite peculiar to the crowded townsmen of that time and different altogether from the normal experience of any preceding age that they never saw anything killed never encountered save through the mitigating media of book or picture the fact of lethal violence that underlies all life Three times in his existence and three times only had Bert seen a dead human being and he had never assisted at the killing of anything bigger than a new born kitten The incident that gave him his third shock was the execution of one of the men on the Adler for carrying a box of matches The case was a flagrant one The man had forgotten he had it upon him when coming aboard Ample notice had been given to every one of the gravity of this offence and notices appeared at numerous points all over the airships The man s defence was that he had grown so used to the notices and had been so preoccupied with his work that he hadn t applied them to himself he pleaded in his defence what is indeed in military affairs another serious crime inadvertency He was tried by his captain and the sentence confirmed by wireless telegraphy by the Prince and it was decided to make his death an example to the whole fleet The Germans the Prince declared hadn t crossed the Atlantic to go wool gathering And in order that this lesson in discipline and obedience might be visible to every one it was determined not to electrocute or drown but hang the offender Accordingly the air fleet came clustering round the flagship like carp in a pond at feeding time The Adler hung at the zenith immediately alongside the flagship The whole crew of the Vaterland assembled upon the hanging gallery the crews of the other airships manned the air chambers that is to say clambered up the outer netting to the upper sides The officers appeared upon the machine gun platforms Bert thought it an altogether stupendous sight looking down as he was upon the entire fleet Far off below two steamers on the rippled blue water one British and the other flying the American flag seemed the minutest objects and marked the scale They were immensely distant Bert stood on the gallery curious to see the execution but uncomfortable because that terrible blond Prince was within a dozen feet of him glaring terribly with his arms folded and his heels together in military fashion They hung the man from the Adler They gave him sixty feet of rope so that he should hang and dangle in the sight of all evil doers who might be hiding matches or contemplating any kindred disobedience Bert saw the man standing a living reluctant man no doubt scared and rebellious enough in his heart but outwardly erect and obedient on the lower gallery of the Adler about a hundred yards away Then they had thrust him overboard Down he fell hands and feet extending until with a jerk he was at the end of the rope Then he ought to have died and swung edifyingly but instead a more terrible thing happened his head came right off and down the body went spinning to the sea feeble grotesque fantastic with the head racing it in its fall Ugh said Bert clutching the rail before him and a sympathetic grunt came from several of the men beside him So said the Prince stiffer and sterner glared for some seconds then turned to the gang way up into the airship For a long time Bert remained clinging to the railing of the gallery He was almost physically sick with the horror of this trifling incident He found it far more dreadful than the battle He was indeed a very degenerate latter day civilised person Late that afternoon Kurt came into the cabin and found him curled up on his locker and looking very white and miserable Kurt had also lost something of his pristine freshness Sea sick he asked No We ought to reach New York this evening There s a good breeze coming up under our tails Then we shall see things Bert did not answer Kurt opened out folding chair and table and rustled for a time with his maps Then he fell thinking darkly He roused himself presently and looked at his companion What s the matter he said Nothing Kurt stared threateningly What s the matter I saw them kill that chap I saw that flying machine man hit the funnels of the big ironclad I saw that dead chap in the passage I seen too much smashing and killing lately That s the matter I don t like it I didn t know war was this sort of thing I m a civilian I don t like it I don t like it said Kurt By Jove no I ve read about war and all that but when you see it it s different And I m gettin giddy I m gettin giddy I didn t mind a bit being up in that balloon at first but all this looking down and floating over things and smashing up people it s getting on my nerves See It ll have to get off again Kurt thought You re not the only one The men are all getting strung up The flying that s just flying Naturally it makes one a little swimmy in the head at first As for the killing we ve got to be blooded that s all We re tame civilised men And we ve got to get blooded I suppose there s not a dozen men on the ship who ve really seen bloodshed Nice quiet law abiding Germans they ve been so far Here they are in for it They re a bit squeamy now but you wait till they ve got their hands in He reflected Everybody s getting a bit strung up he said He turned again to his maps Bert sat crumpled up in the corner apparently heedless of him For some time both kept silence What did the Prince want to go and ang that chap for asked Bert suddenly That was all right said Kurt that was all right QUITE right Here were the orders plain as the nose on your face and here was that fool going about with matches Gaw I shan t forget that bit in a urry said Bert irrelevantly Kurt did not answer him He was measuring their distance from New York and speculating Wonder what the American aeroplanes are like he said Something like our drachenflieger We shall know by this time to morrow I wonder what we shall know I wonder Suppose after all they put up a fight Rum sort of fight He whistled softly and mused Presently he fretted out of the cabin and later Bert found him in the twilight upon the swinging platform staring ahead and speculating about the things that might happen on the morrow Clouds veiled the sea again and the long straggling wedge of air ships rising and falling as they flew seemed like a flock of strange new births in a Chaos that had neither earth nor water but only mist and sky CHAPTER VI HOW WAR CAME TO NEW YORK one The City of New York was in the year of the German attack the largest richest in many respects the most splendid and in some the wickedest city the world had ever seen She was the supreme type of the City of the Scientific Commercial Age she displayed its greatness its power its ruthless anarchic enterprise and its social disorganisation most strikingly and completely She had long ousted London from her pride of place as the modern Babylon she was the centre of the world s finance the world s trade and the world s pleasure and men likened her to the apocalyptic cities of the ancient prophets She sat drinking up the wealth of a continent as Rome once drank the wealth of the Mediterranean and Babylon the wealth of the east In her streets one found the extremes of magnificence and misery of civilisation and disorder In one quarter palaces of marble laced and crowned with light and flame and flowers towered up into her marvellous twilights beautiful beyond description in another a black and sinister polyglot population sweltered in indescribable congestion in warrens and excavations beyond the power and knowledge of government Her vice her crime her law alike were inspired by a fierce and terrible energy and like the great cities of mediaeval Italy her ways were dark and adventurous with private war It was the peculiar shape of Manhattan Island pressed in by arms of the sea on either side and incapable of comfortable expansion except along a narrow northward belt that first gave the New York architects their bias for extreme vertical dimensions Every need was lavishly supplied them money material labour only space was restricted To begin therefore they built high perforce But to do so was to discover a whole new world of architectural beauty of exquisite ascendant lines and long after the central congestion had been relieved by tunnels under the sea four colossal bridges over the east river and a dozen mono rail cables east and west the upward growth went on In many ways New York and her gorgeous plutocracy repeated Venice in the magnificence of her architecture painting metal work and sculpture for example in the grim intensity of her political method in her maritime and commercial ascendancy But she repeated no previous state at all in the lax disorder of her internal administration a laxity that made vast sections of her area lawless beyond precedent so that it was possible for whole districts to be impassable while civil war raged between street and street and for Alsatias to exist in her midst in which the official police never set foot She was an ethnic whirlpool The flags of all nations flew in her harbour and at the climax the yearly coming and going overseas numbered together upwards of two million human beings To Europe she was America to America she was the gateway of the world But to tell the story of New York would be to write a social history of the world saints and martyrs dreamers and scoundrels the traditions of a thousand races and a thousand religions went to her making and throbbed and jostled in her streets And over all that torrential confusion of men and purposes fluttered that strange flag the stars and stripes that meant at once the noblest thing in life and the least noble that is to say Liberty on the one hand and on the other the base jealousy the individual self seeker feels towards the common purpose of the State For many generations New York had taken no heed of war save as a thing that happened far away that affected prices and supplied the newspapers with exciting headlines and pictures The New Yorkers felt perhaps even more certainly than the English had done that war in their own land was an impossible thing In that they shared the delusion of all North America They felt as secure as spectators at a bullfight they risked their money perhaps on the result but that was all And such ideas of war as the common Americans possessed were derived from the limited picturesque adventurous war of the past They saw war as they saw history through an iridescent mist deodorised scented indeed with all its essential cruelties tactfully hidden away They were inclined to regret it as something ennobling to sigh that it could no longer come into their own private experience They read with interest if not with avidity of their new guns of their immense and still more immense ironclads of their incredible and still more incredible explosives but just what these tremendous engines of destruction might mean for their personal lives never entered their heads They did not so far as one can judge from their contemporary literature think that they meant anything to their personal lives at all They thought America was safe amidst all this piling up of explosives They cheered the flag by habit and tradition they despised other nations and whenever there was an international difficulty they were intensely patriotic that is to say they were ardently against any native politician who did not say threaten and do harsh and uncompromising things to the antagonist people They were spirited to Asia spirited to Germany so spirited to Great Britain that the international attitude of the mother country to her great daughter was constantly compared in contemporary caricature to that between a hen pecked husband and a vicious young wife And for the rest they all went about their business and pleasure as if war had died out with the megatherium And then suddenly into a world peacefully busied for the most part upon armaments and the perfection of explosives war came came the shock of realising that the guns were going off that the masses of inflammable material all over the world were at last ablaze two The immediate effect upon New York of the sudden onset of war was merely to intensify her normal vehemence The newspapers and magazines that fed the American mind for books upon this impatient continent had become simply material for the energy of collectors were instantly a coruscation of war pictures and of headlines that rose like rockets and burst like shells To the normal high strung energy of New York streets was added a touch of war fever Great crowds assembled more especially in the dinner hour in Madison Square about the Farragut monument to listen to and cheer patriotic speeches and a veritable epidemic of little flags and buttons swept through these great torrents of swiftly moving young people who poured into New York of a morning by car and mono rail and subway and train to toil and ebb home again between the hours of five and seven It was dangerous not to wear a war button The splendid music halls of the time sank every topic in patriotism and evolved scenes of wild enthusiasm strong men wept at the sight of the national banner sustained by the whole strength of the ballet and special searchlights and illuminations amazed the watching angels The churches re echoed the national enthusiasm in graver key and slower measure and the aerial and naval preparations on the East River were greatly incommoded by the multitude of excursion steamers which thronged helpfully cheering about them The trade in small arms was enormously stimulated and many overwrought citizens found an immediate relief for their emotions in letting off fireworks of a more or less heroic dangerous and national character in the public streets Small children s air balloons of the latest model attached to string became a serious check to the pedestrian in Central Park And amidst scenes of indescribable emotion the Albany legislature in permanent session and with a generous suspension of rules and precedents passed through both Houses the long disputed Bill for universal military service in New York State Critics of the American character are disposed to consider that up to the actual impact of the German attack the people of New York dealt altogether too much with the war as if it was a political demonstration Little or no damage they urge was done to either the German or Japanese forces by the wearing of buttons the waving of small flags the fireworks or the songs They forgot that under the conditions of warfare a century of science had brought about the non military section of the population could do no serious damage in any form to their enemies and that there was no reason therefore why they should not do as they did The balance of military efficiency was shifting back from the many to the few from the common to the specialised The days when the emotional infantryman decided battles had passed by for ever War had become a matter of apparatus of special training and skill of the most intricate kind It had become undemocratic And whatever the value of the popular excitement there can be no denying that the small regular establishment of the United States Government confronted by this totally unexpected emergency of an armed invasion from Europe acted with vigour science and imagination They were taken by surprise so far as the diplomatic situation was concerned and their equipment for building either navigables or aeroplanes was contemptible in comparison with the huge German parks Still they set to work at once to prove to the world that the spirit that had created the Monitor and the Southern submarines of eighteen sixty four was not dead The chief of the aeronautic establishment near West Point was Cabot Sinclair and he allowed himself but one single moment of the posturing that was so universal in that democratic time We have chosen our epitaphs he said to a reporter and we are going to have They did all they could Now run away The curious thing is that they did all do all they could there is no exception known Their only defect indeed was a defect of style One of the most striking facts historically about this war and the one that makes the complete separation that had arisen between the methods of warfare and the necessity of democratic support is the effectual secrecy of the Washington authorities about their airships They did not bother to confide a single fact of their preparations to the public They did not even condescend to talk to Congress They burked and suppressed every inquiry The war was fought by the President and the Secretaries of State in an entirely autocratic manner Such publicity as they sought was merely to anticipate and prevent inconvenient agitation to defend particular points They realised that the chief danger in aerial warfare from an excitable and intelligent public would be a clamour for local airships and aeroplanes to defend local interests This with such resources as they possessed might lead to a fatal division and distribution of the national forces Particularly they feared that they might be forced into a premature action to defend New York They realised with prophetic insight that this would be the particular advantage the Germans would seek So they took great pains to direct the popular mind towards defensive artillery and to divert it from any thought of aerial battle Their real preparations they masked beneath ostensible ones There was at Washington a large reserve of naval guns and these were distributed rapidly conspicuously and with much press attention among the Eastern cities They were mounted for the most part upon hills and prominent crests around the threatened centres of population They were mounted upon rough adaptations of the Doan swivel which at that time gave the maximum vertical range to a heavy gun Much of this artillery was still unmounted and nearly all of it was unprotected when the German air fleet reached New York And down in the crowded streets when that occurred the readers of the New York papers were regaling themselves with wonderful and wonderfully illustrated accounts of such matters as THE SECRET OF THE THUNDERBOLT AGED SCIENTIST PERFECTS ELECTRIC GUN TO ELECTROCUTE AIRSHIP CREWS BY UPWARD LIGHTNING WASHINGTON ORDERS FIVE HUNDRED WAR SECRETARY LODGE DELIGHTED SAYS THEY WILL SUIT THE GERMANS DOWN TO THE GROUND PRESIDENT PUBLICLY APPLAUDS THIS MERRY QUIP three The German fleet reached New York in advance of the news of the American naval disaster It reached New York in the late afternoon and was first seen by watchers at Ocean Grove and Long Branch coming swiftly out of the southward sea and going away to the northwest The flagship passed almost vertically over the Sandy Hook observation station rising rapidly as it did so and in a few minutes all New York was vibrating to the Staten Island guns Several of these guns and especially that at Giffords and the one on Beacon Hill above Matawan were remarkably well handled The former at a distance of five miles and with an elevation of six thousand feet sent a shell to burst so close to the Vaterland that a pane of the Prince s forward window was smashed by a fragment This sudden explosion made Bert tuck in his head with the celerity of a startled tortoise The whole air fleet immediately went up steeply to a height of about twelve thousand feet and at that level passed unscathed over the ineffectual guns The airships lined out as they moved forward into the form of a flattened V with its apex towards the city and with the flagship going highest at the apex The two ends of the V passed over Plumfield and Jamaica Bay respectively and the Prince directed his course a little to the east of the Narrows soared over Upper Bay and came to rest over Jersey City in a position that dominated lower New York There the monsters hung large and wonderful in the evening light serenely regardless of the occasional rocket explosions and flashing shell bursts in the lower air It was a pause of mutual inspection For a time naive humanity swamped the conventions of warfare altogether the interest of the millions below and of the thousands above alike was spectacular The evening was unexpectedly fine only a few thin level bands of clouds at seven or eight thousand feet broke its luminous clarity The wind had dropped it was an evening infinitely peaceful and still The heavy concussions of the distant guns and those incidental harmless pyrotechnics at the level of the clouds seemed to have as little to do with killing and force terror and submission as a salute at a naval review Below every point of vantage bristled with spectators the roofs of the towering buildings the public squares the active ferry boats and every favourable street intersection had its crowds all the river piers were dense with people the Battery Park was solid black with east side population and every position of advantage in Central Park and along Riverside Drive had its peculiar and characteristic assembly from the adjacent streets The footways of the great bridges over the East River were also closely packed and blocked Everywhere shopkeepers had left their shops men their work and women and children their homes to come out and see the marvel It beat they declared the newspapers And from above many of the occupants of the airships stared with an equal curiosity No city in the world was ever so finely placed as New York so magnificently cut up by sea and bluff and river so admirably disposed to display the tall effects of buildings the complex immensities of bridges and mono railways and feats of engineering London Paris Berlin were shapeless low agglomerations beside it Its port reached to its heart like Venice and like Venice it was obvious dramatic and proud Seen from above it was alive with crawling trains and cars and at a thousand points it was already breaking into quivering light New York was altogether at its best that evening its splendid best Gaw What a place said Bert It was so great and in its collective effect so pacifically magnificent that to make war upon it seemed incongruous beyond measure like laying siege to the National Gallery or attacking respectable people in an hotel dining room with battle axe and mail It was in its entirety so large so complex so delicately immense that to bring it to the issue of warfare was like driving a crowbar into the mechanism of a clock And the fish like shoal of great airships hovering light and sunlit above filling the sky seemed equally remote from the ugly forcefulness of war To Kurt to Smallways to I know not how many more of the people in the air fleet came the distinctest apprehension of these incompatibilities But in the head of the Prince Karl Albert were the vapours of romance he was a conqueror and this was the enemy s city The greater the city the greater the triumph No doubt he had a time of tremendous exultation and sensed beyond all precedent the sense of power that night There came an end at last to that pause Some wireless communications had failed of a satisfactory ending and fleet and city remembered they were hostile powers Look cried the multitude look What are they doing What Down through the twilight sank five attacking airships one to the Navy Yard on East River one to City Hall two over the great business buildings of Wall Street and Lower Broadway one to the Brooklyn Bridge dropping from among their fellows through the danger zone from the distant guns smoothly and rapidly to a safe proximity to the city masses At that descent all the cars in the streets stopped with dramatic suddenness and all the lights that had been coming on in the streets and houses went out again For the City Hall had awakened and was conferring by telephone with the Federal command and taking measures for defence The City Hall was asking for airships refusing to surrender as Washington advised and developing into a centre of intense emotion of hectic activity Everywhere and hastily the police began to clear the assembled crowds Go to your homes they said and the word was passed from mouth to mouth There s going to be trouble A chill of apprehension ran through the city and men hurrying in the unwonted darkness across City Hall Park and Union Square came upon the dim forms of soldiers and guns and were challenged and sent back In half an hour New York had passed from serene sunset and gaping admiration to a troubled and threatening twilight The first loss of life occurred in the panic rush from Brooklyn Bridge as the airship approached it With the cessation of the traffic an unusual stillness came upon New York and the disturbing concussions of the futile defending guns on the hills about grew more and more audible At last these ceased also A pause of further negotiation followed People sat in darkness sought counsel from telephones that were dumb Then into the expectant hush came a great crash and uproar the breaking down of the Brooklyn Bridge the rifle fire from the Navy Yard and the bursting of bombs in Wall Street and the City Hall New York as a whole could do nothing could understand nothing New York in the darkness peered and listened to these distant sounds until presently they died away as suddenly as they had begun What could be happening They asked it in vain A long vague period intervened and people looking out of the windows of upper rooms discovered the dark hulls of German airships gliding slowly and noiselessly quite close at hand Then quietly the electric lights came on again and an uproar of nocturnal newsvendors began in the streets The units of that vast and varied population bought and learnt what had happened there had been a fight and New York had hoisted the white flag four The lamentable incidents that followed the surrender of New York seem now in the retrospect to be but the necessary and inevitable consequence of the clash of modern appliances and social conditions produced by the scientific century on the one hand and the tradition of a crude romantic patriotism on the other At first people received the fact with an irresponsible detachment much as they would have received the slowing down of the train in which they were travelling or the erection of a public monument by the city to which they belonged We have surrendered Dear me HAVE we was rather the manner in which the first news was met They took it in the same spectacular spirit they had displayed at the first apparition of the air fleet Only slowly was this realisation of a capitulation suffused with the flush of passion only with reflection did they make any personal application WE have surrendered came later in us America is defeated Then they began to burn and tingle The newspapers which were issued about one in the morning contained no particulars of the terms upon which New York had yielded nor did they give any intimation of the quality of the brief conflict that had preceded the capitulation The later issues remedied these deficiencies There came the explicit statement of the agreement to victual the German airships to supply the complement of explosives to replace those employed in the fight and in the destruction of the North Atlantic fleet to pay the enormous ransom of forty million dollars and to surrender the flotilla in the East River There came too longer and longer descriptions of the smashing up of the City Hall and the Navy Yard and people began to realise faintly what those brief minutes of uproar had meant They read the tale of men blown to bits of futile soldiers in that localised battle fighting against hope amidst an indescribable wreckage of flags hauled down by weeping men And these strange nocturnal editions contained also the first brief cables from Europe of the fleet disaster the North Atlantic fleet for which New York had always felt an especial pride and solicitude Slowly hour by hour the collective consciousness woke up the tide of patriotic astonishment and humiliation came floating in America had come upon disaster suddenly New York discovered herself with amazement giving place to wrath unspeakable a conquered city under the hand of her conqueror As that fact shaped itself in the public mind there sprang up as flames spring up an angry repudiation No cried New York waking in the dawn No I am not defeated This is a dream Before day broke the swift American anger was running through all the city through every soul in those contagious millions Before it took action before it took shape the men in the airships could feel the gigantic insurgence of emotion as cattle and natural creatures feel it is said the coming of an earthquake The newspapers of the Knype group first gave the thing words and a formula We do not agree they said simply We have been betrayed Men took that up everywhere it passed from mouth to mouth at every street corner under the paling lights of dawn orators stood unchecked calling upon the spirit of America to arise making the shame a personal reality to every one who heard To Bert listening five hundred feet above it seemed that the city which had at first produced only confused noises was now humming like a hive of bees of very angry bees After the smashing of the City Hall and Post Office the white flag had been hoisted from a tower of the old Park Row building and thither had gone Mayor O Hagen urged thither indeed by the terror stricken property owners of lower New York to negotiate the capitulation with Von Winterfeld The Vaterland having dropped the secretary by a rope ladder remained hovering circling very slowly above the great buildings old and new that clustered round City Hall Park while the Helmholz which had done the fighting there rose overhead to a height of perhaps two thousand feet So Bert had a near view of all that occurred in that central place The City Hall and Court House the Post Office and a mass of buildings on the west side of Broadway had been badly damaged and the three former were a heap of blackened ruins In the case of the first two the loss of life had not been considerable but a great multitude of workers including many girls and women had been caught in the destruction of the Post Office and a little army of volunteers with white badges entered behind the firemen bringing out the often still living bodies for the most part frightfully charred and carrying them into the big Monson building close at hand Everywhere the busy firemen were directing their bright streams of water upon the smouldering masses their hose lay about the square and long cordons of police held back the gathering black masses of people chiefly from the east side from these central activities In violent and extraordinary contrast with this scene of destruction close at hand were the huge newspaper establishments of Park Row They were all alight and working they had not been abandoned even while the actual bomb throwing was going on and now staff and presses were vehemently active getting out the story the immense and dreadful story of the night developing comment and in most cases spreading the idea of resistance under the very noses of the airships For a long time Bert could not imagine what these callously active offices could be then he detected the noise of the presses and emitted his Gaw Beyond these newspaper buildings again and partially hidden by the arches of the old Elevated Railway of New York long since converted into a mono rail there was another cordon of police and a sort of encampment of ambulances and doctors busy with the dead and wounded who had been killed early in the night by the panic upon Brooklyn Bridge All this he saw in the perspectives of a bird s eye view as things happening in a big irregular shaped pit below him between cliffs of high building Northward he looked along the steep canon of Broadway down whose length at intervals crowds were assembling about excited speakers and when he lifted his eyes he saw the chimneys and cable stacks and roof spaces of New York and everywhere now over these the watching debating people clustered except where the fires raged and the jets of water flew Everywhere too were flagstaffs devoid of flags one white sheet drooped and flapped and drooped again over the Park Row buildings And upon the lurid lights the festering movement and intense shadows of this strange scene there was breaking now the cold impartial dawn For Bert Smallways all this was framed in the frame of the open porthole It was a pale dim world outside that dark and tangible rim All night he had clutched at that rim jumped and quivered at explosions and watched phantom events Now he had been high and now low now almost beyond hearing now flying close to crashings and shouts and outcries He had seen airships flying low and swift over darkened and groaning streets watched great buildings suddenly red lit amidst the shadows crumple at the smashing impact of bombs witnessed for the first time in his life the grotesque swift onset of insatiable conflagrations From it all he felt detached disembodied The Vaterland did not even fling a bomb she watched and ruled Then down they had come at last to hover over City Hall Park and it had crept in upon his mind chillingly terrifyingly that these illuminated black masses were great offices afire and that the going to and fro of minute dim spectres of lantern lit grey and white was a harvesting of the wounded and the dead As the light grew clearer he began to understand more and more what these crumpled black things signified He had watched hour after hour since first New York had risen out of the blue indistinctness of the landfall With the daylight he experienced an intolerable fatigue He lifted weary eyes to the pink flush in the sky yawned immensely and crawled back whispering to himself across the cabin to the locker He did not so much lie down upon that as fall upon it and instantly become asleep There hours after sprawling undignified and sleeping profoundly Kurt found him a very image of the democratic mind confronted with the problems of a time too complex for its apprehension His face was pale and indifferent his mouth wide open and he snored He snored disagreeably Kurt regarded him for a moment with a mild distaste Then he kicked his ankle Wake up he said to Smallways stare and lie down decent Bert sat up and rubbed his eyes Any more fightin yet he asked No said Kurt and sat down a tired man Gott he cried presently rubbing his hands over his face but I d like a cold bath I ve been looking for stray bullet holes in the air chambers all night until now He yawned I must sleep You d better clear out Smallways I can t stand you here this morning You re so infernally ugly and useless Have you had your rations No Well go in and get em and don t come back Stick in the gallery five So Bert slightly refreshed by coffee and sleep resumed his helpless company operation in the War in the Air He went down into the little gallery as the lieutenant had directed and clung to the rail at the extreme end beyond the look out man trying to seem as inconspicuous and harmless a fragment of life as possible A wind was rising rather strongly from the south east It obliged the Vaterland to come about in that direction and made her roll a great deal as she went to and fro over Manhattan Island Away in the north west clouds gathered The throb throb of her slow screw working against the breeze was much more perceptible than when she was going full speed ahead and the friction of the wind against the underside of the gas chamber drove a series of shallow ripples along it and made a faint flapping sound like but fainter than the beating of ripples under the stem of a boat She was stationed over the temporary City Hall in the Park Row building and every now and then she would descend to resume communication with the mayor and with Washington But the restlessness of the Prince would not suffer him to remain for long in any one place Now he would circle over the Hudson and East River now he would go up high as if to peer away into the blue distances once he ascended so swiftly and so far that mountain sickness overtook him and the crew and forced him down again and Bert shared the dizziness and nausea The swaying view varied with these changes of altitude Now they would be low and close and he would distinguish in that steep unusual perspective windows doors street and sky signs people and the minutest details and watch the enigmatical behaviour of crowds and clusters upon the roofs and in the streets then as they soared the details would shrink the sides of streets draw together the view widen the people cease to be significant At the highest the effect was that of a concave relief map Bert saw the dark and crowded land everywhere intersected by shining waters saw the Hudson River like a spear of silver and Lower Island Sound like a shield Even to Bert s unphilosophical mind the contrast of city below and fleet above pointed an opposition the opposition of the adventurous American s tradition and character with German order and discipline Below the immense buildings tremendous and fine as they were seemed like the giant trees of a jungle fighting for life their picturesque magnificence was as planless as the chances of crag and gorge their casualty enhanced by the smoke and confusion of still unsubdued and spreading conflagrations In the sky soared the German airships like beings in a different entirely more orderly world all oriented to the same angle of the horizon uniform in build and appearance moving accurately with one purpose as a pack of wolves will move distributed with the most precise and effectual company operation It dawned upon Bert that hardly a third of the fleet was visible The others had gone upon errands he could not imagine beyond the compass of that great circle of earth and sky He wondered but there was no one to ask As the day wore on about a dozen reappeared in the east with their stores replenished from the flotilla and towing a number of drachenflieger Towards afternoon the weather thickened driving clouds appeared in the south west and ran together and seemed to engender more clouds and the wind came round into that quarter and blew stronger Towards the evening the wind became a gale into which the now tossing airships had to beat All that day the Prince was negotiating with Washington while his detached scouts sought far and wide over the Eastern States looking for anything resembling an aeronautic park A squadron of twenty airships detached overnight had dropped out of the air upon Niagara and was holding the town and power works Meanwhile the insurrectionary movement in the giant city grew uncontrollable In spite of five great fires already involving many acres and spreading steadily New York was still not satisfied that she was beaten At first the rebellious spirit below found vent only in isolated shouts street crowd speeches and newspaper suggestions then it found much more definite expression in the appearance in the morning sunlight of American flags at point after point above the architectural cliffs of the city It is quite possible that in many cases this spirited display of bunting by a city already surrendered was the outcome of the innocent informality of the American mind but it is also undeniable that in many it was a deliberate indication that the people felt wicked The German sense of correctitude was deeply shocked by this outbreak The Graf von Winterfeld immediately communicated with the mayor and pointed out the irregularity and the fire look out stations were instructed in the matter The New York police was speedily hard at work and a foolish contest in full swing between impassioned citizens resolved to keep the flag flying and irritated and worried officers instructed to pull it down The trouble became acute at last in the streets above Columbia University The captain of the airship watching this quarter seems to have stooped to lasso and drag from its staff a flag hoisted upon Morgan Hall As he did so a volley of rifle and revolver shots was fired from the upper windows of the huge apartment building that stands between the University and Riverside Drive Most of these were ineffectual but two or three perforated gas chambers and one smashed the hand and arm of a man upon the forward platform The sentinel on the lower gallery immediately replied and the machine gun on the shield of the eagle let fly and promptly stopped any further shots The airship rose and signalled the flagship and City Hall police and militiamen were directed at once to the spot and this particular incident closed But hard upon that came the desperate attempt of a party of young clubmen from New York who inspired by patriotic and adventurous imaginations slipped off in half a dozen motor cars to Beacon Hill and set to work with remarkable vigour to improvise a fort about the Doan swivel gun that had been placed there They found it still in the hands of the disgusted gunners who had been ordered to cease fire at the capitulation and it was easy to infect these men with their own spirit They declared their gun hadn t had half a chance and were burning to show what it could do Directed by the newcomers they made a trench and bank about the mounting of the piece and constructed flimsy shelter pits of corrugated iron They were actually loading the gun when they were observed by the airship Preussen and the shell they succeeded in firing before the bombs of the latter smashed them and their crude defences to fragments burst over the middle gas chambers of the Bingen and brought her to earth disabled upon Staten Island She was badly deflated and dropped among trees over which her empty central gas bags spread in canopies and festoons Nothing however had caught fire and her men were speedily at work upon her repair They behaved with a confidence that verged upon indiscretion While most of them commenced patching the tears of the membrane half a dozen of them started off for the nearest road in search of a gas main and presently found themselves prisoners in the hands of a hostile crowd Close at hand was a number of villa residences whose occupants speedily developed from an unfriendly curiosity to aggression At that time the police control of the large polyglot population of Staten Island had become very lax and scarcely a household but had its rifle or pistols and ammunition These were presently produced and after two or three misses one of the men at work was hit in the foot Thereupon the Germans left their sewing and mending took cover among the trees and replied The crackling of shots speedily brought the Preussen and Kiel on the scene and with a few hand grenades they made short work of every villa within a mile A number of non combatant American men women and children were killed and the actual assailants driven off For a time the repairs went on in peace under the immediate protection of these two airships Then when they returned to their quarters an intermittent sniping and fighting round the stranded Bingen was resumed and went on all the afternoon and merged at last in the general combat of the evening About eight the Bingen was rushed by an armed mob and all its defenders killed after a fierce disorderly struggle The difficulty of the Germans in both these cases came from the impossibility of landing any efficient force or indeed any force at all from the air fleet The airships were quite unequal to the transport of any adequate landing parties their complement of men was just sufficient to manoeuvre and fight them in the air From above they could inflict immense damage they could reduce any organised Government to a capitulation in the briefest space but they could not disarm much less could they occupy the surrendered areas below They had to trust to the pressure upon the authorities below of a threat to renew the bombardment It was their sole resource No doubt with a highly organised and undamaged Government and a homogeneous and well disciplined people that would have sufficed to keep the peace But this was not the American case Not only was the New York Government a weak one and insufficiently provided with police but the destruction of the City Hall and Post Offide and other central ganglia had hopelessly disorganised the company operation of part with part The street cars and railways had ceased the telephone service was out of gear and only worked intermittently The Germans had struck at the head and the head was conquered and stunned only to release the body from its rule New York had become a headless monster no longer capable of collective submission Everywhere it lifted itself rebelliously everywhere authorities and officials left to their own imitative were joining in the arming and flag hoisting and excitement of that afternoon six The disintegrating truce gave place to a definite general breach with the assassination of the Wetterhorn for that is the only possible word for the act above Union Square and not a mile away from the exemplary ruins of City Hall This occurred late in the afternoon between five and six By that time the weather had changed very much for the worse and the operations of the airships were embarrassed by the necessity they were under of keeping head on to the gusts A series of squalls with hail and thunder followed one another from the south by south east and in order to avoid these as much as possible the air fleet came low over the houses diminishing its range of observation and exposing itself to a rifle attack Overnight there had been a gun placed in Union Square It had never been mounted much less fired and in the darkness after the surrender it was taken with its supplies and put out of the way under the arches of the great Dexter building Here late in the morning it was remarked by a number of patriotic spirits They set to work to hoist and mount it inside the upper floors of the place They made in fact a masked battery behind the decorous office blinds and there lay in wait as simply excited as children until at last the stem of the luckless Wetterhorn appeared beating and rolling at quarter speed over the recently reconstructed pinnacles of Tiffany s Promptly that one gun battery unmasked The airship s look out man must have seen the whole of the tenth story of the Dexter building crumble out and smash in the street below to discover the black muzzle looking out from the shadows behind Then perhaps the shell hit him The gun fired two shells before the frame of the Dexter building collapsed and each shell raked the Wetterhorn from stem to stern They smashed her exhaustively She crumpled up like a can that has been kicked by a heavy boot her forepart came down in the square and the rest of her length with a great snapping and twisting of shafts and stays descended collapsing athwart Tammany Hall and the streets towards Second Avenue Her gas escaped to mix with air and the air of her rent balloonette poured into her deflating gas chambers Then with an immense impact she exploded The Vaterland at that time was beating up to the south of City Hall from over the ruins of the Brooklyn Bridge and the reports of the gun followed by the first crashes of the collapsing Dexter building brought Kurt and Smallways to the cabin porthole They were in time to see the flash of the exploding gun and then they were first flattened against the window and then rolled head over heels across the floor of the cabin by the air wave of the explosion The Vaterland bounded like a football some one has kicked and when they looked out again Union Square was small and remote and shattered as though some cosmically vast giant had rolled over it The buildings to the east of it were ablaze at a dozen points under the flaming tatters and warping skeleton of the airship and all the roofs and walls were ridiculously askew and crumbling as one looked Gaw said Bert What s happened Look at the people But before Kurt could produce an explanation the shrill bells of the airship were ringing to quarters and he had to go Bert hesitated and stepped thoughtfully into the passage looking back at the window as he did so He was knocked off his feet at once by the Prince who was rushing headlong from his cabin to the central magazine Bert had a momentary impression of the great figure of the Prince white with rage bristling with gigantic anger his huge fist swinging Blut und Eisen cried the Prince as one who swears Oh Blut und Eisen Some one fell over Bert something in the manner of falling suggested Von Winterfeld and some one else paused and kicked him spitefully and hard Then he was sitting up in the passage rubbing a freshly bruised cheek and readjusting the bandage he still wore on his head Dem that Prince said Bert indignant beyond measure E asn t the menners of a og He stood up collected his wits for a minute and then went slowly towards the gangway of the little gallery As he did so he heard noises suggestive of the return of the Prince The lot of them were coming back again He shot into his cabin like a rabbit into its burrow just in time to escape that shouting terror He shut the door waited until the passage was still then went across to the window and looked out A drift of cloud made the prospect of the streets and squares hazy and the rolling of the airship swung the picture up and down A few people were running to and fro but for the most part the aspect of the district was desertion The streets seemed to broaden out they became clearer and the little dots that were people larger as the Vaterland came down again Presently she was swaying along above the lower end of Broadway The dots below Bert saw were not running now but standing and looking up Then suddenly they were all running again Something had dropped from the aeroplane something that looked small and flimsy It hit the pavement near a big archway just underneath Bert A little man was sprinting along the sidewalk within half a dozen yards and two or three others and one woman were bolting across the roadway They were odd little figures so very small were they about the heads so very active about the elbows and legs It was really funny to see their legs going Foreshortened humanity has no dignity The little man on the pavement jumped comically no doubt with terror as the bomb fell beside him Then blinding flames squirted out in all directions from the point of impact and the little man who had jumped became for an instant a flash of fire and vanished vanished absolutely The people running out into the road took preposterous clumsy leaps then flopped down and lay still with their torn clothes smouldering into flame Then pieces of the archway began to drop and the lower masonry of the building to fall in with the rumbling sound of coals being shot into a cellar A faint screaming reached Bert and then a crowd of people ran out into the street one man limping and gesticulating awkwardly He halted and went back towards the building A falling mass of brick work hit him and sent him sprawling to lie still and crumpled where he fell Dust and black smoke came pouring into the street and were presently shot with red flame In this manner the massacre of New York began She was the first of the great cities of the Scientific Age to suffer by the enormous powers and grotesque limitations of aerial warfare She was wrecked as in the previous century endless barbaric cities had been bombarded because she was at once too strong to be occupied and too undisciplined and proud to surrender in order to escape destruction Given the circumstances the thing had to be done It was impossible for the Prince to desist and own himself defeated and it was impossible to subdue the city except by largely destroying it The catastrophe was the logical outcome of the situation created by the application of science to warfare It was unavoidable that great cities should be destroyed In spite of his intense exasperation with his dilemma the Prince sought to be moderate even in massacre He tried to give a memorable lesson with the minimum waste of life and the minimum expenditure of explosives For that night he proposed only the wrecking of Broadway He directed the air fleet to move in column over the route of this thoroughfare dropping bombs the Vaterland leading And so our Bert Smallways became a participant in one of the most cold blooded slaughters in the world s history in which men who were neither excited nor except for the remotest chance of a bullet in any danger poured death and destruction upon homes and crowds below He clung to the frame of the porthole as the airship tossed and swayed and stared down through the light rain that now drove before the wind into the twilight streets watching people running out of the houses watching buildings collapse and fires begin As the airships sailed along they smashed up the city as a child will shatter its cities of brick and card Below they left ruins and blazing conflagrations and heaped and scattered dead men women and children mixed together as though they had been no more than Moors or Zulus or Chinese Lower New York was soon a furnace of crimson flames from which there was no escape Cars railways ferries all had ceased and never a light lit the way of the distracted fugitives in that dusky confusion but the light of burning He had glimpses of what it must mean to be down there glimpses And it came to him suddenly as an incredible discovery that such disasters were not only possible now in this strange gigantic foreign New York but also in London in Bun Hill that the little island in the silver seas was at the end of its immunity that nowhere in the world any more was there a place left where a Smallways might lift his head proudly and vote for war and a spirited foreign policy and go secure from such horrible things CHAPTER VII THE VATERLAND IS DISABLED one And then above the flames of Manhattan Island came a battle the first battle in the air The Americans had realised the price their waiting game must cost and struck with all the strength they had if haply they might still save New York from this mad Prince of Blood and Iron and from fire and death They came down upon the Germans on the wings of a great gale in the twilight amidst thunder and rain They came from the yards of Washington and Philadelphia full tilt in two squadrons and but for one sentinel airship hard by Trenton the surprise would have been complete The Germans sick and weary with destruction and half empty of ammunition were facing up into the weather when the news of this onset reached them New York they had left behind to the south eastward a darkened city with one hideous red scar of flames All the airships rolled and staggered bursts of hailstorm bore them down and forced them to fight their way up again the air had become bitterly cold The Prince was on the point of issuing orders to drop earthward and trail copper lightning chains when the news of the aeroplane attack came to him He faced his fleet in line abreast south had the drachenflieger manned and held ready to cast loose and ordered a general ascent into the freezing clearness above the wet and darkness The news of what was imminent came slowly to Bert s perceptions He was standing in the messroom at the time and the evening rations were being served out He had resumed Butteridge s coat and gloves and in addition he had wrapped his blanket about him He was dipping his bread into his soup and was biting off big mouthfuls His legs were wide apart and he leant against the partition in order to steady himself amidst the pitching and oscillation of the airship The men about him looked tired and depressed a few talked but most were sullen and thoughtful and one or two were air sick They all seemed to share the peculiarly outcast feeling that had followed the murders of the evening a sense of a land beneath them and an outraged humanity grown more hostile than the Sea Then the news hit them A red faced sturdy man a man with light eyelashes and a scar appeared in the doorway and shouted something in German that manifestly startled every one Bert felt the shock of the altered tone though he could not understand a word that was said The announcement was followed by a pause and then a great outcry of questions and suggestions Even the air sick men flushed and spoke For some minutes the mess room was Bedlam and then as if it were a confirmation of the news came the shrill ringing of the bells that called the men to their posts Bert with pantomime suddenness found himself alone What s up he said though he partly guessed He stayed only to gulp down the remainder of his soup and then ran along the swaying passage and clutching tightly down the ladder to the little gallery The weather hit him like cold water squirted from a hose The airship engaged in some new feat of atmospheric Jiu Jitsu He drew his blanket closer about him clutching with one straining hand He found himself tossing in a wet twilight with nothing to be seen but mist pouring past him Above him the airship was warm with lights and busy with the movements of men going to their quarters Then abruptly the lights went out and the Vaterland with bounds and twists and strange writhings was fighting her way up the air He had a glimpse as the Vaterland rolled over of some large buildings burning close below them a quivering acanthus of flames and then he saw indistinctly through the driving weather another airship wallowing along like a porpoise and also working up Presently the clouds swallowed her again for a time and then she came back to sight as a dark and whale like monster amidst streaming weather The air was full of flappings and pipings of void gusty shouts and noises it buffeted him and confused him ever and again his attention became rigid a blind and deaf balancing and clutching Wow Something fell past him out of the vast darknesses above and vanished into the tumults below going obliquely downward It was a German drachenflieger The thing was going so fast he had but an instant apprehension of the dark figure of the aeronaut crouched together clutching at his wheel It might be a manoeuvre but it looked like a catastrophe Gaw said Bert Pup pup pup went a gun somewhere in the mirk ahead and suddenly and quite horribly the Vaterland lurched and Bert and the sentinel were clinging to the rail for dear life Bang came a vast impact out of the zenith followed by another huge roll and all about him the tumbled clouds flashed red and lurid in response to flashes unseen revealing immense gulfs The rail went right overhead and he was hanging loose in the air holding on to it For a time Bert s whole mind and being was given to clutching I m going into the cabin he said as the airship righted again and brought back the gallery floor to his feet He began to make his way cautiously towards the ladder Whee wow he cried as the whole gallery reared itself up forward and then plunged down like a desperate horse Crack Bang Bang Bang And then hard upon this little rattle of shots and bombs came all about him enveloping him engulfing him immense and overwhelming a quivering white blaze of lightning and a thunder clap that was like the bursting of a world Just for the instant before that explosion the universe seemed to be standing still in a shadowless glare It was then he saw the American aeroplane He saw it in the light of the flash as a thing altogether motionless Even its screw appeared still and its men were rigid dolls For it was so near he could see the men upon it quite distinctly Its stern was tilting down and the whole machine was heeling over It was of the Colt Coburn Langley pattern with double up tilted wings and the screw ahead and the men were in a boat like body netted over From this very light long body magazine guns projected on either side One thing that was strikingly odd and wonderful in that moment of revelation was that the left upper wing was burning downward with a reddish smoky flame But this was not the most wonderful thing about this apparition The most wonderful thing was that it and a German airship five hundred yards below were threaded as it were on the lightning flash which turned out of its path as if to take them and that out from the corners and projecting points of its huge wings everywhere little branching thorn trees of lightning were streaming Like a picture Bert saw these things a picture a little blurred by a thin veil of wind torn mist The crash of the thunder clap followed the flash and seemed a part of it so that it is hard to say whether Bert was the rather deafened or blinded in that instant And then darkness utter darkness and a heavy report and a thin small sound of voices that went wailing downward into the abyss below two There followed upon these things a long deep swaying of the airship and then Bert began a struggle to get back to his cabin He was drenched and cold and terrified beyond measure and now more than a little air sick It seemed to him that the strength had gone out of his knees and hands and that his feet had become icily slippery over the metal they trod upon But that was because a thin film of ice had frozen upon the gallery He never knew how long his ascent of the ladder back into the airship took him but in his dreams afterwards when he recalled it that experience seemed to last for hours Below above around him were gulfs monstrous gulfs of howling wind and eddies of dark whirling snowflakes and he was protected from it all by a little metal grating and a rail a grating and rail that seemed madly infuriated with him passionately eager to wrench him off and throw him into the tumult of space Once he had a fancy that a bullet tore by his ear and that the clouds and snowflakes were lit by a flash but he never even turned his head to see what new assailant whirled past them in the void He wanted to get into the passage He wanted to get into the passage He wanted to get into the passage Would the arm by which he was clinging hold out or would it give way and snap A handful of hail smacked him in the face so that for a time he was breathless and nearly insensible Hold tight Bert He renewed his efforts He found himself with an enormous sense of relief and warmth in the passage The passage was behaving like a dice box its disposition was evidently to rattle him about and then throw him out again He hung on with the convulsive clutch of instinct until the passage lurched down ahead Then he would make a short run cabin ward and clutch again as the fore end rose Behold He was in the cabin He snapped to the door and for a time he was not a human being he was a case of air sickness He wanted to get somewhere that would fix him that he needn t clutch He opened the locker and got inside among the loose articles and sprawled there helplessly with his head sometimes bumping one side and sometimes the other The lid shut upon him with a click He did not care then what was happening any more He did not care who fought who or what bullets were fired or explosions occurred He did not care if presently he was shot or smashed to pieces He was full of feeble inarticulate rage and despair Foolery he said his one exhaustive comment on human enterprise adventure war and the chapter of accidents that had entangled him Foolery Ugh He included the order of the universe in that comprehensive condemnation He wished he was dead He saw nothing of the stars as presently the Vaterland cleared the rush and confusion of the lower weather nor of the duel she fought with two circling aeroplanes how they shot her rear most chambers through and how she fought them off with explosive bullets and turned to run as she did so The rush and swoop of these wonderful night birds was all lost upon him their heroic dash and self sacrifice The Vaterland was rammed and for some moments she hung on the verge of destruction and sinking swiftly with the American aeroplane entangled with her smashed propeller and the Americans trying to scramble aboard It signified nothing to Bert To him it conveyed itself simply as vehement swaying Foolery When the American airship dropped off at last with most of its crew shot or fallen Bert in his locker appreciated nothing but that the Vaterland had taken a hideous upward leap But then came infinite relief incredibly blissful relief The rolling the pitching the struggle ceased ceased instantly and absolutely The Vaterland was no longer fighting the gale her smashed and exploded engines throbbed no more she was disabled and driving before the wind as smoothly as a balloon a huge windspread tattered cloud of aerial wreckage To Bert it was no more than the end of a series of disagreeable sensations He was not curious to know what had happened to the airship nor what had happened to the battle For a long time he lay waiting apprehensively for the pitching and tossing and his qualms to return and so lying boxed up in the locker he presently fell asleep three He awoke tranquil but very stuffy and at the same time very cold and quite unable to recollect where he could be His head ached and his breath was suffocated He had been dreaming confusedly of Edna and Desert Dervishes and of riding bicycles in an extremely perilous manner through the upper air amidst a pyrotechnic display of crackers and Bengal lights to the great annoyance of a sort of composite person made up of the Prince and mister Butteridge Then for some reason Edna and he had begun to cry pitifully for each other and he woke up with wet eye lashes into this ill ventilated darkness of the locker He would never see Edna any more never see Edna any more He thought he must be back in the bedroom behind the cycle shop at the bottom of Bun Hill and he was sure the vision he had had of the destruction of a magnificent city a city quite incredibly great and splendid by means of bombs was no more than a particularly vivid dream Grubb he called anxious to tell him The answering silence and the dull resonance of the locker to his voice supplementing the stifling quality of the air set going a new train of ideas He lifted up his hands and feet and met an inflexible resistance He was in a coffin he thought He had been buried alive He gave way at once to wild panic Elp he screamed Elp and drummed with his feet and kicked and struggled Let me out Let me out For some seconds he struggled with this intolerable horror and then the side of his imagined coffin gave way and he was flying out into daylight Then he was rolling about on what seemed to be a padded floor with Kurt and being punched and sworn at lustily He sat up His head bandage had become loose and got over one eye and he whipped the whole thing off Kurt was also sitting up a yard away from him pink as ever wrapped in blankets and with an aluminium diver s helmet over his knee staring at him with a severe expression and rubbing his downy unshaven chin They were both on a slanting floor of crimson padding and above them was an opening like a long low cellar flap that Bert by an effort perceived to be the cabin door in a half inverted condition The whole cabin had in fact turned on its side What the deuce do you mean by it Smallways said Kurt jumping out of that locker when I was certain you had gone overboard with the rest of them Where have you been What s up asked Bert This end of the airship is up Most other things are down Was there a battle There was Who won I haven t seen the papers Smallways We left before the finish We got disabled and unmanageable and our colleagues consorts I mean were too busy most of them to trouble about us and the wind blew us Heaven knows where the wind IS blowing us It blew us right out of action at the rate of eighty miles an hour or so Gott what a wind that was What a fight And here we are Where In the air Smallways in the air When we get down on the earth again we shan t know what to do with our legs But what s below us Canada to the best of my knowledge and a jolly bleak empty inhospitable country it looks But why ain t we right ways up Kurt made no answer for a space Last I remember was seeing a sort of flying machine in a lightning flash said Bert Gaw that was orrible Guns going off Things explodin Clouds and ail Pitching and tossing I got so scared and desperate and sick You don t know how the fight came off Not a bit of it I was up with my squad in those divers dresses inside the gas chambers with sheets of silk for caulking We couldn t see a thing outside except the lightning flashes I never saw one of those American aeroplanes Just saw the shots flicker through the chambers and sent off men for the tears We caught fire a bit not much you know We were too wet so the fires spluttered out before we banged And then one of their infernal things dropped out of the air on us and rammed Didn t you feel it I felt everything said Bert I didn t notice any particular smash They must have been pretty desperate if they meant it They slashed down on us like a knife simply ripped the after gas chambers like gutting herrings crumpled up the engines and screw Most of the engines dropped off as they fell off us or we d have grounded but the rest is sort of dangling We just turned up our nose to the heavens and stayed there Eleven men rolled off us from various points and poor old Winterfeld fell through the door of the Prince s cabin into the chart room and broke his ankle Also we got our electric gear shot or carried away no one knows how That s the position Smallways We re driving through the air like a common aerostat at the mercy of the elements almost due north probably to the North Pole We don t know what aeroplanes the Americans have or anything at all about it Very likely we have finished em up One fouled us one was struck by lightning some of the men saw a third upset apparently just for fun They were going cheap anyhow Also we ve lost most of our drachenflieger They just skated off into the night No stability in em That s all We don t know if we ve won or lost We don t know if we re at war with the British Empire yet or at peace Consequently we daren t get down We don t know what we are up to or what we are going to do Our Napoleon is alone forward and I suppose he s rearranging his plans Whether New York was our Moscow or not remains to be seen We ve had a high old time and murdered no end of people War Noble war I m sick of it this morning I like sitting in rooms rightway up and not on slippery partitions I m a civilised man I keep thinking of old Albrecht and the Barbarossa I feel I want a wash and kind words and a quiet home When I look at you I KNOW I want a wash Gott he stifled a vehement yawn What a Cockney tadpole of a ruffian you look Can we get any grub asked Bert Heaven knows said Kurt He meditated upon Bert for a time So far as I can judge Smallways he said the Prince will probably want to throw you overboard next time he thinks of you He certainly will if he sees you After all you know you came als Ballast And we shall have to lighten ship extensively pretty soon Unless I m mistaken the Prince will wake up presently and start doing things with tremendous vigour I ve taken a fancy to you It s the English strain in me You re a rum little chap I shan t like seeing you whizz down the air You d better make yourself useful Smallways I think I shall requisition you for my squad You ll have to work you know and be infernally intelligent and all that And you ll have to hang about upside down a bit Still it s the best chance you have We shan t carry passengers much farther this trip I fancy Ballast goes over board if we don t want to ground precious soon and be taken prisoners of war The Prince won t do that anyhow He ll be game to the last four By means of a folding chair which was still in its place behind the door they got to the window and looked out in turn and contemplated a sparsely wooded country below with no railways nor roads and only occasional signs of habitation Then a bugle sounded and Kurt interpreted it as a summons to food They got through the door and clambered with some difficulty up the nearly vertical passage holding on desperately with toes and finger tips to the ventilating perforations in its floor The mess stewards had found their fireless heating arrangements intact and there was hot cocoa for the officers and hot soup for the men Bert s sense of the queerness of this experience was so keen that it blotted out any fear he might have felt Indeed he was far more interested now than afraid He seemed to have touched down to the bottom of fear and abandonment overnight He was growing accustomed to the idea that he would probably be killed presently that this strange voyage in the air was in all probability his death journey No human being can keep permanently afraid fear goes at last to the back of one s mind accepted and shelved and done with He squatted over his soup sopping it up with his bread and contemplated his comrades They were all rather yellow and dirty with four day beards and they grouped themselves in the tired unpremeditated manner of men on a wreck They talked little The situation perplexed them beyond any suggestion of ideas Three had been hurt in the pitching up of the ship during the fight and one had a bandaged bullet wound It was incredible that this little band of men had committed murder and massacre on a scale beyond precedent None of them who squatted on the sloping gas padded partition soup mug in hand seemed really guilty of anything of the sort seemed really capable of hurting a dog wantonly They were all so manifestly built for homely chalets on the solid earth and carefully tilled fields and blond wives and cheery merrymaking The red faced sturdy man with light eyelashes who had brought the first news of the air battle to the men s mess had finished his soup and with an expression of maternal solicitude was readjusting the bandages of a youngster whose arm had been sprained Bert was crumbling the last of his bread into the last of his soup eking it out as long as possible when suddenly he became aware that every one was looking at a pair of feet that were dangling across the downturned open doorway Kurt appeared and squatted across the hinge In some mysterious way he had shaved his face and smoothed down his light golden hair He looked extraordinarily cherubic Der Prinz he said A second pair of boots followed making wide and magnificent gestures in their attempts to feel the door frame Kurt guided them to a foothold and the Prince shaved and brushed and beeswaxed and clean and big and terrible slid down into position astride of the door All the men and Bert also stood up and saluted The Prince surveyed them with the gesture of a man who site a steed The head of the Kapitan appeared beside him Then Bert had a terrible moment The blue blaze of the Prince s eye fell upon him the great finger pointed a question was asked Kurt intervened with explanations So said the Prince and Bert was disposed of Then the Prince addressed the men in short heroic sentences steadying himself on the hinge with one hand and waving the other in a fine variety of gesture What he said Bert could not tell but he perceived that their demeanor changed their backs stiffened They began to punctuate the Prince s discourse with cries of approval At the end their leader burst into song and all the men with him Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott they chanted in deep strong tones with an immense moral uplifting It was glaringly inappropriate in a damaged half overturned and sinking airship which had been disabled and blown out of action after inflicting the cruellest bombardment in the world s history but it was immensely stirring nevertheless Bert was deeply moved He could not sing any of the words of Luther s great hymn but he opened his mouth and emitted loud deep and partially harmonious notes Far below this deep chanting struck on the ears of a little camp of Christianised half breeds who were lumbering They were breakfasting but they rushed out cheerfully quite prepared for the Second Advent They stared at the shattered and twisted Vaterland driving before the gale amazed beyond words In so many respects it was like their idea of the Second Advent and then again in so many respects it wasn t They stared at its passage awe stricken and perplexed beyond their power of words The hymn ceased Then after a long interval a voice came out of heaven Vat id diss blace here galled itself vat They made no answer Indeed they did not understand though the question repeated itself And at last the monster drove away northward over a crest of pine woods and was no more seen They fell into a hot and long disputation The hymn ended The Prince s legs dangled up the passage again and every one was briskly prepared for heroic exertion and triumphant acts Smallways cried Kurt come here five Then Bert under Kurt s direction had his first experience of the work of an air sailor The immediate task before the captain of the Vaterland was a very simple one He had to keep afloat The wind though it had fallen from its earlier violence was still blowing strongly enough to render the grounding of so clumsy a mass extremely dangerous even if it had been desirable for the Prince to land in inhabited country and so risk capture It was necessary to keep the airship up until the wind fell and then if possible to descend in some lonely district of the Territory where there would be a chance of repair or rescue by some searching consort In order to do this weight had to be dropped and Kurt was detailed with a dozen men to climb down among the wreckage of the deflated air chambers and cut the stuff clear portion by portion as the airship sank So Bert armed with a sharp cutlass found himself clambering about upon netting four thousand feet up in the air trying to understand Kurt when he spoke in English and to divine him when he used German It was giddy work but not nearly so giddy as a rather overnourished reader sitting in a warm room might imagine Bert found it quite possible to look down and contemplate the wild sub arctic landscape below now devoid of any sign of habitation a land of rocky cliffs and cascades and broad swirling desolate rivers and of trees and thickets that grew more stunted and scrubby as the day wore on Here and there on the hills were patches and pockets of snow And over all this he worked hacking away at the tough and slippery oiled silk and clinging stoutly to the netting Presently they cleared and dropped a tangle of bent steel rods and wires from the frame and a big chunk of silk bladder That was trying The airship flew up at once as this loose hamper parted It seemed almost as though they were dropping all Canada The stuff spread out in the air and floated down and hit and twisted up in a nasty fashion on the lip of a gorge Bert clung like a frozen monkey to his ropes and did not move a muscle for five minutes But there was something very exhilarating he found in this dangerous work and above every thing else there was the sense of fellowship He was no longer an isolated and distrustful stranger among these others he had now a common object with them he worked with a friendly rivalry to get through with his share before them And he developed a great respect and affection for Kurt which had hitherto been only latent in him Kurt with a job to direct was altogether admirable he was resourceful helpful considerate swift He seemed to be everywhere One forgot his pinkness his light cheerfulness of manner Directly one had trouble he was at hand with sound and confident advice He was like an elder brother to his men All together they cleared three considerable chunks of wreckage and then Bert was glad to clamber up into the cabins again and give place to a second squad He and his companions were given hot coffee and indeed even gloved as they were the job had been a cold one They sat drinking it and regarding each other with satisfaction One man spoke to Bert amiably in German and Bert nodded and smiled Through Kurt Bert whose ankles were almost frozen succeeded in getting a pair of top boots from one of the disabled men In the afternoon the wind abated greatly and small infrequent snowflakes came drifting by Snow also spread more abundantly below and the only trees were clumps of pine and spruce in the lower valleys Kurt went with three men into the still intact gas chambers let out a certain quantity of gas from them and prepared a series of ripping panels for the descent Also the residue of the bombs and explosives in the magazine were thrown overboard and fell detonating loudly in the wilderness below And about four o clock in the afternoon upon a wide and rocky plain within sight of snow crested cliffs the Vaterland ripped and grounded It was necessarily a difficult and violent affair for the Vaterland had not been planned for the necessities of a balloon The captain got one panel ripped too soon and the others not soon enough She dropped heavily bounced clumsily and smashed the hanging gallery into the fore part mortally injuring Von Winterfeld and then came down in a collapsing heap after dragging for some moments The forward shield and its machine gun tumbled in upon the things below Two men were hurt badly one got a broken leg and one was internally injured by flying rods and wires and Bert was pinned for a time under the side When at last he got clear and could take a view of the situation the great black eagle that had started so splendidly from Franconia six evenings ago sprawled deflated over the cabins of the airship and the frost bitten rocks of this desolate place and looked a most unfortunate bird as though some one had caught it and wrung its neck and cast it aside Several of the crew of the airship were standing about in silence contemplating the wreckage and the empty wilderness into which they had fallen Others were busy under the imromptu tent made by the empty gas chambers The Prince had gone a little way off and was scrutinising the distant heights through his field glass They had the appearance of old sea cliffs here and there were small clumps of conifers and in two places tall cascades The nearer ground was strewn with glaciated boulders and supported nothing but a stunted Alpine vegetation of compact clustering stems and stalkless flowers No river was visible but the air was full of the rush and babble of a torrent close at hand A bleak and biting wind was blowing Ever and again a snowflake drifted past The springless frozen earth under Bert s feet felt strangely dead and heavy after the buoyant airship six So it came about that that great and powerful Prince Karl Albert was for a time thrust out of the stupendous conflict he chiefly had been instrumental in provoking The chances of battle and the weather conspired to maroon him in Labrador and there he raged for six long days while war and wonder swept the world Nation rose against nation and air fleet grappled air fleet cities blazed and men died in multitudes but in Labrador one might have dreamt that except for a little noise of hammering the world was at peace There the encampment lay from a distance the cabins covered over with the silk of the balloon part looked like a gipsy s tent on a rather exceptional scale and all the available hands were busy in building out of the steel of the framework a mast from which the Vaterland s electricians might hang the long conductors of the apparatus for wireless telegraphy that was to link the Prince to the world again There were times when it seemed they would never rig that mast From the outset the party suffered hardship They were not too abundantly provisioned and they were put on short rations and for all the thick garments they had they were but ill equipped against the piercing wind and inhospitable violence of this wilderness The first night was spent in darkness and without fires The engines that had supplied power were smashed and dropped far away to the south and there was never a match among the company It had been death to carry matches All the explosives had been thrown out of the magazine and it was only towards morning that the bird faced man whose cabin Bert had taken in the beginning confessed to a brace of duelling pistols and cartridges with which a fire could be started Afterwards the lockers of the machine gun were found to contain a supply of unused ammunition The night was a distressing one and seemed almost interminable Hardly any one slept There were seven wounded men aboard and Von Winterfeld s head had been injured and he was shivering and in delirium struggling with his attendant and shouting strange things about the burning of New York The men crept together in the mess room in the darkling wrapped in what they could find and drank cocoa from the fireless heaters and listened to his cries In the morning the Prince made them a speech about Destiny and the God of his Fathers and the pleasure and glory of giving one s life for his dynasty and a number of similar considerations that might otherwise have been neglected in that bleak wilderness The men cheered without enthusiasm and far away a wolf howled Then they set to work and for a week they toiled to put up a mast of steel and hang from it a gridiron of copper wires two hundred feet by twelve The theme of all that time was work work continually straining and toilsome work and all the rest was grim hardship and evil chances save for a certain wild splendour in the sunset and sunrise in the torrents and drifting weather in the wilderness about them They built and tended a ring of perpetual fires gangs roamed for brushwood and met with wolves and the wounded men and their beds were brought out from the airship cabins and put in shelters about the fires There old Von Winterfeld raved and became quiet and presently died and three of the other wounded sickened for want of good food while their fellows mended These things happened as it were in the wings the central facts before Bert s consciousness were always firstly the perpetual toil the holding and lifting and lugging at heavy and clumsy masses the tedious filing and winding of wires and secondly the Prince urgent and threatening whenever a man relaxed He would stand over them and point over their heads southward into the empty sky The world there he said in German is waiting for us Fifty Centuries come to their Consummation Bert did not understand the words but he read the gesture Several times the Prince grew angry once with a man who was working slowly once with a man who stole a comrade s ration The first he scolded and set to a more tedious task the second he struck in the face and ill used He did no work himself There was a clear space near the fires in which he would walk up and down sometimes for two hours together with arms folded muttering to himself of Patience and his destiny At times these mutterings broke out into rhetoric into shouts and gestures that would arrest the workers they would stare at him until they perceived that his blue eyes glared and his waving hand addressed itself always to the southward hills On Sunday the work ceased for half an hour and the Prince preached on faith and God s friendship for David and afterwards they all sang Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott In an improvised hovel lay Von Winterfeld and all one morning he raved of the greatness of Germany Blut und Eisen he shouted and then as if in derision Welt Politik ha ha Then he would explain complicated questions of polity to imaginary hearers in low wily tones The other sick men kept still listening to him Bert s distracted attention would be recalled by Kurt Smallways take that end So Slowly tediously the great mast was rigged and hoisted foot by foot into place The electricians had contrived a catchment pool and a wheel in the torrent close at hand for the little Mulhausen dynamo with its turbinal volute used by the telegraphists was quite adaptable to water driving and on the sixth day in the evening the apparatus was in working order and the Prince was calling weakly indeed but calling to his air fleet across the empty spaces of the world For a time he called unheeded The effect of that evening was to linger long in Bert s memory A red fire spluttered and blazed close by the electricians at their work and red gleams xan up the vertical steel mast and threads of copper wire towards the zenith The Prince sat on a rock close by with his chin on his hand waiting Beyond and to the northward was the cairn that covered Von Winterfeld surmounted by a cross of steel and from among the tumbled rocks in the distance the eyes of a wolf gleamed redly On the other hand was the wreckage of the great airship and the men bivouacked about a second ruddy flare They were all keeping very still as if waiting to hear what news might presently be given them Far away across many hundreds of miles of desolation other wireless masts would be clicking and snapping and waking into responsive vibration Perhaps they were not Perhaps those throbs upon the ethers wasted themselves upon a regardless world When the men spoke they spoke in low tones Now and then a bird shrieked remotely and once a wolf howled All these things were set in the immense cold spaciousness of the wild seven Bert got the news last and chiefly in broken English from a linguist among his mates It was only far on in the night that the weary telegraphist got an answer to his calls but then the messages came clear and strong And such news it was I say said Bert at his breakfast amidst a great clamour tell us a bit All de vorlt is at vor said the linguist waving his cocoa in an illustrative manner 
6568-69911-0000	train-other-500	all de vorlt is at vor Bert stared southward into the dawn It did not seem so All de vorlt is at vor They haf burn Berlin they haf burn London

none	none	 Burnt up London ave they Like we did New York It wass a bombardment 
6568-69911-0003	train-other-500	They don t say anything about a place called Clapham or Bun Hill do they I haf heard noding said the linguist That was all Bert could get for a time But the excitement of all the men about him was contagious
6568-69911-0004	train-other-500	and presently he saw Kurt standing alone hands behind him and looking at one of the distant waterfalls very steadfastly He went up and saluted soldier fashion Beg pardon lieutenant he said Kurt turned his face
6568-69911-0005	train-other-500	It was unusually grave that morning I was just thinking I would like to see that waterfall closer he said It reminds me what do you want
none	none	 I can t make ead or tail of what they re saying sir 
6568-69911-0006	train-other-500	Would you mind telling me the news Damn the news said Kurt You ll get news enough before the day s out It s the end of the world They re sending the Graf Zeppelin for us She ll be here by the morning and we ought to be at Niagara or eternal smash within eight
6568-69911-0007	train-other-500	and forty hours I want to look at that waterfall You d better come with me Have you had your rations Yessir Very well Come
6568-69911-0008	train-other-500	And musing profoundly Kurt led the way across the rocks towards the distant waterfall For a time Bert walked behind him in the character of an escort then as they passed out of the atmosphere of the encampment Kurt lagged for him to come alongside
6568-69911-0009	train-other-500	We shall be back in it all in two days time he said And it s a devil of a war to go back to That s the news The world s gone mad Our fleet beat the Americans the night we got disabled that s clear
6568-69911-0010	train-other-500	We lost eleven eleven airships certain and all their aeroplanes got smashed God knows how much we smashed or how many we killed But that was only the beginning Our start s been like firing a magazine
none	none	 Every country was hiding flying machines 
6568-69911-0011	train-other-500	They re fighting in the air all over Europe all over the world The Japanese and Chinese have joined in That s the great fact That s the supreme fact They ve pounced into our little quarrels The Yellow Peril was a peril after all They ve got thousands of airships
none	none	 They re all over the world We bombarded London and Paris and now the French and English have smashed up Berlin And now Asia is at us all and on the top of us all It s mania China on the top And they don t know where to stop It s limitless 
6568-69911-0012	train-other-500	It s the last confusion They re bombarding capitals smashing up dockyards and factories mines and fleets Did they do much to London sir asked Bert Heaven knows He said no more for a time
6568-69911-0013	train-other-500	This Labrador seems a quiet place he resumed at last
none	none	 I m half a mind to stay here Can t do that No I ve got to see it through I ve got to see it through You ve got to too Every one But why I tell you our world s gone to pieces There s no way out of it no way back Here we are We re like mice caught in a house on fire we re like cattle overtaken by a flood Presently we shall be picked up and back we shall go into the fighting We shall kill and smash again perhaps It s a Chino Japanese air fleet this time and the odds are against us Our turns will come What will happen to you I don t know but for myself I know quite well I shall be killed You ll be all right said Bert after a queer pause No said Kurt 
6568-69911-0014	train-other-500	I m going to be killed I didn t know it before but this morning at dawn I knew it as though I d been told Ow I tell you I know But ow COULD you know I know Like being told Like being certain
6568-69911-0015	train-other-500	I know he repeated and for a time they walked in silence towards the waterfall Kurt wrapped in his thoughts walked heedlessly and at last broke out again I ve always felt young before Smallways but this morning I feel old
6568-69911-0016	train-other-500	old So old Nearer to death than old men feel And I ve always thought life was a lark It isn t This sort of thing has always been happening I suppose these things wars and earthquakes that sweep across all the decency of life
6568-69911-0017	train-other-500	It s just as though I had woke up to it all for the first time Every night since we were at New York I ve dreamt of it And it s always been so it s the way of life People are torn away from the people they care for homes are smashed creatures full of life
6568-69911-0018	train-other-500	and memories and little peculiar gifts are scalded and smashed and torn to pieces and starved and spoilt
none	none	 London Berlin San Francisco Think of all the human histories we ended in New York 
6568-69911-0019	train-other-500	And the others go on again as though such things weren t possible As I went on
none	none	 Like animals Just like animals 
6568-69911-0020	train-other-500	He said nothing for a long time and then he dropped out The Prince is a lunatic They came to a place where they had to climb and then to a long peat level beside a rivulet There a quantity of delicate little pink flowers caught Bert s eye
6568-69911-0021	train-other-500	Gaw he said and stooped to pick one In a place like this
none	none	 Kurt stopped and half turned His face winced I never see such a flower said Bert It s so delicate Pick some more if you want to said Kurt Bert did so while Kurt stood and watched him Funny ow one always wants to pick flowers said Bert Kurt had nothing to add to that They went on again without talking for a long time 
6568-69911-0022	train-other-500	At last they came to a rocky hummock from which the view of the waterfall opened out There Kurt stopped and seated himself on a rock
none	none	 That s as much as I wanted to see he explained 
6568-69911-0023	train-other-500	It isn t very like but it s like enough Like what Another waterfall I knew He asked a question abruptly Got a girl Smallways Funny thing said Bert those flowers I suppose I was jes thinking of er
6568-69911-0024	train-other-500	So was I WHAT Edna No I was thinking of MY Edna We ve all got Ednas I suppose for our imaginations to play about This was a girl But all that s past for ever It s hard to think I can t see her just for a minute
6568-69911-0025	train-other-500	just let her know I m thinking of her Very likely said Bert you ll see er all right No said Kurt with decision I KNOW
none	none	 I met her he went on in a place like this in the Alps 
6568-69911-0026	train-other-500	Engstlen Alp There s a waterfall rather like this one a broad waterfall
none	none	 down towards Innertkirchen That s why I came here this morning 
6568-69911-0027	train-other-500	We slipped away and had half a day together beside it And we picked flowers Just such flowers as you picked The same for all I know
none	none	 And gentian 
6568-69911-0028	train-other-500	I know said Bert me and Edna we done things like that Flowers And all that Seems years off now She was beautiful and daring and shy
none	none	 Mein Gott 
6568-69911-0029	train-other-500	I can hardly hold myself for the desire to see her and hear her voice again before I die Where is she Look here Smallways I shall write a sort of letter And there s her portrait He touched his breast pocket
6568-69911-0030	train-other-500	You ll see er again all right said Bert No I shall never see her again I don t understand why people should meet just to be torn apart But I know she and I will never meet again
none	none	 That I know as surely as that the sun will rise and that cascade come shining over the rocks after I am dead and done 
6568-69911-0031	train-other-500	Oh It s all foolishness and haste and violence and cruel folly stupidity and blundering hate and selfish ambition all the things that men have done all the things they will ever do Gott Smallways
6568-69911-0032	train-other-500	what a muddle and confusion life has always been the battles and massacres and disasters the hates and harsh acts the murders and sweatings the lynchings and cheatings
none	none	 This morning I am tired of it all 
6568-69911-0033	train-other-500	as though I d just found it out for the first time I HAVE found it out

countries south of these Arctic solitudes stricken with terror and dismay as these new born aerial navies swept across their skies He was not used to thinking of the world as a whole but as a limitless hinterland of happenings beyond the range of his immediate vision War in his imagination was something a source of news and emotion that happened in a restricted area called the Seat of War But now the whole atmosphere was the Seat of War and every land a cockpit So closely had the nations raced along the path of research and invention so secret and yet so parallel had been their plans and acquisitions that it was within a few hours of the launching of the first fleet in Franconia that an Asiatic Armada beat its west ward way across high above the marvelling millions in the plain of the Ganges But the preparations of the Confederation of Eastern Asia had been on an altogether more colossal scale than the German With this step said Tan Ting siang we overtake and pass the West We recover the peace of the world that these barbarians have destroyed Their secrecy and swiftness and inventions had far surpassed those of the Germans and where the Germans had had a hundred men at work the Asiatics had ten thousand There came to their great aeronautic parks at Chinsi fu and Tsingyen by the mono rails that now laced the whole surface of China a limitless supply of skilled and able workmen workmen far above the average European in industrial efficiency The news of the German World Surprise simply quickened their efforts At the time of the bombardment of New York it is doubtful if the Germans had three hundred airships all together in the world the score of Asiatic fleets flying east and west and south must have numbered several thousand Moreover the Asiatics had a real fighting flying machine the Niais as they were called a light but quite efficient weapon infinitely superior to the German drachenflieger Like that it was a one man machine but it was built very lightly of steel and cane and chemical silk with a transverse engine and a flapping sidewing The aeronaut carried a gun firing explosive bullets loaded with oxygen and in addition and true to the best tradition of Japan a sword Mostly they were Japanese and it is characteristic that from the first it was contemplated that the aeronaut should be a swordsman The wings of these flyers had bat like hooks forward by which they were to cling to their antagonist s gas chambers while boarding him These light flying machines were carried with the fleets and also sent overland or by sea to the front with the men They were capable of flights of from two to five hundred miles according to the wind So hard upon the uprush of the first German air fleet these Asiatic swarms took to the atmosphere Instantly every organised Government in the world was frantically and vehemently building airships and whatever approach to a flying machine its inventors had discovered There was no time for diplomacy Warnings and ultimatums were telegraphed to and fro and in a few hours all the panic fierce world was openly at war and at war in the most complicated way For Britain and France and Italy had declared war upon Germany and outraged Swiss neutrality India at the sight of Asiatic airships had broken into a Hindoo insurrection in Bengal and a Mohametan revolt hostile to this in the North west Provinces the latter spreading like wildfire from Gobi to the Gold Coast and the Confederation of Eastern Asia had seized the oil wells of Burmha and was impartially attacking America and Germany In a week they were building airships in Damascus and Cairo and Johannesburg Australia and New Zealand were frantically equipping themselves One unique and terrifying aspect of this development was the swiftness with which these monsters could be produced To build an ironclad took from two to four years an airship could be put together in as many weeks Moreover compared with even a torpedo boat the airship was remarkably simple to construct given the air chamber material the engines the gas plant and the design it was really not more complicated and far easier than an ordinary wooden boat had been a hundred years before And now from Cape Horn to Nova Zembla and from Canton round to Canton again there were factories and workshops and industrial resources And the German airships were barely in sight of the Atlantic waters the first Asiatic fleet was scarcely reported from Upper Burmah before the fantastic fabric of credit and finance that had held the world together economically for a hundred years strained and snapped A tornado of realisation swept through every stock exchange in the world banks stopped payment business shrank and ceased factories ran on for a day or so by a sort of inertia completing the orders of bankrupt and extinguished customers then stopped The New York Bert Smallways saw for all its glare of light and traffic was in the pit of an economic and financial collapse unparalleled in history The flow of the food supply was already a little checked And before the world war had lasted two weeks by the time that is that mast was rigged in Labrador there was not a city or town in the world outside China however far from the actual centres of destruction where police and government were not adopting special emergency methods to deal with a want of food and a glut of unemployed people The special peculiarities of aerial warfare were of such a nature as to trend once it had begun almost inevitably towards social disorganisation The first of these peculiarities was brought home to the Germans in their attack upon New York the immense power of destruction an airship has over the thing below and its relative inability to occupy or police or guard or garrison a surrendered position Necessarily in the face of urban populations in a state of economic disorganisation and infuriated and starving this led to violent and destructive collisions and even where the air fleet floated inactive above there would be civil conflict and passionate disorder below Nothing comparable to this state of affairs had been known in the previous history of warfare unless we take such a case as that of a nineteenth century warship attacking some large savage or barbaric settlement or one of those naval bombardments that disfigure the history of Great Britain in the late eighteenth century Then indeed there had been cruelties and destruction that faintly foreshadowed the horrors of the aerial war Moreover before the twentieth century the world had had but one experience and that a comparatively light one in the Communist insurrection of Paris eighteen seventy one of the possibilities of a modern urban population under warlike stresses A second peculiarity of airship war as it first came to the world that also made for social collapse was the ineffectiveness of the early air ships against each other Upon anything below they could rain explosives in the most deadly fashion forts and ships and cities lay at their mercy but unless they were prepared for a suicidal grapple they could do remarkably little mischief to each other The armament of the huge German airships big as the biggest mammoth liners afloat was one machine gun that could easily have been packed up on a couple of mules In addition when it became evident that the air must be fought for the air sailors were provided with rifles with explosive bullets of oxygen or inflammable substance but no airship at any time ever carried as much in the way of guns and armour as the smallest gunboat on the navy list had been accustomed to do Consequently when these monsters met in battle they manoeuvred for the upper place or grappled and fought like junks throwing grenades fighting hand to hand in an entirely medieval fashion The risks of a collapse and fall on either side came near to balancing in every case the chances of victory As a consequence and after their first experiences of battle one finds a growing tendency on the part of the air fleet admirals to evade joining battle and to seek rather the moral advantage of a destructive counter attack And if the airships were too ineffective the early drachenflieger were either too unstable like the German or too light like the Japanese to produce immediately decisive results Later it is true the Brazilians launched a flying machine of a type and scale that was capable of dealing with an airship but they built only three or four they operated only in South America and they vanished from history untraceably in the time when world bankruptcy put a stop to all further engineering production on any considerable scale The third peculiarity of aerial warfare was that it was at once enormously destructive and entirely indecisive It had this unique feature that both sides lay open to punitive attack In all previous forms of war both by land and sea the losing side was speedily unable to raid its antagonist s territory and the communications One fought on a front and behind that front the winner s supplies and resources his towns and factories and capital the peace of his country were secure If the war was a naval one you destroyed your enemy s battle fleet and then blockaded his ports secured his coaling stations and hunted down any stray cruisers that threatened your ports of commerce But to blockade and watch a coastline is one thing to blockade and watch the whole surface of a country is another and cruisers and privateers are things that take long to make that cannot be packed up and hidden and carried unostentatiously from point to point In aerial war the stronger side even supposing it destroyed the main battle fleet of the weaker had then either to patrol and watch or destroy every possible point at which he might produce another and perhaps a novel and more deadly form of flyer It meant darkening his air with airships It meant building them by the thousand and making aeronauts by the hundred thousand A small uninitated airship could be hidden in a railway shed in a village street in a wood a flying machine is even less conspicuous And in the air are no streets no channels no point where one can say of an antagonist If he wants to reach my capital he must come by here In the air all directions lead everywhere Consequently it was impossible to end a war by any of the established methods A having outnumbered and overwhelmed B hovers a thousand airships strong over his capital threatening to bombard it unless B submits B replies by wireless telegraphy that he is now in the act of bombarding the chief manufacturing city of A by means of three raider airships A denounces B s raiders as pirates and so forth bombards B s capital and sets off to hunt down B s airships while B in a state of passionate emotion and heroic unconquerableness sets to work amidst his ruins making fresh airships and explosives for the benefit of A The war became perforce a universal guerilla war a war inextricably involving civilians and homes and all the apparatus of social life These aspects of aerial fighting took the world by surprise There had been no foresight to deduce these consequences If there had been the world would have arranged for a Universal Peace Conference in nineteen hundred But mechanical invention had gone faster than intellectual and social organisation and the world with its silly old flags its silly unmeaning tradition of nationality its cheap newspapers and cheaper passions and imperialisms its base commercial motives and habitual insincerities and vulgarities its race lies and conflicts was taken by surprise Once the war began there was no stopping it The flimsy fabric of credit that had grown with no man foreseeing and that had held those hundreds of millions in an economic interdependence that no man clearly understood dissolved in panic Everywhere went the airships dropping bombs destroying any hope of a rally and everywhere below were economic catastrophe starving workless people rioting and social disorder Whatever constructive guiding intelligence there had been among the nations vanished in the passionate stresses of the time Such newspapers and documents and histories as survive from this period all tell one universal story of towns and cities with the food supply interrupted and their streets congested with starving unemployed of crises in administration and states of siege of provisional Governments and Councils of Defence and in the cases of India and Egypt insurrectionary committees taking charge of the re arming of the population of the making of batteries and gun pits of the vehement manufacture of airships and flying machines One sees these things in glimpses in illuminated moments as if through a driving reek of clouds going on all over the world It was the dissolution of an age it was the collapse of the civilisation that had trusted to machinery and the instruments of its destruction were machines But while the collapse of the previous great civilisation that of Rome had been a matter of centuries had been a thing of phase and phase like the ageing and dying of a man this like his killing by railway or motor car was one swift conclusive smashing and an end two The early battles of the aerial war were no doubt determined by attempts to realise the old naval maxim to ascertain the position of the enemy s fleet and to destroy it There was first the battle of the Bernese Oberland in which the Italian and French navigables in their flank raid upon the Franconian Park were assailed by the Swiss experimental squadron supported as the day wore on by German airships and then the encounter of the British Winterhouse Dunn aeroplanes with three unfortunate Germans Then came the Battle of North India in which the entire Anglo Indian aeronautic settlement establishment fought for three days against overwhelming odds and was dispersed and destroyed in detail And simultaneously with the beginning of that commenced the momentous struggle of the Germans and Asiatics that is usually known as the Battle of Niagara because of the objective of the Asiatic attack But it passed gradually into a sporadic conflict over half a continent Such German airships as escaped destruction in battle descended and surrendered to the Americans and were re manned and in the end it became a series of pitiless and heroic encounters between the Americans savagely resolved to exterminate their enemies and a continually reinforced army of invasion from Asia quartered upon the Pacific slope and supported by an immense fleet From the first the war in America was fought with implacable bitterness no quarter was asked no prisoners were taken With ferocious and magnificent energy the Americans constructed and launched ship after ship to battle and perish against the Asiatic multitudes All other affairs were subordinate to this war the whole population was presently living or dying for it Presently as I shall tell the white men found in the Butteridge machine a weapon that could meet and fight the flying machines of the Asiatic swordsman The Asiatic invasion of America completely effaced the German American conflict It vanishes from history At first it had seemed to promise quite sufficient tragedy in itself beginning as it did in unforgettable massacre After the destruction of central New York all America had risen like one man resolved to die a thousand deaths rather than submit to Germany The Germans grimly resolved upon beating the Americans into submission and following out the plans developed by the Prince had seized Niagara in order to avail themselves of its enormous powerworks expelled all its inhabitants and made a desert of its environs as far as Buffalo They had also directly Great Britain and France declare war wrecked the country upon the Canadian side for nearly ten miles inland They began to bring up men and material from the fleet off the east coast stringing out to and fro like bees getting honey It was then that the Asiatic forces appeared and it was in their attack upon this German base at Niagara that the air fleets of East and West first met and the greater issue became clear One conspicuous peculiarity of the early aerial fighting arose from the profound secrecy with which the airships had been prepared Each power had had but the dimmest inkling of the schemes of its rivals and even experiments with its own devices were limited by the needs of secrecy None of the designers of airships and aeroplanes had known clearly what their inventions might have to fight many had not imagined they would have to fight anything whatever in the air and had planned them only for the dropping of explosives Such had been the German idea The only weapon for fighting another airship with which the Franconian fleet had been provided was the machine gun forward Only after the fight over New York were the men given short rifles with detonating bullets Theoretically the drachenflieger were to have been the fighting weapon They were declared to be aerial torpedo boats and the aeronaut was supposed to swoop close to his antagonist and cast his bombs as he whirled past But indeed these contrivances were hopelessly unstable not one third in any engagement succeeded in getting back to the mother airship The rest were either smashed up or grounded The allied Chino Japanese fleet made the same distinction as the Germans between airships and fighting machines heavier than air but the type in both cases was entirely different from the occidental models and it is eloquent of the vigour with which these great peoples took up and bettered the European methods of scientific research in almost every particular the invention of Asiatic engineers Chief among these it is worth remarking was Mohini K Chatterjee a political exile who had formerly served in the British Indian aeronautic park at Lahore The German airship was fish shaped with a blunted head the Asiatic airship was also fish shaped but not so much on the lines of a cod or goby as of a ray or sole It had a wide flat underside unbroken by windows or any opening except along the middle line Its cabins occupied its axis with a sort of bridge deck above and the gas chambers gave the whole affair the shape of a gipsy s hooped tent except that it was much flatter The German airship was essentially a navigable balloon very much lighter than air the Asiatic airship was very little lighter than air and skimmed through it with much greater velocity if with considerably less stability They carried fore and aft guns the latter much the larger throwing inflammatory shells and in addition they had nests for riflemen on both the upper and the under side Light as this armament was in comparison with the smallest gunboat that ever sailed it was sufficient for them to outfight as well as outfly the German monster airships In action they flew to get behind or over the Germans they even dashed underneath avoiding only passing immediately beneath the magazine and then as soon as they had crossed let fly with their rear gun and sent flares or oxygen shells into the antagonist s gas chambers It was not in their airships but as I have said in their flying machines proper that the strength of the Asiatics lay Next only to the Butteridge machine these were certainly the most efficient heavier than air fliers that had ever appeared They were the invention of a Japanese artist and they differed in type extremely from the box kite quality of the German drachenflieger They had curiously curved flexible side wings more like BENT butterfly s wings than anything else and made of a substance like celluloid and of brightly painted silk and they had a long humming bird tail At the forward corner of the wings were hooks rather like the claws of a bat by which the machine could catch and hang and tear at the walls of an airship s gas chamber The solitary rider sat between the wings above a transverse explosive engine an explosive engine that differed in no essential particular from those in use in the light motor bicycles of the period Below was a single large wheel The rider sat astride of a saddle as in the Butteridge machine and he carried a large double edged two handed sword in addition to his explosive bullet firing rifle three One sets down these particulars and compares the points of the American and German pattern of aeroplane and navigable but none of these facts were clearly known to any of those who fought in this monstrously confused battle above the American great lakes Each side went into action against it knew not what under novel conditions and with apparatus that even without hostile attacks was capable of producing the most disconcerting surprises Schemes of action attempts at collective manoeuvring necessarily went to pieces directly the fight began just as they did in almost all the early ironclad battles of the previous century Each captain then had to fall back upon individual action and his own devices one would see triumph in what another read as a cue for flight and despair It is as true of the Battle of Niagara as of the Battle of Lissa that it was not a battle but a bundle of battlettes To such a spectator as Bert it presented itself as a series of incidents some immense some trivial but collectively incoherent He never had a sense of any plain issue joined of any point struggled for and won or lost He saw tremendous things happen and in the end his world darkened to disaster and ruin He saw the battle from the ground from Prospect Park and from Goat Island whither he fled But the manner in which he came to be on the ground needs explaining The Prince had resumed command of his fleet through wireless telegraphy long before the Zeppelin had located his encampment in Labrador By his direction the German air fleet whose advance scouts had been in contact with the Japanese over the Rocky Mountains had concentrated upon Niagara and awaited his arrival He had rejoined his command early in the morning of the twelfth and Bert had his first prospect of the Gorge of Niagara while he was doing net drill outside the middle gas chamber at sunrise The Zeppelin was flying very high at the time and far below he saw the water in the gorge marbled with froth and then away to the west the great crescent of the Canadian Fall shining flickering and foaming in the level sunlight and sending up a deep incessant thudding rumble to the sky The air fleet was keeping station in an enormous crescent with its horns pointing south westward a long array of shining monsters with tails rotating slowly and German ensigns now trailing from their bellies aft of their Marconi pendants Niagara city was still largely standing then albeit its streets were empty of all life Its bridges were intact its hotels and restaurants still flying flags and inviting sky signs its power stations running But about it the country on both sides of the gorge might have been swept by a colossal broom Everything that could possibly give cover to an attack upon the German position at Niagara had been levelled as ruthlessly as machinery and explosives could contrive houses blown up and burnt woods burnt fences and crops destroyed The mono rails had been torn up and the roads in particular cleared of all possibility of concealment or shelter Seen from above the effect of this wreckage was grotesque Young woods had been destroyed whole sale by dragging wires and the spoilt saplings smashed or uprooted lay in swathes like corn after the sickle Houses had an appearance of being flattened down by the pressure of a gigantic finger Much burning was still going on and large areas had been reduced to patches of smouldering and sometimes still glowing blackness Here and there lay the debris of belated fugitives carts and dead bodies of horses and men and where houses had had water supplies there were pools of water and running springs from the ruptured pipes In unscorched fields horses and cattle still fed peacefully Beyond this desolated area the countryside was still standing but almost all the people had fled Buffalo was on fire to an enormous extent and there were no signs of any efforts to grapple with the flames Niagara city itself was being rapidly converted to the needs of a military depot A large number of skilled engineers had already been brought from the fleet and were busily at work adapting the exterior industrial apparatus of the place to the purposes of an aeronautic park They had made a gas recharging station at the corner of the American Fall above the funicular railway and they were opening up a much larger area to the south for the same purpose Over the power houses and hotels and suchlike prominent or important points the German flag was flying The Zeppelin circled slowly over this scene twice while the Prince surveyed it from the swinging gallery it then rose towards the centre of the crescent and transferred the Prince and his suite Kurt included to the Hohenzollern which had been chosen as the flagship during the impending battle They were swung up on a small cable from the forward gallery and the men of the Zeppelin manned the outer netting as the Prince and his staff left them The Zeppelin then came about circled down and grounded in Prospect Park in order to land the wounded and take aboard explosives for she had come to Labrador with her magazines empty it being uncertain what weight she might need to carry She also replenished the hydrogen in one of her forward chambers which had leaked Bert was detailed as a bearer and helped carry the wounded one by one into the nearest of the large hotels that faced the Canadian shore The hotel was quite empty except that there were two trained American nurses and a negro porter and three or four Germans awaiting them Bert went with the Zeppelin s doctor into the main street of the place and they broke into a drug shop and obtained various things of which they stood in need As they returned they found an officer and two men making a rough inventory of the available material in the various stores Except for them the wide main street of the town was quite deserted the people had been given three hours to clear out and everybody it seemed had done so At one corner a dead man lay against the wall shot Two or three dogs were visible up the empty vista but towards its river end the passage of a string of mono rail cars broke the stillness and the silence They were loaded with hose and were passing to the trainful of workers who were converting Prospect Park into an airship dock Bert pushed a case of medicine balanced on a bicycle taken from an adjacent shop to the hotel and then he was sent to load bombs into the Zeppelin magazine a duty that called for elaborate care From this job he was presently called off by the captain of the Zeppelin who sent him with a note to the officer in charge of the Anglo American Power Company for the field telephone had still to be adjusted Bert received his instructions in German whose meaning he guessed and saluted and took the note not caring to betray his ignorance of the language He started off with a bright air of knowing his way and turned a corner or so and was only beginning to suspect that he did not know where he was going when his attention was recalled to the sky by the report of a gun from the Hohenzollern and celestial cheering He looked up and found the view obstructed by the houses on either side of the street He hesitated and then curiosity took him back towards the bank of the river Here his view was inconvenienced by trees and it was with a start that he discovered the Zeppelin which he knew had still a quarter of her magazines to fill was rising over Goat Island She had not waited for her complement of ammunition It occurred to him that he was left behind He ducked back among the trees and bushes until he felt secure from any after thought on the part of the Zeppelin s captain Then his curiosity to see what the German air fleet faced overcame him and drew him at last halfway across the bridge to Goat Island From that point he had nearly a hemisphere of sky and got his first glimpse of the Asiatic airships low in the sky above the glittering tumults of the Upper Rapids They were far less impressive than the German ships He could not judge the distance and they flew edgeways to him so as to conceal the broader aspect of their bulk Bert stood there in the middle of the bridge in a place that most people who knew it remembered as a place populous with sightseers and excursionists and he was the only human being in sight there Above him very high in the heavens the contending air fleets manoeuvred below him the river seethed like a sluice towards the American Fall He was curiously dressed His cheap blue serge trousers were thrust into German airship rubber boots and on his head he wore an aeronaut s white cap that was a trifle too large for him He thrust that back to reveal his staring little Cockney face still scarred upon the brow Gaw he whispered He stared He gesticulated Once or twice he shouted and applauded Then at a certain point terror seized him and he took to his heels in the direction of Goat Island four For a time after they were in sight of each other neither fleet attempted to engage The Germans numbered sixty seven great airships and they maintained the crescent formation at a height of nearly four thousand feet They kept a distance of about one and a half lengths so that the horns of the crescent were nearly thirty miles apart Closely in tow of the airships of the extreme squadrons on either wing were about thirty drachenflieger ready manned but these were too small and distant for Bert to distinguish At first only what was called the Southern fleet of the Asiatics was visible to him It consisted of forty airships carrying all together nearly four hundred one man flying machines upon their flanks and for some time it flew slowly and at a minimum distance of perhaps a dozen miles from the Germans eastward across their front At first Bert could distinguish only the greater bulks then he perceived the one man machines as a multitude of very small objects drifting like motes in the sunshine about and beneath the larger shapes Bert saw nothing then of the second fleet of the Asiatics though probably that was coming into sight of the Germans at the time in the north west The air was very still the sky almost without a cloud and the German fleet had risen to an immense height so that the airships seemed no longer of any considerable size Both ends of their crescent showed plainly As they beat southward they passed slowly between Bert and the sunlight and became black outlines of themselves The drachenflieger appeared as little flecks of black on either wing of this aerial Armada The two fleets seemed in no hurry to engage The Asiatics went far away into the east quickening their pace and rising as they did so and then tailed out into a long column and came flying back rising towards the German left The squadrons of the latter came about facing this oblique advance and suddenly little flickerings and a faint crepitating sound told that they had opened fire For a time no effect was visible to the watcher on the bridge Then like a handful of snowflakes the drachenflieger swooped to the attack and a multitude of red specks whirled up to meet them It was to Bert s sense not only enormously remote but singularly inhuman Not four hours since he had been on one of those very airships and yet they seemed to him now not gas bags carrying men but strange sentient creatures that moved about and did things with a purpose of their own The flight of the Asiatic and German flying machines joined and dropped earthward became like a handful of white and red rose petals flung from a distant window grew larger until Bert could see the overturned ones spinning through the air and were hidden by great volumes of dark smoke that were rising in the direction of Buffalo For a time they all were hidden then two or three white and a number of red ones rose again into the sky like a swarm of big butterflies and circled fighting and drove away out of sight again towards the east A heavy report recalled Bert s eyes to the zenith and behold the great crescent had lost its dressing and burst into a disorderly long cloud of airships One had dropped halfway down the sky It was flaming fore and aft and even as Bert looked it turned over and fell spinning over and over itself and vanished into the smoke of Buffalo Bert s mouth opened and shut and he clutched tighter on the rail of the bridge For some moments they seemed long moments the two fleets remained without any further change flying obliquely towards each other and making what came to Bert s ears as a midget uproar Then suddenly from either side airships began dropping out of alignment smitten by missiles he could neither see nor trace The string of Asiatic ships swung round and either charged into or over it was difficult to say from below the shattered line of the Germans who seemed to open out to give way to them Some sort of manoeuvring began but Bert could not grasp its import The left of the battle became a confused dance of airships For some minutes up there the two crossing lines of ships looked so close it seemed like a hand to hand scuffle in the sky Then they broke up into groups and duels The descent of German air ships towards the lower sky increased One of them flared down and vanished far away in the north two dropped with something twisted and crippled in their movements then a group of antagonists came down from the zenith in an eddying conflict two Asiatics against one German and were presently joined by another and drove away eastward all together with others dropping out of the German line to join them One Asiatic either rammed or collided with a still more gigantic German and the two went spinning to destruction together The northern squadron of Asiatics came into the battle unnoted by Bert except that the multitude of ships above seemed presently increased In a little while the fight was utter confusion drifting on the whole to the southwest against the wind It became more and more a series of group encounters Here a huge German airship flamed earthward with a dozen flat Asiatic craft about her crushing her every attempt to recover Here another hung with its screw fighting off the swordsman from a swarm of flying machines Here again an Asiatic aflame at either end swooped out of the battle His attention went from incident to incident in the vast clearness overhead these conspicuous cases of destruction caught and held his mind it was only very slowly that any sort of scheme manifested itself between those nearer more striking episodes The mass of the airships that eddied remotely above was however neither destroying nor destroyed The majority of them seemed to be going at full speed and circling upward for position exchanging ineffectual shots as they did so Very little ramming was essayed after the first tragic downfall of rammer and rammed and what ever attempts at boarding were made were invisible to Bert There seemed however a steady attempt to isolate antagonists to cut them off from their fellows and bear them down causing a perpetual sailing back and interlacing of these shoaling bulks The greater numbers of the Asiatics and their swifter heeling movements gave them the effect of persistently attacking the Germans Overhead and evidently endeavouring to keep itself in touch with the works of Niagara a body of German airships drew itself together into a compact phalanx and the Asiatics became more and more intent upon breaking this up He was grotesquely reminded of fish in a fish pond struggling for crumbs He could see puny puffs of smoke and the flash of bombs but never a sound came down to him A flapping shadow passed for a moment between Bert and the sun and was followed by another A whirring of engines click clock clitter clock smote upon his ears Instantly he forgot the zenith Perhaps a hundred yards above the water out of the south riding like Valkyries swiftly through the air on the strange steeds the engineering of Europe had begotten upon the artistic inspiration of Japan came a long string of Asiatic swordsman The wings flapped jerkily click block clitter clock and the machines drove up they spread and ceased and the apparatus came soaring through the air So they rose and fell and rose again They passed so closely overhead that Bert could hear their voices calling to one another They swooped towards Niagara city and landed one after another in a long line in a clear space before the hotel But he did not stay to watch them land One yellow face had craned over and looked at him and for one enigmatical instant met his eyes It was then the idea came to Bert that he was altogether too conspicuous in the middle of the bridge and that he took to his heels towards Goat Island Thence dodging about among the trees with perhaps an excessive self consciousness he watched the rest of the struggle five When Bert s sense of security was sufficiently restored for him to watch the battle again he perceived that a brisk little fight was in progress between the Asiatic aeronauts and the German engineers for the possession of Niagara city It was the first time in the whole course of the war that he had seen anything resembling fighting as he had studied it in the illustrated papers of his youth It seemed to him almost as though things were coming right He saw men carrying rifles and taking cover and running briskly from point to point in a loose attacking formation The first batch of aeronauts had probably been under the impression that the city was deserted They had grounded in the open near Prospect Park and approached the houses towards the power works before they were disillusioned by a sudden fire They had scattered back to the cover of a bank near the water it was too far for them to reach their machines again they were lying and firing at the men in the hotels and frame houses about the power works Then to their support came a second string of red flying machines driving up from the east They rose up out of the haze above the houses and came round in a long curve as if surveying the position below The fire of the Germans rose to a roar and one of those soaring shapes gave an abrupt jerk backward and fell among the houses The others swooped down exactly like great birds upon the roof of the power house They caught upon it and from each sprang a nimble little figure and ran towards the parapet Other flapping bird shapes came into this affair but Bert had not seen their coming A staccato of shots came over to him reminding him of army manoeuvres of newspaper descriptions of fights of all that was entirely correct in his conception of warfare He saw quite a number of Germans running from the outlying houses towards the power house Two fell One lay still but the other wriggled and made efforts for a time The hotel that was used as a hospital and to which he had helped carry the wounded men from the Zeppelin earlier in the day suddenly ran up the Geneva flag The town that had seemed so quiet had evidently been concealing a considerable number of Germans and they were now concentrating to hold the central power house He wondered what ammunition they might have More and more of the Asiatic flying machines came into the conflict They had disposed of the unfortunate German drachenflieger and were now aiming at the incipient aeronautic park the electric gas generators and repair stations which formed the German base Some landed and their aeronauts took cover and became energetic infantry soldiers Others hovered above the fight their men ever and again firing shots down at some chance exposure below The firing came in paroxysms now there would be a watchful lull and now a rapid tattoo of shots rising to a roar Once or twice flying machines as they circled warily came right overhead and for a time Bert gave himself body and soul to cowering Ever and again a larger thunder mingled with the rattle and reminded him of the grapple of airships far above but the nearer fight held his attention Abruptly something dropped from the zenith something like a barrel or a huge football CRASH It smashed with an immense report It had fallen among the grounded Asiatic aeroplanes that lay among the turf and flower beds near the river They flew in scraps and fragments turf trees and gravel leapt and fell the aeronauts still lying along the canal bank were thrown about like sacks catspaws flew across the foaming water All the windows of the hotel hospital that had been shiningly reflecting blue sky and airships the moment before became vast black stars Bang a second followed Bert looked up and was filled with a sense of a number of monstrous bodies swooping down coming down on the whole affair like a flight of bellying blankets like a string of vast dish covers The central tangle of the battle above was circling down as if to come into touch with the power house fight He got a new effect of airships altogether as vast things coming down upon him growing swiftly larger and larger and more overwhelming until the houses over the way seemed small the American rapids narrow the bridge flimsy the combatants infinitesimal As they came down they became audible as a complex of shootings and vast creakings and groanings and beatings and throbbings and shouts and shots The fore shortened black eagles at the fore ends of the Germans had an effect of actual combat of flying feathers Some of these fighting airships came within five hundred feet of the ground Bert could see men on the lower galleries of the Germans firing rifles could see Asiatics clinging to the ropes saw one man in aluminium diver s gear fall flashing headlong into the waters above Goat Island For the first time he saw the Asiatic airships closely From this aspect they reminded him more than anything else of colossal snowshoes they had a curious patterning in black and white in forms that reminded him of the engine turned cover of a watch They had no hanging galleries but from little openings on the middle line peeped out men and the muzzles of guns So driving in long descending and ascending curves these monsters wrestled and fought It was like clouds fighting like puddings trying to assassinate each other They whirled and circled about each other and for a time threw Goat Island and Niagara into a smoky twilight through which the sunlight smote in shafts and beams They spread and closed and spread and grappled and drove round over the rapids and two miles away or more into Canada and back over the Falls again A German caught fire and the whole crowd broke away from her flare and rose about her dispersing leaving her to drop towards Canada and blow up as she dropped Then with renewed uproar the others closed again Once from the men in Niagara city came a sound like an ant hill cheering Another German burnt and one badly deflated by the prow of an antagonist flopped out of action southward It became more and more evident that the Germans were getting the worst of the unequal fight More and more obviously were they being persecuted Less and less did they seem to fight with any object other than escape The Asiatics swept by them and above them ripped their bladders set them alight picked off their dimly seen men in diving clothes who struggled against fire and tear with fire extinguishers and silk ribbons in the inner netting They answered only with ineffectual shots Thence the battle circled back over Niagara and then suddenly the Germans as if at a preconcerted signal broke and dispersed going east west north and south in open and confused flight The Asiatics as they realised this rose to fly above them and after them Only one little knot of four Germans and perhaps a dozen Asiatics remained fighting about the Hohenzollern and the Prince as he circled in a last attempt to save Niagara Round they swooped once again over the Canadian Fall over the waste of waters eastward until they were distant and small and then round and back hurrying bounding swooping towards the one gaping spectator The whole struggling mass approached very swiftly growing rapidly larger and coming out black and featureless against the afternoon sun and above the blinding welter of the Upper Rapids It grew like a storm cloud until once more it darkened the sky The flat Asiatic airships kept high above the Germans and behind them and fired unanswered bullets into their gas chambers and upon their flanks the one man flying machines hovered and alighted like a swarm of attacking bees Nearer they came and nearer filling the lower heaven Two of the Germans swooped and rose again but the Hohenzollern had suffered too much for that She lifted weakly turned sharply as if to get out of the battle burst into flames fore and aft swept down to the water splashed into it obliquely and rolled over and over and came down stream rolling and smashing and writhing like a thing alive halting and then coming on again with her torn and bent propeller still beating the air The bursting flames spluttered out again in clouds of steam It was a disaster gigantic in its dimensions She lay across the rapids like an island like tall cliffs tall cliffs that came rolling smoking and crumpling and collapsing advancing with a sort of fluctuating rapidity upon Bert One Asiatic airship it looked to Bert from below like three hundred yards of pavement whirled back and circled two or three times over that great overthrow and half a dozen crimson flying machines danced for a moment like great midges in the sunlight before they swept on after their fellows The rest of the fight had already gone over the island a wild crescendo of shots and yells and smashing uproar It was hidden from Bert now by the trees of the island and forgotten by him in the nearer spectacle of the huge advance of the defeated German airship Something fell with a mighty smashing and splintering of boughs unheeded behind him It seemed for a time that the Hohenzollern must needs break her back upon the Parting of the Waters and then for a time her propeller flopped and frothed in the river and thrust the mass of buckling crumpled wreckage towards the American shore Then the sweep of the torrent that foamed down to the American Fall caught her and in another minute the immense mass of deflating wreckage with flames spurting out in three new places had crashed against the bridge that joined Goat Island and Niagara city and forced a long arm as it were in a heaving tangle under the central span Then the middle chambers blew up with a loud report and in another moment the bridge had given way and the main bulk of the airship like some grotesque cripple in rags staggered flapping and waving flambeaux to the crest of the Fall and hesitated there and vanished in a desperate suicidal leap Its detached fore end remained jammed against that little island Green Island it used to be called which forms the stepping stone between the mainland and Goat Island s patch of trees Bert followed this disaster from the Parting of the Waters to the bridge head Then regardless of cover regardless of the Asiatic airship hovering like a huge house roof without walls above the Suspension Bridge he sprinted along towards the north and came out for the first time upon that rocky point by Luna Island that looks sheer down upon the American Fall There he stood breathless amidst that eternal rush of sound breathless and staring Far below and travelling rapidly down the gorge whirled something like a huge empty sack For him it meant what did it not mean the German air fleet Kurt the Prince Europe all things stable and familiar the forces that had brought him the forces that had seemed indisputably victorious And it went down the rapids like an empty sack and left the visible world to Asia to yellow people beyond Christendom to all that was terrible and strange Remote over Canada receded the rest of that conflict and vanished beyond the range of his vision CHAPTER IX ON GOAT ISLAND one The whack of a bullet on the rocks beside him reminded him that he was a visible object and wearing at least portions of a German uniform It drove him into the trees again and for a time he dodged and dropped and sought cover like a chick hiding among reeds from imaginary hawks Beaten he whispered Beaten and done for Chinese Yellow chaps chasing em At last he came to rest in a clump of bushes near a locked up and deserted refreshment shed within view of the American side They made a sort of hole and harbour for him they met completely overhead He looked across the rapids but the firing had ceased now altogether and everything seemed quiet The Asiatic aeroplane had moved from its former position above the Suspension Bridge was motionless now above Niagara city shadowing all that district about the power house which had been the scene of the land fight The monster had an air of quiet and assured predominance and from its stern it trailed serene and ornamental a long streaming flag the red black and yellow of the great alliance the Sunrise and the Dragon Beyond to the east at a much higher level hung a second consort and Bert presently gathering courage wriggled out and craned his neck to find another still airship against the sunset in the south Gaw he said Beaten and chased My Gawd The fighting it seemed at first was quite over in Niagara city though a German flag was still flying from one shattered house A white sheet was hoisted above the power house and this remained flying all through the events that followed But presently came a sound of shots and then German soldiers running They disappeared among the houses and then came two engineers in blue shirts and trousers hotly pursued by three Japanese swordsman The foremost of the two fugitives was a shapely man and ran lightly and well the second was a sturdy little man and rather fat He ran comically in leaps and bounds with his plump arms bent up by his side and his head thrown back The pursuers ran with uniforms and dark thin metal and leather head dresses The little man stumbled and Bert gasped realising a new horror in war The foremost swordsman won three strides on him and was near enough to slash at him and miss as he spurted A dozen yards they ran and then the swordsman slashed again and Bert could hear across the waters a little sound like the moo of an elfin cow as the fat little man fell forward Slash went the swordsman and slash at something on the ground that tried to save itself with ineffectual hands Oh I carn t cried Bert near blubbering and staring with starting eyes The swordsman slashed a fourth time and went on as his fellows came up after the better runner The hindmost swordsman stopped and turned back He had perceived some movement perhaps but at any rate he stood and ever and again slashed at the fallen body Oo oo groaned Bert at every slash and shrank closer into the bushes and became very still Presently came a sound of shots from the town and then everything was quiet everything even the hospital He saw presently little figures sheathing swords come out from the houses and walk to the debris of the flying machines the bomb had destroyed Others appeared wheeling undamaged aeroplanes upon their wheels as men might wheel bicycles and sprang into the saddles and flapped into the air A string of three airships appeared far away in the east and flew towards the zenith The one that hung low above Niagara city came still lower and dropped a rope ladder to pick up men from the power house For a long time he watched the further happenings in Niagara city as a rabbit might watch a meet He saw men going from building to building to set fire to them as he presently realised and he heard a series of dull detonations from the wheel pit of the power house Some similar business went on among the works on the Canadian side Meanwhile more and more airships appeared and many more flying machines until at last it seemed to him nearly a third of the Asiatic fleet had re assembled He watched them from his bush cramped but immovable watched them gather and range themselves and signal and pick up men until at last they sailed away towards the glowing sunset going to the great Asiatic rendez vous above the oil wells of Cleveland They dwindled and passed away leaving him alone so far as he could tell the only living man in a world of ruin and strange loneliness almost beyond describing He watched them recede and vanish He stood gaping after them Gaw he said at last like one who rouses himself from a trance It was far more than any personal desolation extremity that flooded his soul It seemed to him indeed that this must be the sunset of his race two He did not at first envisage his own plight in definite and comprehensible terms Things happened to him so much of late his own efforts had counted for so little that he had become passive and planless His last scheme had been to go round the coast of England as a Desert Dervish giving refined entertainment to his fellow creatures Fate had quashed that Fate had seen fit to direct him to other destinies had hurried him from point to point and dropped him at last upon this little wedge of rock between the cataracts It did not instantly occur to him that now it was his turn to play He had a singular feeling that all must end as a dream ends that presently surely he would be back in the world of Grubb and Edna and Bun Hill that this roar this glittering presence of incessant water would be drawn aside as a curtain is drawn aside after a holiday lantern show and old familiar customary things re assume their sway It would be interesting to tell people how he had seen Niagara And then Kurt s words came into his head People torn away from the people they care for homes smashed creatures full of life and memories and peculiar little gifts torn to pieces starved and spoilt He wondered half incredulous if that was in deed true It was so hard to realise it Out beyond there was it possible that Tom and Jessica were also in some dire extremity that the little green grocer s shop was no longer standing open with Jessica serving respectfully warming Tom s ear in sharp asides or punctually sending out the goods He tried to think what day of the week it was and found he had lost his reckoning Perhaps it was Sunday If so were they going to church or were they hiding perhaps in bushes What had happened to the landlord the butcher and to Butteridge and all those people on Dymchurch beach Something he knew had happened to London a bombardment But who had bombarded Were Tom and Jessica too being chased by strange brown men with long bare swords and evil eyes He thought of various possible aspects of affliction but presently one phase ousted all the others Were they getting much to eat The question haunted him obsessed him If one was very hungry would one eat rats It dawned upon him that a peculiar misery that oppressed him was not so much anxiety and patriotic sorrow as hunger Of course he was hungry He reflected and turned his steps towards the little refreshment shed that stood near the end of the ruined bridge Ought to be somethin He strolled round it once or twice and then attacked the shutters with his pocket knife reinforced presently by a wooden stake he found conveniently near At last he got a shutter to give and tore it back and stuck in his head Grub he remarked anyhow Leastways He got at the inside fastening of the shutter and had presently this establishment open for his exploration He found several sealed bottles of sterilized milk much mineral water two tins of biscuits and a crock of very stale cakes cigarettes in great quantity but very dry some rather dry oranges nuts some tins of canned meat and fruit and plates and knives and forks and glasses sufficient for several score of people There was also a zinc locker but he was unable to negotiate the padlock of this Shan t starve said Bert for a bit anyhow He sat on the vendor s seat and regaled himself with biscuits and milk and felt for a moment quite contented Quite restful he muttered munching and glancing about him restlessly after what I been through Crikey WOT a day Oh WOT a day Wonder took possession of him Gaw he cried Wot a fight it s been Smashing up the poor fellers Eadlong The airships the fliers and all I wonder what happened to the Zeppelin And that chap Kurt I wonder what happened to im E was a good sort of chap was Kurt Some phantom of imperial solicitude floated through his mind Injia he said A more practical interest arose I wonder if there s anything to open one of these tins of corned beef three After he had feasted Bert lit a cigarette and sat meditative for a time Wonder where Grubb is he said I do wonder that Wonder if any of em wonder about me He reverted to his own circumstances Dessay I shall ave to stop on this island for some time He tried to feel at his ease and secure but presently the indefinable restlessness of the social animal in solitude distressed him He began to want to look over his shoulder and as a corrective roused himself to explore the rest of the island It was only very slowly that he began to realise the peculiarities of his position to perceive that the breaking down of the arch between Green Island and the mainland had cut him off completely from the world Indeed it was only when he came back to where the fore end of the Hohenzollern lay like a stranded ship and was contemplating the shattered bridge that this dawned upon him Even then it came with no sort of shock to his mind a fact among a number of other extraordinary and unmanageable facts He stared at the shattered cabins of the Hohenzollern and its widow s garment of dishevelled silk for a time but without any idea of its containing any living thing it was all so twisted and smashed and entirely upside down Then for a while he gazed at the evening sky A cloud haze was now appearing and not an airship was in sight A swallow flew by and snapped some invisible victim Like a dream he repeated Then for a time the rapids held his mind Roaring It keeps on roaring and splashin always and always Keeps on At last his interests became personal Wonder what I ought to do now He reflected Not an idee he said He was chiefly conscious that a fortnight ago he had been in Bun Hill with no idea of travel in his mind and that now he was between the Falls of Niagara amidst the devastation and ruins of the greatest air fight in the world and that in the interval he had been across France Belgium Germany England Ireland and a number of other countries It was an interesting thought and suitable for conversation but of no great practical utility Wonder ow I can get orf this he said Wonder if there is a way out If not rummy Further reflection decided I believe I got myself in a bit of a ole coming over that bridge Any ow got me out of the way of them Japanesy chaps Wouldn t ave taken em long to cut MY froat No Still He resolved to return to the point of Luna Island For a long time he stood without stirring scrutinising the Canadian shore and the wreckage of hotels and houses and the fallen trees of the Victoria Park pink now in the light of sundown Not a human being was perceptible in that scene of headlong destruction Then he came back to the American side of the island crossed close to the crumpled aluminium wreckage of the Hohenzollern to Green Islet and scrutinised the hopeless breach in the further bridge and the water that boiled beneath it Towards Buffalo there was still much smoke and near the position of the Niagara railway station the houses were burning vigorously Everything was deserted now everything was still One little abandoned thing lay on a transverse path between town and road a crumpled heap of clothes with sprawling limbs Ave a look round said Bert and taking a path that ran through the middle of the island he presently discovered the wreckage of the two Asiatic aeroplanes that had fallen out of the struggle that ended the Hohenzollern With the first he found the wreckage of an aeronaut too The machine had evidently dropped vertically and was badly knocked about amidst a lot of smashed branches in a clump of trees Its bent and broken wings and shattered stays sprawled amidst new splintered wood and its forepeak stuck into the ground The aeronaut dangled weirdly head downward among the leaves and branches some yards away and Bert only discovered him as he turned from the aeroplane In the dusky evening light and stillness for the sun had gone now and the wind had altogether fallen this inverted yellow face was anything but a tranquilising object to discover suddenly a couple of yards away A broken branch had run clean through the man s thorax and he hung so stabbed looking limp and absurd In his hand he still clutched with the grip of death a short light rifle For some time Bert stood very still inspecting this thing Then he began to walk away from it looking constantly back at it Presently in an open glade he came to a stop Gaw he whispered I don like dead bodies some ow I d almost rather that chap was alive He would not go along the path athwart which the Chinaman hung He felt he would rather not have trees round him any more and that it would be more comfortable to be quite close to the sociable splash and uproar of the rapids He came upon the second aeroplane in a clear grassy space by the side of the streaming water and it seemed scarcely damaged at all It looked as though it had floated down into a position of rest It lay on its side with one wing in the air There was no aeronaut near it dead or alive There it lay abandoned with the water lapping about its long tail Bert remained a little aloof from it for a long time looking into the gathering shadows among the trees in the expectation of another Chinaman alive or dead Then very cautiously he approached the machine and stood regarding its widespread vans its big steering wheel and empty saddle He did not venture to touch it I wish that other chap wasn t there he said I do wish e wasn t there He saw a few yards away something bobbing about in an eddy that spun within a projecting head of rock As it went round it seemed to draw him unwillingly towards it What could it be Blow said Bert It s another of em It held him He told himself that it was the other aeronaut that had been shot in the fight and fallen out of the saddle as he strove to land He tried to go away and then it occurred to him that he might get a branch or something and push this rotating object out into the stream That would leave him with only one dead body to worry about Perhaps he might get along with one He hesitated and then with a certain emotion forced himself to do this He went towards the bushes and cut himself a wand and returned to the rocks and clambered out to a corner between the eddy and the stream By that time the sunset was over and the bats were abroad and he was wet with perspiration He prodded the floating blue clad thing with his wand failed tried again successfully as it came round and as it went out into the stream it turned over the light gleamed on golden hair and it was Kurt It was Kurt white and dead and very calm There was no mistaking him There was still plenty of light for that The stream took him and he seemed to compose himself in its swift grip as one who stretches himself to rest White faced he was now and all the colour gone out of him A feeling of infinite distress swept over Bert as the body swept out of sight towards the fall Kurt he cried Kurt I didn t mean to Kurt don leave me ere Don leave me Loneliness and desolation overwhelmed him He gave way He stood on the rock in the evening light weeping and wailing passionately like a child It was as though some link that had held him to all these things had broken and gone He was afraid like a child in a lonely room shamelessly afraid The twilight was closing about him The trees were full now of strange shadows All the things about him became strange and unfamiliar with that subtle queerness one feels oftenest in dreams O God I carn stand this he said and crept back from the rocks to the grass and crouched down and suddenly wild sorrow for the death of Kurt Kurt the brave Kurt the kindly came to his help and he broke from whimpering to weeping He ceased to crouch he sprawled upon the grass and clenched an impotent fist This war he cried this blarsted foolery of a war O Kurt Lieutenant Kurt I done he said I done I ve ad all I want and more than I want The world s all rot and there ain t no sense in it The night s coming If E comes after me E can t come after me E can t If E comes after me I ll fro myself into the water Presently he was talking again in a low undertone There ain t nothing to be afraid of reely It s jest imagination Poor old Kurt he thought it would happen Prevision like E never gave me that letter or tole me who the lady was It s like what e said people tore away from everything they belonged to everywhere Exactly like what e said Ere I am cast away thousands of miles from Edna or Grubb or any of my lot like a plant tore up by the roots And every war s been like this only I adn t the sense to understand it Always All sorts of oles and corners chaps ave died in And people adn t the sense to understand adn t the sense to feel it and stop it Thought war was fine My Gawd Dear old Edna She was a fair bit of all right she was That time we ad a boat at Kingston I bet I ll see er again yet Won t be my fault if I don t four Suddenly on the very verge of this heroic resolution Bert became rigid with terror Something was creeping towards him through the grass Something was creeping and halting and creeping again towards him through the dim dark grass The night was electrical with horror For a time everything was still Bert ceased to breathe It could not be No it was too small It advanced suddenly upon him with a rush with a little meawling cry and tail erect It rubbed its head against him and purred It was a tiny skinny little kitten Gaw Pussy ow you frightened me said Bert with drops of perspiration on his brow five He sat with his back to a tree stump all that night holding the kitten in his arms His mind was tired and he talked or thought coherently no longer Towards dawn he dozed When he awoke he was stiff but in better heart and the kitten slept warmly and reassuringly inside his jacket And fear he found had gone from amidst the trees He stroked the kitten and the little creature woke up to excessive fondness and purring You want some milk said Bert That s what you want And I could do with a bit of brekker too He yawned and stood up with the kitten on his shoulder and stared about him recalling the circumstances of the previous day the grey immense happenings Mus do something he said He turned towards the trees and was presently contemplating the dead aeronaut again The kitten he held companionably against his neck The body was horrible but not nearly so horrible as it had been at twilight and now the limbs were limper and the gun had slipped to the ground and lay half hidden in the grass I suppose we ought to bury im Kitty said Bert and looked helplessly at the rocky soil about him We got to stay on the island with im It was some time before he could turn away and go on towards that provision shed Brekker first he said anyhow stroking the kitten on his shoulder She rubbed his cheek affectionately with her furry little face and presently nibbled at his ear Wan some milk eh he said and turned his back on the dead man as though he mattered nothing He was puzzled to find the door of the shed open though he had closed and latched it very carefully overnight and he found also some dirty plates he had not noticed before on the bench He discovered that the hinges of the tin locker were unscrewed and that it could be opened He had not observed this overnight Silly of me said Bert Ere I was puzzlin and whackin away at the padlock never noticing It had been used apparently as an ice chest but it contained nothing now but the remains of half dozen boiled chickens some ambiguous substance that might once have been butter and a singularly unappetising smell He closed the lid again carefully He gave the kitten some milk in a dirty plate and sat watching its busy little tongue for a time Then he was moved to make an inventory of the provisions There were six bottles of milk unopened and one opened sixty bottles of mineral water and a large stock of syrups about two thousand cigarettes and upwards of a hundred cigars nine oranges two unopened tins of corned beef and one opened and five large tins California peaches He jotted it down on a piece of paper Ain t much solid food he said Still A fortnight say Anything might happen in a fortnight He gave the kitten a small second helping and a scrap of beef and then went down with the little creature running after him tail erect and in high spirits to look at the remains of the Hohenzollern It had shifted in the night and seemed on the whole more firmly grounded on Green Island than before From it his eye went to the shattered bridge and then across to the still desolation of Niagara city Nothing moved over there but a number of crows They were busy with the engineer he had seen cut down on the previous day He saw no dogs but he heard one howling We got to get out of this some ow Kitty he said That milk won t last forever not at the rate you lap it He regarded the sluice like flood before him Plenty of water he said Won t be drink we shall want He decided to make a careful exploration of the island Presently he came to a locked gate labelled Biddle Stairs and clambered over to discover a steep old wooden staircase leading down the face of the cliff amidst a vast and increasing uproar of waters He left the kitten above and descended these and discovered with a thrill of hope a path leading among the rocks at the foot of the roaring downrush of the Centre Fall Perhaps this was a sort of way It led him only to the choking and deafening experience of the Cave of the Winds and after he had spent a quarter of an hour in a partially stupefied condition flattened between solid rock and nearly as solid waterfall he decided that this was after all no practicable route to Canada and retraced his steps As he reascended the Biddle Stairs he heard what he decided at last must be a sort of echo a sound of some one walking about on the gravel paths above When he got to the top the place was as solitary as before Thence he made his way with the kitten skirmishing along beside him in the grass to a staircase that led to a lump of projecting rock that enfiladed the huge green majesty of the Horseshoe Fall He stood there for some time in silence You wouldn t think he said at last there was so much water This roarin and splashin it gets on one s nerves at last Sounds like people talking Sounds like people going about Sounds like anything you fancy He retired up the staircase again I s pose I shall keep on goin round this blessed island he said drearily Round and round and round He found himself presently beside the less damaged Asiatic aeroplane again He stared at it and the kitten smelt it Broke he said He looked up with a convulsive start Advancing slowly towards him out from among the trees were two tall gaunt figures They were blackened and tattered and bandaged the hind most one limped and had his head swathed in white but the foremost one still carried himself as a Prince should do for all that his left arm was in a sling and one side of his face scalded a livid crimson He was the Prince Karl Albert the War Lord the German Alexander and the man behind him was the bird faced man whose cabin had once been taken from him and given to Bert six With that apparition began a new phase of Goat Island in Bert s experience He ceased to be a solitary representative of humanity in a vast and violent and incomprehensible universe and became once more a social creature a man in a world of other men For an instant these two were terrible then they seemed sweet and desirable as brothers They too were in this scrape with him marooned and puzzled He wanted extremely to hear exactly what had happened to them What mattered it if one was a Prince and both were foreign soldiers if neither perhaps had adequate English His native Cockney freedom flowed too generously for him to think of that and surely the Asiatic fleets had purged all such trivial differences Ul LO he said ow did you get ere It is the Englishman who brought us the Butteridge machine said the bird faced officer in German and then in a tone of horror as Bert advanced Salute and again louder SALUTE Gaw said Bert and stopped with a second comment under his breath He stared and saluted awkwardly and became at once a masked defensive thing with whom company operation was impossible For a time these two perfected modern aristocrats stood regarding the difficult problem of the Anglo Saxon citizen that ambiguous citizen who obeying some mysterious law in his blood would neither drill nor be a democrat Bert was by no means a beautiful object but in some inexplicable way he looked resistant He wore his cheap suit of serge now showing many signs of wear and its loose fit made him seem sturdier than he was above his disengaging face was a white German cap that was altogether too big for him and his trousers were crumpled up his legs and their ends tucked into the rubber highlows of a deceased German aeronaut He looked an inferior though by no means an easy inferior and instinctively they hated him The Prince pointed to the flying machine and said something in broken English that Bert took for German and failed to understand He intimated as much Dummer Kerl said the bird faced officer from among his bandages The Prince pointed again with his undamaged hand You verstehen dis drachenflieger Bert began to comprehend the situation He regarded the Asiatic machine The habits of Bun Hill returned to him It s a foreign make he said ambiguously The two Germans consulted You are an expert said the Prince We reckon to repair said Bert in the exact manner of Grubb The Prince sought in his vocabulary Is dat he said goot to fly Bert reflected and scratched his cheek slowly I got to look at it he replied It s ad rough usage He made a sound with his teeth he had also acquired from Grubb put his hands in his trouser pockets and strolled back to the machine Typically Grubb chewed something but Bert could chew only imaginatively Three days work in this he said teething For the first time it dawned on him that there were possibilities in this machine It was evident that the wing that lay on the ground was badly damaged The three stays that held it rigid had snapped across a ridge of rock and there was also a strong possibility of the engine being badly damaged The wing hook on that side was also askew but probably that would not affect the flight Beyond that there probably wasn t much the matter Bert scratched his cheek again and contemplated the broad sunlit waste of the Upper Rapids We might make a job of this You leave it to me He surveyed it intently again and the Prince and his officer watched him In Bun Hill Bert and Grubb had developed to a very high pitch among the hiring stock a method of repair by substituting they substituted bits of other machines A machine that was too utterly and obviously done for even to proffer for hire had nevertheless still capital value It became a sort of quarry for nuts and screws and wheels bars and spokes chain links and the like a mine of ill fitting parts to replace the defects of machines still current And back among the trees was a second Asiatic aeroplane The kitten caressed Bert s airship boots unheeded Mend dat drachenflieger said the Prince If I do mend it said Bert struck by a new thought none of us ain t to be trusted to fly it I vill fly it said the Prince Very likely break your neck said Bert after a pause The Prince did not understand him and disregarded what he said He pointed his gloved finger to the machine and turned to the bird faced officer with some remark in German The officer answered and the Prince responded with a sweeping gesture towards the sky Then he spoke it seemed eloquently Bert watched him and guessed his meaning Much more likely to break your neck he said Owever Ere goes He began to pry about the saddle and engine of the drachenflieger in search for tools Also he wanted some black oily stuff for his hands and face For the first rule in the art of repairing as it was known to the firm of Grubb and Smallways was to get your hands and face thoroughly and conclusively blackened Also he took off his jacket and waistcoat and put his cap carefully to the back of his head in order to facilitate scratching The Prince and the officer seemed disposed to watch him but he succeeded in making it clear to them that this would inconvenience him and that he had to puzzle out a bit before he could get to work They thought him over but his shop experience had given him something of the authoritative way of the expert with common men And at last they went away Thereupon he went straight to the second aeroplane got the aeronaut s gun and ammunition and hid them in a clump of nettles close at hand That s all right said Bert and then proceeded to a careful inspection of the debris of the wings in the trees Then he went back to the first aeroplane to compare the two The Bun Hill method was quite possibly practicable if there was nothing hopeless or incomprehensible in the engine The Germans returned presently to find him already generously smutty and touching and testing knobs and screws and levers with an expression of profound sagacity When the bird faced officer addressed a remark to him he waved him aside with Nong comprong Shut it It s no good Then he had an idea Dead chap back there wants burying he said jerking a thumb over his shoulder seven With the appearance of these two men Bert s whole universe had changed again A curtain fell before the immense and terrible desolation that had overwhelmed him He was in a world of three people a minute human world that nevertheless filled his brain with eager speculations and schemes and cunning ideas What were they thinking of What did they think of him What did they mean to do A hundred busy threads interlaced in his mind as he pottered studiously over the Asiatic aeroplane New ideas came up like bubbles in soda water Gaw he said suddenly He had just appreciated as a special aspect of this irrational injustice of fate that these two men were alive and that Kurt was dead All the crew of the Hohenzollern were shot or burnt or smashed or drowned and these two lurking in the padded forward cabin had escaped I suppose e thinks it s is bloomin Star he muttered and found himself uncontrollably exasperated He stood up facing round to the two men They were standing side by side regarding him It s no good he said starin at me You only put me out And then seeing they did not understand he advanced towards them wrench in hand It occurred to him as he did so that the Prince was really a very big and powerful and serene looking person But he said nevertheless pointing through the trees dead man The bird faced man intervened with a reply in German Dead man said Bert to him There He had great difficulty in inducing them to inspect the dead Chinaman and at last led them to him Then they made it evident that they proposed that he as a common person below the rank of officer should have the sole and undivided privilege of disposing of the body by dragging it to the water s edge There was some heated gesticulation and at last the bird faced officer abased himself to help Together they dragged the limp and now swollen Asiatic through the trees and after a rest or so for he trailed very heavily dumped him into the westward rapid Bert returned to his expert investigation of the flying machine at last with aching arms and in a state of gloomy rebellion Brasted cheek he said One d think I was one of is beastly German slaves Prancing beggar And then he fell speculating what would happen when the flying machine was repaired if it could be repaired The two Germans went away again and after some reflection Bert removed several nuts resumed his jacket and vest pocketed those nuts and his tools and hid the set of tools from the second aeroplane in the fork of a tree Right O he said as he jumped down after the last of these precautions The Prince and his companion reappeared as he returned to the machine by the water s edge The Prince surveyed his progress for a time and then went towards the Parting of the Waters and stood with folded arms gazing upstream in profound thought The bird faced officer came up to Bert heavy with a sentence in English Go he said with a helping gesture und eat When Bert got to the refreshment shed he found all the food had vanished except one measured ration of corned beef and three biscuits He regarded this with open eyes and mouth The kitten appeared from under the vendor s seat with an ingratiating purr Of course said Bert Why where s your milk He accumulated wrath for a moment or so then seized the plate in one hand and the biscuits in another and went in search of the Prince breathing vile words anent grub and his intimate interior He approached without saluting Ere he said fiercely Whad the devil s this An entirely unsatisfactory altercation followed Bert expounded the Bun Hill theory of the relations of grub to efficiency in English the bird faced man replied with points about nations and discipline in German The Prince having made an estimate of Bert s quality and physique suddenly hectored He gripped Bert by the shoulder and shook him making his pockets rattle shouted something to him and flung him struggling back He hit him as though he was a German private Bert went back white and scared but resolved by all his Cockney standards upon one thing He was bound in honour to go for the Prince Gaw he gasped buttoning his jacket Now cried the Prince Vil you go and then catching the heroic gleam in Bert s eye drew his sword The bird faced officer intervened saying something in German and pointing skyward Far away in the southwest appeared a Japanese airship coming fast toward them Their conflict ended at that The Prince was first to grasp the situation and lead the retreat All three scuttled like rabbits for the trees and ran to and for cover until they found a hollow in which the grass grew rank There they all squatted within six yards of one another They sat in this place for a long time up to their necks in the grass and watching through the branches for the airship Bert had dropped some of his corned beef but he found the biscuits in his hand and ate them quietly The monster came nearly overhead and then went away to Niagara and dropped beyond the power works When it was near they all kept silence and then presently they fell into an argument that was robbed perhaps of immediate explosive effect only by their failure to understand one another It was Bert began the talking and he talked on regardless of what they understood or failed to understand But his voice must have conveyed his cantankerous intentions You want that machine done he said first you better keep your ands off me They disregarded that and he repeated it Then he expanded his idea and the spirit of speech took hold of him You think you got old of a chap you can kick and it like you do your private soldiers you re jolly well mistaken See I ve ad about enough of you and your antics I been thinking you over you and your war and your Empire and all the rot of it Rot it is It s you Germans made all the trouble in Europe first and last And all for nothin Jest silly prancing Jest because you ve got the uniforms and flags Ere I was I didn t want to ave anything to do with you I jest didn t care a eng at all about you Then you get old of me steal me practically and ere I am thousands of miles away from ome and everything and all your silly fleet smashed up to rags And you want to go on prancin NOW Not if I know it Look at the mischief you done Look at the way you smashed up New York the people you killed the stuff you wasted Can t you learn Dummer Kerl said the bird faced man suddenly in a tone of concentrated malignancy glaring under his bandages Esel That s German for silly ass I know But who s the silly ass im or me When I was a kid I used to read penny dreadfuls about avin adventures and bein a great c mander and all that rot I stowed it But what s e got in is head Rot about Napoleon rot about Alexander rot about is blessed family and im and Gord and David and all that Any one who wasn t a dressed up silly fool of a Prince could ave told all this was goin to appen There was us in Europe all at sixes and sevens with our silly flags and our silly newspapers raggin us up against each other and keepin us apart and there was China solid as a cheese with millions and millions of men only wantin a bit of science and a bit of enterprise to be as good as all of us You thought they couldn t get at you And then they got flying machines And bif ere we are Why when they didn t go on making guns and armies in China we went and poked em up until they did They AD to give us this lickin they ve give us We wouldn t be happy until they did and as I say ere we are The bird faced officer shouted to him to be quiet and then began a conversation with the Prince British citizen said Bert You ain t obliged to listen but I ain t obliged to shut up And for some time he continued his dissertation upon Imperialism militarism and international politics But their talking put him out and for a time he was certainly merely repeating abusive terms prancin nincompoops and the like old terms and new Then suddenly he remembered his essential grievance Owever look ere ere the thing I started this talk about is where s that food there was in that shed That s what I want to know Where you put it He paused They went on talking in German He repeated his question They disregarded him He asked a third time in a manner insupportably aggressive There fell a tense silence For some seconds the three regarded one another The Prince eyed Bert steadfastly and Bert quailed under his eye Slowly the Prince rose to his feet and the bird faced officer jerked up beside him Bert remained squatting Be quaiat said the Prince Bert perceived this was no moment for eloquence The two Germans regarded him as he crouched there Death for a moment seemed near Then the Prince turned away and the two of them went towards the flying machine Gaw whispered Bert and then uttered under his breath one single word of abuse He sat crouched together for perhaps three minutes then he sprang to his feet and went off towards the Chinese aeronaut s gun hidden among the weeds eight There was no pretence after that moment that Bert was under the orders of the Prince or that he was going on with the repairing of the flying machine The two Germans took possession of that and set to work upon it Bert with his new weapon went off to the neighbourhood of Terrapin Rock and there sat down to examine it It was a short rifle with a big cartridge and a nearly full magazine He took out the cartridges carefully and then tried the trigger and fittings until he felt sure he had the use of it He reloaded carefully Then he remembered he was hungry and went off gun under his arm to hunt in and about the refreshment shed He had the sense to perceive that he must not show himself with the gun to the Prince and his companion So long as they thought him unarmed they would leave him alone but there was no knowing what the Napoleonic person might do if he saw Bert s weapon Also he did not go near them because he knew that within himself boiled a reservoir of rage and fear that he wanted to shoot these two men He wanted to shoot them and he thought that to shoot them would be a quite horrible thing to do The two sides of his inconsistent civilisation warred within him Near the shed the kitten turned up again obviously keen for milk This greatly enhanced his own angry sense of hunger He began to talk as he hunted about and presently stood still shouting insults He talked of war and pride and Imperialism Any other Prince but you would have died with his men and his ship he cried The two Germans at the machine heard his voice going ever and again amidst the clamour of the waters Their eyes met and they smiled slightly He was disposed for a time to sit in the refreshment shed waiting for them but then it occurred to him that so he might get them both at close quarters He strolled off presently to the point of Luna Island to think the situation out It had seemed a comparatively simple one at first but as he turned it over in his mind its possibilities increased and multiplied Both these men had swords had either a revolver Also if he shot them both he might never find the food So far he had been going about with this gun under his arm and a sense of lordly security in his mind but what if they saw the gun and decided to ambush him Goat Island is nearly all cover trees rocks thickets and irregularities Why not go and murder them both now I carn t said Bert dismissing that I got to be worked up But it was a mistake to get right away from them That suddenly became clear He ought to keep them under observation ought to scout them Then he would be able to see what they were doing whether either of them had a revolver where they had hidden the food He would be better able to determine what they meant to do to him If he didn t scout them presently they would begin to scout him This seemed so eminently reasonable that he acted upon it forthwith He thought over his costume and threw his collar and the tell tale aeronaut s white cap into the water far below He turned his coat collar up to hide any gleam of his dirty shirt The tools and nuts in his pockets were disposed to clank but he rearranged them and wrapped some letters and his pocket handkerchief about them He started off circumspectly and noiselessly listening and peering at every step As he drew near his antagonists much grunting and creaking served to locate them He discovered them engaged in what looked like a wrestling match with the Asiatic flying machine Their coats were off their swords laid aside they were working magnificently Apparently they were turning it round and were having a good deal of difficulty with the long tail among the trees He dropped flat at the sight of them and wriggled into a little hollow and so lay watching their exertions Ever and again to pass the time he would cover one or other of them with his gun He found them quite interesting to watch so interesting that at times he came near shouting to advise them He perceived that when they had the machine turned round they would then be in immediate want of the nuts and tools he carried Then they would come after him They would certainly conclude he had them or had hidden them Should he hide his gun and do a deal for food with these tools He felt he would not be able to part with the gun again now he had once felt its reassuring company The kitten turned up again and made a great fuss with him and licked and bit his ear The sun clambered to midday and once that morning he saw though the Germans did not an Asiatic airship very far to the south going swiftly eastward At last the flying machine was turned and stood poised on its wheel with its hooks pointing up the Rapids The two officers wiped their faces resumed jackets and swords spoke and bore themselves like men who congratulated themselves on a good laborious morning Then they went off briskly towards the refreshment shed the Prince leading Bert became active in pursuit but he found it impossible to stalk them quickly enough and silently enough to discover the hiding place of the food He found them when he came into sight of them again seated with their backs against the shed plates on knee and a tin of corned beef and a plateful of biscuits between them They seemed in fairly good spirits and once the Prince laughed At this vision of eating Bert s plans gave way Fierce hunger carried him He appeared before them suddenly at a distance of perhaps twenty yards gun in hand Ands up he said in a hard ferocious voice The Prince hesitated and then up went two pairs of hands The gun had surprised them both completely Stand up said Bert Drop that fork They obeyed again What nex said Bert to himself Orf stage I suppose That way he said Go The Prince obeyed with remarkable alacrity When he reached the head of the clearing he said something quickly to the bird faced man and they both with an entire lack of dignity RAN Bert was struck with an exasperating afterthought Gord he cried with infinite vexation Why I ought to ave took their swords Ere But the Germans were already out of sight and no doubt taking cover among the trees Bert fell back upon imprecations then he went up to the shed cursorily examined the possibility of a flank attack put his gun handy and set to work with a convulsive listening pause before each mouthful on the Prince s plate of corned beef He had finished that up and handed its gleanings to the kitten and he was falling to on the second plateful when the plate broke in his hand He stared with the fact slowly creeping upon him that an instant before he had heard a crack among the thickets Then he sprang to his feet snatched up his gun in one hand and the tin of corned beef in the other and fled round the shed to the other side of the clearing As he did so came a second crack from the thickets and something went phwit by his ear He didn t stop running until he was in what seemed to him a strongly defensible position near Luna Island Then he took cover panting and crouched expectant They got a revolver after all he panted Wonder if they got two If they ave Gord I m done Where s the kitten Finishin up that corned beef I suppose Little beggar nine So it was that war began upon Goat Island It lasted a day and a night the longest day and the longest night in Bert s life He had to lie close and listen and watch Also he had to scheme what he should do It was clear now that he had to kill these two men if he could and that if they could they would kill him The prize was first food and then the flying machine and the doubtful privilege of trying to ride it If one failed one would certainly be killed if one succeeded one would get away somewhere over there For a time Bert tried to imagine what it was like over there His mind ran over possibilities deserts angry Americans Japanese Chinese perhaps Red Indians Were there still Red Indians Got to take what comes said Bert No way out of it that I can see Was that voices He realised that his attention was wandering For a time all his senses were very alert The uproar of the Falls was very confusing and it mixed in all sorts of sounds like feet walking like voices talking like shouts and cries Silly great catarac said Bert There ain t no sense in it fallin and fallin Never mind that now What were the Germans doing Would they go back to the flying machine They couldn t do anything with it because he had those nuts and screws and the wrench and other tools But suppose they found the second set of tools he had hidden in a tree He had hidden the things well of course but they MIGHT find them One wasn t sure of course one wasn t sure He tried to remember just exactly how he had hidden those tools He tried to persuade himself they were certainly and surely hidden but his memory began to play antics Had he really left the handle of the wrench sticking out shining out at the fork of the branch Ssh What was that Some one stirring in those bushes Up went an expectant muzzle No Where was the kitten No It was just imagination not even the kitten The Germans would certainly miss and hunt about for the tools and nuts and screws he carried in his pockets that was clear Then they would decide he had them and come for him He had only to remain still under cover therefore and he would get them Was there any flaw in that Would they take off more removable parts of the flying machine and then lie up for him No they wouldn t do that because they were two to one they would have no apprehension of his getting off in the flying machine and no sound reason for supposing he would approach it and so they would do nothing to damage or disable it That he decided was clear But suppose they lay up for him by the food Well that they wouldn t do because they would know he had this corned beef there was enough in this can to last with moderation several days Of course they might try to tire him out instead of attacking him He roused himself with a start He had just grasped the real weakness of his position He might go to sleep It needed but ten minutes under the suggestion of that idea before he realised that he was going to sleep He rubbed his eyes and handled his gun He had never before realised the intensely soporific effect of the American sun of the American air the drowsy sleep compelling uproar of Niagara Hitherto these things had on the whole seemed stimulating If he had not eaten so much and eaten it so fast he would not be so heavy Are vegetarians always bright He roused himself with a jerk again If he didn t do something he would fall asleep and if he fell asleep it was ten to one they would find him snoring and finish him forthwith If he sat motionless and noiseless he would inevitably sleep It was better he told himself to take even the risks of attacking than that This sleep trouble he felt was going to beat him must beat him in the end They were all right one could sleep and the other could watch That come to think of it was what they would always do one would do anything they wanted done the other would lie under cover near at hand ready to shoot They might even trap him like that One might act as a decoy That set him thinking of decoys What a fool he had been to throw his cap away It would have been invaluable on a stick especially at night He found himself wishing for a drink He settled that for a time by putting a pebble in his mouth And then the sleep craving returned It became clear to him he must attack Like many great generals before him he found his baggage that is to say his tin of corned beef a serious impediment to mobility At last he decided to put the beef loose in his pocket and abandon the tin It was not perhaps an ideal arrangement but one must make sacrifices when one is campaigning He crawled perhaps ten yards and then for a time the possibilities of the situation paralysed him The afternoon was still The roar of the cataract simply threw up that immense stillness in relief He was doing his best to contrive the death of two better men than himself Also they were doing their best to contrive his What behind this silence were they doing Suppose he came upon them suddenly and fired and missed ten He crawled and halted listening and crawled again until nightfall and no doubt the German Alexander and his lieutenant did the same A large scale map of Goat Island marked with red and blue lines to show these strategic movements would no doubt have displayed much interlacing but as a matter of fact neither side saw anything of the other throughout that age long day of tedious alertness Bert never knew how near he got to them nor how far he kept from them Night found him no longer sleepy but athirst and near the American Fall He was inspired by the idea that his antagonists might be in the wreckage of the Hohenzollern cabins that was jammed against Green Island He became enterprising broke from any attempt to conceal himself and went across the little bridge at the double He found nobody It was his first visit to these huge fragments of airships and for a time he explored them curiously in the dim light He discovered the forward cabin was nearly intact with its door slanting downward and a corner under water He crept in drank and then was struck by the brilliant idea of shutting the door and sleeping on it But now he could not sleep at all He nodded towards morning and woke up to find it fully day He breakfasted on corned beef and water and sat for a long time appreciative of the security of his position At last he became enterprising and bold He would he decided settle this business forthwith one way or the other He was tired of all this crawling He set out in the morning sunshine gun in hand scarcely troubling to walk softly He went round the refreshment shed without finding any one and then through the trees towards the flying machine He came upon the bird faced man sitting on the ground with his back against a tree bent up over his folded arms sleeping his bandage very much over one eye Bert stopped abruptly and stood perhaps fifteen yards away gun in hand ready Where was the Prince Then sticking out at the side of the tree beyond he saw a shoulder Bert took five deliberate paces to the left The great man became visible leaning up against the trunk pistol in one hand and sword in the other and yawning yawning You can t shoot a yawning man Bert found He advanced upon his antagonist with his gun levelled some foolish fancy of hands up in his mind The Prince became aware of him the yawning mouth shut like a trap and he stood stiffly up Bert stopped silent For a moment the two regarded one another Had the Prince been a wise man he would I suppose have dodged behind the tree Instead he gave vent to a shout and raised pistol and sword At that like an automaton Bert pulled his trigger It was his first experience of an oxygen containing bullet A great flame spurted from the middle of the Prince a blinding flare and there came a thud like the firing of a gun Something hot and wet struck Bert s face Then through a whirl of blinding smoke and steam he saw limbs and a collapsing burst body fling themselves to earth Bert was so astonished that he stood agape and the bird faced officer might have cut him to the earth without a struggle But instead the bird faced officer was running away through the undergrowth dodging as he went Bert roused himself to a brief ineffectual pursuit but he had no stomach for further killing He returned to the mangled scattered thing that had so recently been the great Prince Karl Albert He surveyed the scorched and splashed vegetation about it He made some speculative identifications He advanced gingerly and picked up the hot revolver to find all its chambers strained and burst He became aware of a cheerful and friendly presence He was greatly shocked that one so young should see so frightful a scene Ere Kitty he said this ain t no place for you He made three strides across the devastated area captured the kitten neatly and went his way towards the shed with her purring loudly on his shoulder YOU don t seem to mind he said For a time he fussed about the shed and at last discovered the rest of the provisions hidden in the roof Seems ard he said as he administered a saucerful of milk when you get three men in a ole like this they can t work together But im and is princing was jest a bit too thick Gaw he reflected sitting on the counter and eating what a thing life is Ere am I I seen is picture eard is name since I was a kid in frocks Prince Karl Albert And if any one ad tole me I was going to blow im to smithereens there I shouldn t ave believed it Kitty That chap at Margit ought to ave tole me about it All e tole me was that I got a weak chess That other chap e ain t going to do much Wonder what I ought to do about im He surveyed the trees with a keen blue eye and fingered the gun on his knee I don t like this killing Kitty he said It s like Kurt said about being blooded Seems to me you got to be blooded young If that Prince ad come up to me and said Shake ands I d ave shook ands Now ere s that other chap dodging about E s got is ead urt already and there s something wrong with his leg And burns Golly it isn t three weeks ago I first set eyes on im and then e was smart and set up ands full of air brushes and things and swearin at me A regular gentleman Now e s arfway to a wild man What am I to do with im What the ell am I to do with im I can t leave im ave that flying machine that s a bit too good and if I don t kill im e ll jest ang about this island and starve E s got a sword of course He resumed his philosophising after he had lit a cigarette War s a silly gaim Kitty It s a silly gaim We common people we were fools We thought those big people knew what they were up to and they didn t Look at that chap E ad all Germany be ind im and what as e made of it Smeshin and blunderin and destroyin and there e is Jest a mess of blood and boots and things Jest an orrid splash Prince Karl Albert And all the men e led and the ships e ad the airships and the dragon fliers all scattered like a paper chase between this ole and Germany And fightin going on and burnin and killin that e started war without end all over the world I suppose I shall ave to kill that other chap I suppose I must But it ain t at all the sort of job I fancy Kitty For a time he hunted about the island amidst the uproar of the waterfall looking for the wounded officer and at last he started him out of some bushes near the head of Biddle Stairs But as he saw the bent and bandaged figure in limping flight before him he found his Cockney softness too much for him again he could neither shoot nor pursue I carn t he said that s flat I aven t the guts for it E ll ave to go He turned his steps towards the flying machine He never saw the bird faced officer again nor any further evidence of his presence Towards evening he grew fearful of ambushes and hunted vigorously for an hour or so but in vain He slept in a good defensible position at the extremity of the rocky point that runs out to the Canadian Fall and in the night he woke in panic terror and fired his gun But it was nothing He slept no more that night In the morning he became curiously concerned for the vanished man and hunted for him as one might for an erring brother If I knew some German he said I d oller It s jest not knowing German does it You can t explain He discovered later traces of an attempt to cross the gap in the broken bridge A rope with a bolt attached had been flung across and had caught in a fenestration of a projecting fragment of railing The end of the rope trailed in the seething water towards the fall But the bird faced officer was already rubbing shoulders with certain inert matter that had once been Lieutenant Kurt and the Chinese aeronaut and a dead cow and much other uncongenial company in the huge circle of the Whirlpool two and a quarter miles away Never had that great gathering place that incessant aimless unprogressive hurry of waste and battered things been so crowded with strange and melancholy derelicts Round they went and round and every day brought its new contributions luckless brutes shattered fragments of boat and flying machine endless citizens from the cities upon the shores of the great lakes above Much came from Cleveland It all gathered here and whirled about indefinitely and over it all gathered daily a greater abundance of birds CHAPTER X THE WORLD UNDER THE WAR one Bert spent two more days upon Goat Island and finished all his provisions except the cigarettes and mineral water before he brought himself to try the Asiatic flying machine Even at last he did not so much go off upon it as get carried off It had taken only an hour or so to substitute wing stays from the second flying machine and to replace the nuts he had himself removed The engine was in working order and differed only very simply and obviously from that of a contemporary motor bicycle The rest of the time was taken up by a vast musing and delaying and hesitation Chiefly he saw himself splashing into the rapids and whirling down them to the Fall clutching and drowning but also he had a vision of being hopelessly in the air going fast and unable to ground His mind was too concentrated upon the business of flying for him to think very much of what might happen to an indefinite spirited Cockney without credential who arrived on an Asiatic flying machine amidst the war infuriated population beyond He still had a lingering solicitude for the bird faced officer He had a haunting fancy he might be lying disabled or badly smashed in some way in some nook or cranny of the Island and it was only after a most exhaustive search that he abandoned that distressing idea If I found im he reasoned the while what could I do wiv im You can t blow a chap s brains out when e s down And I don see ow else I can elp im Then the kitten bothered his highly developed sense of social responsibility If I leave er she ll starve Ought to catch mice for erself ARE there mice Birds She s too young She s like me she s a bit too civilised Finally he stuck her in his side pocket and she became greatly interested in the memories of corned beef she found there With her in his pocket he seated himself in the saddle of the flying machine Big clumsy thing it was and not a bit like a bicycle Still the working of it was fairly plain You set the engine going SO kicked yourself up until the wheel was vertical SO engaged the gyroscope SO and then then you just pulled up this lever Rather stiff it was but suddenly it came over The big curved wings on either side flapped disconcertingly flapped again click clock click clock clitter clock Stop The thing was heading for the water its wheel was in the water Bert groaned from his heart and struggled to restore the lever to its first position Click clock clitter clock he was rising The machine was lifting its dripping wheel out of the eddies and he was going up There was no stopping now no good in stopping now In another moment Bert clutching and convulsive and rigid with staring eyes and a face pale as death was flapping up above the Rapids jerking to every jerk of the wings and rising rising There was no comparison in dignity and comfort between a flying machine and a balloon Except in its moments of descent the balloon was a vehicle of faultless urbanity this was a buck jumping mule a mule that jumped up and never came down again Click clock click clock with each beat of the strangely shaped wings it jumped Bert upward and caught him neatly again half a second later on the saddle And while in ballooning there is no wind since the balloon is a part of the wind flying is a wild perpetual creation of and plunging into wind It was a wind that above all things sought to blind him to force him to close his eyes It occurred to him presently to twist his knees and legs inward and grip with them or surely he would have been bumped into two clumsy halves And he was going up a hundred yards high two hundred three hundred over the streaming frothing wilderness of water below up up up That was all right but how presently would one go horizontally He tried to think if these things did go horizontally No They flapped up and then they soared down For a time he would keep on flapping up Tears streamed from his eyes He wiped them with one temerariously disengaged hand Was it better to risk a fall over land or over water such water He was flapping up above the Upper Rapids towards Buffalo It was at any rate a comfort that the Falls and the wild swirl of waters below them were behind him He was flying up straight That he could see How did one turn He was presently almost cool and his eyes got more used to the rush of air but he was getting very high very high He tilted his head forwards and surveyed the country blinking He could see all over Buffalo a place with three great blackened scars of ruin and hills and stretches beyond He wondered if he was half a mile high or more There were some people among some houses near a railway station between Niagara and Buffalo and then more people They went like ants busily in and out of the houses He saw two motor cars gliding along the road towards Niagara city Then far away in the south he saw a great Asiatic airship going eastward Oh Gord he said and became earnest in his ineffectual attempts to alter his direction But that airship took no notice of him and he continued to ascend convulsively The world got more and more extensive and maplike Click clock clitter clock Above him and very near to him now was a hazy stratum of cloud He determined to disengage the wing clutch He did so The lever resisted his strength for a time then over it came and instantly the tail of the machine cocked up and the wings became rigidly spread Instantly everything was swift and smooth and silent He was gliding rapidly down the air against a wild gale of wind his eyes three quarters shut A little lever that had hitherto been obdurate now confessed itself mobile He turned it over gently to the right and whiroo the left wing had in some mysterious way given at its edge and he was sweeping round and downward in an immense right handed spiral For some moments he experienced all the helpless sensations of catastrophe He restored the lever to its middle position with some difficulty and the wings were equalised again He turned it to the left and had a sensation of being spun round backwards Too much he gasped He discovered that he was rushing down at a headlong pace towards a railway line and some factory buildings They appeared to be tearing up to him to devour him He must have dropped all that height For a moment he had the ineffectual sensations of one whose bicycle bolts downhill The ground had almost taken him by surprise Ere he cried and then with a violent effort of all his being he got the beating engine at work again and set the wings flapping He swooped down and up and resumed his quivering and pulsating ascent of the air He went high again until he had a wide view of the pleasant upland country of western New York State and then made a long coast down and so up again and then a coast Then as he came swooping a quarter of a mile above a village he saw people running about running away evidently in relation to his hawk like passage He got an idea that he had been shot at Up he said and attacked that lever again It came over with remarkable docility and suddenly the wings seemed to give way in the middle But the engine was still It had stopped He flung the lever back rather by instinct than design What to do Much happened in a few seconds but also his mind was quick he thought very quickly He couldn t get up again he was gliding down the air he would have to hit something He was travelling at the rate of perhaps thirty miles an hour down down That plantation of larches looked the softest thing mossy almost Could he get it He gave himself to the steering Round to the right left Swirroo Crackle He was gliding over the tops of the trees ploughing through them tumbling into a cloud of green sharp leaves and black twigs There was a sudden snapping and he fell off the saddle forward a thud and a crashing of branches Some twigs hit him smartly in the face He was between a tree stem and the saddle with his leg over the steering lever and so far as he could realise not hurt He tried to alter his position and free his leg and found himself slipping and dropping through branches with everything giving way beneath him He clutched and found himself in the lower branches of a tree beneath the flying machine The air was full of a pleasant resinous smell He stared for a moment motionless and then very carefully clambered down branch by branch to the soft needle covered ground below Good business he said looking up at the bent and tilted kite wings above I dropped soft He rubbed his chin with his hand and meditated Blowed if I don t think I m a rather lucky fellow he said surveying the pleasant sun bespattered ground under the trees Then he became aware of a violent tumult at his side Lord he said You must be arf smothered and extracted the kitten from his pocket handkerchief and pocket She was twisted and crumpled and extremely glad to see the light again Her little tongue peeped between her teeth He put her down and she ran a dozen paces and shook herself and stretched and sat up and began to wash Nex he said looking about him and then with a gesture of vexation Desh it I ought to ave brought that gun He had rested it against a tree when he had seated himself in the flying machine saddle He was puzzled for a time by the immense peacefulness in the quality of the world and then he perceived that the roar of the cataract was no longer in his ears two He had no very clear idea of what sort of people he might come upon in this country It was he knew America Americans he had always understood were the citizens of a great and powerful nation dry and humorous in their manner addicted to the use of the bowie knife and revolver and in the habit of talking through the nose like Norfolkshire and saying allow and reckon and calculate after the manner of the people who live on the New Forest side of Hampshire Also they were very rich had rocking chairs and put their feet at unusual altitudes and they chewed tobacco gum and other substances with untiring industry Commingled with them were cowboys Red Indians and comic respectful niggers This he had learnt from the fiction in his public library Beyond that he had learnt very little He was not surprised therefore when he met armed men He decided to abandon the shattered flying machine He wandered through the trees for some time and then struck a road that seemed to his urban English eyes to be remarkably wide but not properly made Neither hedge nor ditch nor curbed distinctive footpath separated it from the woods and it went in that long easy curve which distinguishes the tracks of an open continent Ahead he saw a man carrying a gun under his arm a man in a soft black hat a blue blouse and black trousers and with a broad round fat face quite innocent of goatee This person regarded him askance and heard him speak with a start Can you tell me whereabouts I am at all asked Bert The man regarded him and more particularly his rubber boots with sinister suspicion Then he replied in a strange outlandish tongue that was as a matter of fact Czech He ended suddenly at the sight of Bert s blank face with Don t spik English Oh said Bert He reflected gravely for a moment and then went his way Thenks he said as an afterthought The man regarded his back for a moment was struck with an idea began an abortive gesture sighed gave it up and went on also with a depressed countenance Presently Bert came to a big wooden house standing casually among the trees It looked a bleak bare box of a house to him no creeper grew on it no hedge nor wall nor fence parted it off from the woods about it He stopped before the steps that led up to the door perhaps thirty yards away The place seemed deserted He would have gone up to the door and rapped but suddenly a big black dog appeared at the side and regarded him It was a huge heavy jawed dog of some unfamiliar breed and it wore a spike studded collar It did not bark nor approach him it just bristled quietly and emitted a single sound like a short deep cough Bert hesitated and went on He stopped thirty paces away and stood peering about him among the trees If I aven t been and lef that kitten he said Acute sorrow wrenched him for a time The black dog came through the trees to get a better look at him and coughed that well bred cough again Bert resumed the road She ll do all right he said She ll catch things She ll do all right he said presently without conviction But if it had not been for the black dog he would have gone back When he was out of sight of the house and the black dog he went into the woods on the other side of the way and emerged after an interval trimming a very tolerable cudgel with his pocket knife Presently he saw an attractive looking rock by the track and picked it up and put it in his pocket Then he came to three or four houses wooden like the last each with an ill painted white verandah that was his name for it and all standing in the same casual way upon the ground Behind through the woods he saw pig stys and a rooting black sow leading a brisk adventurous family A wild looking woman with sloe black eyes and dishevelled black hair sat upon the steps of one of the houses nursing a baby but at the sight of Bert she got up and went inside and he heard her bolting the door Then a boy appeared among the pig stys but he would not understand Bert s hail I suppose it is America said Bert The houses became more frequent down the road and he passed two other extremely wild and dirty looking men without addressing them One carried a gun and the other a hatchet and they scrutinised him and his cudgel scornfully Then he struck a cross road with a mono rail at its side and there was a notice board at the corner with Wait here for the cars That s all right any ow said Bert Wonder ow long I should ave to wait It occurred to him that in the present disturbed state of the country the service might be interrupted and as there seemed more houses to the right than the left he turned to the right He passed an old negro Ullo said Bert Goo morning Good day sah said the old negro in a voice of almost incredible richness What s the name of this place asked Bert Tanooda sah said the negro Thenks said Bert Thank YOU sah said the negro overwhelmingly Bert came to houses of the same detached unwalled wooden type but adorned now with enamelled advertisements partly in English and partly in Esperanto Then he came to what he concluded was a grocer s shop It was the first house that professed the hospitality of an open door and from within came a strangely familiar sound Gaw he said searching in his pockets Why I aven t wanted money for free weeks I wonder if I Grubb ad most of it Ah He produced a handful of coins and regarded it three pennies sixpence and a shilling That s all right he said forgetting a very obvious consideration He approached the door and as he did so a compactly built grey faced man in shirt sleeves appeared in it and scrutinised him and his cudgel Mornin said Bert Can I get anything to eat r drink in this shop The man in the door replied thank Heaven in clear good American This sir is not A shop it is A store Oh said Bert and then Well can I get anything to eat You can said the American in a tone of confident encouragement and led the way inside The shop seemed to him by his Bun Hill standards extremely roomy well lit and unencumbered There was a long counter to the left of him with drawers and miscellaneous commodities ranged behind it a number of chairs several tables and two spittoons to the right various barrels cheeses and bacon up the vista and beyond a large archway leading to more space A little group of men was assembled round one of the tables and a woman of perhaps five and thirty leant with her elbows on the counter All the men were armed with rifles and the barrel of a gun peeped above the counter They were all listening idly inattentively to a cheap metallic toned gramophone that occupied a table near at hand From its brazen throat came words that gave Bert a qualm of homesickness that brought back in his memory a sunlit beach a group of children red painted bicycles Grubb and an approaching balloon Ting a ling a ting a ling a ting a ling a tang What Price Hair pins Now A heavy necked man in a straw hat who was chewing something stopped the machine with a touch and they all turned their eyes on Bert And all their eyes were tired eyes Can we give this gentleman anything to eat mother or can we not said the proprietor He kin have what he likes said the woman at the counter without moving right up from a cracker to a square meal She struggled with a yawn after the manner of one who has been up all night I want a meal said Bert but I aven t very much money I don want to give mor n a shillin Mor n a WHAT said the proprietor sharply Mor n a shillin said Bert with a sudden disagreeable realisation coming into his mind Yes said the proprietor startled for a moment from his courtly bearing But what in hell is a shilling He means a quarter said a wise looking lank young man in riding gaiters Bert trying to conceal his consternation produced a coin That s a shilling he said He calls A store A shop said the proprietor and he wants A meal for A shilling May I ask you sir what part of America you hail from Bert replaced the shilling in his pocket as he spoke Niagara he said And when did you leave Niagara Bout an hour ago Well said the proprietor and turned with a puzzled smile to the others Well They asked various questions simultaneously Bert selected one or two for reply You see he said I been with the German air fleet I got caught up by them sort of by accident and brought over here From England Yes from England Way of Germany I was in a great battle with them Asiatics and I got lef on a little island between the Falls Goat Island I don know what it was called But any ow I found a flying machine and made a sort of fly with it and got here Two men stood up with incredulous eyes on him Where s the flying machine they asked outside It s back in the woods here bout arf a mile away Is it good said a thick lipped man with a scar I come down rather a smash Everybody got up and stood about him and talked confusingly They wanted him to take them to the flying machine at once Look ere said Bert I ll show you only I aven t ad anything to eat since yestiday except mineral water A gaunt soldierly looking young man with long lean legs in riding gaiters and a bandolier who had hitherto not spoken intervened now on his behalf in a note of confident authority That s aw right he said Give him a feed mister Logan from me I want to hear more of that story of his We ll see his machine afterwards If you ask me I should say it s a remarkably interesting accident had dropped this gentleman here I guess we requisition that flying machine if we find it for local defence three So Bert fell on his feet again and sat eating cold meat and good bread and mustard and drinking very good beer and telling in the roughest outline and with the omissions and inaccuracies of statement natural to his type of mind the simple story of his adventures He told how he and a gentleman friend had been visiting the seaside for their health how a chep came along in a balloon and fell out as he fell in how he had drifted to Franconia how the Germans had seemed to mistake him for some one and had took him prisoner and brought him to New York how he had been to Labrador and back how he had got to Goat Island and found himself there alone He omitted the matter of the Prince and the Butteridge aspect of the affair not out of any deep deceitfulness but because he felt the inadequacy of his narrative powers He wanted everything to seem easy and natural and correct to present himself as a trustworthy and understandable Englishman in a sound mediocre position to whom refreshment and accommodation might be given with freedom and confidence When his fragmentary story came to New York and the battle of Niagara they suddenly produced newspapers which had been lying about on the table and began to check him and question him by these vehement accounts It became evident to him that his descent had revived and roused to flames again a discussion a topic that had been burning continuously that had smouldered only through sheer exhaustion of material during the temporary diversion of the gramophone a discussion that had drawn these men together rifle in hand the one supreme topic of the whole world the War and the methods of the War He found any question of his personality and his personal adventures falling into the background found himself taken for granted and no more than a source of information The ordinary affairs of life the buying and selling of everyday necessities the cultivation of the ground the tending of beasts was going on as it were by force of routine as the common duties of life go on in a house whose master lies under the knife of some supreme operation The overruling interest was furnished by those great Asiatic airships that went upon incalculable missions across the sky the crimson clad swordsmen who might come fluttering down demanding petrol or food or news These men were asking all the continent was asking What are we to do What can we try How can we get at them Bert fell into his place as an item ceased even in his own thoughts to be a central and independent thing After he had eaten and drunken his fill and sighed and stretched and told them how good the food seemed to him he lit a cigarette they gave him and led the way with some doubts and trouble to the flying machine amidst the larches It became manifest that the gaunt young man whose name it seemed was Laurier was a leader both by position and natural aptitude He knew the names and characters and capabilities of all the men who were with him and he set them to work at once with vigour and effect to secure this precious instrument of war They got the thing down to the ground deliberately and carefully felling a couple of trees in the process and they built a wide flat roof of timbers and tree boughs to guard their precious find against its chance discovery by any passing Asiatics Long before evening they had an engineer from the next township at work upon it and they were casting lots among the seventeen picked men who wanted to take it for its first flight And Bert found his kitten and carried it back to Logan s store and handed it with earnest admonition to missus Logan And it was reassuringly clear to him that in missus Logan both he and the kitten had found a congenial soul Laurier was not only a masterful person and a wealthy property owner and employer he was president Bert learnt with awe of the Tanooda Canning Corporation but he was popular and skilful in the arts of popularity In the evening quite a crowd of men gathered in the store and talked of the flying machine and of the war that was tearing the world to pieces And presently came a man on a bicycle with an ill printed newspaper of a single sheet which acted like fuel in a blazing furnace of talk It was nearly all American news the old fashioned cables had fallen into disuse for some years and the Marconi stations across the ocean and along the Atlantic coastline seemed to have furnished particularly tempting points of attack But such news it was Bert sat in the background for by this time they had gauged his personal quality pretty completely listening Before his staggering mind passed strange vast images as they talked of great issues at a crisis of nations in tumultuous march of continents overthrown of famine and destruction beyond measure Ever and again in spite of his efforts to suppress them certain personal impressions would scamper across the weltering confusion the horrible mess of the exploded Prince the Chinese aeronaut upside down the limping and bandaged bird faced officer blundering along in miserable and hopeless flight They spoke of fire and massacre of cruelties and counter cruelties of things that had been done to harmless Asiatics by race mad men of the wholesale burning and smashing up of towns railway junctions bridges of whole populations in hiding and exodus Every ship they ve got is in the Pacific he heard one man exclaim Since the fighting began they can t have landed on the Pacific slope less than a million men They ve come to stay in these States and they will living or dead Slowly broadly invincibly there grew upon Bert s mind realisation of the immense tragedy of humanity into which his life was flowing the appalling and universal nature of the epoch that had arrived the conception of an end to security and order and habit The whole world was at war and it could not get back to peace it might never recover peace He had thought the things he had seen had been exceptional conclusive things that the besieging of New York and the battle of the Atlantic were epoch making events between long years of security And they had been but the first warning impacts of universal cataclysm Each day destruction and hate and disaster grew the fissures widened between man and man new regions of the fabric of civilisation crumbled and gave way Below the armies grew and the people perished above the airships and aeroplanes fought and fled raining destruction It is difficult perhaps for the broad minded and long perspectived reader to understand how incredible the breaking down of the scientific civilisation seemed to those who actually lived at this time who in their own persons went down in that debacle Progress had marched as it seemed invincible about the earth never now to rest again For three hundred years and more the long steadily accelerated diastole of Europeanised civilisation had been in progress towns had been multiplying populations increasing values rising new countries developing thought literature knowledge unfolding and spreading It seemed but a part of the process that every year the instruments of war were vaster and more powerful and that armies and explosives outgrew all other growing things Three hundred years of diastole and then came the swift and unexpected systole like the closing of a fist They could not understand it was systole They could not think of it as anything but a jolt a hitch a mere oscillatory indication of the swiftness of their progress Collapse though it happened all about them remained incredible Presently some falling mass smote them down or the ground opened beneath their feet They died incredulous These men in the store made a minute remote group under this immense canopy of disaster They turned from one little aspect to another What chiefly concerned them was defence against Asiatic raiders swooping for petrol or to destroy weapons or communications Everywhere levies were being formed at that time to defend the plant of the railroads day and night in the hope that communication would speedily be restored The land war was still far away A man with a flat voice distinguished himself by a display of knowledge and cunning He told them all with confidence just what had been wrong with the German drachenflieger and the American aeroplanes just what advantage the Japanese flyers possessed He launched out into a romantic description of the Butteridge machine and riveted Bert s attention I SEE that said Bert and was smitten silent by a thought The man with the flat voice talked on without heeding him of the strange irony of Butteridge s death At that Bert had a little twinge of relief he would never meet Butteridge again It appeared Butteridge had died suddenly very suddenly And his secret sir perished with him When they came to look for the parts none could find them He had hidden them all too well But couldn t he tell asked the man in the straw hat Did he die so suddenly as that Struck down sir Rage and apoplexy At a place called Dymchurch in England That s right said Laurier I remember a page about it in the Sunday American At the time they said it was a German spy had stolen his balloon Well sir said the flat voiced man that fit of apoplexy at Dyrnchurch was the worst thing absolutely the worst thing that ever happened to the world For if it had not been for the death of mister Butteridge No one knows his secret Not a soul It s gone His balloon it appears was lost at sea with all the plans Down it went and they went with it Pause With machines such as he made we could fight these Asiatic fliers on more than equal terms We could outfly and beat down those scarlet humming birds wherever they appeared But it s gone it s gone and there s no time to reinvent it now We got to fight with what we got and the odds are against us THAT won t stop us fightin No but just think of it Bert was trembling violently He cleared his throat hoarsely I say he said look here I Nobody regarded him The man with the flat voice was opening a new branch of the subject I allow he began Bert became violently excited He stood up He made clawing motions with his hands I say he exclaimed mister Laurier Look ere I want about that Butteridge machine mister Laurier sitting on an adjacent table with a magnificent gesture arrested the discourse of the flat voiced man What s HE saying said he Then the whole company realised that something was happening to Bert either he was suffocating or going mad He was spluttering Look ere I say Old on a bit and trembling and eagerly unbuttoning himself He tore open his collar and opened vest and shirt He plunged into his interior and for an instant it seemed he was plucking forth his liver Then as he struggled with buttons on his shoulder they perceived this flattened horror was in fact a terribly dirty flannel chest protector In an other moment Bert in a state of irregular decolletage was standing over the table displaying a sheaf of papers These he gasped These are the plans You know mister Butteridge his machine What died I was the chap that went off in that balloon For some seconds every one was silent They stared from these papers to Bert s white face and blazing eyes and back to the papers on the table Nobody moved Then the man with the flat voice spoke Irony he said with a note of satisfaction Real rightdown Irony When it s too late to think of making em any more four They would all no doubt have been eager to hear Bert s story over again but it was it this point that Laurier showed his quality No SIR he said and slid from off his table He impounded the dispersing Butteridge plans with one comprehensive sweep of his arm rescuing them even from the expository finger marks of the man with the flat voice and handed them to Bert Put those back he said where you had em We have a journey before us Bert took them Whar said the man in the straw hat Why sir we are going to find the President of these States and give these plans over to him I decline to believe sir we are too late Where is the President asked Bert weakly in that pause that followed Logan said Laurier disregarding that feeble inquiry you must help us in this It seemed only a matter of a few minutes before Bert and Laurier and the storekeeper were examining a number of bicycles that were stowed in the hinder room of the store Bert didn t like any of them very much They had wood rims and an experience of wood rims in the English climate had taught him to hate them That however and one or two other objections to an immediate start were overruled by Laurier But where IS the President Bert repeated as they stood behind Logan while he pumped up a deflated tyre Laurier looked down on him He is reported in the neighbourhood of Albany out towards the Berkshire Hills He is moving from place to place and as far as he can organising the defence by telegraph and telephones The Asiatic air fleet is trying to locate him When they think they have located the seat of government they throw bombs This inconveniences him but so far they have not come within ten miles of him The Asiatic air fleet is at present scattered all over the Eastern States seeking out and destroying gas works and whatever seems conducive to the building of airships or the transport of troops Our retaliatory measures are slight in the extreme But with these machines Sir this ride of ours will count among the historical rides of the world He came near to striking an attitude We shan t get to him to night asked Bert No sir said Laurier We shall have to ride some days sure And suppose we can t get a lift on a train or anything No sir There s been no transit by Tanooda for three days It is no good waiting We shall have to get on as well as we can Startin now Starting now But ow about We shan t be able to do much to night May as well ride till we re fagged and sleep then So much clear gain Our road is eastward Of course began Bert with memories of the dawn upon Goat Island and left his sentence unfinished He gave his attention to the more scientific packing of the chest protector for several of the plans flapped beyond his vest five For a week Bert led a life of mixed sensations Amidst these fatigue in the legs predominated Mostly he rode rode with Laurier s back inexorably ahead through a land like a larger England with bigger hills and wider valleys larger fields wider roads fewer hedges and wooden houses with commodious piazzas He rode Laurier made inquiries Laurier chose the turnings Laurier doubted Laurier decided Now it seemed they were in telephonic touch with the President now something had happened and he was lost again But always they had to go on and always Bert rode A tyre was deflated Still he rode He grew saddle sore Laurier declared that unimportant Asiatic flying ships passed overhead the two cyclists made a dash for cover until the sky was clear Once a red Asiatic flying machine came fluttering after them so low they could distinguish the aeronaut s head He followed them for a mile Now they came to regions of panic now to regions of destruction here people were fighting for food here they seemed hardly stirred from the countryside routine They spent a day in a deserted and damaged Albany The Asiatics had descended and cut every wire and made a cinder heap of the Junction and our travellers pushed on eastward They passed a hundred half heeded incidents and always Bert was toiling after Laurier s indefatigable back Things struck upon Bert s attention and perplexed him and then he passed on with unanswered questionings fading from his mind He saw a large house on fire on a hillside to the right and no man heeding it They came to a narrow railroad bridge and presently to a mono rail train standing in the track on its safety feet It was a remarkably sumptuous train the Last Word Trans Continental Express and the passengers were all playing cards or sleeping or preparing a picnic meal on a grassy slope near at hand They had been there six days At one point ten dark complexioned men were hanging in a string from the trees along the roadside Bert wondered why At one peaceful looking village where they stopped off to get Bert s tyre mended and found beer and biscuits they were approached by an extremely dirty little boy without boots who spoke as follows Deyse been hanging a Chink in dose woods Hanging a Chinaman said Laurier Sure Der sleuths got him rubberin der rail road sheds Oh Dose guys done wase cartridges Deyse hung him and dey pulled his legs Deyse doin all der Chinks dey can fine dat weh Dey ain t takin no risks All der Chinks dey can fine Neither Bert nor Laurier made any reply and presently after a little skilful expectoration the young gentleman was attracted by the appearance of two of his friends down the road and shuffled off whooping weirdly That afternoon they almost ran over a man shot through the body and partly decomposed lying near the middle of the road just outside Albany He must have been lying there for some days Beyond Albany they came upon a motor car with a tyre burst and a young woman sitting absolutely passive beside the driver s seat An old man was under the car trying to effect some impossible repairs Beyond sitting with a rifle across his knees with his back to the car and staring into the woods was a young man The old man crawled out at their approach and still on all fours accosted Bert and Laurier The car had broken down overnight The old man said he could not understand what was wrong but he was trying to puzzle it out Neither he nor his son in law had any mechanical aptitude They had been assured this was a fool proof car It was dangerous to have to stop in this place The party had been attacked by tramps and had had to fight It was known they had provisions He mentioned a great name in the world of finance Would Laurier and Bert stop and help him He proposed it first hopefully then urgently at last in tears and terror No said Laurier inexorable We must go on We have something more than a woman to save We have to save America The girl never stirred And once they passed a madman singing And at last they found the President hiding in a small saloon upon the outskirts of a place called Pinkerville on the Hudson and gave the plans of the Butteridge machine into his hands CHAPTER XI THE GREAT COLLAPSE one And now the whole fabric of civilisation was bending and giving and dropping to pieces and melting in the furnace of the war The stages of the swift and universal collapse of the financial and scientific civilisation with which the twentieth century opened followed each other very swiftly so swiftly that upon the foreshortened page of history they seem altogether to overlap To begin with one sees the world nearly at a maximum wealth and prosperity To its inhabitants indeed it seemed also at a maximum of security When now in retrospect the thoughtful observer surveys the intellectual history of this time when one reads its surviving fragments of literature its scraps of political oratory the few small voices that chance has selected out of a thousand million utterances to speak to later days the most striking thing of all this web of wisdom and error is surely that hallucination of security To men living in our present world state orderly scientific and secured nothing seems so precarious so giddily dangerous as the fabric of the social order with which the men of the opening of the twentieth century were content To us it seems that every institution and relationship was the fruit of haphazard and tradition and the manifest sport of chance their laws each made for some separate occasion and having no relation to any future needs their customs illogical their education aimless and wasteful Their method of economic exploitation indeed impresses a trained and informed mind as the most frantic and destructive scramble it is possible to conceive their credit and monetary system resting on an unsubstantial tradition of the worthiness of gold seems a thing almost fantastically unstable And they lived in planless cities for the most part dangerously congested their rails and roads and population were distributed over the earth in the wanton confusion ten thousand irrevelant considerations had made Yet they thought confidently that this was a secure and permanent progressive system and on the strength of some three hundred years of change and irregular improvement answered the doubter with Things always have gone well We ll worry through But when we contrast the state of man in the opening of the twentieth century with the condition of any previous period in his history then perhaps we may begin to understand something of that blind confidence It was not so much a reasoned confidence as the inevitable consequence of sustained good fortune By such standards as they possessed things HAD gone amazingly well for them It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that for the first time in history whole populations found themselves regularly supplied with more than enough to eat and the vital statistics of the time witness to an amelioration of hygienic conditions rapid beyond all precedent and to a vast development of intelligence and ability in all the arts that make life wholesome The level and quality of the average education had risen tremendously and at the dawn of the twentieth century comparatively few people in Western Europe or America were unable to read or write Never before had there been such reading masses There was wide social security A common man might travel safely over three quarters of the habitable globe could go round the earth at a cost of less than the annual earnings of a skilled artisan Compared with the liberality and comfort of the ordinary life of the time the order of the Roman Empire under the Antonines was local and limited And every year every month came some new increment to human achievement a new country opened up new mines new scientific discoveries a new machine For those three hundred years indeed the movement of the world seemed wholly beneficial to mankind Men said indeed that moral organisation was not keeping pace with physical progress but few attached any meaning to these phrases the understanding of which lies at the basis of our present safety Sustaining and constructive forces did indeed for a time more than balance the malign drift of chance and the natural ignorance prejudice blind passion and wasteful self seeking of mankind The accidental balance on the side of Progress was far slighter and infinitely more complex and delicate in its adjustments than the people of that time suspected but that did not alter the fact that it was an effective balance They did not realise that this age of relative good fortune was an age of immense but temporary opportunity for their kind They complacently assumed a necessary progress towards which they had no moral responsibility They did not realise that this security of progress was a thing still to be won or lost and that the time to win it was a time that passed They went about their affairs energetically enough and yet with a curious idleness towards those threatening things No one troubled over the real dangers of mankind They saw their armies and navies grow larger and more portentous some of their ironclads at the last cost as much as the whole annual expenditure upon advanced education they accumulated explosives and the machinery of destruction they allowed their national traditions and jealousies to accumulate they contemplated a steady enhancement of race hostility as the races drew closer without concern or understanding and they permitted the growth in their midst of an evil spirited press mercenary and unscrupulous incapable of good and powerful for evil The State had practically no control over the press at all Quite heedlessly they allowed this torch paper to lie at the door of their war magazine for any spark to fire The precedents of history were all one tale of the collapse of civilisations the dangers of the time were manifest One is incredulous now to believe they could not see Could mankind have prevented this disaster of the War in the Air An idle question that as idle as to ask could mankind have prevented the decay that turned Assyria and Babylon to empty deserts or the slow decline and fall the gradual social disorganisation phase by phase that closed the chapter of the Empire of the West They could not because they did not they had not the will to arrest it What mankind could achieve with a different will is a speculation as idle as it is magnificent And this was no slow decadence that came to the Europeanised world those other civilisations rotted and crumbled down the Europeanised civilisation was as it were blown up Within the space of five years it was altogether disintegrated and destroyed Up to the very eve of the War in the Air one sees a spacious spectacle of incessant advance a world wide security enormous areas with highly organised industry and settled populations gigantic cities spreading gigantically the seas and oceans dotted with shipping the land netted with rails and open ways Then suddenly the German air fleets sweep across the scene and we are in the beginning of the end two This story has already told of the swift rush upon New York of the first German air fleet and of the wild inevitable orgy of inconclusive destruction that ensued Behind it a second air fleet was already swelling at its gasometers when England and France and Spain and Italy showed their hands None of these countries had prepared for aeronautic warfare on the magnificent scale of the Germans but each guarded secrets each in a measure was making ready and a common dread of German vigour and that aggressive spirit Prince Karl Albert embodied had long been drawing these powers together in secret anticipation of some such attack This rendered their prompt company operation possible and they certainly company operated promptly The second aerial power in Europe at this time was France the British nervous for their Asiatic empire and sensible of the immense moral effect of the airship upon half educated populations had placed their aeronautic parks in North India and were able to play but a subordinate part in the European conflict Still even in England they had nine or ten big navigables twenty or thirty smaller ones and a variety of experimental aeroplanes Before the fleet of Prince Karl Albert had crossed England while Bert was still surveying Manchester in bird s eye view the diplomatic exchanges were going on that led to an attack upon Germany A heterogeneous collection of navigable balloons of all sizes and types gathered over the Bernese Oberland crushed and burnt the twenty five Swiss air ships that unexpectedly resisted this concentration in the battle of the Alps and then leaving the Alpine glaciers and valleys strewn with strange wreckage divided into two fleets and set itself to terrorise Berlin and destroy the Franconian Park seeking to do this before the second air fleet could be inflated Both over Berlin and Franconia the assailants with their modern explosives effected great damage before they were driven off In Franconia twelve fully distended and five partially filled and manned giants were able to make head against and at last with the help of a squadron of drachenflieger from Hamburg defeat and pursue the attack and to relieve Berlin and the Germans were straining every nerve to get an overwhelming fleet in the air and were already raiding London and Paris when the advance fleets from the Asiatic air parks the first intimation of a new factor in the conflict were reported from Burmah and Armenia Already the whole financial fabric of the world was staggering when that occurred With the destruction of the American fleet in the North Atlantic and the smashing conflict that ended the naval existence of Germany in the North Sea with the burning and wrecking of billions of pounds worth of property in the four cardinal cities of the world the fact of the hopeless costliness of war came home for the first time came like a blow in the face to the consciousness of mankind Credit went down in a wild whirl of selling Everywhere appeared a phenomenon that had already in a mild degree manifested itself in preceding periods of panic a desire to SECURE AND HOARD GOLD before prices reached bottom But now it spread like wild fire it became universal Above was visible conflict and destruction below something was happening far more deadly and incurable to the flimsy fabric of finance and commercialism in which men had so blindly put their trust As the airships fought above the visible gold supply of the world vanished below An epidemic of private cornering and universal distrust swept the world In a few weeks money except for depreciated paper vanished into vaults into holes into the walls of houses into ten million hiding places Money vanished and at its disappearance trade and industry came to an end The economic world staggered and fell dead It was like the stroke of some disease it was like the water vanishing out of the blood of a living creature it was a sudden universal coagulation of intercourse And as the credit system that had been the living fortress of the scientific civilisation reeled and fell upon the millions it had held together in economic relationship as these people perplexed and helpless faced this marvel of credit utterly destroyed the airships of Asia countless and relentless poured across the heavens swooped eastward to America and westward to Europe The page of history becomes a long crescendo of battle The main body of the British Indian air fleet perished upon a pyre of blazing antagonists in Burmah the Germans were scattered in the great battle of the Carpathians the vast peninsula of India burst into insurrection and civil war from end to end and from Gobi to Morocco rose the standards of the Jehad For some weeks of warfare and destruction it seemed as though the Confederation of Eastern Asia must needs conquer the world and then the jerry built modern civilisation of China too gave way under the strain The teeming and peaceful population of China had been westernised during the opening years of the twentieth century with the deepest resentment and reluctance they had been dragooned and disciplined under Japanese and European influence into an acquiescence with sanitary methods police controls military service and wholesale process of exploitation against which their whole tradition rebelled Under the stresses of the war their endurance reached the breaking point the whole of China rose in incoherent revolt and the practical destruction of the central government at Pekin by a handful of British and German airships that had escaped from the main battles rendered that revolt invincible In Yokohama appeared barricades the black flag and the social revolution With that the whole world became a welter of conflict So that a universal social collapse followed as it were a logical consequence upon world wide war Wherever there were great populations great masses of people found themselves without work without money and unable to get food Famine was in every working class quarter in the world within three weeks of the beginning of the war Within a month there was not a city anywhere in which the ordinary law and social procedure had not been replaced by some form of emergency control in which firearms and military executions were not being used to keep order and prevent violence And still in the poorer quarters and in the populous districts and even here and there already among those who had been wealthy famine spread three So what historians have come to call the Phase of the Emergency Committees sprang from the opening phase and from the phase of social collapse Then followed a period of vehement and passionate conflict against disintegration everywhere the struggle to keep order and to keep fighting went on And at the same time the character of the war altered through the replacement of the huge gas filled airships by flying machines as the instruments of war So soon as the big fleet engagements were over the Asiatics endeavoured to establish in close proximity to the more vulnerable points of the countries against which they were acting fortified centres from which flying machine raids could be made For a time they had everything their own way in this and then as this story has told the lost secret of the Butteridge machine came to light and the conflict became equalized and less conclusive than ever For these small flying machines ineffectual for any large expedition or conclusive attack were horribly convenient for guerilla warfare rapidly and cheaply made easily used easily hidden The design of them was hastily copied and printed in Pinkerville and scattered broadcast over the United States and copies were sent to Europe and there reproduced Every man every town every parish that could was exhorted to make and use them In a little while they were being constructed not only by governments and local authorities but by robber bands by insurgent committees by every type of private person The peculiar social destructiveness of the Butteridge machine lay in its complete simplicity It was nearly as simple as a motor bicycle The broad outlines of the earlier stages of the war disappeared under its influence the spacious antagonism of nations and empires and races vanished in a seething mass of detailed conflict The world passed at a stride from a unity and simplicity broader than that of the Roman Empire at its best to as social fragmentation as complete as the robber baron period of the Middle Ages But this time for a long descent down gradual slopes of disintegration comes a fall like a fall over a cliff Everywhere were men and women perceiving this and struggling desperately to keep as it were a hold upon the edge of the cliff A fourth phase follows Through the struggle against Chaos in the wake of the Famine came now another old enemy of humanity the Pestilence the Purple Death But the war does not pause The flags still fly Fresh air fleets rise new forms of airship and beneath their swooping struggles the world darkens scarcely heeded by history It is not within the design of this book to tell what further story to tell how the War in the Air kept on through the sheer inability of any authorities to meet and agree and end it until every organised government in the world was as shattered and broken as a heap of china beaten with a stick With every week of those terrible years history becomes more detailed and confused more crowded and uncertain Not without great and heroic resistance was civilisation borne down Out of the bitter social conflict below rose patriotic associations brotherhoods of order city mayors princes provisional committees trying to establish an order below and to keep the sky above The double effort destroyed them And as the exhaustion of the mechanical resources of civilisation clears the heavens of airships at last altogether Anarchy Famine and Pestilence are discovered triumphant below The great nations and empires have become but names in the mouths of men Everywhere there are ruins and unburied dead and shrunken yellow faced survivors in a mortal apathy Here there are robbers here vigilance committees and here guerilla bands ruling patches of exhausted territory strange federations and brotherhoods form and dissolve and religious fanaticisms begotten of despair gleam in famine bright eyes It is a universal dissolution The fine order and welfare of the earth have crumpled like an exploded bladder In five short years the world and the scope of human life have undergone a retrogressive change as great as that between the age of the Antonines and the Europe of the ninth century four Across this sombre spectacle of disaster goes a minute and insignificant person for whom perhaps the readers of this story have now some slight solicitude Of him there remains to be told just one single and miraculous thing Through a world darkened and lost through a civilisation in its death agony our little Cockney errant went and found his Edna He found his Edna He got back across the Atlantic partly by means of an order from the President and partly through his own good luck He contrived to get himself aboard a British brig in the timber trade that put out from Boston without cargo chiefly it would seem because its captain had a vague idea of getting home to South Shields Bert was able to ship himself upon her mainly because of the seamanlike appearance of his rubber boots They had a long eventful voyage they were chased or imagined themselves to be chased for some hours by an Asiatic ironclad which was presently engaged by a British cruiser The two ships fought for three hours circling and driving southward as they fought until the twilight and the cloud drift of a rising gale swallowed them up A few days later Bert s ship lost her rudder and mainmast in a gale The crew ran out of food and subsisted on fish They saw strange air ships going eastward near the Azores and landed to get provisions and repair the rudder at Teneriffe There they found the town destroyed and two big liners with dead still aboard sunken in the harbour From there they got canned food and material for repairs but their operations were greatly impeded by the hostility of a band of men amidst the ruins of the town who sniped them and tried to drive them away At Mogador they stayed and sent a boat ashore for water and were nearly captured by an Arab ruse Here too they got the Purple Death aboard and sailed with it incubating in their blood The cook sickened first and then the mate and presently every one was down and three in the forecastle were dead It chanced to be calm weather and they drifted helplessly and indeed careless of their fate backwards towards the Equator The captain doctored them all with rum Nine died all together and of the four survivors none understood navigation when at last they took heart again and could handle a sail they made a course by the stars roughly northward and were already short of food once more when they fell in with a petrol driven ship from Rio to Cardiff shorthanded by reason of the Purple Death and glad to take them aboard So at last after a year of wandering Bert reached England He landed in bright June weather and found the Purple Death was there just beginning its ravages The people were in a state of panic in Cardiff and many had fled to the hills and directly the steamer came to the harbour she was boarded and her residue of food impounded by some unauthenticated Provisional Committee Bert tramped through a country disorganised by pestilence foodless and shaken to the very base of its immemorial order He came near death and starvation many times and once he was drawn into scenes of violence that might have ended his career But the Bert Smallways who tramped from Cardiff to London vaguely going home vaguely seeking something of his own that had no tangible form but Edna was a very different person from the Desert Dervish who was swept out of England in mister Butteridge s balloon a year before He was brown and lean and enduring steady eyed and pestilence salted and his mouth which had once hung open shut now like a steel trap Across his brow ran a white scar that he had got in a fight on the brig In Cardiff he had felt the need of new clothes and a weapon and had by means that would have shocked him a year ago secured a flannel shirt a corduroy suit and a revolver and fifty cartridges from an abandoned pawnbroker s He also got some soap and had his first real wash for thirteen months in a stream outside the town The Vigilance bands that had at first shot plunderers very freely were now either entirely dispersed by the plague or busy between town and cemetery in a vain attempt to keep pace with it He prowled on the outskirts of the town for three or four days starving and then went back to join the Hospital Corps for a week and so fortified himself with a few square meals before he started eastward The Welsh and English countryside at that time presented the strangest mingling of the assurance and wealth of the opening twentieth century with a sort of Dureresque medievalism All the gear the houses and mono rails the farm hedges and power cables the roads and pavements the sign posts and advertisements of the former order were still for the most part intact Bankruptcy social collapse famine and pestilence had done nothing to damage these and it was only to the great capitals and ganglionic centres as it were of this State that positive destruction had come Any one dropped suddenly into the country would have noticed very little difference He would have remarked first perhaps that all the hedges needed clipping that the roadside grass grew rank that the road tracks were unusually rainworn and that the cottages by the wayside seemed in many cases shut up that a telephone wire had dropped here and that a cart stood abandoned by the wayside But he would still find his hunger whetted by the bright assurance that Wilder s Canned Peaches were excellent or that there was nothing so good for the breakfast table as Gobble s Sausages And then suddenly would come the Dureresque element the skeleton of a horse or some crumpled mass of rags in the ditch with gaunt extended feet and a yellow purple blotched skin and face or what had been a face gaunt and glaring and devastated Then here would be a field that had been ploughed and not sown and here a field of corn carelessly trampled by beasts and here a hoarding torn down across the road to make a fire Then presently he would meet a man or a woman yellow faced and probably negligently dressed and armed prowling for food These people would have the complexions and eyes and expressions of tramps or criminals and often the clothing of prosperous middle class or upper class people Many of these would be eager for news and willing to give help and even scraps of queer meat or crusts of grey and doughy bread in return for it They would listen to Bert s story with avidity and attempt to keep him with them for a day or so The virtual cessation of postal distribution and the collapse of all newspaper enterprise had left an immense and aching gap in the mental life of this time Men had suddenly lost sight of the ends of the earth and had still to recover the rumour spreading habits of the Middle Ages In their eyes in their bearing in their talk was the quality of lost and deoriented souls As Bert travelled from parish to parish and from district to district avoiding as far as possible those festering centres of violence and despair the larger towns he found the condition of affairs varying widely In one parish he would find the large house burnt the vicarage wrecked evidently in violent conflict for some suspected and perhaps imaginary store of food unburied dead everywhere and the whole mechanism of the community at a standstill In another he would find organising forces stoutly at work newly painted notice boards warning off vagrants the roads and still cultivated fields policed by armed men the pestilence under control even nursing going on a store of food husbanded the cattle and sheep well guarded and a group of two or three justices the village doctor or a farmer dominating the whole place a reversion in fact to the autonomous community of the fifteenth century But at any time such a village would be liable to a raid of Asiatics or Africans or such like air pirates demanding petrol and alcohol or provisions The price of its order was an almost intolerable watchfulness and tension Then the approach to the confused problems of some larger centre of population and the presence of a more intricate conflict would be marked by roughly smeared notices of Quarantine or Strangers Shot or by a string of decaying plunderers dangling from the telephone poles at the roadside About Oxford big boards were put on the roofs warning all air wanderers off with the single word Guns Taking their risks amidst these things cyclists still kept abroad and once or twice during Bert s long tramp powerful motor cars containing masked and goggled figures went tearing past him There were few police in evidence but ever and again squads of gaunt and tattered soldier cyclists would come drifting along and such encounters became more frequent as he got out of Wales into England Amidst all this wreckage they were still campaigning He had had some idea of resorting to the workhouses for the night if hunger pressed him too closely but some of these were closed and others converted into temporary hospitals and one he came up to at twilight near a village in Gloucestershire stood with all its doors and windows open silent as the grave and as he found to his horror by stumbling along evil smelling corridors full of unburied dead From Gloucestershire Bert went northward to the British aeronautic park outside Birmingham in the hope that he might be taken on and given food for there the Government or at any rate the War Office still existed as an energetic fact concentrated amidst collapse and social disaster upon the effort to keep the British flag still flying in the air and trying to brisk up mayor and mayor and magistrate and magistrate in a new effort of organisation They had brought together all the best of the surviving artisans from that region they had provisioned the park for a siege and they were urgently building a larger type of Butteridge machine Bert could get no footing at this work he was not sufficiently skilled and he had drifted to Oxford when the great fight occurred in which these works were finally wrecked He saw something but not very much of the battle from a place called Boar Hill He saw the Asiatic squadron coming up across the hills to the south west and he saw one of their airships circling southward again chased by two aeroplanes the one that was ultimately overtaken wrecked and burnt at Edge Hill But he never learnt the issue of the combat as a whole He crossed the Thames from Eton to Windsor and made his way round the south of London to Bun Hill and there he found his brother Tom looking like some dark defensive animal in the old shop just recovering from the Purple Death and Jessica upstairs delirious and as it seemed to him dying grimly She raved of sending out orders to customers and scolded Tom perpetually lest he should be late with missus Thompson s potatoes and missus Hopkins cauliflower though all business had long since ceased and Tom had developed a quite uncanny skill in the snaring of rats and sparrows and the concealment of certain stores of cereals and biscuits from plundered grocers shops Tom received his brother with a sort of guarded warmth Lor he said it s Bert I thought you d be coming back some day and I m glad to see you But I carn t arst you to eat anything because I aven t got anything to eat Where you been Bert all this time Bert reassured his brother by a glimpse of a partly eaten swede and was still telling his story in fragments and parentheses when he discovered behind the counter a yellow and forgotten note addressed to himself What s this he said and found it was a year old note from Edna She came ere said Tom like one who recalls a trivial thing arstin for you and arstin us to take er in That was after the battle and settin Clapham Rise afire I was for takin er in but Jessica wouldn t ave it and so she borrowed five shillings of me quiet like and went on I dessay she s tole you She had Bert found She had gone on she said in her note to an aunt and uncle who had a brickfield near Horsham And there at last after another fortnight of adventurous journeying Bert found her five When Bert and Edna set eyes on one another they stared and laughed foolishly so changed they were and so ragged and surprised And then they both fell weeping Oh Bertie boy she cried You ve come you ve come and put out her arms and staggered I told im He said he d kill me if I didn t marry him But Edna was not married and when presently Bert could get talk from her she explained the task before him That little patch of lonely agricultural country had fallen under the power of a band of bullies led by a chief called Bill Gore who had begun life as a butcher boy and developed into a prize fighter and a professional sport They had been organised by a local nobleman of former eminence upon the turf but after a time he had disappeared no one quite knew how and Bill had succeeded to the leadership of the countryside and had developed his teacher s methods with considerable vigour There had been a strain of advanced philosophy about the local nobleman and his mind ran to improving the race and producing the Over Man which in practice took the form of himself especially and his little band in moderation marrying with some frequency Bill followed up the idea with an enthusiasm that even trenched upon his popularity with his followers One day he had happened upon Edna tending her pigs and had at once fallen a wooing with great urgency among the troughs of slush Edna had made a gallant resistance but he was still vigorously about and extraordinarily impatient He might she said come at any time and she looked Bert in the eyes They were back already in the barbaric stage when a man must fight for his love And here one deplores the conflicts of truth with the chivalrous tradition One would like to tell of Bert sallying forth to challenge his rival of a ring formed and a spirited encounter and Bert by some miracle of pluck and love and good fortune winning But indeed nothing of the sort occurred Instead he reloaded his revolver very carefully and then sat in the best room of the cottage by the derelict brickfield looking anxious and perplexed and listening to talk about Bill and his ways and thinking thinking Then suddenly Edna s aunt with a thrill in her voice announced the appearance of that individual He was coming with two others of his gang through the garden gate Bert got up put the woman aside and looked out They presented remarkable figures They wore a sort of uniform of red golfing jackets and white sweaters football singlet and stockings and boots and each had let his fancy play about his head dress Bill had a woman s hat full of cock s feathers and all had wild slouching cowboy brims Bert sighed and stood up deeply thoughtful and Edna watched him marvelling The women stood quite still He left the window and went out into the passage rather slowly and with the careworn expression of a man who gives his mind to a complex and uncertain business Edna he called and when she came he opened the front door He asked very simply and pointing to the foremost of the three That im Sure and being told that it was shot his rival instantly and very accurately through the chest He then shot Bill s best man much less tidily in the head and then shot at and winged the third man as he fled The third gentleman yelped and continued running with a comical end on twist Then Bert stood still meditating with the pistol in his hand and quite regardless of the women behind him So far things had gone well It became evident to him that if he did not go into politics at once he would be hanged as an assassin and accordingly and without a word to the women he went down to the village public house he had passed an hour before on his way to Edna entered it from the rear and confronted the little band of ambiguous roughs who were drinking in the tap room and discussing matrimony and Bill s affection in a facetious but envious manner with a casually held but carefully reloaded revolver and an invitation to join what he called I regret to say a Vigilance Committee under his direction It s wanted about ere and some of us are gettin it up He presented himself as one having friends outside though indeed he had no friends at all in the world but Edna and her aunt and two female cousins There was a quick but entirely respectful discussion of the situation They thought him a lunatic who had tramped into this neighbourhood ignorant of Bill They desired to temporise until their leader came Bill would settle him Some one spoke of Bill Bill s dead I jest shot im said Bert We don t need reckon with IM E s shot and a red aired chap with a squint E S shot We ve settled up all that There ain t going to be no more Bill ever E d got wrong ideas about marriage and things It s is sort of chap we re after That carried the meeting Bill was perfunctorily buried and Bert s Vigilance Committee for so it continued to be called reigned in his stead That is the end of this story so far as Bert Smallways is concerned We leave him with his Edna to become squatters among the clay and oak thickets of the Weald far away from the stream of events From that time forth life became a succession of peasant encounters an affair of pigs and hens and small needs and little economies and children until Clapham and Bun Hill and all the life of the Scientific Age became to Bert no more than the fading memory of a dream He never knew how the War in the Air went on nor whether it still went on There were rumours of airships going and coming and of happenings Londonward Once or twice their shadows fell on him as he worked but whence they came or whither they went he could not tell Even his desire to tell died out for want of food At times came robbers and thieves at times came diseases among the beasts and shortness of food once the country was worried by a pack of boar hounds he helped to kill he went through many inconsecutive irrelevant adventures He survived them all Accident and death came near them both ever and again and passed them by and they loved and suffered and were happy and she bore him many children eleven children one after the other of whom only four succumbed to the necessary hardships of their simple life They lived and did well as well was understood in those days They went the way of all flesh year by year THE EPILOGUE It happened that one bright summer s morning exactly thirty years after the launching of the first German air fleet an old man took a small boy to look for a missing hen through the ruins of Bun Hill and out towards the splintered pinnacles of the Crystal Palace He was not a very old man he was as a matter of fact still within a few weeks of sixty three but constant stooping over spades and forks and the carrying of roots and manure and exposure to the damps of life in the open air without a change of clothing had bent him into the form of a sickle Moreover he had lost most of his teeth and that had affected his digestion and through that his skin and temper In face and expression he was curiously like that old Thomas Smallways who had once been coachman to Sir Peter Bone and this was just as it should be for he was Tom Smallways the son who formerly kept the little green grocer s shop under the straddle of the mono rail viaduct in the High Street of Bun Hill But now there were no green grocer s shops and Tom was living in one of the derelict villas hard by that unoccupied building site that had been and was still the scene of his daily horticulture He and his wife lived upstairs and in the drawing and dining rooms which had each French windows opening on the lawn and all about the ground floor generally Jessica who was now a lean and lined and baldish but still very efficient and energetic old woman kept her three cows and a multitude of gawky hens These two were part of a little community of stragglers and returned fugitives perhaps a hundred and fifty souls of them all together that had settled down to the new conditions of things after the Panic and Famine and Pestilence that followed in the wake of the War They had come back from strange refuges and hiding places and had squatted down among the familiar houses and begun that hard struggle against nature for food which was now the chief interest of their lives They were by sheer preoccupation with that a peaceful people more particularly after Wilkes the house agent driven by some obsolete dream of acquisition had been drowned in the pool by the ruined gas works for making inquiries into title and displaying a litigious turn of mind He had not been murdered you understand but the people had carried an exemplary ducking ten minutes or so beyond its healthy limits This little community had returned from its original habits of suburban parasitism to what no doubt had been the normal life of humanity for nearly immemorial years a life of homely economies in the most intimate contact with cows and hens and patches of ground a life that breathes and exhales the scent of cows and finds the need for stimulants satisfied by the activity of the bacteria and vermin it engenders Such had been the life of the European peasant from the dawn of history to the beginning of the Scientific Era so it was the large majority of the people of Asia and Africa had always been wont to live For a time it had seemed that by virtue of machines and scientific civilisation Europe was to be lifted out of this perpetual round of animal drudgery and that America was to evade it very largely from the outset And with the smash of the high and dangerous and splendid edifice of mechanical civilisation that had arisen so marvellously back to the land came the common man back to the manure The little communities still haunted by ten thousand memories of a greater state gathered and developed almost tacitly a customary law and fell under the guidance of a medicine man or a priest The world rediscovered religion and the need of something to hold its communities together At Bun Hill this function was entrusted to an old Baptist minister He taught a simple but adequate faith In his teaching a good principle called the Word fought perpetually against a diabolical female influence called the Scarlet Woman and an evil being called Alcohol This Alcohol had long since become a purely spiritualised conception deprived of any element of material application it had no relation to the occasional finds of whiskey and wine in Londoners cellars that gave Bun Hill its only holidays He taught this doctrine on Sundays and on weekdays he was an amiable and kindly old man distinguished by his quaint disposition to wash his hands and if possible his face daily and with a wonderful genius for cutting up pigs He held his Sunday services in the old church in the Beckenham Road and then the countryside came out in a curious reminiscence of the urban dress of Edwardian times All the men without exception wore frock coats top hats and white shirts though many had no boots Tom was particularly distinguished on these occasions because he wore a top hat with gold lace about it and a green coat and trousers that he had found upon a skeleton in the basement of the Urban and District Bank The women even Jessica came in jackets and immense hats extravagantly trimmed with artificial flowers and exotic birds feather s of which there were abundant supplies in the shops to the north and the children there were not many children because a large proportion of the babies born in Bun Hill died in a few days time of inexplicable maladies had similar clothes cut down to accommodate them even Stringer s little grandson of four wore a large top hat That was the Sunday costume of the Bun Hill district a curious and interesting survival of the genteel traditions of the Scientific Age On a weekday the folk were dingily and curiously hung about with dirty rags of housecloth and scarlet flannel sacking curtain serge and patches of old carpet and went either bare footed or on rude wooden sandals These people the reader must understand were an urban population sunken back to the state of a barbaric peasantry and so without any of the simple arts a barbaric peasantry would possess In many ways they were curiously degenerate and incompetent They had lost any idea of making textiles they could hardly make up clothes when they had material and they were forced to plunder the continually dwindling supplies of the ruins about them for cover All the simple arts they had ever known they had lost and with the breakdown of modern drainage modern water supply shopping and the like their civilised methods were useless Their cooking was worse than primitive It was a feeble muddling with food over wood fires in rusty drawing room fireplaces for the kitcheners burnt too much Among them all no sense of baking or brewing or metal working was to be found Their employment of sacking and such like coarse material for work a day clothing and their habit of tying it on with string and of thrusting wadding and straw inside it for warmth gave these people an odd packed appearance and as it was a week day when Tom took his little nephew for the hen seeking excursion so it was they were attired So you ve really got to Bun Hill at last Teddy said old Tom beginning to talk and slackening his pace so soon as they were out of range of old Jessica You re the last of Bert s boys for me to see Wat I ve seen young Bert I ve seen Sissie and Matt Tom what s called after me and Peter The traveller people brought you along all right eh I managed said Teddy who was a dry little boy Didn t want to eat you on the way They was all right said Teddy and on the way near Leatherhead we saw a man riding on a bicycle My word said Tom there ain t many of those about nowadays Where was he going Said e was going to Dorking if the High Road was good enough But I doubt if he got there All about Burford it was flooded We came over the hill uncle what they call the Roman Road That s high and safe Don t know it said old Tom But a bicycle You re sure it was a bicycle Had two wheels It was a bicycle right enough Why I remember a time Teddy where there was bicycles no end when you could stand just here the road was as smooth as a board then and see twenty or thirty coming and going at the same time bicycles and moty bicycles moty cars all sorts of whirly things No said Teddy I do They d keep on going by all day undreds and undreds But where was they all going asked Teddy Tearin off to Brighton you never seen Brighton I expect it s down by the sea used to be a moce mazing place and coming and going from London Why They did But why Lord knows why Teddy They did Then you see that great thing there like a great big rusty nail sticking up higher than all the houses and that one yonder and that and how something s fell in between em among the houses They was parts of the mono rail They went down to Brighton too and all day and night there was people going great cars as big as ouses full of people The little boy regarded the rusty evidences acrosss the narrow muddy ditch of cow droppings that had once been a High Street He was clearly disposed to be sceptical and yet there the ruins were He grappled with ideas beyond the strength of his imagination What did they go for he asked all of em They AD to Everything was on the go those days everything Yes but where did they come from All round ere Teddy there was people living in those ouses and up the road more ouses and more people You d ardly believe me Teddy but it s Bible truth You can go on that way for ever and ever and keep on coming on ouses more ouses and more There s no end to em No end They get bigger and bigger His voice dropped as though he named strange names It s LONDON he said And it s all empty now and left alone All day it s left alone You don t find ardly a man you won t find nothing but dogs and cats after the rats until you get round by Bromley and Beckenham and there you find the Kentish men herding swine Nice rough lot they are too I tell you that so long as the sun is up it s as still as the grave I been about by day orfen and orfen He paused And all those ouses and streets and ways used to be full of people before the War in the Air and the Famine and the Purple Death They used to be full of people Teddy and then came a time when they was full of corpses when you couldn t go a mile that way before the stink of em drove you back It was the Purple Death ad killed em every one The cats and dogs and ens and vermin caught it Everything and every one ad it Jest a few of us appened to live I pulled through and your aunt though it made er lose er air Why you find the skeletons in the ouses now This way we been into all the ouses and took what we wanted and buried moce of the people but up that way Norwood way there s ouses with the glass in the windows still and the furniture not touched all dusty and falling to pieces and the bones of the people lying some in bed some about the ouse jest as the Purple Death left em five and twenty years ago I went into one me and old Higgins las year and there was a room with books Teddy you know what I mean by books Teddy I seen em I seen em with pictures Well books all round Teddy undreds of books beyond rhyme or reason as the saying goes green mouldy and dry I was for leaven em alone I was never much for reading but ole Higgins he must touch em I believe I could read one of em NOW e says Not it I says I could e says laughing and takes one out and opens it I looked and there Teddy was a cullud picture oh so lovely It was a picture of women and serpents in a garden I never see anything like it This suits me said old Higgins to rights And then kind of friendly he gave the book a pat Old Tom Smallways paused impressively And then said Teddy It all fell to dus White dus He became still more impressive We didn t touch no more of them books that day Not after that For a long time both were silent Then Tom playing with a subject that attracted him with a fatal fascination repeated All day long they lie still as the grave Teddy took the point at last Don t they lie o nights he asked Old Tom shook his head Nobody knows boy nobody knows But what could they do Nobody knows Nobody ain t seen to tell not nobody Nobody They tell tales said old Tom They tell tales but there ain t no believing em I gets ome about sundown and keeps indoors so I can t say nothing can I But there s them that thinks some things and them as thinks others I ve eard it s unlucky to take clo es off of em unless they got white bones There s stories The boy watched his uncle sharply WOT stories he said Stories of moonlight nights and things walking about But I take no stock in em I keeps in bed If you listen to stories Lord You ll get afraid of yourself in a field at midday The little boy looked round and ceased his questions for a space They say there s a og man in Beck n am what was lost in London three days and three nights E went up after whiskey to Cheapside and lorst is way among the ruins and wandered Three days and three nights e wandered about and the streets kep changing so s he couldn t get ome If e adn t remembered some words out of the Bible e might ave been there now All day e went and all night and all day long it was still It was as still as death all day long until the sunset came and the twilight thickened and then it began to rustle and whisper and go pit a pat with a sound like urrying feet He paused Yes said the little boy breathlessly Go on What then A sound of carts and orses there was and a sound of cabs and omnibuses and then a lot of whistling shrill whistles whistles that froze is marrer And directly the whistles began things begun to show people in the streets urrying people in the ouses and shops busying themselves moty cars in the streets a sort of moonlight in all the lamps and winders People I say Teddy but they wasn t people They was the ghosts of them that was overtook the ghosts of them that used to crowd those streets And they went past im and through im and never eeded im went by like fogs and vapours Teddy And sometimes they was cheerful and sometimes they was orrible orrible beyond words And once e come to a place called Piccadilly Teddy and there was lights blazing like daylight and ladies and gentlemen in splendid clo es crowding the pavement and taxicabs follering along the road And as e looked they all went evil evil in the face Teddy And it seemed to im SUDDENLY THEY SAW IM and the women began to look at im and say things to im orrible wicked things One come very near im Teddy right up to im and looked into is face close And she adn t got a face to look with only a painted skull and then e see they was all painted skulls And one after another they crowded on im saying orrible things and catchin at im and threatenin and coaxing im so that is eart near left is body for fear Yes gasped Teddy in an unendurable pause Then it was he remembered the words of Scripture and saved himself alive The Lord is my Elper e says therefore I will fear nothing and straightaway there came a cock crowing and the street was empty from end to end And after that the Lord was good to im and guided im ome Teddy stared and caught at another question But who was the people he asked who lived in all these ouses What was they Gent men in business people with money leastways we thought it was money till everything smashed up and then seemingly it was jes paper all sorts Why there was undreds of thousands of them There was millions I ve seen that I Street there regular so s you couldn t walk along the pavements shoppin time with women and people shoppin But where d they get their food and things Bort em in shops like I used to ave I ll show you the place Teddy if we go back People nowadays aven t no idee of a shop no idee Plate glass winders it s all Greek to them Why I ve ad as much as a ton and a arf of petaties to andle all at one time You d open your eyes till they dropped out to see jes what I used to ave in my shop Baskets of pears eaped up marrers apples and pears d licious great nuts His voice became luscious Benanas oranges What s benanas asked the boy and oranges Fruits they was Sweet juicy d licious fruits Foreign fruits They brought em from Spain and N York and places In ships and things They brought em to me from all over the world and I sold em in my shop I sold em Teddy me what goes about now with you dressed up in old sacks and looking for lost ens People used to come into my shop great beautiful ladies like you d ardly dream of now dressed up to the nines and say Well mister Smallways what you got smorning and I d say Well I got some very nice C nadian apples or p raps I got custed marrers See And they d buy em Right off they d say Send me some up Lord what a life that was The business of it the bussel the smart things you saw moty cars going by kerridges people organ grinders German bands Always something going past always If it wasn t for those empty ouses I d think it all a dream But what killed all the people uncle asked Teddy It was a smash up said old Tom Everything was going right until they started that War Everything was going like clock work Everybody was busy and everybody was appy and everybody got a good square meal every day He met incredulous eyes Everybody he said firmly If you couldn t get it anywhere else you could get it in the workhuss a nice ot bowl of soup called skilly and bread better n any one knows ow to make now reg lar WHITE bread gov ment bread Teddy marvelled but said nothing It made him feel deep longings that he found it wisest to fight down For a time the old man resigned himself to the pleasures of gustatory reminiscence His lips moved Pickled Sammin he whispered an vinegar Dutch cheese BEER A pipe of terbakker But OW did the people get killed asked Teddy presently There was the War The War was the beginning of it The War banged and flummocked about but it didn t really KILL many people But it upset things They came and set fire to London and burnt and sank all the ships there used to be in the Thames we could see the smoke and steam for weeks and they threw a bomb into the Crystal Palace and made a bust up and broke down the rail lines and things like that But as for killin people it was just accidental if they did They killed each other more There was a great fight all hereabout one day Teddy up in the air Great things bigger than fifty ouses bigger than the Crystal Palace bigger bigger than anything flying about up in the air and whacking at each other and dead men fallin off em T riffic But it wasn t so much the people they killed as the business they stopped There wasn t any business doin Teddy there wasn t any money about and nothin to buy if you ad it But ow did the people get KILLED said the little boy in the pause I m tellin you Teddy said the old man It was the stoppin of business come next Suddenly there didn t seem to be any money There was cheques they was a bit of paper written on and they was jes as good as money jes as good if they come from customers you knew Then all of a sudden they wasn t I was left with three of em and two I d given change Then it got about that five pun notes were no good and then the silver sort of went off Gold you couldn t get for love or anything The banks in London ad got it and the banks was all smashed up Everybody went bankrup Everybody was thrown out of work Everybody He paused and scrutinised his hearer The small boy s intelligent face expressed hopeless perplexity That s ow it appened said old Tom He sought for some means of expression It was like stoppin a clock he said Things were quiet for a bit deadly quiet except for the air ships fighting about in the sky and then people begun to get excited I remember my lars customer the very lars customer that ever I ad He was a mister Moses Gluckstein a city gent and very pleasant and fond of sparrowgrass and chokes and e cut in there adn t been no customers for days and began to talk very fast offerin me for anything I ad anything petaties or anything its weight in gold E said it was a little speculation e wanted to try E said it was a sort of bet reely and very likely e d lose but never mind that e wanted to try E always ad been a gambler e said E said I d only got to weigh it out and e d give me is cheque right away Well that led to a bit of a argument perfect respectful it was but a argument about whether a cheque was still good and while e was explaining there come by a lot of these here unemployed with a great banner they ad for every one to read every one could read those days We want Food Three or four of em suddenly turns and comes into my shop Got any food says one No I says not to sell I wish I ad But if I ad I m afraid I couldn t let you have it This gent e s been offerin me mister Gluckstein e tried to stop me but it was too late What s e been offerin you says a great big chap with a atchet what s e been offerin you I ad to tell Boys e said ere s another feenancier and they took im out there and then and ung im on a lam pose down the street E never lifted a finger to resist After I tole on im e never said a word Tom meditated for a space First chap I ever sin ung he said Ow old was you asked Teddy Bout thirty said old Tom Why I saw free pig stealers ung before I was six said Teddy Father took me because of my birfday being near Said I ought to be blooded Well you never saw no one killed by a moty car any ow said old Tom after a moment of chagrin And you never saw no dead men carried into a chemis shop Teddy s momentary triumph faded No he said I aven t Nor won t Nor won t You ll never see the things I ve seen never Not if you live to be a undred Well as I was saying that s how the Famine and Riotin began Then there was strikes and Socialism things I never did old with worse and worse There was fightin and shootin down and burnin and plundering They broke up the banks up in London and got the gold but they couldn t make food out of gold Ow did WE get on Well we kep quiet We didn t interfere with no one and no one didn t interfere with us We ad some old tatoes about but mocely we lived on rats Ours was a old ouse full of rats and the famine never seemed to bother em Orfen we got a rat Orfen But moce of the people who lived hereabouts was too tender stummicked for rats Didn t seem to fancy em They d been used to all sorts of fallals and they didn t take to onest feeding not till it was too late Died rather It was the famine began to kill people Even before the Purple Death came along they was dying like flies at the end of the summer Ow I remember it all I was one of the first to ave it I was out seein if I mightn t get old of a cat or somethin and then I went round to my bit of ground to see whether I couldn t get up some young turnips I d forgot and I was took something awful You ve no idee the pain Teddy it doubled me up pretty near I jes lay down by at there corner and your aunt come along to look for me and dragged me ome like a sack I d never ave got better if it adn t been for your aunt Tom she says to me you got to get well and I AD to Then SHE sickened She sickened but there ain t much dyin about your aunt Lor she says as if I d leave you to go muddlin along alone That s what she says She s got a tongue as your aunt But it took er air off and arst though I might she s never cared for the wig I got er orf the old lady what was in the vicarage garden Well this ere Purple Death it jes wiped people out Teddy You couldn t bury em And it took the dogs and the cats too and the rats and orses At last every house and garden was full of dead bodies London way you couldn t go for the smell of there and we ad to move out of the I street into that villa we got And all the water run short that way The drains and underground tunnels took it Gor knows where the Purple Death come from some say one thing and some another Some said it come from eatin rats and some from eatin nothin Some say the Asiatics brought it from some I place Thibet I think where it never did nobody much arm All I know is it come after the Famine And the Famine come after the Penic and the Penic come after the War Teddy thought What made the Purple Death he asked Aven t I tole you But why did they ave a Penic They ad it But why did they start the War They couldn t stop theirselves Aving them airships made em And ow did the War end Lord knows if it s ended boy said old Tom Lord knows if it s ended There s been travellers through ere there was a chap only two summers ago say it s goin on still They say there s bands of people up north who keep on with it and people in Germany and China and Merica and places E said they still got flying machines and gas and things But we aven t seen nothin in the air now for seven years and nobody asn t come nigh of us Last we saw was a crumpled sort of airship going away over there It was a littleish sized thing and lopsided as though it ad something the matter with it He pointed and came to a stop at a gap in the fence the vestiges of the old fence from which in the company of his neighbour mister Stringer the milkman he had once watched the South of England Aero Club s Saturday afternoon ascents Dim memories it may be of that particular afternoon returned to him There down there where all that rus looks so red and bright that s the gas works What s gas asked the little boy Oh a hairy sort of nothin what you put in balloons to make em go up And you used to burn it till the lectricity come The little boy tried vainly to imagine gas on the basis of these particulars Then his thoughts reverted to a previous topic But why didn t they end the War Obstinacy Everybody was getting urt but everybody was urtin and everybody was igh spirited and patriotic and so they smeshed up things instead They jes went on smeshin And afterwards they jes got desp rite and savige It ought to ave ended said the little boy It didn t ought to ave begun said old Tom But people was proud People was la dy da ish and uppish and proud Too much meat and drink they ad Give in not them And after a bit nobody arst em to give in Nobody arst em He sucked his old gums thoughtfully and his gaze strayed away across the valley to where the shattered glass of the Crystal Palace glittered in the sun A dim large sense of waste and irrevocable lost opportunities pervaded his mind He repeated his ultimate judgment upon all these things obstinately slowly and conclusively his final saying upon the matter You can say what you like he said It didn t ought ever to ave begun He said it simply somebody somewhere ought to have stopped something but who or how or why were all beyond his ken End of Project Gutenberg s The War in the
