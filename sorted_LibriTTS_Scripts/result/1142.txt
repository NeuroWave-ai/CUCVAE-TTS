TYPHOON BY JOSEPH CONRAD Far as the mariner on highest mast Can see all around upon the calmed vast So wide was Neptune s hall KEATS AUTHOR S NOTE The main characteristic of this volume consists in this that all the stories composing it belong not only to the same period but have been written one after another in the order in which they appear in the book The period is that which follows on my connection with Blackwood s Magazine I had just finished writing The End of the Tether and was casting about for some subject which could be developed in a shorter form than the tales in the volume of Youth when the instance of a steamship full of returning coolies from Singapore to some port in northern China occurred to my recollection Years before I had heard it being talked about in the East as a recent occurrence It was for us merely one subject of conversation amongst many others of the kind Men earning their bread in any very specialized occupation will talk shop not only because it is the most vital interest of their lives but also because they have not much knowledge of other subjects They have never had the time to get acquainted with them Life for most of us is not so much a hard as an exacting taskmaster I never met anybody personally concerned in this affair the interest of which for us was of course not the bad weather but the extraordinary complication brought into the ship s life at a moment of exceptional stress by the human element below her deck Neither was the story itself ever enlarged upon in my hearing In that company each of us could imagine easily what the whole thing was like The financial difficulty of it presenting also a human problem was solved by a mind much too simple to be perplexed by anything in the world except men s idle talk for which it was not adapted From the first the mere anecdote the mere statement I might say that such a thing had happened on the high seas appeared to me a sufficient subject for meditation Yet it was but a bit of a sea yarn after all I felt that to bring out its deeper significance which was quite apparent to me something other something more was required a leading motive that would harmonize all these violent noises and a point of view that would put all that elemental fury into its proper place What was needed of course was Captain MacWhirr Directly I perceived him I could see that he was the man for the situation I don t mean to say that I ever saw Captain MacWhirr in the flesh or had ever come in contact with his literal mind and his dauntless temperament MacWhirr is not an acquaintance of a few hours or a few weeks or a few months He is the product of twenty years of life My own life Conscious invention had little to do with him If it is true that Captain MacWhirr never walked and breathed on this earth which I find for my part extremely difficult to believe I can also assure my readers that he is perfectly authentic I may venture to assert the same of every aspect of the story while I confess that the particular typhoon of the tale was not a typhoon of my actual experience At its first appearance Typhoon the story was classed by some critics as a deliberately intended storm piece Others picked out MacWhirr in whom they perceived a definite symbolic intention Neither was exclusively my intention Both the typhoon and Captain MacWhirr presented themselves to me as the necessities of the deep conviction with which I approached the subject of the story It was their opportunity It was also my opportunity and it would be vain to discourse about what I made of it in a handful of pages since the pages themselves are here between the covers of this volume to speak for themselves This is a belated reflection If it had occurred to me before it would have perhaps done away with the existence of this Author s Note for indeed the same remark applies to every story in this volume None of them are stories of experience in the absolute sense of the word Experience in them is but the canvas of the attempted picture Each of them has its more than one intention With each the question is what the writer has done with his opportunity and each answers the question for itself in words which if I may say so without undue solemnity were written with a conscientious regard for the truth of my own sensations And each of those stories to mean something must justify itself in its own way to the conscience of each successive reader Falk the second story in the volume offended the delicacy of one critic at least by certain peculiarities of its subject But what is the subject of Falk I personally do not feel so very certain about it He who reads must find out for himself My intention in writing Falk was not to shock anybody As in most of my writings I insist not on the events but on their effect upon the persons in the tale But in everything I have written there is always one invariable intention and that is to capture the reader s attention by securing his interest and enlisting his sympathies for the matter in hand whatever it may be within the limits of the visible world and within the boundaries of human emotions I may safely say that Falk is absolutely true to my experience of certain straightforward characters combining a perfectly natural ruthlessness with a certain amount of moral delicacy Falk obeys the law of self preservation without the slightest misgivings as to his right but at a crucial turn of that ruthlessly preserved life he will not condescend to dodge the truth As he is presented as sensitive enough to be affected permanently by a certain unusual experience that experience had to be set by me before the reader vividly but it is not the subject of the tale If we go by mere facts then the subject is Falk s attempt to get married in which the narrator of the tale finds himself unexpectedly involved both on its ruthless and its delicate side Falk shares with one other of my stories The Return in the Tales of Unrest volume the distinction of never having been serialized I think the copy was shown to the editor of some magazine who rejected it indignantly on the sole ground that the girl never says anything This is perfectly true From first to last Hermann s niece utters no word in the tale and it is not because she is dumb but for the simple reason that whenever she happens to come under the observation of the narrator she has either no occasion or is too profoundly moved to speak The editor who obviously had read the story might have perceived that for himself Apparently he did not and I refrained from pointing out the impossibility to him because since he did not venture to say that the girl did not live I felt no concern at his indignation All the other stories were serialized The Typhoon appeared in the early numbers of the Pall Mall Magazine then under the direction of the late mister Halkett It was on that occasion too that I saw for the first time my conceptions rendered by an artist in another medium mister Maurice Grieffenhagen knew how to combine in his illustrations the effect of his own most distinguished personal vision with an absolute fidelity to the inspiration of the writer Amy Foster was published in The Illustrated London News with a fine drawing of Amy on her day out giving tea to the children at her home in a hat with a big feather To morrow appeared first in the Pall Mall Magazine Of that story I will only say that it struck many people by its adaptability to the stage and that I was induced to dramatize it under the title of One Day More up to the present my only effort in that direction I may also add that each of the four stories on their appearance in book form was picked out on various grounds as the best of the lot by different critics who reviewed the volume with a warmth of appreciation and understanding a sympathetic insight and a friendliness of expression for which I cannot be sufficiently grateful nineteen nineteen J C TYPHOON I Captain MacWhirr of the steamer Nan Shan had a physiognomy that in the order of material appearances was the exact counterpart of his mind it presented no marked characteristics of firmness or stupidity it had no pronounced characteristics whatever it was simply ordinary irresponsive and unruffled The only thing his aspect might have been said to suggest at times was bashfulness because he would sit in business offices ashore sunburnt and smiling faintly with downcast eyes When he raised them they were perceived to be direct in their glance and of blue colour His hair was fair and extremely fine clasping from temple to temple the bald dome of his skull in a clamp as of fluffy silk The hair of his face on the contrary carroty and flaming resembled a growth of copper wire clipped short to the line of the lip while no matter how close he shaved fiery metallic gleams passed when he moved his head over the surface of his cheeks He was rather below the medium height a bit round shouldered and so sturdy of limb that his clothes always looked a shade too tight for his arms and legs As if unable to grasp what is due to the difference of latitudes he wore a brown bowler hat a complete suit of a brownish hue and clumsy black boots These harbour togs gave to his thick figure an air of stiff and uncouth smartness A thin silver watch chain looped his waistcoat and he never left his ship for the shore without clutching in his powerful hairy fist an elegant umbrella of the very best quality but generally unrolled Young Jukes the chief mate attending his commander to the gangway would sometimes venture to say with the greatest gentleness Allow me sir and possessing himself of the umbrella deferentially would elevate the ferule shake the folds twirl a neat furl in a jiffy and hand it back going through the performance with a face of such portentous gravity that mister Solomon Rout the chief engineer smoking his morning cigar over the skylight would turn away his head in order to hide a smile Oh aye The blessed gamp Thank ee Jukes thank ee would mutter Captain MacWhirr heartily without looking up Having just enough imagination to carry him through each successive day and no more he was tranquilly sure of himself and from the very same cause he was not in the least conceited It is your imaginative superior who is touchy overbearing and difficult to please but every ship Captain MacWhirr commanded was the floating abode of harmony and peace It was in truth as impossible for him to take a flight of fancy as it would be for a watchmaker to put together a chronometer with nothing except a two pound hammer and a whip saw in the way of tools Yet the uninteresting lives of men so entirely given to the actuality of the bare existence have their mysterious side It was impossible in Captain MacWhirr s case for instance to understand what under heaven could have induced that perfectly satisfactory son of a petty grocer in Belfast to run away to sea And yet he had done that very thing at the age of fifteen It was enough when you thought it over to give you the idea of an immense potent and invisible hand thrust into the ant heap of the earth laying hold of shoulders knocking heads together and setting the unconscious faces of the multitude towards inconceivable goals and in undreamt of directions His father never really forgave him for this undutiful stupidity We could have got on without him he used to say later on but there s the business And he an only son too His mother wept very much after his disappearance As it had never occurred to him to leave word behind he was mourned over for dead till after eight months his first letter arrived from Talcahuano It was short and contained the statement We had very fine weather on our passage out But evidently in the writer s mind the only important intelligence was to the effect that his captain had on the very day of writing entered him regularly on the ship s articles as Ordinary Seaman Because I can do the work he explained The mother again wept copiously while the remark Tom s an ass expressed the emotions of the father He was a corpulent man with a gift for sly chaffing which to the end of his life he exercised in his intercourse with his son a little pityingly as if upon a half witted person MacWhirr s visits to his home were necessarily rare and in the course of years he despatched other letters to his parents informing them of his successive promotions and of his movements upon the vast earth In these missives could be found sentences like this The heat here is very great Or On Christmas day at four P M we fell in with some icebergs The old people ultimately became acquainted with a good many names of ships and with the names of the skippers who commanded them with the names of Scots and English shipowners with the names of seas oceans straits promontories with outlandish names of lumber ports of rice ports of cotton ports with the names of islands with the name of their son s young woman She was called Lucy It did not suggest itself to him to mention whether he thought the name pretty And then they died The great day of MacWhirr s marriage came in due course following shortly upon the great day when he got his first command All these events had taken place many years before the morning when in the chart room of the steamer Nan Shan he stood confronted by the fall of a barometer he had no reason to distrust The fall taking into account the excellence of the instrument the time of the year and the ship s position on the terrestrial globe was of a nature ominously prophetic but the red face of the man betrayed no sort of inward disturbance Omens were as nothing to him and he was unable to discover the message of a prophecy till the fulfilment had brought it home to his very door That s a fall and no mistake he thought There must be some uncommonly dirty weather knocking about The Nan Shan was on her way from the southward to the treaty port of Fu chau with some cargo in her lower holds and two hundred Chinese coolies returning to their village homes in the province of Fo kien after a few years of work in various tropical colonies The morning was fine the oily sea heaved without a sparkle and there was a queer white misty patch in the sky like a halo of the sun The fore deck packed with Chinamen was full of sombre clothing yellow faces and pigtails sprinkled over with a good many naked shoulders for there was no wind and the heat was close The coolies lounged talked smoked or stared over the rail some drawing water over the side sluiced each other a few slept on hatches while several small parties of six sat on their heels surrounding iron trays with plates of rice and tiny teacups and every single Celestial of them was carrying with him all he had in the world a wooden chest with a ringing lock and brass on the corners containing the savings of his labours some clothes of ceremony sticks of incense a little opium maybe bits of nameless rubbish of conventional value and a small hoard of silver dollars toiled for in coal lighters won in gambling houses or in petty trading grubbed out of earth sweated out in mines on railway lines in deadly jungle under heavy burdens amassed patiently guarded with care cherished fiercely A cross swell had set in from the direction of Formosa Channel about ten o clock without disturbing these passengers much because the Nan Shan with her flat bottom rolling chocks on bilges and great breadth of beam had the reputation of an exceptionally steady ship in a sea way mister Jukes in moments of expansion on shore would proclaim loudly that the old girl was as good as she was pretty It would never have occurred to Captain MacWhirr to express his favourable opinion so loud or in terms so fanciful She was a good ship undoubtedly and not old either She had been built in Dumbarton less than three years before to the order of a firm of merchants in Siam Messrs Sigg and Son When she lay afloat finished in every detail and ready to take up the work of her life the builders contemplated her with pride Sigg has asked us for a reliable skipper to take her out remarked one of the partners and the other after reflecting for a while said I think MacWhirr is ashore just at present Is he Then wire him at once He s the very man declared the senior without a moment s hesitation Next morning MacWhirr stood before them unperturbed having travelled from London by the midnight express after a sudden but undemonstrative parting with his wife She was the daughter of a superior couple who had seen better days We had better be going together over the ship Captain said the senior partner and the three men started to view the perfections of the Nan Shan from stem to stern and from her keelson to the trucks of her two stumpy pole masts Captain MacWhirr had begun by taking off his coat which he hung on the end of a steam windless embodying all the latest improvements My uncle wrote of you favourably by yesterday s mail to our good friends Messrs Sigg you know and doubtless they ll continue you out there in command said the junior partner You ll be able to boast of being in charge of the handiest boat of her size on the coast of China Captain he added Have you Thank ee mumbled vaguely MacWhirr to whom the view of a distant eventuality could appeal no more than the beauty of a wide landscape to a purblind tourist and his eyes happening at the moment to be at rest upon the lock of the cabin door he walked up to it full of purpose and began to rattle the handle vigorously while he observed in his low earnest voice You can t trust the workmen nowadays A brand new lock and it won t act at all Stuck fast See See As soon as they found themselves alone in their office across the yard You praised that fellow up to Sigg What is it you see in him asked the nephew with faint contempt I admit he has nothing of your fancy skipper about him if that s what you mean said the elder man curtly Is the foreman of the joiners on the Nan Shan outside

none	none	How is it that you let Tait s people put us off with a defective lock on the cabin door The Captain could see directly he set eye on it Have it replaced at once The little straws Bates the little straws The lock was replaced accordingly and a few days afterwards the Nan Shan steamed out to the East without MacWhirr having offered any further remark as to her fittings or having been heard to utter a single word hinting at pride in his ship gratitude for his appointment or satisfaction at his prospects With a temperament neither loquacious nor taciturn he found very little occasion to talk There were matters of duty of course directions orders and so on but the past being to his mind done with and the future not there yet the more general actualities of the day required no comment because facts can speak for themselves with overwhelming precision Old mister Sigg liked a man of few words and one that you could be sure would not try to improve upon his instructions MacWhirr satisfying these requirements was continued in command of the Nan Shan and applied himself to the careful navigation of his ship in the China seas She had come out on a British register but after some time Messrs Sigg judged it expedient to transfer her to the Siamese flag At the news of the contemplated transfer Jukes grew restless as if under a sense of personal affront He went about grumbling to himself and uttering short scornful laughs Fancy having a ridiculous Noah s Ark elephant in the ensign of one s ship he said once at the engine room door Dash me if I can stand it I ll throw up the billet Don t it make you sick mister Rout The chief engineer only cleared his throat with the air of a man who knows the value of a good billet The first morning the new flag floated over the stern of the Nan Shan Jukes stood looking at it bitterly from the bridge He struggled with his feelings for a while and then remarked Queer flag for a man to sail under sir What s the matter with the flag inquired Captain MacWhirr Seems all right to me And he walked across to the end of the bridge to have a good look Well it looks queer to me burst out Jukes greatly exasperated and flung off the bridge Captain MacWhirr was amazed at these manners After a while he stepped quietly into the chart room and opened his International Signal Code book at the plate where the flags of all the nations are correctly figured in gaudy rows He ran his finger over them and when he came to Siam he contemplated with great attention the red field and the white elephant Nothing could be more simple but to make sure he brought the book out on the bridge for the purpose of comparing the coloured drawing with the real thing at the flagstaff astern When next Jukes who was carrying on the duty that day with a sort of suppressed fierceness happened on the bridge his commander observed There s nothing amiss with that flag Isn t there mumbled Jukes falling on his knees before a deck locker and jerking therefrom viciously a spare lead line No I looked up the book Length twice the breadth and the elephant exactly in the middle I thought the people ashore would know how to make the local flag Stands to reason You were wrong Jukes Well sir began Jukes getting up excitedly all I can say He fumbled for the end of the coil of line with trembling hands That s all right Captain MacWhirr soothed him sitting heavily on a little canvas folding stool he greatly affected All you have to do is to take care they don t hoist the elephant upside down before they get quite used to it Jukes flung the new lead line over on the fore deck with a loud Here you are bo ss en don t forget to wet it thoroughly and turned with immense resolution towards his commander but Captain MacWhirr spread his elbows on the bridge rail comfortably Because it would be I suppose understood as a signal of distress he went on What do you think That elephant there I take it stands for something in the nature of the Union Jack in the flag Does it yelled Jukes so that every head on the Nan Shan s decks looked towards the bridge Then he sighed and with sudden resignation It would certainly be a dam distressful sight he said meekly Later in the day he accosted the chief engineer with a confidential Here let me tell you the old man s latest mister Solomon Rout frequently alluded to as Long Sol Old Sol or Father Rout from finding himself almost invariably the tallest man on board every ship he joined had acquired the habit of a stooping leisurely condescension His hair was scant and sandy his flat cheeks were pale his bony wrists and long scholarly hands were pale too as though he had lived all his life in the shade He smiled from on high at Jukes and went on smoking and glancing about quietly in the manner of a kind uncle lending an ear to the tale of an excited schoolboy Then greatly amused but impassive he asked And did you throw up the billet No cried Jukes raising a weary discouraged voice above the harsh buzz of the Nan Shan s friction winches All of them were hard at work snatching slings of cargo high up to the end of long derricks only as it seemed to let them rip down recklessly by the run The cargo chains groaned in the gins clinked on coamings rattled over the side and the whole ship quivered with her long gray flanks smoking in wreaths of steam No cried Jukes I didn t What s the good I might just as well fling my resignation at this bulkhead I don t believe you can make a man like that understand anything He simply knocks me over At that moment Captain MacWhirr back from the shore crossed the deck umbrella in hand escorted by a mournful self possessed Chinaman walking behind in paper soled silk shoes and who also carried an umbrella The master of the Nan Shan speaking just audibly and gazing at his boots as his manner was remarked that it would be necessary to call at Fu chau this trip and desired mister Rout to have steam up to morrow afternoon at one o clock sharp He pushed back his hat to wipe his forehead observing at the same time that he hated going ashore anyhow while overtopping him mister Rout without deigning a word smoked austerely nursing his right elbow in the palm of his left hand Then Jukes was directed in the same subdued voice to keep the forward tween deck clear of cargo Two hundred coolies were going to be put down there The Bun Hin Company were sending that lot home Twenty five bags of rice would be coming off in a sampan directly for stores All seven years men they were said Captain MacWhirr with a camphor wood chest to every man The carpenter should be set to work nailing three inch battens along the deck below fore and aft to keep these boxes from shifting in a sea way Jukes had better look to it at once D ye hear Jukes This chinaman here was coming with the ship as far as Fu chau a sort of interpreter he would be Bun Hin s clerk he was and wanted to have a look at the space Jukes had better take him forward D ye hear Jukes Jukes took care to punctuate these instructions in proper places with the obligatory Yes sir ejaculated without enthusiasm His brusque Come along John make look see set the Chinaman in motion at his heels Wanchee look see all same look see can do said Jukes who having no talent for foreign languages mangled the very pidgin English cruelly He pointed at the open hatch Catchee number one piecie place to sleep in Eh He was gruff as became his racial superiority but not unfriendly The Chinaman gazing sad and speechless into the darkness of the hatchway seemed to stand at the head of a yawning grave No catchee rain down there savee pointed out Jukes Suppose all ee same fine weather one piecie coolie man come topside he pursued warming up imaginatively Make so Phooooo He expanded his chest and blew out his cheeks Savee John Breathe fresh air Good Eh Washee him piecie pants chow chow top side see John With his mouth and hands he made exuberant motions of eating rice and washing clothes and the Chinaman who concealed his distrust of this pantomime under a collected demeanour tinged by a gentle and refined melancholy glanced out of his almond eyes from Jukes to the hatch and back again Velly good he murmured in a disconsolate undertone and hastened smoothly along the decks dodging obstacles in his course He disappeared ducking low under a sling of ten dirty gunny bags full of some costly merchandise and exhaling a repulsive smell Captain MacWhirr meantime had gone on the bridge and into the chart room where a letter commenced two days before awaited termination These long letters began with the words My darling wife and the steward between the scrubbing of the floors and the dusting of chronometer boxes snatched at every opportunity to read them They interested him much more than they possibly could the woman for whose eye they were intended and this for the reason that they related in minute detail each successive trip of the Nan Shan Her master faithful to facts which alone his consciousness reflected would set them down with painstaking care upon many pages The house in a northern suburb to which these pages were addressed had a bit of garden before the bow windows a deep porch of good appearance coloured glass with imitation lead frame in the front door He paid five and forty pounds a year for it and did not think the rent too high because missus MacWhirr a pretentious person with a scraggy neck and a disdainful manner was admittedly ladylike and in the neighbourhood considered as quite superior The only secret of her life was her abject terror of the time when her husband would come home to stay for good Under the same roof there dwelt also a daughter called Lydia and a son Tom These two were but slightly acquainted with their father Mainly they knew him as a rare but privileged visitor who of an evening smoked his pipe in the dining room and slept in the house The lanky girl upon the whole was rather ashamed of him the boy was frankly and utterly indifferent in a straightforward delightful unaffected way manly boys have And Captain MacWhirr wrote home from the coast of China twelve times every year desiring quaintly to be remembered to the children and subscribing himself your loving husband as calmly as if the words so long used by so many men were apart from their shape worn out things and of a faded meaning The China seas north and south are narrow seas They are seas full of every day eloquent facts such as islands sand banks reefs swift and changeable currents tangled facts that nevertheless speak to a seaman in clear and definite language Their speech appealed to Captain MacWhirr s sense of realities so forcibly that he had given up his state room below and practically lived all his days on the bridge of his ship often having his meals sent up and sleeping at night in the chart room And he indited there his home letters Each of them without exception contained the phrase The weather has been very fine this trip or some other form of a statement to that effect And this statement too in its wonderful persistence was of the same perfect accuracy as all the others they contained mister Rout likewise wrote letters only no one on board knew how chatty he could be pen in hand because the chief engineer had enough imagination to keep his desk locked His wife relished his style greatly They were a childless couple and missus Rout a big high bosomed jolly woman of forty shared with mister Rout s toothless and venerable mother a little cottage near Teddington She would run over her correspondence at breakfast with lively eyes and scream out interesting passages in a joyous voice at the deaf old lady prefacing each extract by the warning shout Solomon says She had the trick of firing off Solomon s utterances also upon strangers astonishing them easily by the unfamiliar text and the unexpectedly jocular vein of these quotations On the day the new curate called for the first time at the cottage she found occasion to remark As Solomon says the engineers that go down to the sea in ships behold the wonders of sailor nature when a change in the visitor s countenance made her stop and stare Solomon Oh missus Rout stuttered the young man very red in the face I must say I don t He s my husband she announced in a great shout throwing herself back in the chair Perceiving the joke she laughed immoderately with a handkerchief to her eyes while he sat wearing a forced smile and from his inexperience of jolly women fully persuaded that she must be deplorably insane They were excellent friends afterwards for absolving her from irreverent intention he came to think she was a very worthy person indeed and he learned in time to receive without flinching other scraps of Solomon s wisdom For my part Solomon was reported by his wife to have said once give me the dullest ass for a skipper before a rogue There is a way to take a fool but a rogue is smart and slippery This was an airy generalization drawn from the particular case of Captain MacWhirr s honesty which in itself had the heavy obviousness of a lump of clay On the other hand mister Jukes unable to generalize unmarried and unengaged was in the habit of opening his heart after another fashion to an old chum and former shipmate actually serving as second officer on board an Atlantic liner First of all he would insist upon the advantages of the Eastern trade hinting at its superiority to the Western ocean service He extolled the sky the seas the ships and the easy life of the Far East The Nan Shan he affirmed was second to none as a sea boat We have no brass bound uniforms but then we are like brothers here he wrote We all mess together and live like fighting cocks All the chaps of the black squad are as decent as they make that kind and old Sol the Chief is a dry stick We are good friends As to our old man you could not find a quieter skipper Sometimes you would think he hadn t sense enough to see anything wrong And yet it isn t that 
583_139009_000059_000007	train-clean-360	Can t be 
none	none	He has been in command for a good few years now He doesn t do anything actually foolish and gets his ship along all right without worrying anybody I believe he hasn t brains enough to enjoy kicking up a row I don t take advantage of him I would scorn it Outside the routine of duty he doesn t seem to understand more than half of what you tell him We get a laugh out of this at times but it is dull too to be with a man like this in the long run Old Sol says he hasn t much conversation Conversation O Lord He never talks The other day I had been yarning under the bridge with one of the engineers and he must have heard us When I came up to take my watch he steps out of the chart room and has a good look all round peeps over at the sidelights glances at the compass squints upward at the stars That s his regular performance By and by he says Was that you talking just now in the port alleyway Yes sir With the third engineer Yes sir He walks off to starboard and sits under the dodger on a little campstool of his and for half an hour perhaps he makes no sound except that I heard him sneeze once Then after a while I hear him getting up over there and he strolls across to port where I was I can t understand what you can find to talk about says he Two solid hours I am not blaming you I see people ashore at it all day long and then in the evening they sit down and keep at it over the drinks Must be saying the same things over and over again I can t understand Did you ever hear anything like that And he was so patient about it It made me quite sorry for him But he is exasperating too sometimes Of course one would not do anything to vex him even if it were worth while 
583_139009_000060_000003	train-clean-360	But it isn t 
none	none	He s so jolly innocent that if you were to put your thumb to your nose and wave your fingers at him he would only wonder gravely to himself what got into you He told me once quite simply that he found it very difficult to make out what made people always act so queerly He s too dense to trouble about and that s the truth Thus wrote mister Jukes to his chum in the Western ocean trade out of the fulness of his heart and the liveliness of his fancy He had expressed his honest opinion It was not worthwhile trying to impress a man of that sort If the world had been full of such men life would have probably appeared to Jukes an unentertaining and unprofitable business He was not alone in his opinion The sea itself as if sharing mister Jukes good natured forbearance had never put itself out to startle the silent man who seldom looked up and wandered innocently over the waters with the only visible purpose of getting food raiment and house room for three people ashore Dirty weather he had known of course He had been made wet uncomfortable tired in the usual way felt at the time and presently forgotten So that upon the whole he had been justified in reporting fine weather at home But he had never been given a glimpse of immeasurable strength and of immoderate wrath the wrath that passes exhausted but never appeased the wrath and fury of the passionate sea He knew it existed as we know that crime and abominations exist he had heard of it as a peaceable citizen in a town hears of battles famines and floods and yet knows nothing of what these things mean though indeed he may have been mixed up in a street row have gone without his dinner once or been soaked to the skin in a shower Captain MacWhirr had sailed over the surface of the oceans as some men go skimming over the years of existence to sink gently into a placid grave ignorant of life to the last without ever having been made to see all it may contain of perfidy of violence and of terror There are on sea and land such men thus fortunate or thus disdained by destiny or by the sea II Observing the steady fall of the barometer Captain MacWhirr thought There s some dirty weather knocking about This is precisely what he thought He had had an experience of moderately dirty weather the term dirty as applied to the weather implying only moderate discomfort to the seaman Had he been informed by an indisputable authority that the end of the world was to be finally accomplished by a catastrophic disturbance of the atmosphere he would have assimilated the information under the simple idea of dirty weather and no other because he had no experience of cataclysms and belief does not necessarily imply comprehension The wisdom of his county had pronounced by means of an Act of Parliament that before he could be considered as fit to take charge of a ship he should be able to answer certain simple questions on the subject of circular storms such as hurricanes cyclones typhoons and apparently he had answered them since he was now in command of the Nan Shan in the China seas during the season of typhoons But if he had answered he remembered nothing of it He was however conscious of being made uncomfortable by the clammy heat He came out on the bridge and found no relief to this oppression The air seemed thick He gasped like a fish and began to believe himself greatly out of sorts The Nan Shan was ploughing a vanishing furrow upon the circle of the sea that had the surface and the shimmer of an undulating piece of gray silk The sun pale and without rays poured down leaden heat in a strangely indecisive light and the Chinamen were lying prostrate about the decks Their bloodless pinched yellow faces were like the faces of bilious invalids Captain MacWhirr noticed two of them especially stretched out on their backs below the bridge As soon as they had closed their eyes they seemed dead Three others however were quarrelling barbarously away forward and one big fellow half naked with herculean shoulders was hanging limply over a winch another sitting on the deck his knees up and his head drooping sideways in a girlish attitude was plaiting his pigtail with infinite languor depicted in his whole person and in the very movement of his fingers The smoke struggled with difficulty out of the funnel and instead of streaming away spread itself out like an infernal sort of cloud smelling of sulphur and raining soot all over the decks What the devil are you doing there mister Jukes asked Captain MacWhirr This unusual form of address though mumbled rather than spoken caused the body of mister Jukes to start as though it had been prodded under the fifth rib He had had a low bench brought on the bridge and sitting on it with a length of rope curled about his feet and a piece of canvas stretched over his knees was pushing a sail needle vigorously He looked up and his surprise gave to his eyes an expression of innocence and candour I am only roping some of that new set of bags we made last trip for whipping up coals he remonstrated gently We shall want them for the next coaling sir What became of the others Why worn out of course sir Captain MacWhirr after glaring down irresolutely at his chief mate disclosed the gloomy and cynical conviction that more than half of them had been lost overboard if only the truth was known and retired to the other end of the bridge Jukes exasperated by this unprovoked attack broke the needle at the second stitch and dropping his work got up and cursed the heat in a violent undertone The propeller thumped the three Chinamen forward had given up squabbling very suddenly and the one who had been plaiting his tail clasped his legs and stared dejectedly over his knees The lurid sunshine cast faint and sickly shadows The swell ran higher and swifter every moment and the ship lurched heavily in the smooth deep hollows of the sea I wonder where that beastly swell comes from said Jukes aloud recovering himself after a stagger North east grunted the literal MacWhirr from his side of the bridge There s some dirty weather knocking about Go and look at the glass When Jukes came out of the chart room the cast of his countenance had changed to thoughtfulness and concern He caught hold of the bridge rail and stared ahead The temperature in the engine room had gone up to a hundred and seventeen degrees Irritated voices were ascending through the skylight and through the fiddle of the stokehold in a harsh and resonant uproar mingled with angry clangs and scrapes of metal as if men with limbs of iron and throats of bronze had been quarrelling down there The second engineer was falling foul of the stokers for letting the steam go down He was a man with arms like a blacksmith and generally feared but that afternoon the stokers were answering him back recklessly and slammed the furnace doors with the fury of despair Then the noise ceased suddenly and the second engineer appeared emerging out of the stokehold streaked with grime and soaking wet like a chimney sweep coming out of a well As soon as his head was clear of the fiddle he began to scold Jukes for not trimming properly the stokehold ventilators and in answer Jukes made with his hands deprecatory soothing signs meaning No wind can t be helped you can see for yourself But the other wouldn t hear reason His teeth flashed angrily in his dirty face He didn t mind he said the trouble of punching their blanked heads down there blank his soul but did the condemned sailors think you could keep steam up in the God forsaken boilers simply by knocking the blanked stokers about No by George You had to get some draught too may he be everlastingly blanked for a swab headed deck hand if you didn t And the chief too rampaging before the steam gauge and carrying on like a lunatic up and down the engine room ever since noon What did Jukes think he was stuck up there for if he couldn t get one of his decayed good for nothing deck cripples to turn the ventilators to the wind The relations of the engine room and the deck of the Nan Shan were as is known of a brotherly nature therefore Jukes leaned over and begged the other in a restrained tone not to make a disgusting ass of himself the skipper was on the other side of the bridge But the second declared mutinously that he didn t care a rap who was on the other side of the bridge and Jukes passing in a flash from lofty disapproval into a state of exaltation invited him in unflattering terms to come up and twist the beastly things to please himself and catch such wind as a donkey of his sort could find The second rushed up to the fray He flung himself at the port ventilator as though he meant to tear it out bodily and toss it overboard All he did was to move the cowl round a few inches with an enormous expenditure of force and seemed spent in the effort He leaned against the back of the wheelhouse and Jukes walked up to him Oh Heavens ejaculated the engineer in a feeble voice He lifted his eyes to the sky and then let his glassy stare descend to meet the horizon that tilting up to an angle of forty degrees seemed to hang on a slant for a while and settled down slowly Heavens Phew What s up anyhow Jukes straddling his long legs like a pair of compasses put on an air of superiority We re going to catch it this time he said The barometer is tumbling down like anything Harry And you trying to kick up that silly row The word barometer seemed to revive the second engineer s mad animosity Collecting afresh all his energies he directed Jukes in a low and brutal tone to shove the unmentionable instrument down his gory throat Who cared for his crimson barometer It was the steam the steam that was going down and what between the firemen going faint and the chief going silly it was worse than a dog s life for him he didn t care a tinker s curse how soon the whole show was blown out of the water He seemed on the point of having a cry but after regaining his breath he muttered darkly I ll faint them and dashed off He stopped upon the fiddle long enough to shake his fist at the unnatural daylight and dropped into the dark hole with a whoop When Jukes turned his eyes fell upon the rounded back and the big red ears of Captain MacWhirr who had come across He did not look at his chief officer but said at once That s a very violent man that second engineer Jolly good second anyhow grunted Jukes They can t keep up steam he added rapidly and made a grab at the rail against the coming lurch Captain MacWhirr unprepared took a run and brought himself up with a jerk by an awning stanchion A profane man he said obstinately If this goes on I ll have to get rid of him the first chance It s the heat said Jukes The weather s awful It would make a saint swear Even up here I feel exactly as if I had my head tied up in a woollen blanket Captain MacWhirr looked up D ye mean to say mister Jukes you ever had your head tied up in a blanket What was that for It s a manner of speaking sir said Jukes stolidly Some of you fellows do go on What s that about saints swearing I wish you wouldn t talk so wild What sort of saint would that be that would swear No more saint than yourself I expect And what s a blanket got to do with it or the weather either The heat does not make me swear does it It s filthy bad temper That s what it is And what s the good of your talking like this Thus Captain MacWhirr expostulated against the use of images in speech and at the end electrified Jukes by a contemptuous snort followed by words of passion and resentment Damme I ll fire him out of the ship if he don t look out And Jukes incorrigible thought Goodness me Somebody s put a new inside to my old man Here s temper if you like Of course it s the weather what else It would make an angel quarrelsome let alone a saint All the Chinamen on deck appeared at their last gasp At its setting the sun had a diminished diameter and an expiring brown rayless glow as if millions of centuries elapsing since the morning had brought it near its end A dense bank of cloud became visible to the northward it had a sinister dark olive tint and lay low and motionless upon the sea resembling a solid obstacle in the path of the ship She went floundering towards it like an exhausted creature driven to its death The coppery twilight retired slowly and the darkness brought out overhead a swarm of unsteady big stars that as if blown upon flickered exceedingly and seemed to hang very near the earth At eight o clock Jukes went into the chart room to write up the ship s log He copies neatly out of the rough book the number of miles the course of the ship and in the column for wind scrawled the word calm from top to bottom of the eight hours since noon He was exasperated by the continuous monotonous rolling of the ship The heavy inkstand would slide away in a manner that suggested perverse intelligence in dodging the pen Having written in the large space under the head of Remarks Heat very oppressive he stuck the end of the penholder in his teeth pipe fashion and mopped his face carefully Ship rolling heavily in a high cross swell he began again and commented to himself Heavily is no word for it Then he wrote Sunset threatening with a low bank of clouds to N and E Sky clear overhead Sprawling over the table with arrested pen he glanced out of the door and in that frame of his vision he saw all the stars flying upwards between the teakwood jambs on a black sky The whole lot took flight together and disappeared leaving only a blackness flecked with white flashes for the sea was as black as the sky and speckled with foam afar The stars that had flown to the roll came back on the return swing of the ship rushing downwards in their glittering multitude not of fiery points but enlarged to tiny discs brilliant with a clear wet sheen Jukes watched the flying big stars for a moment and then wrote eight P M Swell increasing Ship labouring and taking water on her decks Battened down the coolies for the night Barometer still falling He paused and thought to himself Perhaps nothing whatever ll come of it And then he closed resolutely his entries Every appearance of a typhoon coming on On going out he had to stand aside and Captain MacWhirr strode over the doorstep without saying a word or making a sign Shut the door mister Jukes will you he cried from within Jukes turned back to do so muttering ironically Afraid to catch cold I suppose It was his watch below but he yearned for communion with his kind and he remarked cheerily to the second mate Doesn t look so bad after all does it The second mate was marching to and fro on the bridge tripping down with small steps one moment and the next climbing with difficulty the shifting slope of the deck At the sound of Jukes voice he stood still facing forward but made no reply Hallo That s a heavy one said Jukes swaying to meet the long roll till his lowered hand touched the planks This time the second mate made in his throat a noise of an unfriendly nature He was an oldish shabby little fellow with bad teeth and no hair on his face He had been shipped in a hurry in Shanghai that trip when the second officer brought from home had delayed the ship three hours in port by contriving in some manner Captain MacWhirr could never understand to fall overboard into an empty coal lighter lying alongside and had to be sent ashore to the hospital with concussion of the brain and a broken limb or two Jukes was not discouraged by the unsympathetic sound The Chinamen must be having a lovely time of it down there he said It s lucky for them the old girl has the easiest roll of any ship I ve ever been in There now This one wasn t so bad You wait snarled the second mate With his sharp nose red at the tip and his thin pinched lips he always looked as though he were raging inwardly and he was concise in his speech to the point of rudeness All his time off duty he spent in his cabin with the door shut keeping so still in there that he was supposed to fall asleep as soon as he had disappeared but the man who came in to wake him for his watch on deck would invariably find him with his eyes wide open flat on his back in the bunk and glaring irritably from a soiled pillow He never wrote any letters did not seem to hope for news from anywhere and though he had been heard once to mention West Hartlepool it was with extreme bitterness and only in connection with the extortionate charges of a boarding house He was one of those men who are picked up at need in the ports of the world They are competent enough appear hopelessly hard up show no evidence of any sort of vice and carry about them all the signs of manifest failure They come aboard on an emergency care for no ship afloat live in their own atmosphere of casual connection amongst their shipmates who know nothing of them and make up their minds to leave at inconvenient times They clear out with no words of leavetaking in some God forsaken port other men would fear to be stranded in and go ashore in company of a shabby sea chest corded like a treasure box and with an air of shaking the ship s dust off their feet You wait he repeated balanced in great swings with his back to Jukes motionless and implacable Do you mean to say we are going to catch it hot asked Jukes with boyish interest Say I say nothing You don t catch me snapped the little second mate with a mixture of pride scorn and cunning as if Jukes question had been a trap cleverly detected Oh no None of you here shall make a fool of me if I know it he mumbled to himself Jukes reflected rapidly that this second mate was a mean little beast and in his heart he wished poor Jack Allen had never smashed himself up in the coal lighter The far off blackness ahead of the ship was like another night seen through the starry night of the earth the starless night of the immensities beyond the created universe revealed in its appalling stillness through a low fissure in the glittering sphere of which the earth is the kernel Whatever there might be about said Jukes we are steaming straight into it You ve said it caught up the second mate always with his back to Jukes You ve said it mind not I Oh go to Jericho said Jukes frankly and the other emitted a triumphant little chuckle You ve said it he repeated And what of that I ve known some real good men get into trouble with their skippers for saying a dam sight less answered the second mate feverishly Oh no You don t catch me You seem deucedly anxious not to give yourself away said Jukes completely soured by such absurdity I wouldn t be afraid to say what I think Aye to me That s no great trick I am nobody and well I know it The ship after a pause of comparative steadiness started upon a series of rolls one worse than the other and for a time Jukes preserving his equilibrium was too busy to open his mouth As soon as the violent swinging had quieted down somewhat he said This is a bit too much of a good thing Whether anything is coming or not I think she ought to be put head on to that swell The old man is just gone in to lie down Hang me if I don t speak to him But when he opened the door of the chart room he saw his captain reading a book Captain MacWhirr was not lying down he was standing up with one hand grasping the edge of the bookshelf and the other holding open before his face a thick volume The lamp wriggled in the gimbals the loosened books toppled from side to side on the shelf the long barometer swung in jerky circles the table altered its slant every moment In the midst of all this stir and movement Captain MacWhirr holding on showed his eyes above the upper edge and asked What s the matter Swell getting worse sir Noticed that in here muttered Captain MacWhirr Anything wrong Jukes inwardly disconcerted by the seriousness of the eyes looking at him over the top of the book produced an embarrassed grin Rolling like old boots he said sheepishly Aye Very heavy very heavy What do you want At this Jukes lost his footing and began to flounder I was thinking of our passengers he said in the manner of a man clutching at a straw Passengers wondered the Captain gravely What passengers Why the Chinamen sir explained Jukes very sick of this conversation The Chinamen Why don t you speak plainly Couldn t tell what you meant Never heard a lot of coolies spoken of as passengers before Passengers indeed What s come to you Captain MacWhirr closing the book on his forefinger lowered his arm and looked completely mystified Why are you thinking of the Chinamen mister Jukes he inquired Jukes took a plunge like a man driven to it She s rolling her decks full of water sir Thought you might put her head on perhaps for a while Till this goes down a bit very soon I dare say Head to the eastward I never knew a ship roll like this He held on in the doorway and Captain MacWhirr feeling his grip on the shelf inadequate made up his mind to let go in a hurry and fell heavily on the couch Head to the eastward he said struggling to sit up That s more than four points off her course Yes sir Fifty degrees Would just bring her head far enough round to meet this Captain MacWhirr was now sitting up He had not dropped the book and he had not lost his place To the eastward he repeated with dawning astonishment To the Where do you think we are bound to You want me to haul a full powered steamship four points off her course to make the Chinamen comfortable Now I ve heard more than enough of mad things done in the world but this If I didn t know you Jukes I would think you were in liquor Steer four points off And what afterwards Steer four points over the other way I suppose to make the course good What put it into your head that I would start to tack a steamer as if she were a sailing ship Jolly good thing she isn t threw in Jukes with bitter readiness She would have rolled every blessed stick out of her this afternoon Aye And you just would have had to stand and see them go said Captain MacWhirr showing a certain animation It s a dead calm isn t it It is sir But there s something out of the common coming for sure Maybe I suppose you have a notion I should be getting out of the way of that dirt said Captain MacWhirr speaking with the utmost simplicity of manner and tone and fixing the oilcloth on the floor with a heavy stare Thus he noticed neither Jukes discomfiture nor the mixture of vexation and astonished respect on his face Now here s this book he continued with deliberation slapping his thigh with the closed volume I ve been reading the chapter on the storms there This was true He had been reading the chapter on the storms When he had entered the chart room it was with no intention of taking the book down Some influence in the air the same influence probably that caused the steward to bring without orders the Captain s sea boots and oilskin coat up to the chart room had as it were guided his hand to the shelf and without taking the time to sit down he had waded with a conscious effort into the terminology of the subject He lost himself amongst advancing semi circles left and right hand quadrants the curves of the tracks the probable bearing of the centre the shifts of wind and the readings of barometer He tried to bring all these things into a definite relation to himself and ended by becoming contemptuously angry with such a lot of words and with so much advice all head work and supposition without a glimmer of certitude It s the damnedest thing Jukes he said If a fellow was to believe all that s in there he would be running most of his time all over the sea trying to get behind the weather Again he slapped his leg with the book and Jukes opened his mouth but said nothing Running to get behind the weather Do you understand that mister Jukes It s the maddest thing ejaculated Captain MacWhirr with pauses gazing at the floor profoundly You would think an old woman had been writing this It passes me If that thing means anything useful then it means that I should at once alter the course away away to the devil somewhere and come booming down on Fu chau from the northward at the tail of this dirty weather that s supposed to be knocking about in our way From the north Do you understand mister Jukes Three hundred extra miles to the distance and a pretty coal bill to show I couldn t bring myself to do that if every word in there was gospel truth mister Jukes Don t you expect me And Jukes silent marvelled at this display of feeling and loquacity But the truth is that you don t know if the fellow is right anyhow How can you tell what a gale is made of till you get it He isn t aboard here is he Very well Here he says that the centre of them things bears eight points off the wind but we haven t got any wind for all the barometer falling Where s his centre now We will get the wind presently mumbled Jukes Let it come then said Captain MacWhirr with dignified indignation It s only to let you see mister Jukes that you don t find everything in books All these rules for dodging breezes and circumventing the winds of heaven mister Jukes seem to me the maddest thing when you come to look at it sensibly He raised his eyes saw Jukes gazing at him dubiously and tried to illustrate his meaning About as queer as your extraordinary notion of dodging the ship head to sea for I don t know how long to make the Chinamen comfortable whereas all we ve got to do is to take them to Fu chau being timed to get there before noon on Friday If the weather delays me very well There s your log book to talk straight about the weather But suppose I went swinging off my course and came in two days late and they asked me Where have you been all that time Captain What could I say to that Went around to dodge the bad weather I would say It must ve been dam bad they would say Don t know I would have to say I ve dodged clear of it See that Jukes I have been thinking it all out this afternoon He looked up again in his unseeing unimaginative way No one had ever heard him say so much at one time Jukes with his arms open in the doorway was like a man invited to behold a miracle Unbounded wonder was the intellectual meaning of his eye while incredulity was seated in his whole countenance A gale is a gale mister Jukes resumed the Captain and a full powered steam ship has got to face it There s just so much dirty weather knocking about the world and the proper thing is to go through it with none of what old Captain Wilson of the Melita calls storm strategy The other day ashore I heard him hold forth about it to a lot of shipmasters who came in and sat at a table next to mine It seemed to me the greatest nonsense He was telling them how he outmanoeuvred I think he said a terrific gale so that it never came nearer than fifty miles to him A neat piece of head work he called it How he knew there was a terrific gale fifty miles off beats me altogether It was like listening to a crazy man I would have thought Captain Wilson was old enough to know better Captain MacWhirr ceased for a moment then said It s your watch below mister Jukes Jukes came to himself with a start Yes sir Leave orders to call me at the slightest change said the Captain He reached up to put the book away and tucked his legs upon the couch Shut the door so that it don t fly open will you I can t stand a door banging They ve put a lot of rubbishy locks into this ship I must say Captain MacWhirr closed his eyes He did so to rest himself He was tired and he experienced that state of mental vacuity which comes at the end of an exhaustive discussion that has liberated some belief matured in the course of meditative years He had indeed been making his confession of faith had he only known it and its effect was to make Jukes on the other side of the door stand scratching his head for a good while Captain MacWhirr opened his eyes He thought he must have been asleep What was that loud noise Wind Why had he not been called The lamp wriggled in its gimbals the barometer swung in circles the table altered its slant every moment a pair of limp sea boots with collapsed tops went sliding past the couch He put out his hand instantly and captured one Jukes face appeared in a crack of the door only his face very red with staring eyes The flame of the lamp leaped a piece of paper flew up a rush of air enveloped Captain MacWhirr Beginning to draw on the boot he directed an expectant gaze at Jukes swollen excited features Came on like this shouted Jukes five minutes ago all of a sudden The head disappeared with a bang and a heavy splash and patter of drops swept past the closed door as if a pailful of melted lead had been flung against the house A whistling could be heard now upon the deep vibrating noise outside The stuffy chart room seemed as full of draughts as a shed Captain MacWhirr collared the other sea boot on its violent passage along the floor He was not flustered but he could not find at once the opening for inserting his foot The shoes he had flung off were scurrying from end to end of the cabin gambolling playfully over each other like puppies As soon as he stood up he kicked at them viciously but without effect He threw himself into the attitude of a lunging fencer to reach after his oilskin coat and afterwards he staggered all over the confined space while he jerked himself into it Very grave straddling his legs far apart and stretching his neck he started to tie deliberately the strings of his sou wester under his chin with thick fingers that trembled slightly He went through all the movements of a woman putting on her bonnet before a glass with a strained listening attention as though he had expected every moment to hear the shout of his name in the confused clamour that had suddenly beset his ship Its increase filled his ears while he was getting ready to go out and confront whatever it might mean It was tumultuous and very loud made up of the rush of the wind the crashes of the sea with that prolonged deep vibration of the air like the roll of an immense and remote drum beating the charge of the gale He stood for a moment in the light of the lamp thick clumsy shapeless in his panoply of combat vigilant and red faced There s a lot of weight in this he muttered As soon as he attempted to open the door the wind caught it Clinging to the handle he was dragged out over the doorstep and at once found himself engaged with the wind in a sort of personal scuffle whose object was the shutting of that door At the last moment a tongue of air scurried in and licked out the flame of the lamp Ahead of the ship he perceived a great darkness lying upon a multitude of white flashes on the starboard beam a few amazing stars drooped dim and fitful above an immense waste of broken seas as if seen through a mad drift of smoke On the bridge a knot of men indistinct and toiling were making great efforts in the light of the wheelhouse windows that shone mistily on their heads and backs Suddenly darkness closed upon one pane then on another The voices of the lost group reached him after the manner of men s voices in a gale in shreds and fragments of forlorn shouting snatched past the ear All at once Jukes appeared at his side yelling with his head down Watch put in wheelhouse shutters glass afraid blow in Jukes heard his commander upbraiding This come anything warning call me He tried to explain with the uproar pressing on his lips Light air remained bridge sudden north east could turn thought you sure hear They had gained the shelter of the weather cloth and could converse with raised voices as people quarrel I got the hands along to cover up all the ventilators Good job I had remained on deck I didn t think you would be asleep and so What did you say sir What Nothing cried Captain MacWhirr I said all right By all the powers We ve got it this time observed Jukes in a howl You haven t altered her course inquired Captain MacWhirr straining his voice No sir Certainly not Wind came out right ahead And here comes the head sea A plunge of the ship ended in a shock as if she had landed her forefoot upon something solid After a moment of stillness a lofty flight of sprays drove hard with the wind upon their faces Keep her at it as long as we can shouted Captain MacWhirr Before Jukes had squeezed the salt water out of his eyes all the stars had disappeared III Jukes was as ready a man as any half dozen young mates that may be caught by casting a net upon the waters and though he had been somewhat taken aback by the startling viciousness of the first squall he had pulled himself together on the instant had called out the hands and had rushed them along to secure such openings about the deck as had not been already battened down earlier in the evening Shouting in his fresh stentorian voice Jump boys and bear a hand he led in the work telling himself the while that he had just expected this But at the same time he was growing aware that this was rather more than he had expected From the first stir of the air felt on his cheek the gale seemed to take upon itself the accumulated impetus of an avalanche Heavy sprays enveloped the Nan Shan from stem to stern and instantly in the midst of her regular rolling she began to jerk and plunge as though she had gone mad with fright Jukes thought This is no joke While he was exchanging explanatory yells with his captain a sudden lowering of the darkness came upon the night falling before their vision like something palpable It was as if the masked lights of the world had been turned down Jukes was uncritically glad to have his captain at hand It relieved him as though that man had by simply coming on deck taken most of the gale s weight upon his shoulders Such is the prestige the privilege and the burden of command Captain MacWhirr could expect no relief of that sort from any one on earth Such is the loneliness of command He was trying to see with that watchful manner of a seaman who stares into the wind s eye as if into the eye of an adversary to penetrate the hidden intention and guess the aim and force of the thrust The strong wind swept at him out of a vast obscurity he felt under his feet the uneasiness of his ship and he could not even discern the shadow of her shape He wished it were not so and very still he waited feeling stricken by a blind man s helplessness To be silent was natural to him dark or shine Jukes at his elbow made himself heard yelling cheerily in the gusts We must have got the worst of it at once sir A faint burst of lightning quivered all round as if flashed into a cavern into a black and secret chamber of the sea with a floor of foaming crests It unveiled for a sinister fluttering moment a ragged mass of clouds hanging low the lurch of the long outlines of the ship the black figures of men caught on the bridge heads forward as if petrified in the act of butting The darkness palpitated down upon all this and then the real thing came at last It was something formidable and swift like the sudden smashing of a vial of wrath It seemed to explode all round the ship with an overpowering concussion and a rush of great waters as if an immense dam had been blown up to windward In an instant the men lost touch of each other This is the disintegrating power of a great wind it isolates one from one s kind An earthquake a landslip an avalanche overtake a man incidentally as it were without passion A furious gale attacks him like a personal enemy tries to grasp his limbs fastens upon his mind seeks to rout his very spirit out of him Jukes was driven away from his commander He fancied himself whirled a great distance through the air Everything disappeared even for a moment his power of thinking but his hand had found one of the rail stanchions His distress was by no means alleviated by an inclination to disbelieve the reality of this experience Though young he had seen some bad weather and had never doubted his ability to imagine the worst but this was so much beyond his powers of fancy that it appeared incompatible with the existence of any ship whatever He would have been incredulous about himself in the same way perhaps had he not been so harassed by the necessity of exerting a wrestling effort against a force trying to tear him away from his hold Moreover the conviction of not being utterly destroyed returned to him through the sensations of being half drowned bestially shaken and partly choked It seemed to him he remained there precariously alone with the stanchion for a long long time The rain poured on him flowed drove in sheets He breathed in gasps and sometimes the water he swallowed was fresh and sometimes it was salt For the most part he kept his eyes shut tight as if suspecting his sight might be destroyed in the immense flurry of the elements When he ventured to blink hastily he derived some moral support from the green gleam of the starboard light shining feebly upon the flight of rain and sprays He was actually looking at it when its ray fell upon the uprearing sea which put it out He saw the head of the wave topple over adding the mite of its crash to the tremendous uproar raging around him and almost at the same instant the stanchion was wrenched away from his embracing arms After a crushing thump on his back he found himself suddenly afloat and borne upwards His first irresistible notion was that the whole China Sea had climbed on the bridge Then more sanely he concluded himself gone overboard All the time he was being tossed flung and rolled in great volumes of water he kept on repeating mentally with the utmost precipitation the words My God My God My God My God All at once in a revolt of misery and despair he formed the crazy resolution to get out of that And he began to thresh about with his arms and legs But as soon as he commenced his wretched struggles he discovered that he had become somehow mixed up with a face an oilskin coat somebody s boots He clawed ferociously all these things in turn lost them found them again lost them once more and finally was himself caught in the firm clasp of a pair of stout arms He returned the embrace closely round a thick solid body He had found his captain They tumbled over and over tightening their hug Suddenly the water let them down with a brutal bang and stranded against the side of the wheelhouse out of breath and bruised they were left to stagger up in the wind and hold on where they could Jukes came out of it rather horrified as though he had escaped some unparalleled outrage directed at his feelings It weakened his faith in himself He started shouting aimlessly to the man he could feel near him in that fiendish blackness Is it you sir Is it you sir till his temples seemed ready to burst And he heard in answer a voice as if crying far away as if screaming to him fretfully from a very great distance the one word Yes Other seas swept again over the bridge He received them defencelessly right over his bare head with both his hands engaged in holding The motion of the ship was extravagant Her lurches had an appalling helplessness she pitched as if taking a header into a void and seemed to find a wall to hit every time When she rolled she fell on her side headlong and she would be righted back by such a demolishing blow that Jukes felt her reeling as a clubbed man reels before he collapses The gale howled and scuffled about gigantically in the darkness as though the entire world were one black gully At certain moments the air streamed against the ship as if sucked through a tunnel with a concentrated solid force of impact that seemed to lift her clean out of the water and keep her up for an instant with only a quiver running through her from end to end And then she would begin her tumbling again as if dropped back into a boiling cauldron Jukes tried hard to compose his mind and judge things coolly The sea flattened down in the heavier gusts would uprise and overwhelm both ends of the Nan Shan in snowy rushes of foam expanding wide beyond both rails into the night And on this dazzling sheet spread under the blackness of the clouds and emitting a bluish glow Captain MacWhirr could catch a desolate glimpse of a few tiny specks black as ebony the tops of the hatches the battened companions the heads of the covered winches the foot of a mast This was all he could see of his ship Her middle structure covered by the bridge which bore him his mate the closed wheelhouse where a man was steering shut up with the fear of being swept overboard together with the whole thing in one great crash her middle structure was like a half tide rock awash upon a coast It was like an outlying rock with the water boiling up streaming over pouring off beating round like a rock in the surf to which shipwrecked people cling before they let go only it rose it sank it rolled continuously without respite and rest like a rock that should have miraculously struck adrift from a coast and gone wallowing upon the sea The Nan Shan was being looted by the storm with a senseless destructive fury trysails torn out of the extra gaskets double lashed awnings blown away bridge swept clean weather cloths burst rails twisted light screens smashed and two of the boats had gone already They had gone unheard and unseen melting as it were in the shock and smother of the wave It was only later when upon the white flash of another high sea hurling itself amidships Jukes had a vision of two pairs of davits leaping black and empty out of the solid blackness with one overhauled fall flying and an iron bound block capering in the air that he became aware of what had happened within about three yards of his back He poked his head forward groping for the ear of his commander His lips touched it big fleshy very wet He cried in an agitated tone Our boats are going now sir And again he heard that voice forced and ringing feebly but with a penetrating effect of quietness in the enormous discord of noises as if sent out from some remote spot of peace beyond the black wastes of the gale again he heard a man s voice the frail and indomitable sound that can be made to carry an infinity of thought resolution and purpose that shall be pronouncing confident words on the last day when heavens fall and justice is done again he heard it and it was crying to him as if from very very far All right He thought he had not managed to make himself understood Our boats I say boats the boats sir Two gone The same voice within a foot of him and yet so remote yelled sensibly Can t be helped Captain MacWhirr had never turned his face but Jukes caught some more words on the wind What can expect when hammering through such Bound to leave something behind stands to reason Watchfully Jukes listened for more No more came This was all Captain MacWhirr had to say and Jukes could picture to himself rather than see the broad squat back before him An impenetrable obscurity pressed down upon the ghostly glimmers of the sea A dull conviction seized upon Jukes that there was nothing to be done If the steering gear did not give way if the immense volumes of water did not burst the deck in or smash one of the hatches if the engines did not give up if way could be kept on the ship against this terrific wind and she did not bury herself in one of these awful seas of whose white crests alone topping high above her bows he could now and then get a sickening glimpse then there was a chance of her coming out of it Something within him seemed to turn over bringing uppermost the feeling that the Nan Shan was lost She s done for he said to himself with a surprising mental agitation as though he had discovered an unexpected meaning in this thought One of these things was bound to happen Nothing could be prevented now and nothing could be remedied The men on board did not count and the ship could not last This weather was too impossible Jukes felt an arm thrown heavily over his shoulders and to this overture he responded with great intelligence by catching hold of his captain round the waist They stood clasped thus in the blind night bracing each other against the wind cheek to cheek and lip to ear in the manner of two hulks lashed stem to stern together And Jukes heard the voice of his commander hardly any louder than before but nearer as though starting to march athwart the prodigious rush of the hurricane it had approached him bearing that strange effect of quietness like the serene glow of a halo D ye know where the hands got to it asked vigorous and evanescent at the same time overcoming the strength of the wind and swept away from Jukes instantly Jukes didn t know They were all on the bridge when the real force of the hurricane struck the ship He had no idea where they had crawled to Under the circumstances they were nowhere for all the use that could be made of them Somehow the Captain s wish to know distressed Jukes Want the hands sir he cried apprehensively Ought to know asserted Captain MacWhirr Hold hard They held hard An outburst of unchained fury a vicious rush of the wind absolutely steadied the ship she rocked only quick and light like a child s cradle for a terrific moment of suspense while the whole atmosphere as it seemed streamed furiously past her roaring away from the tenebrous earth It suffocated them and with eyes shut they tightened their grasp What from the magnitude of the shock might have been a column of water running upright in the dark butted against the ship broke short and fell on her bridge crushingly from on high with a dead burying weight A flying fragment of that collapse a mere splash enveloped them in one swirl from their feet over their heads filling violently their ears mouths and nostrils with salt water It knocked out their legs wrenched in haste at their arms seethed away swiftly under their chins and opening their eyes they saw the piled up masses of foam dashing to and fro amongst what looked like the fragments of a ship She had given way as if driven straight in Their panting hearts yielded too before the tremendous blow and all at once she sprang up again to her desperate plunging as if trying to scramble out from under the ruins The seas in the dark seemed to rush from all sides to keep her back where she might perish There was hate in the way she was handled and a ferocity in the blows that fell She was like a living creature thrown to the rage of a mob hustled terribly struck at borne up flung down leaped upon Captain MacWhirr and Jukes kept hold of each other deafened by the noise gagged by the wind and the great physical tumult beating about their bodies brought like an unbridled display of passion a profound trouble to their souls One of those wild and appalling shrieks that are heard at times passing mysteriously overhead in the steady roar of a hurricane swooped as if borne on wings upon the ship and Jukes tried to outscream it Will she live through this The cry was wrenched out of his breast It was as unintentional as the birth of a thought in the head and he heard nothing of it himself It all became extinct at once thought intention effort and of his cry the inaudible vibration added to the tempest waves of the air He expected nothing from it Nothing at all For indeed what answer could be made But after a while he heard with amazement the frail and resisting voice in his ear the dwarf sound unconquered in the giant tumult She may It was a dull yell more difficult to seize than a whisper And presently the voice returned again half submerged in the vast crashes like a ship battling against the waves of an ocean Let s hope so it cried small lonely and unmoved a stranger to the visions of hope or fear and it flickered into disconnected words Ship This Never Anyhow for the best Jukes gave it up Then as if it had come suddenly upon the one thing fit to withstand the power of a storm it seemed to gain force and firmness for the last broken shouts Keep on hammering builders good men And chance it engines Rout good man Captain MacWhirr removed his arm from Jukes shoulders and thereby ceased to exist for his mate so dark it was Jukes after a tense stiffening of every muscle would let himself go limp all over The gnawing of profound discomfort existed side by side with an incredible disposition to somnolence as though he had been buffeted and worried into drowsiness The wind would get hold of his head and try to shake it off his shoulders his clothes full of water were as heavy as lead cold and dripping like an armour of melting ice he shivered it lasted a long time and with his hands closed hard on his hold he was letting himself sink slowly into the depths of bodily misery His mind became concentrated upon himself in an aimless idle way and when something pushed lightly at the back of his knees he nearly as the saying is jumped out of his skin In the start forward he bumped the back of Captain MacWhirr who didn t move and then a hand gripped his thigh A lull had come a menacing lull of the wind the holding of a stormy breath and he felt himself pawed all over It was the boatswain Jukes recognized these hands so thick and enormous that they seemed to belong to some new species of man The boatswain had arrived on the bridge crawling on all fours against the wind and had found the chief mate s legs with the top of his head Immediately he crouched and began to explore Jukes person upwards with prudent apologetic touches as became an inferior He was an ill favoured undersized gruff sailor of fifty coarsely hairy short legged long armed resembling an elderly ape His strength was immense and in his great lumpy paws bulging like brown boxing gloves on the end of furry forearms the heaviest objects were handled like playthings Apart from the grizzled pelt on his chest the menacing demeanour and the hoarse voice he had none of the classical attributes of his rating His good nature almost amounted to imbecility the men did what they liked with him and he had not an ounce of initiative in his character which was easy going and talkative For these reasons Jukes disliked him but Captain MacWhirr to Jukes scornful disgust seemed to regard him as a first rate petty officer He pulled himself up by Jukes coat taking that liberty with the greatest moderation and only so far as it was forced upon him by the hurricane What is it boss n what is it yelled Jukes impatiently What could that fraud of a boss n want on the bridge The typhoon had got on Jukes nerves The husky bellowings of the other though unintelligible seemed to suggest a state of lively satisfaction There could be no mistake The old fool was pleased with something The boatswain s other hand had found some other body for in a changed tone he began to inquire Is it you sir Is it you sir The wind strangled his howls Yes cried Captain MacWhirr IV All that the boatswain out of a superabundance of yells could make clear to Captain MacWhirr was the bizarre intelligence that All them Chinamen in the fore tween deck have fetched away sir Jukes to leeward could hear these two shouting within six inches of his face as you may hear on a still night half a mile away two men conversing across a field He heard Captain MacWhirr s exasperated What What and the strained pitch of the other s hoarseness In a lump seen them myself Awful sight sir thought tell you Jukes remained indifferent as if rendered irresponsible by the force of the hurricane which made the very thought of action utterly vain Besides being very young he had found the occupation of keeping his heart completely steeled against the worst so engrossing that he had come to feel an overpowering dislike towards any other form of activity whatever He was not scared he knew this because firmly believing he would never see another sunrise he remained calm in that belief These are the moments of do nothing heroics to which even good men surrender at times Many officers of ships can no doubt recall a case in their experience when just such a trance of confounded stoicism would come all at once over a whole ship s company Jukes however had no wide experience of men or storms He conceived himself to be calm inexorably calm but as a matter of fact he was daunted not abjectly but only so far as a decent man may without becoming loathsome to himself It was rather like a forced on numbness of spirit The long long stress of a gale does it the suspense of the interminably culminating catastrophe and there is a bodily fatigue in the mere holding on to existence within the excessive tumult a searching and insidious fatigue that penetrates deep into a man s breast to cast down and sadden his heart which is incorrigible and of all the gifts of the earth even before life itself aspires to peace Jukes was benumbed much more than he supposed He held on very wet very cold stiff in every limb and in a momentary hallucination of swift visions it is said that a drowning man thus reviews all his life he beheld all sorts of memories altogether unconnected with his present situation He remembered his father for instance a worthy business man who at an unfortunate crisis in his affairs went quietly to bed and died forthwith in a state of resignation Jukes did not recall these circumstances of course but remaining otherwise unconcerned he seemed to see distinctly the poor man s face a certain game of nap played when quite a boy in Table Bay on board a ship since lost with all hands the thick eyebrows of his first skipper and without any emotion as he might years ago have walked listlessly into her room and found her sitting there with a book he remembered his mother dead too now the resolute woman left badly off who had been very firm in his bringing up It could not have lasted more than a second perhaps not so much A heavy arm had fallen about his shoulders Captain MacWhirr s voice was speaking his name into his ear Jukes Jukes He detected the tone of deep concern The wind had thrown its weight on the ship trying to pin her down amongst the seas They made a clean breach over her as over a deep swimming log and the gathered weight of crashes menaced monstrously from afar The breakers flung out of the night with a ghostly light on their crests the light of sea foam that in a ferocious boiling up pale flash showed upon the slender body of the ship the toppling rush the downfall and the seething mad scurry of each wave Never for a moment could she shake herself clear of the water Jukes rigid perceived in her motion the ominous sign of haphazard floundering She was no longer struggling intelligently It was the beginning of the end and the note of busy concern in Captain MacWhirr s voice sickened him like an exhibition of blind and pernicious folly The spell of the storm had fallen upon Jukes He was penetrated by it absorbed by it he was rooted in it with a rigour of dumb attention Captain MacWhirr persisted in his cries but the wind got between them like a solid wedge He hung round Jukes neck as heavy as a millstone and suddenly the sides of their heads knocked together Jukes mister Jukes I say He had to answer that voice that would not be silenced He answered in the customary manner Yes sir And directly his heart corrupted by the storm that breeds a craving for peace rebelled against the tyranny of training and command Captain MacWhirr had his mate s head fixed firm in the crook of his elbow and pressed it to his yelling lips mysteriously Sometimes Jukes would break in admonishing hastily Look out sir or Captain MacWhirr would bawl an earnest exhortation to Hold hard there and the whole black universe seemed to reel together with the ship They paused She floated yet And Captain MacWhirr would resume his shouts Says whole lot fetched away Ought to see what s the matter Directly the full force of the hurricane had struck the ship every part of her deck became untenable and the sailors dazed and dismayed took shelter in the port alleyway under the bridge It had a door aft which they shut it was very black cold and dismal At each heavy fling of the ship they would groan all together in the dark and tons of water could be heard scuttling about as if trying to get at them from above The boatswain had been keeping up a gruff talk but a more unreasonable lot of men he said afterwards he had never been with They were snug enough there out of harm s way and not wanted to do anything either and yet they did nothing but grumble and complain peevishly like so many sick kids Finally one of them said that if there had been at least some light to see each other s noses by it wouldn t be so bad It was making him crazy he declared to lie there in the dark waiting for the blamed hooker to sink Why don t you step outside then and be done with it at once the boatswain turned on him This called up a shout of execration The boatswain found himself overwhelmed with reproaches of all sorts They seemed to take it ill that a lamp was not instantly created for them out of nothing They would whine after a light to get drowned by anyhow And though the unreason of their revilings was patent since no one could hope to reach the lamp room which was forward he became greatly distressed He did not think it was decent of them to be nagging at him like this He told them so and was met by general contumely He sought refuge therefore in an embittered silence At the same time their grumbling and sighing and muttering worried him greatly but by and by it occurred to him that there were six globe lamps hung in the tween deck and that there could be no harm in depriving the coolies of one of them The Nan Shan had an athwartship coal bunker which being at times used as cargo space communicated by an iron door with the fore tween deck It was empty then and its manhole was the foremost one in the alleyway The boatswain could get in therefore without coming out on deck at all but to his great surprise he found he could induce no one to help him in taking off the manhole cover He groped for it all the same but one of the crew lying in his way refused to budge Why I only want to get you that blamed light you are crying for he expostulated almost pitifully Somebody told him to go and put his head in a bag He regretted he could not recognize the voice and that it was too dark to see otherwise as he said he would have put a head on that son of a sea cook anyway sink or swim Nevertheless he had made up his mind to show them he could get a light if he were to die for it Through the violence of the ship s rolling every movement was dangerous To be lying down seemed labour enough He nearly broke his neck dropping into the bunker He fell on his back and was sent shooting helplessly from side to side in the dangerous company of a heavy iron bar a coal trimmer s slice probably left down there by somebody This thing made him as nervous as though it had been a wild beast He could not see it the inside of the bunker coated with coal dust being perfectly and impenetrably black but he heard it sliding and clattering and striking here and there always in the neighbourhood of his head It seemed to make an extraordinary noise too to give heavy thumps as though it had been as big as a bridge girder This was remarkable enough for him to notice while he was flung from port to starboard and back again and clawing desperately the smooth sides of the bunker in the endeavour to stop himself The door into the tween deck not fitting quite true he saw a thread of dim light at the bottom Being a sailor and a still active man he did not want much of a chance to regain his feet and as luck would have it in scrambling up he put his hand on the iron slice picking it up as he rose Otherwise he would have been afraid of the thing breaking his legs or at least knocking him down again At first he stood still He felt unsafe in this darkness that seemed to make the ship s motion unfamiliar unforeseen and difficult to counteract He felt so much shaken for a moment that he dared not move for fear of taking charge again He had no mind to get battered to pieces in that bunker He had struck his head twice he was dazed a little He seemed to hear yet so plainly the clatter and bangs of the iron slice flying about his ears that he tightened his grip to prove to himself he had it there safely in his hand He was vaguely amazed at the plainness with which down there he could hear the gale raging Its howls and shrieks seemed to take on in the emptiness of the bunker something of the human character of human rage and pain being not vast but infinitely poignant And there were with every roll thumps too profound ponderous thumps as if a bulky object of five ton weight or so had got play in the hold But there was no such thing in the cargo Something on deck Impossible Or alongside Couldn t be He thought all this quickly clearly competently like a seaman and in the end remained puzzled This noise though came deadened from outside together with the washing and pouring of water on deck above his head Was it the wind Must be It made down there a row like the shouting of a big lot of crazed men And he discovered in himself a desire for a light too if only to get drowned by and a nervous anxiety to get out of that bunker as quickly as possible He pulled back the bolt the heavy iron plate turned on its hinges and it was as though he had opened the door to the sounds of the tempest A gust of hoarse yelling met him the air was still and the rushing of water overhead was covered by a tumult of strangled throaty shrieks that produced an effect of desperate confusion He straddled his legs the whole width of the doorway and stretched his neck And at first he perceived only what he had come to seek six small yellow flames swinging violently on the great body of the dusk It was stayed like the gallery of a mine with a row of stanchions in the middle and cross beams overhead penetrating into the gloom ahead indefinitely And to port there loomed like the caving in of one of the sides a bulky mass with a slanting outline The whole place with the shadows and the shapes moved all the time The boatswain glared the ship lurched to starboard and a great howl came from that mass that had the slant of fallen earth Pieces of wood whizzed past Planks he thought inexpressibly startled and flinging back his head At his feet a man went sliding over open eyed on his back straining with uplifted arms for nothing and another came bounding like a detached stone with his head between his legs and his hands clenched His pigtail whipped in the air he made a grab at the boatswain s legs and from his opened hand a bright white disc rolled against the boatswain s foot He recognized a silver dollar and yelled at it with astonishment With a precipitated sound of trampling and shuffling of bare feet and with guttural cries the mound of writhing bodies piled up to port detached itself from the ship s side and sliding inert and struggling shifted to starboard with a dull brutal thump The cries ceased The boatswain heard a long moan through the roar and whistling of the wind he saw an inextricable confusion of heads and shoulders naked soles kicking upwards fists raised tumbling backs legs pigtails faces Good Lord he cried horrified and banged to the iron door upon this vision This was what he had come on the bridge to tell He could not keep it to himself and on board ship there is only one man to whom it is worth while to unburden yourself On his passage back the hands in the alleyway swore at him for a fool Why didn t he bring that lamp What the devil did the coolies matter to anybody And when he came out the extremity of the ship made what went on inside of her appear of little moment At first he thought he had left the alleyway in the very moment of her sinking The bridge ladders had been washed away but an enormous sea filling the after deck floated him up After that he had to lie on his stomach for some time holding to a ring bolt getting his breath now and then and swallowing salt water He struggled farther on his hands and knees too frightened and distracted to turn back In this way he reached the after part of the wheelhouse In that comparatively sheltered spot he found the second mate The boatswain was pleasantly surprised his impression being that everybody on deck must have been washed away a long time ago He asked eagerly where the Captain was The second mate was lying low like a malignant little animal under a hedge Captain Gone overboard after getting us into this mess The mate too for all he knew or cared Another fool Didn t matter Everybody was going by and by The boatswain crawled out again into the strength of the wind not because he much expected to find anybody he said but just to get away from that man He crawled out as outcasts go to face an inclement world Hence his great joy at finding Jukes and the Captain But what was going on in the tween deck was to him a minor matter by that time Besides it was difficult to make yourself heard But he managed to convey the idea that the Chinaman had broken adrift together with their boxes and that he had come up on purpose to report this As to the hands they were all right Then appeased he subsided on the deck in a sitting posture hugging with his arms and legs the stand of the engine room telegraph an iron casting as thick as a post When that went why he expected he would go too He gave no more thought to the coolies Captain MacWhirr had made Jukes understand that he wanted him to go down below to see What am I to do then sir And the trembling of his whole wet body caused Jukes voice to sound like bleating See first Boss n says adrift That boss n is a confounded fool howled Jukes shakily The absurdity of the demand made upon him revolted Jukes He was as unwilling to go as if the moment he had left the deck the ship were sure to sink I must know can t leave They ll settle sir Fight boss n says they fight Why Can t have fighting board ship Much rather keep you here case I should washed overboard myself Stop it some way You see and tell me through engine room tube Don t want you come up here too often Dangerous moving about deck Jukes held with his head in chancery had to listen to what seemed horrible suggestions Don t want you get lost so long ship isn t Rout Good man Ship may through this all right yet All at once Jukes understood he would have to go Do you think she may he screamed But the wind devoured the reply out of which Jukes heard only the one word pronounced with great energy Always Captain MacWhirr released Jukes and bending over the boatswain yelled Get back with the mate Jukes only knew that the arm was gone off his shoulders He was dismissed with his orders to do what He was exasperated into letting go his hold carelessly and on the instant was blown away It seemed to him that nothing could stop him from being blown right over the stern He flung himself down hastily and the boatswain who was following fell on him Don t you get up yet sir cried the boatswain No hurry A sea swept over Jukes understood the boatswain to splutter that the bridge ladders were gone I ll lower you down sir by your hands he screamed He shouted also something about the smoke stack being as likely to go overboard as not Jukes thought it very possible and imagined the fires out the ship helpless The boatswain by his side kept on yelling What What is it Jukes cried distressfully and the other repeated What would my old woman say if she saw me now In the alleyway where a lot of water had got in and splashed in the dark the men were still as death till Jukes stumbled against one of them and cursed him savagely for being in the way Two or three voices then asked eager and weak Any chance for us sir What s the matter with you fools he said brutally He felt as though he could throw himself down amongst them and never move any more But they seemed cheered and in the midst of obsequious warnings Look out Mind that manhole lid sir they lowered him into the bunker The boatswain tumbled down after him and as soon as he had picked himself up he remarked She would say Serve you right you old fool for going to sea The boatswain had some means and made a point of alluding to them frequently His wife a fat woman and two grown up daughters kept a greengrocer s shop in the East end of London In the dark Jukes unsteady on his legs listened to a faint thunderous patter A deadened screaming went on steadily at his elbow as it were and from above the louder tumult of the storm descended upon these near sounds His head swam To him too in that bunker the motion of the ship seemed novel and menacing sapping his resolution as though he had never been afloat before He had half a mind to scramble out again but the remembrance of Captain MacWhirr s voice made this impossible His orders were to go and see What was the good of it he wanted to know Enraged he told himself he would see of course But the boatswain staggering clumsily warned him to be careful how he opened that door there was a blamed fight going on And Jukes as if in great bodily pain desired irritably to know what the devil they were fighting for Dollars Dollars sir All their rotten chests got burst open Blamed money skipping all over the place and they are tumbling after it head over heels tearing and biting like anything A regular little hell in there Jukes convulsively opened the door The short boatswain peered under his arm One of the lamps had gone out broken perhaps Rancorous guttural cries burst out loudly on their ears and a strange panting sound the working of all these straining breasts A hard blow hit the side of the ship water fell above with a stunning shock and in the forefront of the gloom where the air was reddish and thick Jukes saw a head bang the deck violently two thick calves waving on high muscular arms twined round a naked body a yellow face open mouthed and with a set wild stare look up and slide away An empty chest clattered turning over a man fell head first with a jump as if lifted by a kick and farther off indistinct others streamed like a mass of rolling stones down a bank thumping the deck with their feet and flourishing their arms wildly The hatchway ladder was loaded with coolies swarming on it like bees on a branch They hung on the steps in a crawling stirring cluster beating madly with their fists the underside of the battened hatch and the headlong rush of the water above was heard in the intervals of their yelling The ship heeled over more and they began to drop off first one then two then all the rest went away together falling straight off with a great cry Jukes was confounded The boatswain with gruff anxiety begged him Don t you go in there sir The whole place seemed to twist upon itself jumping incessantly the while and when the ship rose to a sea Jukes fancied that all these men would be shot upon him in a body He backed out swung the door to and with trembling hands pushed at the bolt As soon as his mate had gone Captain MacWhirr left alone on the bridge sidled and staggered as far as the wheelhouse Its door being hinged forward he had to fight the gale for admittance and when at last he managed to enter it was with an instantaneous clatter and a bang as though he had been fired through the wood He stood within holding on to the handle The steering gear leaked steam and in the confined space the glass of the binnacle made a shiny oval of light in a thin white fog The wind howled hummed whistled with sudden booming gusts that rattled the doors and shutters in the vicious patter of sprays Two coils of lead line and a small canvas bag hung on a long lanyard swung wide off and came back clinging to the bulkheads The gratings underfoot were nearly afloat with every sweeping blow of a sea water squirted violently through the cracks all round the door and the man at the helm had flung down his cap his coat and stood propped against the gear casing in a striped cotton shirt open on his breast The little brass wheel in his hands had the appearance of a bright and fragile toy The cords of his neck stood hard and lean a dark patch lay in the hollow of his throat and his face was still and sunken as in death Captain MacWhirr wiped his eyes The sea that had nearly taken him overboard had to his great annoyance washed his sou wester hat off his bald head The fluffy fair hair soaked and darkened resembled a mean skein of cotton threads festooned round his bare skull His face glistening with sea water had been made crimson with the wind with the sting of sprays He looked as though he had come off sweating from before a furnace You here he muttered heavily The second mate had found his way into the wheelhouse some time before He had fixed himself in a corner with his knees up a fist pressed against each temple and this attitude suggested rage sorrow resignation surrender with a sort of concentrated unforgiveness He said mournfully and defiantly Well it s my watch below now ain t it The steam gear clattered stopped clattered again and the helmsman s eyeballs seemed to project out of a hungry face as if the compass card behind the binnacle glass had been meat God knows how long he had been left there to steer as if forgotten by all his shipmates The bells had not been struck there had been no reliefs the ship s routine had gone down wind but he was trying to keep her head north north east The rudder might have been gone for all he knew the fires out the engines broken down the ship ready to roll over like a corpse He was anxious not to get muddled and lose control of her head because the compass card swung far both ways wriggling on the pivot and sometimes seemed to whirl right round He suffered from mental stress He was horribly afraid also of the wheelhouse going Mountains of water kept on tumbling against it When the ship took one of her desperate dives the corners of his lips twitched Captain MacWhirr looked up at the wheelhouse clock Screwed to the bulk head it had a white face on which the black hands appeared to stand quite still It was half past one in the morning Another day he muttered to himself The second mate heard him and lifting his head as one grieving amongst ruins You won t see it break he exclaimed His wrists and his knees could be seen to shake violently No by God You won t He took his face again between his fists The body of the helmsman had moved slightly but his head didn t budge on his neck like a stone head fixed to look one way from a column During a roll that all but took his booted legs from under him and in the very stagger to save himself Captain MacWhirr said austerely Don t you pay any attention to what that man says And then with an indefinable change of tone very grave he added He isn t on duty The sailor said nothing The hurricane boomed shaking the little place which seemed air tight and the light of the binnacle flickered all the time You haven t been relieved Captain MacWhirr went on looking down I want you to stick to the helm though as long as you can You ve got the hang of her Another man coming here might make a mess of it Wouldn t do No child s play And the hands are probably busy with a job down below Think you can The steering gear leaped into an abrupt short clatter stopped smouldering like an ember and the still man with a motionless gaze burst out as if all the passion in him had gone into his lips By Heavens sir I can steer for ever if nobody talks to me Oh aye All right The Captain lifted his eyes for the first time to the man Hackett And he seemed to dismiss this matter from his mind He stooped to the engine room speaking tube blew in and bent his head mister Rout below answered and at once Captain MacWhirr put his lips to the mouthpiece With the uproar of the gale around him he applied alternately his lips and his ear and the engineer s voice mounted to him harsh and as if out of the heat of an engagement One of the stokers was disabled the others had given in the second engineer and the donkey man were firing up The third engineer was standing by the steam valve The engines were being tended by hand How was it above Bad enough It mostly rests with you said Captain MacWhirr Was the mate down there yet No Well he would be presently Would mister Rout let him talk through the speaking tube through the deck speaking tube because he the Captain was going out again on the bridge directly There was some trouble amongst the Chinamen They were fighting it seemed Couldn t allow fighting anyhow mister Rout had gone away and Captain MacWhirr could feel against his ear the pulsation of the engines like the beat of the ship s heart mister Rout s voice down there shouted something distantly The ship pitched headlong the pulsation leaped with a hissing tumult and stopped dead Captain MacWhirr s face was impassive and his eyes were fixed aimlessly on the crouching shape of the second mate Again mister Rout s voice cried out in the depths and the pulsating beats recommenced with slow strokes growing swifter mister Rout had returned to the tube It don t matter much what they do he said hastily and then with irritation She takes these dives as if she never meant to come up again Awful sea said the Captain s voice from above Don t let me drive her under barked Solomon Rout up the pipe Dark and rain Can t see what s coming uttered the voice Must keep her moving enough to steer and chance it it went on to state distinctly I am doing as much as I dare We are getting smashed up a good deal up here proceeded the voice mildly Doing fairly well though Of course if the wheelhouse should go mister Rout bending an attentive ear muttered peevishly something under his breath But the deliberate voice up there became animated to ask Jukes turned up yet Then after a short wait I wish he would bear a hand I want him to be done and come up here in case of anything To look after the ship I am all alone The second mate s lost What shouted mister Rout into the engine room taking his head away Then up the tube he cried Gone overboard and clapped his ear to Lost his nerve the voice from above continued in a matter of fact tone Damned awkward circumstance mister Rout listening with bowed neck opened his eyes wide at this However he heard something like the sounds of a scuffle and broken exclamations coming down to him He strained his hearing and all the time Beale the third engineer with his arms uplifted held between the palms of his hands the rim of a little black wheel projecting at the side of a big copper pipe He seemed to be poising it above his head as though it were a correct attitude in some sort of game To steady himself he pressed his shoulder against the white bulkhead one knee bent and a sweat rag tucked in his belt hanging on his hip His smooth cheek was begrimed and flushed and the coal dust on his eyelids like the black pencilling of a make up enhanced the liquid brilliance of the whites giving to his youthful face something of a feminine exotic and fascinating aspect When the ship pitched he would with hasty movements of his hands screw hard at the little wheel Gone crazy began the Captain s voice suddenly in the tube Rushed at me Just now Had to knock him down This minute You heard mister Rout The devil muttered mister Rout Look out Beale His shout rang out like the blast of a warning trumpet between the iron walls of the engine room Painted white they rose high into the dusk of the skylight sloping like a roof and the whole lofty space resembled the interior of a monument divided by floors of iron grating with lights flickering at different levels and a mass of gloom lingering in the middle within the columnar stir of machinery under the motionless swelling of the cylinders A loud and wild resonance made up of all the noises of the hurricane dwelt in the still warmth of the air There was in it the smell of hot metal of oil and a slight mist of steam The blows of the sea seemed to traverse it in an unringing stunning shock from side to side Gleams like pale long flames trembled upon the polish of metal from the flooring below the enormous crank heads emerged in their turns with a flash of brass and steel going over while the connecting rods big jointed like skeleton limbs seemed to thrust them down and pull them up again with an irresistible precision And deep in the half light other rods dodged deliberately to and fro crossheads nodded discs of metal rubbed smoothly against each other slow and gentle in a commingling of shadows and gleams Sometimes all those powerful and unerring movements would slow down simultaneously as if they had been the functions of a living organism stricken suddenly by the blight of languor and mister Rout s eyes would blaze darker in his long sallow face He was fighting this fight in a pair of carpet slippers A short shiny jacket barely covered his loins and his white wrists protruded far out of the tight sleeves as though the emergency had added to his stature had lengthened his limbs augmented his pallor hollowed his eyes He moved climbing high up disappearing low down with a restless purposeful industry and when he stood still holding the guard rail in front of the starting gear he would keep glancing to the right at the steam gauge at the water gauge fixed upon the white wall in the light of a swaying lamp The mouths of two speaking tubes gaped stupidly at his elbow and the dial of the engine room telegraph resembled a clock of large diameter bearing on its face curt words instead of figures The grouped letters stood out heavily black around the pivot head of the indicator emphatically symbolic of loud exclamations AHEAD ASTERN SLOW Half STAND BY and the fat black hand pointed downwards to the word FULL which thus singled out captured the eye as a sharp cry secures attention The wood encased bulk of the low pressure cylinder frowning portly from above emitted a faint wheeze at every thrust and except for that low hiss the engines worked their steel limbs headlong or slow with a silent determined smoothness And all this the white walls the moving steel the floor plates under Solomon Rout s feet the floors of iron grating above his head the dusk and the gleams uprose and sank continuously with one accord upon the harsh wash of the waves against the ship s side The whole loftiness of the place booming hollow to the great voice of the wind swayed at the top like a tree would go over bodily as if borne down this way and that by the tremendous blasts You ve got to hurry up shouted mister Rout as soon as he saw Jukes appear in the stokehold doorway Jukes glance was wandering and tipsy his red face was puffy as though he had overslept himself He had had an arduous road and had travelled over it with immense vivacity the agitation of his mind corresponding to the exertions of his body He had rushed up out of the bunker stumbling in the dark alleyway amongst a lot of bewildered men who trod upon asked What s up sir in awed mutters all round him down the stokehold ladder missing many iron rungs in his hurry down into a place deep as a well black as Tophet tipping over back and forth like a see saw The water in the bilges thundered at each roll and lumps of coal skipped to and fro from end to end rattling like an avalanche of pebbles on a slope of iron Somebody in there moaned with pain and somebody else could be seen crouching over what seemed the prone body of a dead man a lusty voice blasphemed and the glow under each fire door was like a pool of flaming blood radiating quietly in a velvety blackness A gust of wind struck upon the nape of Jukes neck and next moment he felt it streaming about his wet ankles The stokehold ventilators hummed in front of the six fire doors two wild figures stripped to the waist staggered and stooped wrestling with two shovels Hallo Plenty of draught now yelled the second engineer at once as though he had been all the time looking out for Jukes The donkeyman a dapper little chap with a dazzling fair skin and a tiny gingery moustache worked in a sort of mute transport They were keeping a full head of steam and a profound rumbling as of an empty furniture van trotting over a bridge made a sustained bass to all the other noises of the place Blowing off all the time went on yelling the second With a sound as of a hundred scoured saucepans the orifice of a ventilator spat upon his shoulder a sudden gush of salt water and he volleyed a stream of curses upon all things on earth including his own soul ripping and raving and all the time attending to his business With a sharp clash of metal the ardent pale glare of the fire opened upon his bullet head showing his spluttering lips his insolent face and with another clang closed like the white hot wink of an iron eye Where s the blooming ship Can you tell me blast my eyes Under water or what It s coming down here in tons Are the condemned cowls gone to Hades Hey Don t you know anything you jolly sailor man you Jukes after a bewildered moment had been helped by a roll to dart through and as soon as his eyes took in the comparative vastness peace and brilliance of the engine room the ship setting her stern heavily in the water sent him charging head down upon mister Rout The chief s arm long like a tentacle and straightening as if worked by a spring went out to meet him and deflected his rush into a spin towards the speaking tubes At the same time mister Rout repeated earnestly You ve got to hurry up whatever it is Jukes yelled Are you there sir and listened Nothing Suddenly the roar of the wind fell straight into his ear but presently a small voice shoved aside the shouting hurricane quietly You Jukes Well Jukes was ready to talk it was only time that seemed to be wanting It was easy enough to account for everything He could perfectly imagine the coolies battened down in the reeking tween deck lying sick and scared between the rows of chests Then one of these chests or perhaps several at once breaking loose in a roll knocking out others sides splitting lids flying open and all these clumsy Chinamen rising up in a body to save their property Afterwards every fling of the ship would hurl that tramping yelling mob here and there from side to side in a whirl of smashed wood torn clothing rolling dollars A struggle once started they would be unable to stop themselves Nothing could stop them now except main force It was a disaster He had seen it and that was all he could say Some of them must be dead he believed The rest would go on fighting He sent up his words tripping over each other crowding the narrow tube They mounted as if into a silence of an enlightened comprehension dwelling alone up there with a storm And Jukes wanted to be dismissed from the face of that odious trouble intruding on the great need of the ship V He waited Before his eyes the engines turned with slow labour that in the moment of going off into a mad fling would stop dead at mister Rout s shout Look out Beale They paused in an intelligent immobility stilled in mid stroke a heavy crank arrested on the cant as if conscious of danger and the passage of time Then with a Now then from the chief and the sound of a breath expelled through clenched teeth they would accomplish the interrupted revolution and begin another There was the prudent sagacity of wisdom and the deliberation of enormous strength in their movements This was their work this patient coaxing of a distracted ship over the fury of the waves and into the very eye of the wind At times mister Rout s chin would sink on his breast and he watched them with knitted eyebrows as if lost in thought The voice that kept the hurricane out of Jukes ear began Take the hands with you and left off unexpectedly What could I do with them sir A harsh abrupt imperious clang exploded suddenly The three pairs of eyes flew up to the telegraph dial to see the hand jump from FULL to STOP as if snatched by a devil And then these three men in the engineroom had the intimate sensation of a check upon the ship of a strange shrinking as if she had gathered herself for a desperate leap Stop her bellowed mister Rout Nobody not even Captain MacWhirr who alone on deck had caught sight of a white line of foam coming on at such a height that he couldn t believe his eyes nobody was to know the steepness of that sea and the awful depth of the hollow the hurricane had scooped out behind the running wall of water It raced to meet the ship and with a pause as of girding the loins the Nan Shan lifted her bows and leaped The flames in all the lamps sank darkening the engine room One went out With a tearing crash and a swirling raving tumult tons of water fell upon the deck as though the ship had darted under the foot of a cataract Down there they looked at each other stunned Swept from end to end by God bawled Jukes She dipped into the hollow straight down as if going over the edge of the world The engine room toppled forward menacingly like the inside of a tower nodding in an earthquake An awful racket of iron things falling came from the stokehold She hung on this appalling slant long enough for Beale to drop on his hands and knees and begin to crawl as if he meant to fly on all fours out of the engine room and for mister Rout to turn his head slowly rigid cavernous with the lower jaw dropping Jukes had shut his eyes and his face in a moment became hopelessly blank and gentle like the face of a blind man At last she rose slowly staggering as if she had to lift a mountain with her bows mister Rout shut his mouth Jukes blinked and little Beale stood up hastily Another one like this and that s the last of her cried the chief He and Jukes looked at each other and the same thought came into their heads The Captain Everything must have been swept away Steering gear gone ship like a log All over directly Rush ejaculated mister Rout thickly glaring with enlarged doubtful eyes at Jukes who answered him by an irresolute glance The clang of the telegraph gong soothed them instantly The black hand dropped in a flash from STOP to FULL Now then Beale cried mister Rout The steam hissed low The piston rods slid in and out Jukes put his ear to the tube The voice was ready for him It said Pick up all the money Bear a hand now I ll want you up here And that was all Sir called up Jukes There was no answer He staggered away like a defeated man from the field of battle He had got in some way or other a cut above his left eyebrow a cut to the bone He was not aware of it in the least quantities of the China Sea large enough to break his neck for him had gone over his head had cleaned washed and salted that wound It did not bleed but only gaped red and this gash over the eye his dishevelled hair the disorder of his clothes gave him the aspect of a man worsted in a fight with fists Got to pick up the dollars He appealed to mister Rout smiling pitifully at random What s that asked mister Rout wildly Pick up I don t care Then quivering in every muscle but with an exaggeration of paternal tone Go away now for God s sake You deck people ll drive me silly There s that second mate been going for the old man Don t you know You fellows are going wrong for want of something to do At these words Jukes discovered in himself the beginnings of anger Want of something to do indeed Full of hot scorn against the chief he turned to go the way he had come In the stokehold the plump donkeyman toiled with his shovel mutely as if his tongue had been cut out but the second was carrying on like a noisy undaunted maniac who had preserved his skill in the art of stoking under a marine boiler Hallo you wandering officer Hey Can t you get some of your slush slingers to wind up a few of them ashes I am getting choked with them here Curse it Hallo Hey Remember the articles Sailors and firemen to assist each other Hey D ye hear Jukes was climbing out frantically and the other lifting up his face after him howled Can t you speak What are you poking about here for What s your game anyhow A frenzy possessed Jukes By the time he was back amongst the men in the darkness of the alleyway he felt ready to wring all their necks at the slightest sign of hanging back The very thought of it exasperated him He couldn t hang back They shouldn t The impetuosity with which he came amongst them carried them along They had already been excited and startled at all his comings and goings by the fierceness and rapidity of his movements and more felt than seen in his rushes he appeared formidable busied with matters of life and death that brooked no delay At his first word he heard them drop into the bunker one after another obediently with heavy thumps They were not clear as to what would have to be done What is it What is it they were asking each other The boatswain tried to explain the sounds of a great scuffle surprised them and the mighty shocks reverberating awfully in the black bunker kept them in mind of their danger When the boatswain threw open the door it seemed that an eddy of the hurricane stealing through the iron sides of the ship had set all these bodies whirling like dust there came to them a confused uproar a tempestuous tumult a fierce mutter gusts of screams dying away and the tramping of feet mingling with the blows of the sea For a moment they glared amazed blocking the doorway Jukes pushed through them brutally He said nothing and simply darted in Another lot of coolies on the ladder struggling suicidally to break through the battened hatch to a swamped deck fell off as before and he disappeared under them like a man overtaken by a landslide The boatswain yelled excitedly Come along Get the mate out He ll be trampled to death Come on They charged in stamping on breasts on fingers on faces catching their feet in heaps of clothing kicking broken wood but before they could get hold of him Jukes emerged waist deep in a multitude of clawing hands In the instant he had been lost to view all the buttons of his jacket had gone its back had got split up to the collar his waistcoat had been torn open The central struggling mass of Chinamen went over to the roll dark indistinct helpless with a wild gleam of many eyes in the dim light of the lamps Leave me alone damn you I am all right screeched Jukes Drive them forward Watch your chance when she pitches Forward with em Drive them against the bulkhead Jam em up The rush of the sailors into the seething tween deck was like a splash of cold water into a boiling cauldron The commotion sank for a moment The bulk of Chinamen were locked in such a compact scrimmage that linking their arms and aided by an appalling dive of the ship the seamen sent it forward in one great shove like a solid block Behind their backs small clusters and loose bodies tumbled from side to side The boatswain performed prodigious feats of strength With his long arms open and each great paw clutching at a stanchion he stopped the rush of seven entwined Chinamen rolling like a boulder His joints cracked he said Ha and they flew apart But the carpenter showed the greater intelligence Without saying a word to anybody he went back into the alleyway to fetch several coils of cargo gear he had seen there chain and rope With these life lines were rigged There was really no resistance The struggle however it began had turned into a scramble of blind panic If the coolies had started up after their scattered dollars they were by that time fighting only for their footing They took each other by the throat merely to save themselves from being hurled about Whoever got a hold anywhere would kick at the others who caught at his legs and hung on till a roll sent them flying together across the deck The coming of the white devils was a terror Had they come to kill The individuals torn out of the ruck became very limp in the seamen s hands some dragged aside by the heels were passive like dead bodies with open fixed eyes Here and there a coolie would fall on his knees as if begging for mercy several whom the excess of fear made unruly were hit with hard fists between the eyes and cowered while those who were hurt submitted to rough handling blinking rapidly without a plaint Faces streamed with blood there were raw places on the shaven heads scratches bruises torn wounds gashes The broken porcelain out of the chests was mostly responsible for the latter Here and there a Chinaman wild eyed with his tail unplaited nursed a bleeding sole They had been ranged closely after having been shaken into submission cuffed a little to allay excitement addressed in gruff words of encouragement that sounded like promises of evil They sat on the deck in ghastly drooping rows and at the end the carpenter with two hands to help him moved busily from place to place setting taut and hitching the life lines The boatswain with one leg and one arm embracing a stanchion struggled with a lamp pressed to his breast trying to get a light and growling all the time like an industrious gorilla The figures of seamen stooped repeatedly with the movements of gleaners and everything was being flung into the bunker clothing smashed wood broken china and the dollars too gathered up in men s jackets Now and then a sailor would stagger towards the doorway with his arms full of rubbish and dolorous slanting eyes followed his movements With every roll of the ship the long rows of sitting Celestials would sway forward brokenly and her headlong dives knocked together the line of shaven polls from end to end When the wash of water rolling on the deck died away for a moment it seemed to Jukes yet quivering from his exertions that in his mad struggle down there he had overcome the wind somehow that a silence had fallen upon the ship a silence in which the sea struck thunderously at her sides Everything had been cleared out of the tween deck all the wreckage as the men said They stood erect and tottering above the level of heads and drooping shoulders Here and there a coolie sobbed for his breath Where the high light fell Jukes could see the salient ribs of one the yellow wistful face of another bowed necks or would meet a dull stare directed at his face He was amazed that there had been no corpses but the lot of them seemed at their last gasp and they appeared to him more pitiful than if they had been all dead Suddenly one of the coolies began to speak The light came and went on his lean straining face he threw his head up like a baying hound From the bunker came the sounds of knocking and the tinkle of some dollars rolling loose he stretched out his arm his mouth yawned black and the incomprehensible guttural hooting sounds that did not seem to belong to a human language penetrated Jukes with a strange emotion as if a brute had tried to be eloquent Two more started mouthing what seemed to Jukes fierce denunciations the others stirred with grunts and growls Jukes ordered the hands out of the tweendecks hurriedly He left last himself backing through the door while the grunts rose to a loud murmur and hands were extended after him as after a malefactor The boatswain shot the bolt and remarked uneasily Seems as if the wind had dropped sir The seamen were glad to get back into the alleyway Secretly each of them thought that at the last moment he could rush out on deck and that was a comfort There is something horribly repugnant in the idea of being drowned under a deck Now they had done with the Chinamen they again became conscious of the ship s position Jukes on coming out of the alleyway found himself up to the neck in the noisy water He gained the bridge and discovered he could detect obscure shapes as if his sight had become preternaturally acute He saw faint outlines They recalled not the familiar aspect of the Nan Shan but something remembered an old dismantled steamer he had seen years ago rotting on a mudbank She recalled that wreck There was no wind not a breath except the faint currents created by the lurches of the ship The smoke tossed out of the funnel was settling down upon her deck He breathed it as he passed forward He felt the deliberate throb of the engines and heard small sounds that seemed to have survived the great uproar the knocking of broken fittings the rapid tumbling of some piece of wreckage on the bridge He perceived dimly the squat shape of his captain holding on to a twisted bridge rail motionless and swaying as if rooted to the planks The unexpected stillness of the air oppressed Jukes We have done it sir he gasped Thought you would said Captain MacWhirr Did you murmured Jukes to himself Wind fell all at once went on the Captain Jukes burst out If you think it was an easy job But his captain clinging to the rail paid no attention According to the books the worst is not over yet If most of them hadn t been half dead with seasickness and fright not one of us would have come out of that tween deck alive said Jukes Had to do what s fair by them mumbled MacWhirr stolidly You don t find everything in books Why I believe they would have risen on us if I hadn t ordered the hands out of that pretty quick continued Jukes with warmth After the whisper of their shouts their ordinary tones so distinct rang out very loud to their ears in the amazing stillness of the air It seemed to them they were talking in a dark and echoing vault Through a jagged aperture in the dome of clouds the light of a few stars fell upon the black sea rising and falling confusedly Sometimes the head of a watery cone would topple on board and mingle with the rolling flurry of foam on the swamped deck and the Nan Shan wallowed heavily at the bottom of a circular cistern of clouds This ring of dense vapours gyrating madly round the calm of the centre encompassed the ship like a motionless and unbroken wall of an aspect inconceivably sinister Within the sea as if agitated by an internal commotion leaped in peaked mounds that jostled each other slapping heavily against her sides and a low moaning sound the infinite plaint of the storm s fury came from beyond the limits of the menacing calm Captain MacWhirr remained silent and Jukes ready ear caught suddenly the faint long drawn roar of some immense wave rushing unseen under that thick blackness which made the appalling boundary of his vision Of course he started resentfully they thought we had caught at the chance to plunder them Of course You said pick up the money Easier said than done They couldn t tell what was in our heads We came in smash right into the middle of them Had to do it by a rush As long as it s done mumbled the Captain without attempting to look at Jukes Had to do what s fair We shall find yet there s the devil to pay when this is over said Jukes feeling very sore Let them only recover a bit and you ll see They will fly at our throats sir Don t forget sir she isn t a British ship now These brutes know it well too The damned Siamese flag We are on board all the same remarked Captain MacWhirr The trouble s not over yet insisted Jukes prophetically reeling and catching on She s a wreck he added faintly The trouble s not over yet assented Captain MacWhirr half aloud Look out for her a minute Are you going off the deck sir asked Jukes hurriedly as if the storm were sure to pounce upon him as soon as he had been left alone with the ship He watched her battered and solitary labouring heavily in a wild scene of mountainous black waters lit by the gleams of distant worlds She moved slowly breathing into the still core of the hurricane the excess of her strength in a white cloud of steam and the deep toned vibration of the escape was like the defiant trumpeting of a living creature of the sea impatient for the renewal of the contest It ceased suddenly The still air moaned Above Jukes head a few stars shone into a pit of black vapours The inky edge of the cloud disc frowned upon the ship under the patch of glittering sky The stars too seemed to look at her intently as if for the last time and the cluster of their splendour sat like a diadem on a lowering brow Captain MacWhirr had gone into the chart room There was no light there but he could feel the disorder of that place where he used to live tidily His armchair was upset The books had tumbled out on the floor he scrunched a piece of glass under his boot He groped for the matches and found a box on a shelf with a deep ledge He struck one and puckering the corners of his eyes held out the little flame towards the barometer whose glittering top of glass and metals nodded at him continuously It stood very low incredibly low so low that Captain MacWhirr grunted The match went out and hurriedly he extracted another with thick stiff fingers Again a little flame flared up before the nodding glass and metal of the top His eyes looked at it narrowed with attention as if expecting an imperceptible sign With his grave face he resembled a booted and misshapen pagan burning incense before the oracle of a Joss There was no mistake It was the lowest reading he had ever seen in his life Captain MacWhirr emitted a low whistle He forgot himself till the flame diminished to a blue spark burnt his fingers and vanished Perhaps something had gone wrong with the thing There was an aneroid glass screwed above the couch He turned that way struck another match and discovered the white face of the other instrument looking at him from the bulkhead meaningly not to be gainsaid as though the wisdom of men were made unerring by the indifference of matter There was no room for doubt now Captain MacWhirr pshawed at it and threw the match down The worst was to come then and if the books were right this worst would be very bad The experience of the last six hours had enlarged his conception of what heavy weather could be like It ll be terrific he pronounced mentally He had not consciously looked at anything by the light of the matches except at the barometer and yet somehow he had seen that his water bottle and the two tumblers had been flung out of their stand It seemed to give him a more intimate knowledge of the tossing the ship had gone through I wouldn t have believed it he thought And his table had been cleared too his rulers his pencils the inkstand all the things that had their safe appointed places they were gone as if a mischievous hand had plucked them out one by one and flung them on the wet floor The hurricane had broken in upon the orderly arrangements of his privacy This had never happened before and the feeling of dismay reached the very seat of his composure And the worst was to come yet He was glad the trouble in the tween deck had been discovered in time If the ship had to go after all then at least she wouldn t be going to the bottom with a lot of people in her fighting teeth and claw That would have been odious And in that feeling there was a humane intention and a vague sense of the fitness of things These instantaneous thoughts were yet in their essence heavy and slow partaking of the nature of the man He extended his hand to put back the matchbox in its corner of the shelf There were always matches there by his order The steward had his instructions impressed upon him long before A box just there see Not so very full where I can put my hand on it steward Might want a light in a hurry Can t tell on board ship what you might want in a hurry Mind now And of course on his side he would be careful to put it back in its place scrupulously He did so now but before he removed his hand it occurred to him that perhaps he would never have occasion to use that box any more The vividness of the thought checked him and for an infinitesimal fraction of a second his fingers closed again on the small object as though it had been the symbol of all these little habits that chain us to the weary round of life He released it at last and letting himself fall on the settee listened for the first sounds of returning wind Not yet He heard only the wash of water the heavy splashes the dull shocks of the confused seas boarding his ship from all sides She would never have a chance to clear her decks But the quietude of the air was startlingly tense and unsafe like a slender hair holding a sword suspended over his head By this awful pause the storm penetrated the defences of the man and unsealed his lips He spoke out in the solitude and the pitch darkness of the cabin as if addressing another being awakened within his breast I shouldn t like to lose her he said half aloud He sat unseen apart from the sea from his ship isolated as if withdrawn from the very current of his own existence where such freaks as talking to himself surely had no place His palms reposed on his knees he bowed his short neck and puffed heavily surrendering to a strange sensation of weariness he was not enlightened enough to recognize for the fatigue of mental stress From where he sat he could reach the door of a washstand locker There should have been a towel there There was Good He took it out wiped his face and afterwards went on rubbing his wet head He towelled himself with energy in the dark and then remained motionless with the towel on his knees A moment passed of a stillness so profound that no one could have guessed there was a man sitting in that cabin Then a murmur arose She may come out of it yet When Captain MacWhirr came out on deck which he did brusquely as though he had suddenly become conscious of having stayed away too long the calm had lasted already more than fifteen minutes long enough to make itself intolerable even to his imagination Jukes motionless on the forepart of the bridge began to speak at once His voice blank and forced as though he were talking through hard set teeth seemed to flow away on all sides into the darkness deepening again upon the sea I had the wheel relieved Hackett began to sing out that he was done He s lying in there alongside the steering gear with a face like death At first I couldn t get anybody to crawl out and relieve the poor devil That boss n s worse than no good I always said Thought I would have had to go myself and haul out one of them by the neck Ah well muttered the Captain He stood watchful by Jukes side The second mate s in there too holding his head Is he hurt sir No crazy said Captain MacWhirr curtly Looks as if he had a tumble though I had to give him a push explained the Captain Jukes gave an impatient sigh It will come very sudden said Captain MacWhirr and from over there I fancy God only knows though These books are only good to muddle your head and make you jumpy It will be bad and there s an end If we only can steam her round in time to meet it A minute passed Some of the stars winked rapidly and vanished You left them pretty safe began the Captain abruptly as though the silence were unbearable Are you thinking of the coolies sir I rigged lifelines all ways across that tween deck Did you Good idea mister Jukes I didn t think you cared to know said Jukes the lurching of the ship cut his speech as though somebody had been jerking him around while he talked how I got on with that infernal job We did it And it may not matter in the end Had to do what s fair for all they are only Chinamen Give them the same chance with ourselves hang it all She isn t lost yet Bad enough to be shut up below in a gale That s what I thought when you gave me the job sir interjected Jukes moodily without being battered to pieces pursued Captain MacWhirr with rising vehemence Couldn t let that go on in my ship if I knew she hadn t five minutes to live Couldn t bear it mister Jukes A hollow echoing noise like that of a shout rolling in a rocky chasm approached the ship and went away again The last star blurred enlarged as if returning to the fiery mist of its beginning struggled with the colossal depth of blackness hanging over the ship and went out Now for it muttered Captain MacWhirr mister Jukes Here sir The two men were growing indistinct to each other We must trust her to go through it and come out on the other side That s plain and straight There s no room for Captain Wilson s storm strategy here No sir She will be smothered and swept again for hours mumbled the Captain There s not much left by this time above deck for the sea to take away unless you or me Both sir whispered Jukes breathlessly You are always meeting trouble half way Jukes Captain MacWhirr remonstrated quaintly Though it s a fact that the second mate is no good D ye hear mister Jukes You would be left alone if Captain MacWhirr interrupted himself and Jukes glancing on all sides remained silent Don t you be put out by anything the Captain continued mumbling rather fast Keep her facing it They may say what they like but the heaviest seas run with the wind Facing it always facing it that s the way to get through You are a young sailor Face it That s enough for any man Keep a cool head Yes sir said Jukes with a flutter of the heart In the next few seconds the Captain spoke to the engine room and got an answer For some reason Jukes experienced an access of confidence a sensation that came from outside like a warm breath and made him feel equal to every demand The distant muttering of the darkness stole into his ears He noted it unmoved out of that sudden belief in himself as a man safe in a shirt of mail would watch a point The ship laboured without intermission amongst the black hills of water paying with this hard tumbling the price of her life She rumbled in her depths shaking a white plummet of steam into the night and Jukes thought skimmed like a bird through the engine room where mister Rout good man was ready When the rumbling ceased it seemed to him that there was a pause of every sound a dead pause in which Captain MacWhirr s voice rang out startlingly What s that A puff of wind it spoke much louder than Jukes had ever heard it before On the bow That s right She may come out of it yet The mutter of the winds drew near apace In the forefront could be distinguished a drowsy waking plaint passing on and far off the growth of a multiple clamour marching and expanding There was the throb as of many drums in it a vicious rushing note and like the chant of a tramping multitude Jukes could no longer see his captain distinctly The darkness was absolutely piling itself upon the ship At most he made out movements a hint of elbows spread out of a head thrown up Captain MacWhirr was trying to do up the top button of his oilskin coat with unwonted haste The hurricane with its power to madden the seas to sink ships to uproot trees to overturn strong walls and dash the very birds of the air to the ground had found this taciturn man in its path and doing its utmost had managed to wring out a few words Before the renewed wrath of winds swooped on his ship Captain MacWhirr was moved to declare in a tone of vexation as it were I wouldn t like to lose her He was spared that annoyance VI On A bright sunshiny day with the breeze chasing her smoke far ahead the Nan Shan came into Fu chau Her arrival was at once noticed on shore and the seamen in harbour said Look Look at that steamer What s that Siamese isn t she Just look at her She seemed indeed to have been used as a running target for the secondary batteries of a cruiser A hail of minor shells could not have given her upper works a more broken torn and devastated aspect and she had about her the worn weary air of ships coming from the far ends of the world and indeed with truth for in her short passage she had been very far sighting verily even the coast of the Great Beyond whence no ship ever returns to give up her crew to the dust of the earth She was incrusted and gray with salt to the trucks of her masts and to the top of her funnel as though as some facetious seaman said the crowd on board had fished her out somewhere from the bottom of the sea and brought her in here for salvage And further excited by the felicity of his own wit he offered to give five pounds for her as she stands Before she had been quite an hour at rest a meagre little man with a red tipped nose and a face cast in an angry mould landed from a sampan on the quay of the Foreign Concession and incontinently turned to shake his fist at her A tall individual with legs much too thin for a rotund stomach and with watery eyes strolled up and remarked Just left her eh Quick work He wore a soiled suit of blue flannel with a pair of dirty cricketing shoes a dingy gray moustache drooped from his lip and daylight could be seen in two places between the rim and the crown of his hat Hallo what are you doing here asked the ex second mate of the Nan Shan shaking hands hurriedly Standing by for a job chance worth taking got a quiet hint explained the man with the broken hat in jerky apathetic wheezes The second shook his fist again at the Nan Shan There s a fellow there that ain t fit to have the command of a scow he declared quivering with passion while the other looked about listlessly Is there But he caught sight on the quay of a heavy seaman s chest painted brown under a fringed sailcloth cover and lashed with new manila line He eyed it with awakened interest I would talk and raise trouble if it wasn t for that damned Siamese flag Nobody to go to or I would make it hot for him The fraud Told his chief engineer that s another fraud for you I had lost my nerve The greatest lot of ignorant fools that ever sailed the seas No You can t think Got your money all right inquired his seedy acquaintance suddenly Yes Paid me off on board raged the second mate Get your breakfast on shore says he Mean skunk commented the tall man vaguely and passed his tongue on his lips What about having a drink of some sort He struck me hissed the second mate No Struck You don t say The man in blue began to bustle about sympathetically Can t possibly talk here I want to know all about it Struck eh Let s get a fellow to carry your chest I know a quiet place where they have some bottled beer mister Jukes who had been scanning the shore through a pair of glasses informed the chief engineer afterwards that our late second mate hasn t been long in finding a friend A chap looking uncommonly like a bummer I saw them walk away together from the quay The hammering and banging of the needful repairs did not disturb Captain MacWhirr The steward found in the letter he wrote in a tidy chart room passages of such absorbing interest that twice he was nearly caught in the act But missus MacWhirr in the drawing room of the forty pound house stifled a yawn perhaps out of self respect for she was alone She reclined in a plush bottomed and gilt hammock chair near a tiled fireplace with Japanese fans on the mantel and a glow of coals in the grate Lifting her hands she glanced wearily here and there into the many pages It was not her fault they were so prosy so completely uninteresting from My darling wife at the beginning to Your loving husband at the end She couldn t be really expected to understand all these ship affairs She was glad of course to hear from him but she had never asked herself why precisely They are called typhoons The mate did not seem to like it Not in books Couldn t think of letting it go on The paper rustled sharply A calm that lasted more than twenty minutes she read perfunctorily and the next words her thoughtless eyes caught on the top of another page were see you and the children again She had a movement of impatience He was always thinking of coming home He had never had such a good salary before What was the matter now It did not occur to her to turn back overleaf to look She would have found it recorded there that between four and six A M on December twenty fifth Captain MacWhirr did actually think that his ship could not possibly live another hour in such a sea and that he would never see his wife and children again Nobody was to know this his letters got mislaid so quickly nobody whatever but the steward who had been greatly impressed by that disclosure So much so that he tried to give the cook some idea of the narrow squeak we all had by saying solemnly The old man himself had a dam poor opinion of our chance How do you know asked contemptuously the cook an old soldier He hasn t told you maybe Well he did give me a hint to that effect the steward brazened it out Get along with you He will be coming to tell me next jeered the old cook over his shoulder missus MacWhirr glanced farther on the alert Do what s fair Miserable objects Only three with a broken leg each and one Thought had better keep the matter quiet hope to have done the fair thing She let fall her hands No there was nothing more about coming home Must have been merely expressing a pious wish missus MacWhirr s mind was set at ease and a black marble clock priced by the local jeweller at threeL eighteens sixd had a discreet stealthy tick The door flew open and a girl in the long legged short frocked period of existence flung into the room A lot of colourless rather lanky hair was scattered over her shoulders Seeing her mother she stood still and directed her pale prying eyes upon the letter From father murmured missus MacWhirr What have you done with your ribbon The girl put her hands up to her head and pouted He s well continued missus MacWhirr languidly At least I think so He never says She had a little laugh The girl s face expressed a wandering indifference and missus MacWhirr surveyed her with fond pride Go and get your hat she said after a while I am going out to do some shopping There is a sale at Linom s Oh how jolly uttered the child impressively in unexpectedly grave vibrating tones and bounded out of the room It was a fine afternoon with a gray sky and dry sidewalks Outside the draper s missus MacWhirr smiled upon a woman in a black mantle of generous proportions armoured in jet and crowned with flowers blooming falsely above a bilious matronly countenance They broke into a swift little babble of greetings and exclamations both together very hurried as if the street were ready to yawn open and swallow all that pleasure before it could be expressed Behind them the high glass doors were kept on the swing People couldn t pass men stood aside waiting patiently and Lydia was absorbed in poking the end of her parasol between the stone flags missus MacWhirr talked rapidly Thank you very much He s not coming home yet Of course it s very sad to have him away but it s such a comfort to know he keeps so well missus MacWhirr drew breath The climate there agrees with him she added beamingly as if poor MacWhirr had been away touring in China for the sake of his health Neither was the chief engineer coming home yet mister Rout knew too well the value of a good billet Solomon says wonders will never cease cried missus Rout joyously at the old lady in her armchair by the fire mister Rout s mother moved slightly her withered hands lying in black half mittens on her lap The eyes of the engineer s wife fairly danced on the paper That captain of the ship he is in a rather simple man you remember mother has done something rather clever Solomon says Yes my dear said the old woman meekly sitting with bowed silvery head and that air of inward stillness characteristic of very old people who seem lost in watching the last flickers of life I think I remember Solomon Rout Old Sol Father Sol the Chief Rout good man mister Rout the condescending and paternal friend of youth had been the baby of her many children all dead by this time And she remembered him best as a boy of ten long before he went away to serve his apprenticeship in some great engineering works in the North She had seen so little of him since she had gone through so many years that she had now to retrace her steps very far back to recognize him plainly in the mist of time Sometimes it seemed that her daughter in law was talking of some strange man missus Rout junior was disappointed H m H m She turned the page How provoking He doesn t say what it is Says I couldn t understand how much there was in it Fancy What could it be so very clever What a wretched man not to tell us She read on without further remark soberly and at last sat looking into the fire The chief wrote just a word or two of the typhoon but something had moved him to express an increased longing for the companionship of the jolly woman If it hadn t been that mother must be looked after I would send you your passage money to day You could set up a small house out here I would have a chance to see you sometimes then We are not growing younger He s well mother sighed missus Rout rousing herself He always was a strong healthy boy said the old woman placidly But mister Jukes account was really animated and very full His friend in the Western Ocean trade imparted it freely to the other officers of his liner A chap I know writes to me about an extraordinary affair that happened on board his ship in that typhoon you know that we read of in the papers two months ago It s the funniest thing Just see for yourself what he says I ll show you his letter There were phrases in it calculated to give the impression of light hearted indomitable resolution Jukes had written them in good faith for he felt thus when he wrote He described with lurid effect the scenes in the tween deck It struck me in a flash that those confounded Chinamen couldn t tell we weren t a desperate kind of robbers Tisn t good to part the Chinaman from his money if he is the stronger party We need have been desperate indeed to go thieving in such weather but what could these beggars know of us So without thinking of it twice I got the hands away in a jiffy Our work was done that the old man had set his heart on We cleared out without staying to inquire how they felt I am convinced that if they had not been so unmercifully shaken and afraid each individual one of them to stand up we would have been torn to pieces Oh It was pretty complete I can tell you and you may run to and fro across the Pond to the end of time before you find yourself with such a job on your hands After this he alluded professionally to the damage done to the ship and went on thus It was when the weather quieted down that the situation became confoundedly delicate It wasn t made any better by us having been lately transferred to the Siamese flag though the skipper can t see that it makes any difference as long as we are on board he says There are feelings that this man simply hasn t got and there s an end of it You might just as well try to make a bedpost understand But apart from this it is an infernally lonely state for a ship to be going about the China seas with no proper consuls not even a gunboat of her own anywhere nor a body to go to in case of some trouble My notion was to keep these Johnnies under hatches for another fifteen hours or so as we weren t much farther than that from Fu chau We would find there most likely some sort of a man of war and once under her guns we were safe enough for surely any skipper of a man of war English French or Dutch would see white men through as far as row on board goes We could get rid of them and their money afterwards by delivering them to their Mandarin or Taotai or whatever they call these chaps in goggles you see being carried about in sedan chairs through their stinking streets The old man wouldn t see it somehow He wanted to keep the matter quiet He got that notion into his head and a steam windlass couldn t drag it out of him He wanted as little fuss made as possible for the sake of the ship s name and for the sake of the owners for the sake of all concerned says he looking at me very hard It made me angry hot Of course you couldn t keep a thing like that quiet but the chests had been secured in the usual manner and were safe enough for any earthly gale while this had been an altogether fiendish business I couldn t give you even an idea of Meantime I could hardly keep on my feet None of us had a spell of any sort for nearly thirty hours and there the old man sat rubbing his chin rubbing the top of his head and so bothered he didn t even think of pulling his long boots off I hope sir says I you won t be letting them out on deck before we make ready for them in some shape or other Not mind you that I felt very sanguine about controlling these beggars if they meant to take charge A trouble with a cargo of Chinamen is no child s play I was dam tired too I wish said I you would let us throw the whole lot of these dollars down to them and leave them to fight it out amongst themselves while we get a rest Now you talk wild Jukes says he looking up in his slow way that makes you ache all over somehow We must plan out something that would be fair to all parties I had no end of work on hand as you may imagine so I set the hands going and then I thought I would turn in a bit I hadn t been asleep in my bunk ten minutes when in rushes the steward and begins to pull at my leg For God s sake mister Jukes come out Come on deck quick sir Oh do come out The fellow scared all the sense out of me I didn t know what had happened another hurricane or what Could hear no wind The Captain s letting them out Oh he is letting them out Jump on deck sir and save us The chief engineer has just run below for his revolver That s what I understood the fool to say However Father Rout swears he went in there only to get a clean pocket handkerchief Anyhow I made one jump into my trousers and flew on deck aft There was certainly a good deal of noise going on forward of the bridge Four of the hands with the boss n were at work abaft I passed up to them some of the rifles all the ships on the China coast carry in the cabin and led them on the bridge On the way I ran against Old Sol looking startled and sucking at an unlighted cigar Come along I shouted to him We charged the seven of us up to the chart room All was over There stood the old man with his sea boots still drawn up to the hips and in shirt sleeves got warm thinking it out I suppose Bun Hin s dandy clerk at his elbow as dirty as a sweep was still green in the face I could see directly I was in for something What the devil are these monkey tricks mister Jukes asks the old man as angry as ever he could be I tell you frankly it made me lose my tongue For God s sake mister Jukes says he do take away these rifles from the men Somebody s sure to get hurt before long if you don t Damme if this ship isn t worse than Bedlam Look sharp now I want you up here to help me and Bun Hin s Chinaman to count that money You wouldn t mind lending a hand too mister Rout now you are here The more of us the better He had settled it all in his mind while I was having a snooze Had we been an English ship or only going to land our cargo of coolies in an English port like Hong Kong for instance there would have been no end of inquiries and bother claims for damages and so on But these Chinamen know their officials better than we do The hatches had been taken off already and they were all on deck after a night and a day down below It made you feel queer to see so many gaunt wild faces together The beggars stared about at the sky at the sea at the ship as though they had expected the whole thing to have been blown to pieces And no wonder They had had a doing that would have shaken the soul out of a white man But then they say a Chinaman has no soul He has though something about him that is deuced tough There was a fellow amongst others of the badly hurt who had had his eye all but knocked out It stood out of his head the size of half a hen s egg This would have laid out a white man on his back for a month and yet there was that chap elbowing here and there in the crowd and talking to the others as if nothing had been the matter They made a great hubbub amongst themselves and whenever the old man showed his bald head on the foreside of the bridge they would all leave off jawing and look at him from below It seems that after he had done his thinking he made that Bun Hin s fellow go down and explain to them the only way they could get their money back He told me afterwards that all the coolies having worked in the same place and for the same length of time he reckoned he would be doing the fair thing by them as near as possible if he shared all the cash we had picked up equally among the lot You couldn t tell one man s dollars from another s he said and if you asked each man how much money he brought on board he was afraid they would lie and he would find himself a long way short I think he was right there As to giving up the money to any Chinese official he could scare up in Fu chau he said he might just as well put the lot in his own pocket at once for all the good it would be to them I suppose they thought so too We finished the distribution before dark It was rather a sight the sea running high the ship a wreck to look at these Chinamen staggering up on the bridge one by one for their share and the old man still booted and in his shirt sleeves busy paying out at the chartroom door perspiring like anything and now and then coming down sharp on myself or Father Rout about one thing or another not quite to his mind He took the share of those who were disabled himself to them on the No two hatch There were three dollars left over and these went to the three most damaged coolies one to each We turned to afterwards and shovelled out on deck heaps of wet rags all sorts of fragments of things without shape and that you couldn t give a name to and let them settle the ownership themselves This certainly is coming as near as can be to keeping the thing quiet for the benefit of all concerned What s your opinion you pampered mail boat swell The old chief says that this was plainly the only thing that could be done The skipper remarked to me the other day There are things you find nothing about in books I think that he got out of it
