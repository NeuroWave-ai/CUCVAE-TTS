CHAPTER I The Rome Express the direttissimo or most direct was approaching Paris one morning in March when it became known to the occupants of the sleeping car that there was something amiss very much amiss in the car The train was travelling the last stage between Laroche and Paris a run of a hundred miles without a stop It had halted at Laroche for early breakfast and many if not all the passengers had turned out Of those in the sleeping car seven in number six had been seen in the restaurant or about the platform the seventh a lady had not stirred All had reentered their berths to sleep or doze when the train went on but several were on the move as it neared Paris taking their turn at the lavatory calling for water towels making the usual stir of preparation as the end of a journey was at hand There were many calls for the porter yet no porter appeared At last the attendant was found lazy villain asleep snoring loudly stertorously in his little bunk at the end of the car He was roused with difficulty and set about his work in a dull unwilling lethargic way which promised badly for his tips from those he was supposed to serve By degrees all the passengers got dressed all but two the lady in nine and ten who had made no sign as yet and the man who occupied alone a double berth next her numbered seven and eight As it was the porter s duty to call every one and as he was anxious like the rest of his class to get rid of his travellers as soon as possible after arrival he rapped at each of the two closed doors behind which people presumably still slept The lady cried All right but there was no answer from No seven and eight Again and again the porter knocked and called loudly Still meeting with no response he opened the door of the compartment and went in It was now broad daylight No blind was down indeed the one narrow window was open wide and the whole of the interior of the compartment was plainly visible all and everything in it The occupant lay on his bed motionless Sound asleep No not merely asleep the twisted unnatural lie of the limbs the contorted legs the one arm drooping listlessly but stiffly over the side of the berth told of a deeper more eternal sleep The man was dead Dead and not from natural causes One glance at the blood stained bedclothes one look at the gaping wound in the breast at the battered mangled face told the terrible story It was murder murder most foul The victim had been stabbed to the heart With a wild affrighted cry the porter rushed out of the compartment and to the eager questioning of all who crowded round him he could only mutter in confused and trembling accents There there in there Thus the fact of the murder became known to every one by personal inspection for every one even the lady had appeared for just a moment had looked in where the body lay The compartment was filled for some ten minutes or more by an excited gesticulating polyglot mob of half a dozen all talking at once in French English and Italian The first attempt to restore order was made by a tall man middle aged but erect in his bearing with bright eyes and alert manner who took the porter aside and said sharply in good French but with a strong English accent Here it s your business to do something No one has any right to be in that compartment now There may be reasons traces things to remove never mind what But get them all out Be sharp about it and lock the door Remember you will be held responsible to justice The porter shuddered so did many of the passengers who had overheard the Englishman s last words Justice It is not to be trifled with anywhere least of all in France where the uncomfortable superstition prevails that every one who can be reasonably suspected of a crime is held to be guilty of that crime until his innocence is clearly proved All those six passengers and the porter were now brought within the category of the accused They were all open to suspicion they and they alone for the murdered man had been seen alive at Laroche and the fell deed must have been done since then while the train was in transit that is to say going at express speed when no one could leave it except at peril of his life Deuced awkward for us said the tall English general Sir Charles Collingham by name to his brother the parson when he had reentered their compartment and shut the door I can t see it In what way asked the Reverend Silas Collingham a typical English cleric with a rubicund face and square cut white whiskers dressed in a suit of black serge and wearing the professional white tie Why we shall be detained of course arrested probably certainly detained Examined cross examined bully ragged I know something of the French police and their ways If they stop us I shall write to the Times cried his brother by profession a man of peace but with a choleric eye that told of an angry temperament By all means my dear Silas when you get the chance That won t be just yet for I tell you we re in a tight place and may expect a good deal of worry With that he took out his cigarette case and his match box lighted his cigarette and calmly watched the smoke rising with all the coolness of an old campaigner accustomed to encounter and face the ups and downs of life I only hope to goodness they ll run straight on to Paris he added in a fervent tone not unmixed with apprehension No By jingo we re slackening speed Why shouldn t we It s right the conductor or chief of the train or whatever you call him should know what has happened Why man can t you see While the train is travelling express every one must stay on board it if it slows it is possible to leave it Who would want to leave it Oh I don t know said the General rather testily Any way the thing s done now The train had pulled up in obedience to the signal of alarm given by some one in the sleeping car but by whom it was impossible to say Not by the porter for he seemed greatly surprised as the conductor came up to him How did you know he asked Know Know what You stopped me I didn t Who rang the bell then I did not But I m glad you ve come There has been a crime murder Good Heavens cried the conductor jumping up on to the car and entering into the situation at once His business was only to verify the fact and take all necessary precautions He was a burly brusque peremptory person the despotic self important French official who knew what to do as he thought and did it without hesitation or apology No one must leave the car he said in a tone not to be misunderstood Neither now nor on arrival at the station There was a shout of protest and dismay which he quickly cut short You will have to arrange it with the authorities in Paris they can alone decide My duty is plain to detain you place you under surveillance till then Afterwards we will see Enough gentlemen and madame He bowed with the instinctive gallantry of his nation to the female figure which now appeared at the door of her compartment She stood for a moment listening seemingly greatly agitated and then without a word disappeared retreating hastily into her own private room where she shut herself in Almost immediately at a signal from the conductor the train resumed its journey The distance remaining to be traversed was short half an hour more and the Lyons station at Paris was reached where the bulk of the passengers all indeed but the occupants of the sleeper descended and passed through the barriers The latter were again desired to keep their places while a posse of officials came and mounted guard Presently they were told to leave the car one by one but to take nothing with them All their hand bags rugs and belongings were to remain in the berths just as they lay One by one they were marched under escort to a large and bare waiting room which had no doubt been prepared for their reception Here they took their seats on chairs placed at wide intervals apart and were peremptorily forbidden to hold any communication with each other by word or gesture This order was enforced by a fierce looking guard in blue and red uniform who stood facing them with his arms folded gnawing his moustache and frowning severely Last of all the porter was brought in and treated like the passengers but more distinctly as a prisoner He had a guard all to himself and it seemed as though he was the object of peculiar suspicion It had no great effect upon him for while the rest of the party were very plainly sad and a prey to lively apprehension the porter sat dull and unmoved with the stolid sluggish unconcerned aspect of a man just roused from sound sleep and relapsing into slumber who takes little notice of what is passing around Meanwhile the sleeping car with its contents especially the corpse of the victim was shunted into a siding and sentries were placed on it at both ends Seals had been affixed upon the entrance doors so that the interior might be kept inviolate until it could be visited and examined by the Chef de la Surete or Chief of the Detective Service Every one and everything awaited the arrival of this all important functionary CHAPTER II M Flocon the Chief was an early man and he paid a first visit to his office about seven A M He lived just round the corner in the Rue des Arcs and had not far to go to the Prefecture But even now soon after daylight he was correctly dressed as became a responsible ministerial officer He wore a tight frock coat and an immaculate white tie under his arm he carried the regulation portfolio or lawyer s bag stuffed full of reports dispositions and documents dealing with cases in hand He was altogether a very precise and natty little personage quiet and unpretending in demeanour with a mild thoughtful face in which two small ferrety eyes blinked and twinkled behind gold rimmed glasses But when things went wrong when he had to deal with fools or when scent was keen or the enemy near he would become as fierce and eager as any terrier He had just taken his place at his table and begun to arrange his papers which being a man of method he kept carefully sorted by lots each in an old copy of the Figaro when he was called to the telephone His services were greatly needed as we know at the Lyons station and the summons was to the following effect Crime on train No forty five A man murdered in the sleeper All the passengers held Please come at once Most important A fiacre was called instantly and M Flocon accompanied by Galipaud and Block the two first inspectors for duty was driven with all possible speed across Paris He was met outside the station just under the wide verandah by the officials who gave him a brief outline of the facts so far as they were known and as they have already been put before the reader The passengers have been detained asked M Flocon at once Those in the sleeping car only Tut tut they should have been all kept at least until you had taken their names and addresses Who knows what they might not have been able to tell It was suggested that as the crime was committed presumably while the train was in motion only those in the one car could be implicated We should never jump to conclusions said the Chief snappishly Well show me the train card the list of the travellers in the sleeper It cannot be found sir Impossible Why it is the porter s business to deliver it at the end of the journey to his superiors and under the law to us Where is the porter In custody Surely sir but there is something wrong with him So I should think Nothing of this kind could well occur without his knowledge If he was doing his duty unless of course he but let us avoid hasty conjectures He has also lost the passengers tickets which you know he retains till the end of the journey After the catastrophe however he was unable to lay his hand upon his pocket book It contained all his papers Worse and worse There is something behind all this Take me to him Stay can I have a private room close to the other where the prisoners those held on suspicion are It will be necessary to hold investigations take their depositions M le Juge will be here directly M Flocon was soon installed in a room actually communicating with the waiting room and as a preliminary of the first importance taking precedence even of the examination of the sleeping car he ordered the porter to be brought in to answer certain questions The man Ludwig Groote as he presently gave his name thirty two years of age born at Amsterdam looked such a sluggish slouching blear eyed creature that M Flocon began by a sharp rebuke Now Sharp Are you always like this cried the Chief The porter still stared straight before him with lack lustre eyes and made no immediate reply Are you drunk are you Can it be possible he said and in vague reply to a sudden strong suspicion he went on What were you doing between Laroche and Paris Sleeping The man roused himself a little I think I slept I must have slept I was very drowsy I had been up two nights but so it is always and I am not like this generally I do not understand Hah The Chief thought he understood Did you feel this drowsiness before leaving Laroche No monsieur I did not Certainly not I was fresh till then quite fresh Hum exactly I see and the little Chief jumped to his feet and ran round to where the porter stood sheepishly and sniffed and smelt at him Yes yes Sniff sniff sniff the little man danced round and round him then took hold of the porter s head with one hand and with the other turned down his lower eyelid so as to expose the eyeball sniffed a little more and then resumed his seat Exactly And now where is your train card Pardon monsieur I cannot find it That is absurd Where do you keep it Look again search I must have it The porter shook his head hopelessly It is gone monsieur and my pocket book But your papers the tickets Everything was in it monsieur I must have dropped it Strange very strange However the fact was to be recorded for the moment He could of course return to it You can give me the names of the passengers No monsieur Not exactly I cannot remember not enough to distinguish between them Fichtre But this is most devilishly irritating To think that I have to do with a man so stupid such an idiot such an ass At least you know how the berths were occupied how many in each and which persons Yes You can tell me that Well go on By and by we will have the passengers in and you can fix their places after I have ascertained their names Now please For how many was the car Sixteen There were two compartments of four berths each and four of two berths each Stay let us make a plan I will draw it Here now is that right and the Chief held up the rough diagram here shown Illustration Diagram of railroad car Here we have the six compartments Now take a with berths one two three and four Were they all occupied No only two by Englishmen I know that they talked English which I understand a little One was a soldier the other I think a clergyman or priest Good we can verify that directly Now b with berths five and six Who was there One gentleman I don t remember his name But I shall know him by appearance Go on In c two berths seven and eight Also one gentleman It was he who I mean that is where the crime occurred Ah indeed in seven and eight Very well And the next nine and ten A lady Our only lady She came from Rome One moment Where did the rest come from Did any embark on the road No monsieur all the passengers travelled through from Rome The dead man included Was he Roman That I cannot say but he came on board at Rome Very well This lady she was alone In the compartment yes But not altogether I do not understand She had her servant with her In the car No not in the car As a passenger by second class But she came to her mistress sometimes in the car For her service I presume Well yes monsieur when I would permit it But she came a little too often and I was compelled to protest to speak to Madame la Comtesse She was a countess then The maid addressed her by that title That is all I know I heard her When did you see the lady s maid last Last night I think at Amberieux about eight p m Not this morning No sir I am quite sure of that Not at Laroche She did not come on board to stay for the last stage when her mistress would be getting up dressing and likely to require her No I should not have permitted it And where is the maid now d you suppose The porter looked at him with an air of complete imbecility She is surely somewhere near in or about the station She would hardly desert her mistress now he said stupidly at last At any rate we can soon settle that The Chief turned to one of his assistants both of whom had been standing behind him all the time and said Step out Galipaud and see No wait I am nearly as stupid as this simpleton Describe this maid Tall and slight dark eyed very black hair Dressed all in black plain black bonnet I cannot remember more Find her Galipaud keep your eye on her We may want her why I cannot say as she seems disconnected with the event but still she ought to be at hand Then turning to the porter he went on Finish please You said nine and ten was the lady s Well eleven and twelve It was vacant all through the run And the last compartment for four There were two berths occupied both by Frenchmen at least so I judged them They talked French to each other and to me Then now we have them all Stand aside please and I will make the passengers come in We will then determine their places and affix their names from their own admissions Call them in Block one by one CHAPTER III The questions put by M Flocon were much the same in every case and were limited in this early stage of the inquiry to the one point of identity The first who entered was a Frenchman He was a jovial fat faced portly man who answered to the name of Anatole Lafolay and who described himself as a traveller in precious stones The berth he had occupied was No thirteen in compartment f His companion in the berth was a younger man smaller slighter but of much the same stamp His name was Jules Devaux and he was a commission agent His berth had been No fifteen in the same compartment f Both these Frenchmen gave their addresses with the names of many people to whom they were well known and established at once a reputation for respectability which was greatly in their favour The third to appear was the tall gray headed Englishman who had taken a certain lead at the first discovery of the crime He called himself General Sir Charles Collingham an officer of her Majesty s army and the clergyman who shared the compartment was his brother the Reverend Silas Collingham rector of Theakstone Lammas in the county of Norfolk Their berths were numbered one and four in a Before the English General was dismissed he asked whether he was likely to be detained For the present yes replied M Flocon briefly He did not care to be asked questions That under the circumstances was his business Because I should like to communicate with the British Embassy You are known there asked the detective not choosing to believe the story at first It might be a ruse of some sort I know Lord Dufferin personally I was with him in India Also Colonel Papillon the military attache we were in the same regiment If I sent to the Embassy the latter would no doubt come himself How do you propose to send That is for you to decide All I wish is that it should be known that my brother and I are detained under suspicion and incriminated Hardly that Monsieur le General But it shall be as you wish We will telephone from here to the post nearest the Embassy to inform his Excellency Certainly Lord Dufferin and my friend Colonel Papillon Of what has occurred And now if you will permit me to proceed So the single occupant of the compartment b that adjoining the Englishmen was called in He was an Italian by name Natale Ripaldi a dark skinned man with very black hair and a bristling black moustache He wore a long dark cloak of the Inverness order and with the slouch hat he carried in his hand and his downcast secretive look he had the rather conventional aspect of a conspirator If monsieur permits he volunteered to say after the formal questioning was over I can throw some light on this catastrophe And how so pray Did you assist Were you present If so why wait to speak till now said the detective receiving the advance rather coldly It behooved him to be very much on his guard I have had no opportunity till now of addressing any one in authority You are in authority I presume I am the Chief of the Detective Service Then monsieur remember please that I can give some useful information when called upon Now indeed if you will receive it M Flocon was so anxious to approach the inquiry without prejudice that he put up his hand We will wait if you please When M le Juge arrives then perhaps at any rate at a later stage That will do now thank you The Italian s lip curled with a slight indication of contempt at the French detective s methods but he bowed without speaking and went out Last of all the lady appeared in a long sealskin travelling cloak and closely veiled She answered M Flocon s questions in a low tremulous voice as though greatly perturbed She was the Contessa di Castagneto she said an Englishwoman by birth but her husband had been an Italian as the name implied and they resided in Rome He was dead she had been a widow for two or three years and was on her way now to London That will do madame thank you said the detective politely for the present at least Why are we likely to be detained I trust not Her voice became appealing almost piteous Her hands restlessly moving showed how much she was distressed Indeed Madame la Comtesse it must be so I regret it infinitely but until we have gone further into this have elicited some facts arrived at some conclusions But there madame I need not must not say more Oh monsieur I was so anxious to continue my journey Friends are awaiting me in London I do hope I most earnestly beg and entreat you to spare me I am not very strong my health is indifferent Do sir be so good as to release me from As she spoke she raised her veil and showed what no woman wishes to hide least of all when seeking the good will of one of the opposite sex She had a handsome face strikingly so Not even the long journey the fatigue the worries and anxieties which had supervened could rob her of her marvellous beauty She was a brilliant brunette dark skinned but her complexion was of a clear pale olive and as soft as lustrous as pure ivory Her great eyes of a deep velvety brown were saddened by near tears She had rich red lips the only colour in her face and these habitually slightly apart showed pearly white glistening teeth It was difficult to look at this charming woman without being affected by her beauty M Flocon was a Frenchman gallant and impressionable yet he steeled his heart A detective must beware of sentiment and he seemed to see something insidious in this appeal which he resented Madame it is useless he answered gruffly I do not make the law I have only to support it Every good citizen is bound to that I trust I am a good citizen said the Countess with a wan smile but very wearily Still I should wish to be let off now I have suffered greatly terribly by this horrible catastrophe My nerves are quite shattered It is too cruel However I can say no more except to ask that you will let my maid come to me M Flocon still obdurate would not even consent to that I fear madame that for the present at least you cannot be allowed to communicate with any one not even with your maid But she is not implicated she was not in the car I have not seen her since Since repeated M Flocon after a pause Since last night at Amberieux about eight o clock She helped me to undress and saw me to bed I sent her away then and said I should not need her till we reached Paris But I want her now indeed I do She did not come to you at Laroche No Have I not said so The porter here she pointed to the man who stood staring at her from the other side of the table he made difficulties about her being in the car saying that she came too often stayed too long that I must pay for her berth and so on I did not see why I should do that so she stayed away Except from time to time Precisely And the last time was at Amberieux As I have told you and he will tell you the same Thank you madame that will do The Chief rose from his chair plainly intimating that the interview was at an end CHAPTER IV He had other work to do and was eager to get at it So he left Block to show the Countess back to the waiting room and motioning to the porter that he might also go the Chief hastened to the sleeping car the examination of which too long delayed claimed his urgent attention It is the first duty of a good detective to visit the actual theatre of a crime and overhaul it inch by inch seeking searching investigating looking for any even the most insignificant traces of the murderer s hands The sleeping car as I have said had been side tracked its doors were sealed and it was under strict watch and ward But everything of course gave way before the detective and breaking through the seals he walked in making straight for the little room or compartment where the body of the victim still lay untended and absolutely untouched It was a ghastly sight although not new in M Flocon s experience There lay the corpse in the narrow berth just as it had been stricken It was partially undressed wearing only shirt and drawers The former lay open at the chest and showed the gaping wound that had no doubt caused death probably instantaneous death But other blows had been struck there must have been a struggle fierce and embittered as for dear life The savage truculence of the murderer had triumphed but not until he had battered in the face destroying features and rendering recognition almost impossible A knife had given the mortal wound that was at once apparent from the shape of the wound It was the knife too which had gashed and stabbed the face almost wantonly for some of these wounds had not bled and the plain inference was that they had been inflicted after life had sped M Flocon examined the body closely but without disturbing it The police medical officer would wish to see it as it was found The exact position as well as the nature of the wounds might afford evidence as to the manner of death But the Chief looked long and with absorbed concentrated interest at the murdered man noting all he actually saw and conjecturing a good deal more The features of the mutilated face were all but unrecognizable but the hair which was abundant was long black and inclined to curl the black moustache was thick and drooping The shirt was of fine linen the drawers silk On one finger were two good rings the hands were clean the nails well kept and there was every evidence that the man did not live by manual labour He was of the easy cultured class as distinct from the workman or operative This conclusion was borne out by his light baggage which still lay about the berth hat box rugs umbrella brown morocco hand bag All were the property of some one well to do or at least possessed of decent belongings One or two pieces bore a monogram F Q the same as on the shirt and under linen but on the bag was a luggage label with the name Francis Quadling passenger to Paris in full Its owner had apparently no reason to conceal his name More strangely those who had done him to death had been at no pains to remove all traces of his identity M Flocon opened the hand bag seeking for further evidence but found nothing of importance only loose collars cuffs a sponge and slippers two Italian newspapers of an earlier date No money valuables or papers All these had been removed probably and presumably by the perpetrator of the crime Having settled the first preliminary but essential points he next surveyed the whole compartment critically Now for the first time he was struck with the fact that the window was open to its full height Since when was this It was a question to be put presently to the porter and any others who had entered the car but the discovery drew him to examine the window more closely and with good results At the ledge caught on a projecting point on the far side partly in partly out of the car was a morsel of white lace a scrap of feminine apparel although what part or how it had come there was not at once obvious to M Flocon A long and minute inspection of this bit of lace which he was careful not to detach as yet from the place in which he found it showed that it was ragged and frayed and fast caught where it hung It could not have been blown there by any chance air it must have been torn from the article to which it belonged whatever that might be head dress nightcap night dress or handkerchief The lace was of a kind to serve any of these purposes Inspecting further M Flocon made a second discovery On the small table under the window was a short length of black jet beading part of the trimming or ornamentation of a lady s dress These two objects of feminine origin one partly outside the car the other near it but quite inside gave rise to many conjectures It led however to the inevitable conclusion that a woman had been at some time or other in the berth M Flocon could not but connect these two finds with the fact of the open window The latter might of course have been the work of the murdered man himself at an earlier hour Yet it is unusual as the detective imagined for a passenger and especially an Italian to lie under an open window in a sleeping berth when travelling by express train before daylight in March Who opened that window then and why Perhaps some further facts might be found on the outside of the car With this idea M Flocon left it and passed on to the line or permanent way Here he found himself a good deal below the level of the car These sleepers have no foot boards like ordinary carriages access to them is gained from a platform by the steps at each end The Chief was short of stature and he could only approach the window outside by calling one of the guards and ordering him to make the small ladder faire la petite echelle This meant stooping and giving a back on which little M Flocon climbed nimbly and so was raised to the necessary height A close scrutiny revealed nothing unusual The exterior of the car was encrusted with the mud and dust gathered in the journey none of which appeared to have been disturbed M Flocon reentered the carriage neither disappointed nor pleased his mind was in an open state ready to receive any impressions and as yet only one that was at all clear and distinct was borne in on him This was the presence of the lace and the jet beads in the theatre of the crime The inference was fair and simple He came logically and surely to this one That some woman had entered the compartment two That whether or not she had come in before the crime she was there after the window had been opened which was not done by the murdered man three That she had leaned out or partly passed out of the window at some time or other as the scrap of lace testified four Why had she leaned out To seek some means of exit or escape of course But escape from whom from what The murderer Then she must know him and unless an accomplice if so why run from him she would give up her knowledge on compulsion if not voluntarily as seemed doubtful seeing she his suspicions were consolidating had not done so already But there might be another even stronger reason to attempt escape at such imminent risk as leaving an express train at full speed To escape from her own act and the consequences it must entail escape from horror first from detection next and then from arrest and punishment All this would imperiously impel even a weak woman to face the worst peril to look out lean out even try the terrible but impossible feat of climbing out of the car So M Flocon by fair process of reasoning reached a point which incriminated one woman the only woman possible and that was the titled high bred lady who called herself the Contessa di Castagneto This conclusion gave a definite direction to further search Consulting the rough plan which he had constructed to take the place of the missing train card he entered the compartment which the Countess had occupied and which was actually next door It was in the tumbled untidy condition of a sleeping place but just vacated The sex and quality of its recent occupant were plainly apparent in the goods and chattels lying about the property and possessions of a delicate well bred woman of the world things still left as she had used them last rugs still unrolled a pair of easy slippers on the floor the sponge in its waterproof bag on the bed brushes bottles button hook hand glass many things belonging to the dressing bag not yet returned to that receptacle The maid was no doubt to have attended to all these but as she had not come they remained unpacked and strewn about in some disorder M Flocon pounced down upon the contents of the berth and commenced an immediate search for a lace scarf or any wrap or cover with lace He found nothing and was hardly disappointed It told more against the Countess who if innocent would have no reason to conceal or make away with a possibly incriminating possession the need for which she could not of course understand Next he handled the dressing bag and with deft fingers replaced everything Everything was forthcoming but one glass bottle a small one the absence of which he noted but thought of little consequence till by and by he came upon it under peculiar circumstances Before leaving the car and after walking through the other compartments M Flocon made an especially strict search of the corner where the porter had his own small chair his only resting place indeed throughout the journey He had not forgotten the attendant s condition when first examined and he had even then been nearly satisfied that the man had been hocussed narcotized drugged Any doubts were entirely removed by his picking up near the porter s seat a small silver topped bottle and a handkerchief both marked with coronet and monogram the last of which although the letters were much interlaced and involved were decipherable as S L L C It was that of the Countess and corresponded with the marks on her other belongings He put it to his nostril and recognized at once by its smell that it had contained tincture of laudanum or some preparation of that drug CHAPTER V M Flocon was an experienced detective and he knew so well that he ought to be on his guard against the most plausible suggestions that he did not like to make too much of these discoveries Still he was distinctly satisfied if not exactly exultant and he went back towards the station with a strong predisposition against the Contessa di Castagneto Just outside the waiting room however his assistant Galipaud met him with news which rather dashed his hopes and gave a new direction to his thoughts The lady s maid was not to be found Impossible cried the Chief and then at once suspicion followed surprise I have looked monsieur inquired everywhere the maid has not been seen She certainly is not here Did she go through the barrier with the other passengers No one knows no one remembers her not even the conductor But she has gone That is positive Yet it was her duty to be here to attend to her service Her mistress would certainly want her has asked for her Why should she run away This question presented itself as one of infinite importance to be pondered over seriously before he went further into the inquiry Did the Countess know of this disappearance She had asked imploringly for her maid True but might that not be a blind Women are born actresses and at need can assume any part convey any impression Might not the Countess have wished to be dissociated from the maid and therefore have affected complete ignorance of her flight I will try her further said M Flocon to himself But then supposing that the maid had taken herself off of her own accord Why was it Why had she done so Because because she was afraid of something If so of what No direct accusation could be brought against her on the face of it She had not been in the sleeping car at the time of the murder while the Countess as certainly was and according to strong presumption in the very compartment where the deed was done If the maid was afraid why was she afraid Only on one possible hypothesis That she was either in collusion with the Countess or possessed of some guilty knowledge tending to incriminate the Countess and probably herself She had run away to avoid any inconvenient questioning tending to get her mistress into trouble which would react probably on herself We must press the Countess on this point closely I will put it plainly to M le Juge said the detective as he entered the private room set apart for the police authorities where he found M Beaumont le Hardi the instructing judge and the Commissary of the Quartier arrondissement A lengthy conference followed among the officials M Flocon told all he knew all he had discovered gave his views with all the force and fluency of a public prosecutor and was congratulated warmly on the progress he had made I agree with you sir said the instructing judge we must have in the Countess first and pursue the line indicated as regards the missing maid I will fetch her then Stay what can be going on in there cried M Flocon rising from his seat and running into the outer waiting room which to his surprise and indignation he found in great confusion The guard who was on duty was struggling in personal conflict almost with the English General There was a great hubbub of voices and the Countess was lying back half fainting in her chair What s all this How dare you sir This to the General who now had the man by the throat with one hand and with the other was preventing him from drawing his sword Desist forbear You are opposing legal authority desist or I will call in assistance and will have you secured and removed The little Chief s blood was up he spoke warmly with all the force and dignity of an official who sees the law outraged It is entirely the fault of this ruffian of yours he has behaved most brutally replied Sir Charles still holding him tight Let him go monsieur your behaviour is inexcusable What you a military officer of the highest rank to assault a sentinel For shame This is unworthy of you He deserves to be scragged the beast went on the General as with one sharp turn of the wrist he threw the guard off and sent him flying nearly across the room where being free at last the Frenchman drew his sword and brandished it threateningly from a distance But M Flocon interposed with uplifted hand and insisted upon an explanation It is just this replied Sir Charles speaking fast and with much fierceness that lady there poor thing she is ill you can see that for yourself suffering overwrought she asked for a glass of water and this brute triple brute as you say in French refused to bring it I could not leave the room protested the guard My orders were precise So I was going to fetch the water went on the General angrily eying the guard as though he would like to make another grab at him and this fellow interfered Very properly added M Flocon Then why didn t he go himself or call some one Upon my word monsieur you are not to be complimented upon your people nor your methods I used to think that a Frenchman was gallant courteous especially to ladies The Chief looked a little disconcerted but remembering what he knew against this particular lady he stiffened and said severely I am responsible for my conduct to my superiors and not to you Besides you appear to forget your position You are here detained all of you he spoke to the whole room under suspicion A ghastly crime has been perpetrated by some one among you Do not be too sure of that interposed the irrepressible General Who else could be concerned The train never stopped after leaving Laroche said the detective allowing himself to be betrayed into argument Yes it did corrected Sir Charles with a contemptuous laugh shows how much you know Again the Chief looked unhappy He was on dangerous ground face to face with a new fact affecting all his theories if fact it was not mere assertion and that he must speedily verify But nothing was to be gained much indeed might be lost by prolonging this discussion in the presence of the whole party It was entirely opposed to the French practice of investigation which works secretly taking witnesses separately one by one and strictly preventing all intercommunication or collusion among them What I know or do not know is my affair he said with an indifference he did not feel I shall call upon you M le General for your statement in due course and that of the others He bowed stiffly to the whole room Every one must be interrogated M le Juge is now here and he proposes to begin madame with you The Countess gave a little start shivered and turned very pale Can t you see she is not equal to it cried the General hotly She has not yet recovered In the name of I do not say chivalry for that would be useless but of common humanity spare madame at least for the present That is impossible quite impossible There are reasons why Madame la Comtesse should be examined first I trust therefore she will make an effort I will try if you wish it She rose from her chair and walked a few steps rather feebly then stopped No no Countess do not go said Sir Charles hastily in English as he moved across to where she stood and gave her his hand This is sheer cruelty sir and cannot be permitted Stand aside shouted M Flocon I forbid you to approach that lady to address her or communicate with her Guard advance do your duty But the guard although his sword was still out of its sheath showed great reluctance to move He had no desire to try conclusions again with this very masterful person who was moreover a general as he had seen service he had a deep respect for generals even of foreign growth Meanwhile the General held his ground and continued his conversation with the Countess speaking still in English thus exasperating M Flocon who did not understand the language almost to madness This is not to be borne he cried Here Galipaud Block and when his two trusty assistants came rushing in he pointed furiously to the General Seize him remove him by force if necessary He shall go to the violon to the nearest lock up The noise attracted also the Judge and the Commissary and there were now six officials in all including the guard all surrounding the General a sufficiently imposing force to overawe even the most recalcitrant fire eater But now the General seemed to see only the comic side of the situation and he burst out laughing What all of you How many more Why not bring up cavalry and artillery horse foot and guns he asked derisively All to prevent one old man from offering his services to one weak woman Gentlemen my regards Really Charles I fear you are going too far said his brother the clergyman who however had been manifestly enjoying the whole scene Indeed yes It is not necessary I assure you added the Countess with tears of gratitude in her big brown eyes I am most touched most thankful You are a true soldier a true English gentleman and I shall never forget your kindness Then she put her hand in his with a pretty winning gesture that was reward enough for any man Meanwhile the Judge the senior official present had learned exactly what had happened and he now addressed the General with a calm but stern rebuke Monsieur will not I trust oblige us to put in force the full power of the law I might if I chose and as I am fully entitled commit you at once to Mazas to keep you in solitary confinement Your conduct has been deplorable well calculated to traverse and impede justice But I am willing to believe that you were led away not unnaturally as a gallant gentleman it is the characteristic of your nation of your cloth and that on more mature consideration you will acknowledge and not repeat your error M Beaumont le Hardi was a grave florid soft voiced person with a bald head and a comfortably lined white waistcoat one who sought his ends by persuasion not force but who had the instincts of a gentleman and little sympathy with the peremptory methods of his more inflammable colleague Oh with all my heart monsieur said Sir Charles cordially You saw or at least know how this has occurred I did not begin it nor was I the most to blame But I was in the wrong I admit What do you wish me to do now Give me your promise to abide by our rules they may be irksome but we think them necessary and hold no further converse with your companions Certainly certainly monsieur at least after I have said one word more to Madame la Comtesse No no I cannot permit even that But Sir Charles in spite of the warning finger held up by the Judge insisted upon crying out to her as she was being led into the other room Courage dear lady courage Don t let them bully you You have nothing to fear Any further defiance of authority was now prevented by her almost forcible removal from the room CHAPTER VI The stormy episode just ended had rather a disturbing effect on M Flocon who could scarcely give his full attention to all the points old and new 
7387-96092-0001	train-other-500	that had now arisen in the investigation But he would have time to go over them at his leisure while the work of interrogation was undertaken by the Judge
none	none	 The latter had taken his seat at a small table and just opposite was his greffier or clerk 
7387-96092-0002	train-other-500	who was to write down question and answer verbatim A little to one side with the light full on the face the witness was seated
none	none	 bearing the scrutiny of three pairs of eyes 
7387-96092-0003	train-other-500	the Judge first and behind him those of the Chief Detective and the Commissary of Police I trust madame that you are equal to answering a few questions
none	none	 began M le Hardi blandly 
7387-96092-0004	train-other-500	Oh yes I hope so Indeed I have no choice replied the Countess bravely resigned They will refer principally to your maid Ah said the Countess quickly and in a troubled voice
7387-96092-0005	train-other-500	yet she bore the gaze of the three officials without flinching I want to know a little more about her if you please Of course Anything I know I will tell you She spoke now with perfect self possession But if I might ask
7387-96092-0006	train-other-500	why this interest I will tell you frankly You asked for her we sent for her and Yes She cannot be found She is not in the station The Countess all but jumped from her chair in her surprise
7387-96092-0007	train-other-500	surprise that seemed too spontaneous to be feigned Impossible it cannot be She would not dare to leave me here like this all alone Parbleu she has dared Most certainly she is not here
none	none	 But what can have become of her 
7387-96092-0008	train-other-500	Ah madame what indeed Can you form any idea We hoped you might have been able to enlighten us I cannot monsieur not in the least Perchance you sent her on to your hotel
7387-96092-0009	train-other-500	to warn your friends that you were detained To fetch them perhaps to you in your trouble The trap was neatly contrived but she was not deceived How could I I knew of no trouble when I saw her last Oh
7387-96092-0010	train-other-500	indeed and when was that Last night at Amberieux as I have already told that gentleman
none	none	 She pointed to M Flocon who was obliged to nod his head 
7387-96092-0011	train-other-500	Well she has gone away somewhere It does not much matter still it is odd and for your sake
none	none	 we should like to help you to find her if you do wish to find her 
7387-96092-0012	train-other-500	Another little trap which failed
none	none	 Indeed I hardly think she is worth keeping after this barefaced desertion 
7387-96092-0013	train-other-500	No indeed And she must be held to strict account for it must justify it give her reasons So we must find her for you I am not at all anxious really the Countess said quickly
7387-96092-0014	train-other-500	and the remark told against her Well now Madame la Comtesse as to her description Will you tell us what was her height figure colour of eyes hair general appearance She was tall
7387-96092-0015	train-other-500	above the middle height at least slight good figure black hair and eyes Pretty That depends upon what you mean by pretty Some people might think so in her own class How was she dressed
7387-96092-0016	train-other-500	In plain dark serge bonnet of black straw and brown ribbons I do not allow my maid to wear colours Exactly And her name age place of birth
none	none	 Hortense Petitpre thirty two 
7387-96092-0017	train-other-500	born I believe in Paris The Judge when these particulars had been given looked over his shoulder towards the detective but said nothing It was quite unnecessary
none	none	 for M Flocon who had been writing in his note book 
7387-96092-0018	train-other-500	now rose and left the room He called Galipaud to him saying sharply Here is the more detailed description of the lady s maid and in writing Have it copied and circulate it at once Give it to the station master and to the agents of police round about here
7387-96092-0019	train-other-500	I have an idea only an idea that this woman has not gone far It may be worth nothing still there is the chance
none	none	 People who are wanted often hang about the very place they would not stay in if they were wise 
7387-96092-0020	train-other-500	Anyhow set a watch for her and come back here Meanwhile the Judge had continued his questioning And where madame did you obtain your maid In Rome She was there out of a place
7387-96092-0021	train-other-500	I heard of her at an agency and registry office when I was looking for a maid a month or two ago Then she has not been long in your service No as I tell you she came to me in December last Well recommended Strongly
7387-96092-0022	train-other-500	She had lived with good families French and English And with you what was her character Irreproachable Well
none	none	 so much for Hortense Petitpre She is not far off I dare say 
7387-96092-0023	train-other-500	When we want her we shall be able to lay hands on her I do not doubt madame may rest assured Pray take no trouble in the matter I certainly should not keep her Very well very well And now another small matter I see
none	none	 he referred to the rough plan of the sleeping car prepared by M Flocon I see that you occupied the compartment d with berths Nos nine and ten I think nine was the number of my berth It was You may be certain of that Now next door to your compartment do you know who was next door I mean in seven and eight 
7387-96092-0025	train-other-500	The Countess s lip quivered and she was a prey to sudden emotion as she answered in a low voice It was where where There there madame said the Judge reassuring her as he would a little child You need not say
7387-96092-0026	train-other-500	It is no doubt very distressing to you Yet you know She bent her head slowly but uttered no word Now this man this poor man had you noticed him at all No no not afterwards of course
7387-96092-0027	train-other-500	It would not be likely But during the journey Did you speak to him or he to you
none	none	 No 
7387-96092-0028	train-other-500	no distinctly no Nor see him Yes I saw him I believe at Modane with the rest when we dined Ah exactly so He dined at Modane
7387-96092-0029	train-other-500	Was that the only occasion on which you saw him You had never met him previously in Rome where you resided Whom do you mean The murdered man Who else No not that I am aware of At least I did not recognize him as a friend
7387-96092-0030	train-other-500	I presume if he was among your friends Pardon me that he certainly was not interrupted the Countess Well among your acquaintances he would probably have made himself known to you I suppose so
7387-96092-0031	train-other-500	And he did not do so He never spoke to you nor you to him I never saw him the occupant of that compartment except on that one occasion I kept a good deal in my compartment during the journey Alone
7387-96092-0032	train-other-500	It must have been very dull for you said the Judge pleasantly I was not always alone said the Countess hesitatingly and with a slight flush I had friends in the car
none	none	 Oh oh 
7387-96092-0033	train-other-500	the exclamation was long drawn and rather significant Who were they You may as well tell us madame we should certainly find out I have no wish to withhold the information she replied now turning pale
7387-96092-0034	train-other-500	possibly at the imputation conveyed Why should I And these friends were Sir Charles Collingham and his brother They came and sat with me occasionally sometimes one sometimes the other During the day
7387-96092-0035	train-other-500	Of course during the day Her eyes flashed as though the question was another offence Have you known them long The General I met in Roman society last winter It was he who introduced his brother Very good so far
7387-96092-0036	train-other-500	The General knew you took an interest in you That explains his strange unjustifiable conduct just now I do not think it was either strange or unjustifiable interrupted the Countess hotly He is a gentleman
none	none	 Quite a preux cavalier of course 
7387-96092-0037	train-other-500	But we will pass on You are not a good sleeper I believe madame Indeed no I sleep badly as a rule Then you would be easily disturbed Now last night did you hear anything strange in the car
7387-96092-0038	train-other-500	more particularly in the adjoining compartment Nothing No sound of voices raised high
none	none	 no noise of a conflict a struggle No monsieur 
7387-96092-0039	train-other-500	That is odd I cannot understand it We know beyond all question from the appearance of the body the corpse that there was a fight an encounter Yet you a wretched sleeper with only a thin plank of wood between you and the affray
7387-96092-0040	train-other-500	hear nothing absolutely nothing It is most extraordinary I was asleep I must have been asleep A light sleeper would certainly be awakened How can you explain how can you reconcile that
7387-96092-0041	train-other-500	The question was blandly put but the Judge s incredulity verged upon actual insolence Easily I had taken a soporific I always do on a journey I am obliged to keep something sulphonal or chloral by me on purpose
7387-96092-0042	train-other-500	Then this madame is yours And the Judge with an air of undisguised triumph
none	none	 produced the small glass vial which M Flocon had picked up in the sleeping car near the conductor s seat 
7387-96092-0043	train-other-500	The Countess with a quick gesture put out her hand to take it No I cannot give it up Look as near as you like
none	none	 and say is it yours 
7387-96092-0044	train-other-500	Of course it is mine Where did you get it Not in my berth No madame not in your berth But where Pardon me we shall not tell you not just now I missed it last night went on the Countess slightly confused
7387-96092-0045	train-other-500	After you had taken your dose of chloral No before And why did you want this It is laudanum For my nerves I have a toothache I I really sir
7387-96092-0046	train-other-500	I need not tell you all my ailments And the maid had removed it So I presume she must have taken it out of the bag in the first instance And then kept it That is what I can only suppose
none	none	 Ah CHAPTER VII When the Judge had brought down the interrogation of the Countess to the production of the small glass bottle he paused and with a long drawn Ah of satisfaction looked round at his colleagues Both M Flocon and the Commissary nodded their heads approvingly plainly sharing his triumph Then they all put their heads together in close whispered conference Admirable M le Juge said the detective You have been most adroit It is a clear case No doubt said the Commissary who was a blunt rather coarse person believing that to take anybody and everybody into custody is always the safest and simplest course It looks black against her I think she ought to be arrested at once 
7205-96093-0000	train-other-500	We might indeed we ought to have more evidence more definite evidence perhaps The Judge was musing over the facts as he knew them
none	none	 I should like before going further to look at the car he said suddenly coming to a conclusion M Flocon readily agreed 
7205-96093-0001	train-other-500	We will go together he said adding Madame will remain here please until we return It may not be for long And afterwards asked the Countess whose nervousness had if anything increased during the whispered colloquy of the officials
7205-96093-0002	train-other-500	Ah afterwards Who knows was the reply with a shrug of the shoulders all most enigmatic and unsatisfactory What have we against her said the Judge as soon as they had gained the absolute privacy of the sleeping car The bottle of laudanum
7205-96093-0003	train-other-500	and the porter s condition He was undoubtedly drugged answered the detective and the discussion which followed took the form of a dialogue between them for the Commissary took no part in it Yes but why by the Countess
7205-96093-0004	train-other-500	How do we know that positively It is her bottle
none	none	 said M Flocon 
7205-96093-0005	train-other-500	Her story may be true that she missed it that the maid took it We have nothing whatever against the maid We know nothing about her No Except that she has disappeared But that tells more against her mistress It is all very vague
7205-96093-0006	train-other-500	I do not see my way quite as yet But the fragment of lace the broken beading
none	none	 Surely M le Juge 
7205-96093-0007	train-other-500	they are a woman s and only one woman was in the car So far as we know But if these could be proved to be hers Ah if you could prove that Easy enough Have her searched here at once in the station
7205-96093-0008	train-other-500	There is a female searcher attached to the detention room
none	none	 It is a strong measure She is a lady Ladies who commit crimes must not expect to be handled with kid gloves 
7205-96093-0009	train-other-500	She is an Englishwoman or with English connections titled too I hesitate upon my word Suppose we are wrong It may lead to unpleasantness
none	none	 M le Prefet is anxious to avoid complications possibly international 
7205-96093-0010	train-other-500	As he spoke he bent over and taking a magnifier from his pocket examined the lace which still fluttered where it was caught It is fine lace I think
none	none	 What say you M Flocon You may be more experienced in such matters The finest or nearly so 
7205-96093-0011	train-other-500	I believe it is Valenciennes the trimming of some underclothing I should think
none	none	 That surely is sufficient M le Juge M Beaumont le Hardi gave a reluctant consent and the Chief went back himself to see that the searching was undertaken without loss of time The Countess protested but vainly against this new indignity What could she do 
7205-96093-0012	train-other-500	A prisoner practically friendless for the General was not within reach to resist was out of the question Indeed she was plainly told that force would be employed unless she submitted with a good grace There was nothing for it but to obey
7205-96093-0013	train-other-500	Mother Tontaine as the female searcher called herself was an evil visaged corpulent old creature with a sickly soft insinuating voice
7205-96093-0014	train-other-500	and a greasy familiar manner that was most offensive They had given her the scrap of torn lace and the debris of the jet as a guide
none	none	 with very particular directions to see if they corresponded with any part of the lady s apparel 
7205-96093-0015	train-other-500	She soon showed her quality
none	none	 Aha oho What is this my pretty princess How comes so great a lady into the hands of Mother Tontaine But I will not harm you my beauty my pretty my little one 
7205-96093-0016	train-other-500	Oh no no I will not trouble you dearie No trust to me
none	none	 and she held out one skinny claw and looked the other way The Countess did not or would not understand 
7205-96093-0017	train-other-500	Madame has money went on the old hag in a half threatening half coaxing whisper as she came up quite close and fastened on her victim like a bird of prey If you mean that I am to bribe you
none	none	 Fie the nasty word But just a small present a pretty gift 
7205-96093-0018	train-other-500	one or two yellow bits twenty thirty forty francs you d better She shook the soft arm she held roughly and anything seemed preferable than to be touched by this horrible woman
none	none	 Wait wait cried the Countess shivering all over and feeling hastily for her purse she took out several napoleons Aha oho 
7205-96093-0019	train-other-500	One two three said the searcher in a fat wheedling voice Four yes four five and she clinked the coins together in her palm while a covetous light came into her faded eyes at the joyous sound Five
none	none	 make it five at once d ye hear me 
7205-96093-0020	train-other-500	or I ll call them in and tell them That will go against you my princess What
none	none	 try to bribe a poor old woman 
7205-96093-0021	train-other-500	Mother Tontaine honest and incorruptible Tontaine Five then five With trembling haste the Countess emptied the whole contents of her purse in the old hag s hand Bon aubaine Nice pickings
none	none	 It is a misery what they pay me here I am oh so poor 
7205-96093-0022	train-other-500	and I have children many babies You will not tell them the police you dare not No no no Thus muttering to herself
none	none	 she shambled across the room to a corner 
7205-96093-0023	train-other-500	where she stowed the money safely away Then she came back
none	none	 showed the bit of lace and pressed it into the Countess s hands 
7205-96093-0024	train-other-500	Do you know this little one Where it comes from where there is much more I was told to look for it to search for it on you
none	none	 and with a quick gesture she lifted the edge of the Countess s skirt dropping it next moment with a low chuckling laugh Oho aha You were right my pretty to pay me my pretty 
7205-96093-0025	train-other-500	right And some day to day to morrow
none	none	 whenever I ask you 
7205-96093-0026	train-other-500	you will remember Mother Tontaine The Countess listened with dismay What had she done
none	none	 Put herself into the power of this greedy and unscrupulous old beldame 
7205-96093-0027	train-other-500	And this my princess What have we here aha Mere Tontaine held up next the broken bit of jet ornament for inspection and as the Countess leaned forward to examine it more closely gave it into her hand
7205-96093-0028	train-other-500	You recognize it of course But be careful my pretty Beware If any one were looking it would ruin you I could not save you then Sh say nothing only look and quick give it me back I must have it to show
7205-96093-0029	train-other-500	All this time the Countess was turning the jet over and over in her open palm with a perplexed disturbed but hardly a terrified air Yes she knew it or thought she knew it
7205-96093-0030	train-other-500	It had been But how had it come here into the possession of this base myrmidon of the French police
none	none	 Give it me quick There was a loud knock at the door They are coming 
7205-96093-0031	train-other-500	Remember Mother Tontaine put her long finger to her lip Not a word I have found nothing of course Nothing I can swear to that and you will not forget Mother Tontaine
none	none	 Now M Flocon stood at the open door awaiting the searcher s report He looked much disconcerted when the old woman took him on one side and briefly explained that the search had been altogether fruitless There was nothing to justify suspicion nothing so far as she could find 
7205-96093-0032	train-other-500	The detective looked from one to the other from the hag he had employed in this unpleasant quest to the lady on whom it had been tried The Countess to his surprise did not complain He had expected further and strong upbraidings
7205-96093-0033	train-other-500	Strange to say she took it very quietly There was no indignation in her face She was still pale and her hands trembled but she said nothing made no reference at least to what she had just gone through
7205-96093-0034	train-other-500	Again he took counsel with his colleague while the Countess was kept apart
none	none	 What next M Flocon asked the Judge What shall we do with her 
7205-96093-0035	train-other-500	Let her go answered the detective briefly What do you suggest this sir said the Judge slyly After your strong and well grounded suspicions They are as strong as ever stronger
7205-96093-0036	train-other-500	and I feel sure I shall yet justify them But what I wish now is to let her go at large under surveillance Ah you would shadow her Precisely By a good agent Galipaud for instance He speaks English
7205-96093-0037	train-other-500	and he can if necessary follow her anywhere even to England
none	none	 She can be extradited said the Commissary with his one prominent idea of arrest Do you agree M le Juge Then if you will permit me I will give the necessary orders and perhaps you will inform the lady that she is free to leave the station The Countess now had reason to change her opinion of the French officials Great politeness now replaced the first severity that had been so cruel She was told with many bows and apologies that her regretted but unavoidable detention was at an end Not only was she freely allowed to depart but she was escorted by both M Flocon and the Commissary outside to where an omnibus was in waiting and all her baggage piled on top even to the dressing bag which had been neatly repacked for her But the little silver topped vial had not been restored to her nor the handkerchief In her joy at her deliverance either she had not given these a second thought or she did not wish to appear anxious to recover them Nor did she notice that as the bus passed through the gates at the bottom of the large slope that leads from the Lyons Station it was followed at a discreet distance by a modest fiacre which pulled up eventually outside the Hotel Madagascar Its occupant M Galipaud kept the Countess in sight and entering the hotel at her heels waited till she had left the office when he held a long conference with the proprietor CHAPTER VIII A first stage in the inquiry had now been reached with results that seemed promising and were yet contradictory No doubt the watch to be set on the Countess might lead to something yet something to bring first plausible suspicion to a triumphant issue but the examination of the other occupants of the car should not be allowed to slacken on that account The Countess might have some confederate among them this pestilent English General perhaps who had made himself so conspicuous in her defence or some one of them might throw light upon her movements upon her conduct during the journey Then with a spasm of self reproach M Flocon remembered that two distinct suggestions had been made to him by two of the travellers and that so far he had neglected them One was the significant hint from the Italian that he could materially help the inquiry The other was the General s sneering assertion that the train had not continued its journey uninterruptedly between Laroche and Paris Consulting the Judge and laying these facts before him it was agreed that the Italian s offer seemed the most important and he was accordingly called in next Who and what are you asked the Judge carelessly but the answer roused him at once to intense interest and he could not quite resist a glance of reproach at M Flocon My name I have given you Natale Ripaldi I am a detective officer belonging to the Roman police What cried M Flocon colouring deeply This is unheard of Why in the name of all the devils have you withheld this most astonishing statement until now Monsieur surely remembers I told him half an hour ago I had something important to communicate Yes yes of course But why were you so reticent Good Heavens Monsieur was not so encouraging that I felt disposed to force on him what I knew he would have to hear in due course It is monstrous quite abominable and shall not end here Your superiors shall hear of your conduct went on the Chief hotly They will also hear and I think listen to my version of the story that I offered you fairly and at the first opportunity all the information I had and that you refused to accept it You should have persisted It was your manifest duty You are an officer of the law or you say you are Pray telegraph at once if you think fit to Rome to the police authorities and you will find that Natale Ripaldi your humble servant travelled by the through express with their knowledge and authority And here are my credentials my official card some official letters And what in a word have you to tell us I can tell you who the murdered man was We know that already Possibly but only his name I apprehend I know his profession his business his object in travelling for I was appointed to watch and follow him That is why I am here Was he a suspicious character then A criminal At any rate he was absconding from Rome with valuables A thief in fact The Italian put out the palms of his hands with a gesture of doubt and deprecation Thief is a hard ugly word That which he was removing was or had been his own property Tut tut do be more explicit and get on interrupted the little Chief testily I ask nothing better but if questions are put to me The Judge interposed Give us your story We can interrogate you afterwards The murdered man is Francis A Quadling of the firm of Correse Quadling bankers in the Via Condotti Rome It was an old house once of good of the highest repute but of late years it has fallen into difficulties Its financial soundness was doubted in certain circles and the Government was warned that a great scandal was imminent So the matter was handed over to the police and I was directed to make inquiries and to keep my eye on this Quadling he jerked his thumb towards the platform where the body might be supposed to be This Quadling was the only surviving partner He was well known and liked in Rome indeed many who heard the adverse reports disbelieved them I myself among the number But my duty was plain Naturally echoed the fiery little detective I made it my business to place the banker under surveillance to learn his habits his ways of life see who were his friends the houses he visited I soon knew much that I wanted to know although not all But one fact I discovered and think it right to inform you of it at once He was on intimate terms with La Castagneto at least he frequently called upon her La Castagneto Do you mean the Countess of that name who was a passenger in the sleeper Beyond doubt it is she I mean The officials looked at each other eagerly and M Beaumont le Hardi quickly turned over the sheets on which the Countess s evidence was recorded She had denied acquaintance with this murdered man Quadling and here was positive evidence that they were on intimate terms He was at her house on the very day we all left Rome in the evening towards dusk The Countess had an apartment in the Via Margutta and when he left her he returned to his own place in the Condotti entered the bank stayed half an hour then came out with one hand bag and rug called a cab and was driven straight to the railway station And you followed Of course When I saw him walk straight to the sleeping car and ask the conductor for seven and eight I knew that his plans had been laid and that he was on the point of leaving Rome secretly When presently La Castagneto also arrived I concluded that she was in his confidence and that possibly they were eloping together Why did you not arrest him I had no authority even if I had had the time Although I was ordered to watch the Signor Quadling I had no warrant for his arrest But I decided on the spur of the moment what course I should take It seemed to be the only one and that was to embark in the same train and stick close to my man You informed your superiors I suppose Pardon me monsieur said the Italian blandly to the Chief who asked the question but have you any right to inquire into my conduct towards my superiors In all that affects the murder I am at your orders but in this other matter it is between me and them Ta ta ta They will tell us if you will not And you had better be careful lest you obstruct justice Speak out sir and beware What did you intend to do To act according to circumstances If my suspicions were confirmed What suspicions Why that this banker was carrying off any large sum in cash notes securities as in effect he was Ah You know that How By my own eyes I looked into his compartment once and saw him in the act of counting them over a great quantity in fact Again the officials looked at each other significantly They had got at last to a motive for the crime And that of course would have justified his arrest Exactly I proposed directly we arrived in Paris to claim the assistance of your police and take him into custody But his fate interposed There was a pause a long pause for another important point had been reached in the inquiry the motive for the murder had been made clear and with it the presumption against the Countess gained terrible strength But there was more perhaps to be got out of this dark visaged Italian detective who had already proved so useful an ally One or two words more said the Judge to Ripaldi During the journey now did you have any conversation with this Quadling None He kept very much to himself You saw him I suppose at the restaurants Yes at Modane and Laroche But did not speak to him Not a word Had he any suspicion do you think as to who you were Why should he He did not know me I had taken pains he should never see me Did he speak to any other passenger Very little To the Countess Yes once or twice I think to her maid Ah that maid Did you notice her at all She has not been seen It is strange She seems to have disappeared To have run away in fact suggested Ripaldi with a queer smile Well at least she is not here with her mistress Can you offer any explanation of that She was perhaps afraid The Countess and she were very good friends I think On better more familiar terms than is usual between mistress and maid The maid knew something Ah monsieur it is only an idea But I give it you for what it is worth Well well this maid what was she like Tall dark good looking not too reserved She made other friends the porter and the English Colonel I saw the last speaking to her I spoke to her myself What can have become of her said the Judge Would M le Juge like me to go in search of her That is if you have no more questions to ask no wish to detain me further We will consider that and let you know in a moment if you will wait outside And then when alone the officials deliberated It was a good offer the man knew her appearance he was in possession of all the facts he could be trusted Ah but can he though queried the detective How do we know he has told us truth What guarantee have we of his loyalty his good faith What if he is also concerned in the crime has some guilty knowledge What if he killed Quadling himself or was an accomplice before or after the fact All these are possibilities of course but pardon me dear colleague a little far fetched eh said the Judge Why not utilize this man If he betrays us serves us ill if we had reason to lay hands on him again he could hardly escape us Let him go and send some one with him said the Commissary the first practical suggestion he had yet made Excellent cried the Judge You have another man here Chief let him go with this Italian They called in Ripaldi and told him We will accept your services monsieur and you can begin your search at once In what direction do you propose to begin Where has her mistress gone How do you know she has gone At least she is no longer with us out there Have you arrested her or what No she is still at large but we have our eye upon her She has gone to her hotel the Madagascar off the Grands Boulevards Then it is there that I shall look for the maid No doubt she preceded her mistress to the hotel or she will join her there very shortly You would not make yourself known of course They might give you the slip You have no authority to detain them not in France I should take my precautions and I can always appeal to the police Exactly That would be your proper course But you might lose valuable time a great opportunity and we wish to guard against that so we shall associate one of our own people with you in your proceedings Oh very well if you wish It will no doubt be best The Italian readily assented but a shrewd listener might have guessed from the tone of his voice that the proposal was not exactly pleasing to him I will call in Block said the Chief and the second detective inspector appeared to take his instructions He was a stout stumpy little man with a barrel like figure greatly emphasized by the short frock coat he wore he had smallish pig s eyes buried deep in a fat face and his round chubby cheeks hung low over his turned down collar This gentleman went on the Chief indicating Ripaldi is a member of the Roman police and has been so obliging as to offer us his services You will accompany him in the first instance to the Hotel Madagascar Put yourself in communication with Galipaud who is there on duty Would it not be sufficient if I made myself known to M Galipaud suggested the Italian I have seen him here I should recognize him That is not so certain he may have changed his appearance Besides he does not know the latest developments and might not be very cordial You might write me a few lines to take to him I think not We prefer to send Block replied the Chief briefly and decidedly He did not like this pertinacity and looked at his colleagues as though he sought their concurrence in altering the arrangements for the Italian s mission It might be wiser to detain him still It was only to save trouble that I made the suggestion hastily put in Ripaldi Naturally I am in your hands And if I do not meet with the maid at the hotel I may have to look further in which case Monsieur Block thank you would no doubt render valuable assistance This speech restored confidence and a few minutes later the two detectives already excellent friends from the freemasonry of a common craft left the station in a closed cab CHAPTER IX 
6548-96095-0000	train-other-500	What next asked the Judge That
none	none	 pestilent English officer if you please M le Juge 
6548-96095-0001	train-other-500	said the detective That fire eating swashbuckling soldier with his blustering barrack room ways I long to come to close quarters with him He ridiculed me taunted me said I knew nothing we will see
6548-96095-0002	train-other-500	we will see In fact you wish to interrogate him yourself Very well Let us have him in
6548-96095-0003	train-other-500	When Sir Charles Collingham entered he included the three officials in one cold stiff bow waited a moment and then finding he was not offered a chair said with studied politeness
6548-96095-0004	train-other-500	I presume I may sit down Pardon Of course pray be seated said the Judge hastily and evidently a little ashamed of himself Ah thanks
6548-96095-0005	train-other-500	Do you object went on the General taking out a silver cigarette case May I offer one He handed round the box affably We do not smoke on duty
none	none	 answered the Chief rudely 
6548-96095-0006	train-other-500	Nor is smoking permitted in a court of justice Come come I wish to show no disrespect But I cannot recognize this as a court of justice and I think if you will forgive me
6548-96095-0007	train-other-500	that I shall take three whiffs It may help me keep my temper He was evidently making game of them There was no symptom remaining of the recent effervescence when he was acting as the Countess s champion and he was perfectly nay
6548-96095-0008	train-other-500	insolently calm and self possessed You call yourself General Collingham went on the Chief I do not call myself I am General Sir Charles Collingham of the British Army Retired
6548-96095-0009	train-other-500	No I am still on the active list These points will have to be verified With all my heart You have already sent to the British Embassy Yes but no one has come
none	none	 answered the detective 
6548-96095-0010	train-other-500	contemptuously If you disbelieve me why do you question me It is our duty to question you and yours to answer If not we have means to make you You are suspected
6548-96095-0011	train-other-500	inculpated in a terrible crime and your whole attitude is is objectionable unworthy disgr
none	none	 Gently gently my dear colleague interposed the Judge If you will permit me I will take up this And you M le General 
6548-96095-0012	train-other-500	I am sure you cannot wish to impede or obstruct us we represent the law of this country
none	none	 Have I done so M le Juge answered the General with the utmost courtesy 
6548-96095-0013	train-other-500	as he threw away his half burned cigarette No no I do not imply that in the least I only entreat you as a good and gallant gentleman to meet us in a proper spirit and give us your best help
6548-96095-0014	train-other-500	Indeed I am quite ready If there has been any unpleasantness it has surely not been of my making but rather of that little man there
none	none	 The General pointed to M Flocon 
6548-96095-0015	train-other-500	rather contemptuously and nearly started a fresh disturbance Well well let us say no more of that and proceed to business I understand
6548-96095-0016	train-other-500	said the Judge after fingering a few pages of the dispositions in front of him that you are a friend of the Contessa di Castagneto Indeed she has told us so herself It was very good of her to call me her friend
6548-96095-0017	train-other-500	I am proud to hear she so considers me How long have you known her Four or five months Since the beginning of the last winter season in Rome Did you frequent her house
6548-96095-0018	train-other-500	If you mean was I permitted to call on her on friendly terms yes Did you know all her friends How can I answer that I know whom I met there from time to time Exactly
6548-96095-0019	train-other-500	Did you often meet among them a Signor Quadling Quadling Quadling I cannot say that I have The name is familiar somehow but I cannot recall the man
none	none	 Have you never heard of the Roman bankers Correse Quadling Ah of course Although I have had no dealing with them Certainly I have never met mister Quadling Not at the Countess s Never 
6548-96095-0021	train-other-500	of that I am quite sure And yet we have had positive evidence that he was a constant visitor there It is perfectly incomprehensible to me Not only have I never met him but I have never heard the Countess mention his name
6548-96095-0022	train-other-500	It will surprise you then to be told that he called at her apartment in the Via Margutta on the very evening of her departure from Rome Called was admitted was closeted with her for more than an hour
none	none	 I am surprised astounded I called there myself about four in the afternoon to offer my services for the journey and I too stayed till after five 
6548-96095-0023	train-other-500	I can hardly believe it I have more surprises for you General What will you think when I tell you that this very Quadling this friend acquaintance call him what you please
6548-96095-0024	train-other-500	but at least intimate enough to pay her a visit on the eve of a long journey
none	none	 was the man found murdered in the sleeping car Can it be possible Are you sure 
6548-96095-0025	train-other-500	cried Sir Charles almost starting from his chair
none	none	 And what do you deduce from all this What do you imply An accusation against that lady Absurd I respect your chivalrous desire to stand up for a lady 
6548-96095-0026	train-other-500	who calls you her friend but we are officials first and sentiment cannot be permitted to influence us We have good reasons for suspecting that lady I tell you that frankly
none	none	 and trust to you as a soldier and man of honour not to abuse the confidence reposed in you May I not know those reasons 
6548-96095-0027	train-other-500	Because she was in the car the only woman you understand between Laroche and Paris Do you suspect a female hand then asked the General evidently much interested and impressed
6548-96095-0028	train-other-500	That is so although I am exceeding my duty in revealing this
none	none	 And you are satisfied that this lady a refined delicate person in the best society 
6548-96095-0029	train-other-500	of the highest character believe me I know that to be the case whom you yet suspect of an atrocious crime was the only female in the car Obviously Who else What other woman could possibly have been in the car
6548-96095-0030	train-other-500	No one got in at Laroche the train never stopped till it reached Paris On that last point at least you are quite mistaken I assure you Why not upon the other also The train stopped
6548-96095-0031	train-other-500	interjected the detective Why has no one told us that Possibly because you never asked But it is nevertheless the fact Verify it Every one will tell you the same The detective himself hurried to the door and called in the porter
6548-96095-0032	train-other-500	He was within his rights of course but the action showed distrust at which the General only smiled but he laughed outright when the still stupid and half dazed porter of course corroborated the statement at once
6548-96095-0033	train-other-500	At whose instance was the train pulled up asked the detective and the Judge nodded his head approvingly To know that would fix fresh suspicion But the porter could not answer the question
6548-96095-0034	train-other-500	Some one had rung the alarm bell so at least the conductor had declared otherwise they should not have stopped Yet he the porter
none	none	 had not done so nor did any passenger come forward to admit giving the signal 
6548-96095-0035	train-other-500	But there had been a halt Yes assuredly This is a new light the Judge confessed Do you draw any conclusion from it he went on to ask the General That is surely your business I have only elicited the fact to disprove your theory
6548-96095-0036	train-other-500	But if you wish I will tell you how it strikes me The Judge bowed assent The bare fact that the train was halted would mean little That would be the natural act of a timid or excitable person involved indirectly in such a catastrophe
none	none	 But to disavow the act starts suspicion 
6548-96095-0037	train-other-500	The fair inference is that there was some reason an unavowable reason for halting the train And that reason would be You must see it without my assistance surely Why
none	none	 what else but to afford some one an opportunity to leave the car 
6548-96095-0038	train-other-500	But how could that be You would have seen that person some of you especially at such a critical time The aisle would be full of people both exits were thus practically overlooked
6548-96095-0039	train-other-500	My idea is it is only an idea understand that the person had already left the car that is to say the interior of the car Escaped how Where What do you mean
6548-96095-0040	train-other-500	Escaped through the open window of the compartment where you found the murdered man You noticed the open window then quickly asked the detective When was that Directly I entered the compartment at the first alarm
6548-96095-0041	train-other-500	It occurred to me at once that some one might have gone through it But no woman could have done it
none	none	 To climb out of an express train 
6548-96095-0042	train-other-500	going at top speed would be an impossible feat for a woman
none	none	 said the detective doggedly Why in God s name do you still harp upon the woman 
6548-96095-0043	train-other-500	Why should it be a woman more than a man Because
none	none	 it was the Judge who spoke but he paused a moment in deference to a gesture of protest from M Flocon 
6548-96095-0044	train-other-500	The little detective was much concerned at the utter want of reticence displayed by his colleague Because
none	none	 went on the Judge with decision 
6548-96095-0045	train-other-500	because this was found in the compartment and he held out the piece of lace and the scrap of beading for the General s inspection adding quickly You have seen these or one of them or something like them before
6548-96095-0046	train-other-500	I am sure of it I call upon you I demand no I appeal to your sense of honour Sir Collingham
none	none	 Tell me please exactly what you know CHAPTER X The General sat for a time staring hard at the bit of torn lace and the broken beads Then he spoke out firmly It is my duty to withhold nothing It is not the lace That I could not swear to for me and probably for most men two pieces of lace are very much the same But I think I have seen these beads or something exactly like them before Where When They formed part of the trimming of a mantle worn by the Contessa di Castagneto Ah it was the same interjection uttered simultaneously by the three Frenchmen but each had a very different note in the Judge it was deep interest in the detective triumph in the Commissary indignation as when he caught a criminal red handed Did she wear it on the journey continued the Judge As to that I cannot say Come come General you were with her constantly you must be able to tell us We insist on being told This fiercely from the now jubilant M Flocon I repeat that I cannot say To the best of my recollection the Countess wore a long travelling cloak an ulster as we call them The jacket with those bead ornaments may have been underneath But if I have seen them as I believe I have it was not during this journey Here the Judge whispered to M Flocon The searcher did not discover any second mantle How do we know the woman examined thoroughly he replied Here at least is direct evidence as to the beads At last the net is drawing round this fine Countess Well at any rate said the detective aloud returning to the General these beads were found in the compartment of the murdered man I should like that explained please By me How can I explain it And the fact does not bear upon what we were considering as to whether any one had left the car Why not The Countess as we know never left the car As to her entering this particular compartment at any previous time it is highly improbable Indeed it is rather insulting her to suggest it She and this Quadling were close friends So you say On what evidence I do not know but I dispute it Then how could the beads get there They were her property worn by her Once I admit but not necessarily on this journey Suppose she had given the mantle away to her maid for instance I believe ladies often pass on their things to their maids It is all pure presumption a mere theory This maid she has not as yet been imported into the discussion Then I would suggest that you do so without delay She is to my mind a well rather a curious person You know her spoke to her I know her in a way I had seen her in the Via Margutta and I nodded to her when she came first into the car And on the journey you spoke to her frequently I Oh dear no not at all I noticed her certainly I could not help it and perhaps I ought to tell her mistress She seemed to make friends a little too readily with people As for instance With the porter to begin with I saw them together at Laroche in the buffet at the bar and that Italian the man who was in here before me indeed with the murdered man She seemed to know them all Do you imply that the maid might be of use in this inquiry Most assuredly I do As I tell you she was constantly in and out of the car and more or less intimate with several of the passengers Including her mistress the Countess put in M Flocon The General laughed pleasantly Most ladies are I presume on intimate terms with their maids They say no man is a hero to his valet It is the same I suppose with the other sex So intimate went on the little detective with much malicious emphasis that now the maid has disappeared lest she might be asked inconvenient questions about her mistress Disappeared You are sure She cannot be found that is all we know It is as I thought then She it was who left the car cried Sir Charles with so much vehemence that the officials were startled out of their dignified reserve and shouted back almost in a breath Explain yourself Quick quick What in God s name do you mean I had my suspicions from the first and I will tell you why At Laroche the car emptied as you may have heard every one except the Countess at least went over to the restaurant for early coffee I with the rest I was one of the first to finish and I strolled back to the platform to get a few whiffs of a cigarette At that moment I saw or thought I saw the end of a skirt disappearing into the sleeping car I concluded it was this maid Hortense who was taking her mistress a cup of coffee Then my brother came up we exchanged a few words and entered the car together By the same door as that through which you had seen the skirt pass No by the other My brother went back to his berth but I paused in the corridor to finish my cigarette after the train had gone on By this time every one but myself had returned to his berth and I was on the point of lying down again for half an hour when I distinctly heard the handle turned of the compartment I knew to be vacant all through the run That was the one with berths eleven and twelve Probably It was next to the Countess Not only was the handle turned but the door partly opened It was not the porter Oh no he was in his seat you know it at the end of the car sound asleep snoring I could hear him Did any one come out of the vacant compartment No but I was almost certain I believe I could swear that I saw the same skirt just the hem of it a black skirt sway forward beyond the door just for a second Then all at once the door was closed again fast What did you conclude from this Or did you think nothing of it I thought very little I supposed it was that the maid wished to be near her mistress as we were approaching Paris and I had heard from the Countess that the porter had made many difficulties But you see after what has happened that there was a reason for stopping the train Quite so M Flocon readily admitted with a scarcely concealed sneer He had quite made up his mind now that it was the Countess who had rung the alarm bell in order to allow of the escape of the maid her confederate and accomplice And you still have an impression that some one presumably this woman got off the car somehow during the stoppage he asked I suggest it certainly Whether it was or could be so I must leave to your superior judgment What A woman climb out like that Bah Tell that to some one else You have of course examined the exterior of the car dear colleague now said the Judge Assuredly once but I will do it again Still the outside is quite smooth there is no foot board Only an acrobat could succeed in thus escaping and then only at the peril of his life But a woman oh no it is too absurd With help she might I think get up on to the roof quickly remarked Sir Charles I have looked out of the window of my compartment It would be nothing for a man nor much for a woman if assisted That we will see for ourselves said the detective ungraciously The sooner the better added the Judge and the whole party rose from their chairs intending to go straight to the car when the policeman on guard appeared at the door followed close by an English military officer in uniform whom he was trying to keep back but with no great success It was Colonel Papillon of the Embassy Halloa Jack you are a good chap cried the General quickly going forward to shake hands I was sure you would come Come sir Of course I came I was just going to an official function as you see but his Excellency insisted my horse was at the door and here I am All this was in English but the attache turned now to the officials and with many apologies for his intrusion suggested that they should allow his friend the General to return with him to the Embassy when they had done with him Of course we will answer for him He shall remain at your disposal and will appear whenever called upon He returned to Sir Charles asking You will promise that sir Oh willingly I had always meant to stay on a bit in Paris And really I should like to see the end of this But my brother He must get home for next Sunday s duty He has nothing to tell but he would come back to Paris at any time if his evidence was wanted The French Judge very obligingly agreed to all these proposals and two more of the detained passengers making four in all now left the station Then the officials proceeded to the car which still remained as the Chief Detective had left it Here they soon found how just were the General s previsions CHAPTER XI The three officials went straight to where the still open window showed the particular spot to be examined The exterior of the car was a little smirched and stained with the dust of the journey lying thick in parts and in others there were a few great splotches of mud plastered on The detective paused for a moment to get a general view looking in the light of the General s suggestion for either hand or foot marks anything like a trace of the passage of a feminine skirt across the dusty surface But nothing was to be seen nothing definite or conclusive at least Only here and there a few lines and scratches that might be encouraging but proved little Then the Commissary drawing nearer called attention to some suspicious spots sprinkled about the window but above it towards the roof What is it asked the detective as his colleague with the point of his long fore finger nail picked at the thin crust on the top of one of these spots disclosing a dark viscous core I could not swear to it but I believe it is blood Blood Good Heavens cried the detective as he dragged his powerful magnifying glass out of his pocket and applied it to the spot Look M le Juge he added after a long and minute examination What say you It has that appearance Only medical evidence can positively decide but I believe it is blood Now we are on the right track I feel convinced Some one fetch a ladder One of these curious French ladders narrow at the top splayed out at the base was quickly leaned against the car and the detective ran up using his magnifier as he climbed There is more here much more and something like yes beyond question it is the print of two hands upon the roof It was here she climbed No doubt I can see it now exactly She would sit on the window ledge the lower limbs inside the car here and held there Then with her hands she would draw herself up to the roof said the Judge But what nerve what strength of arm It was life and death Within the car was more terrible danger Fear will do much in such a case We all know that Well what more By this time the detective had stepped on to the roof of the car More more much more Footprints as plain as a picture A woman s feet Wait let me follow them to the end said he cautiously creeping forward to the end of the car A minute or two more and he rejoined his colleagues on the ground level and rubbing his hands declared joyously that it was all perfectly clear Dangerous or not difficult or not she did it I have traced her have seen where she must have lain crouching ever so long followed her all along the top of the car to the end where she got down above the little platform exit Beyond doubt she left the car when it stopped and by arrangement with her confederate The Countess Who else And at a point near Paris The English General said the halt was within twenty minutes run of the station Then it is from that point we must commence our search for her The Italian has gone on the wrong scent Not necessarily The maid we may be sure will try to communicate with her mistress Still it would be well to secure her before she can do that said the Judge With all we know now a sharp interrogation might extract some very damaging admissions from her went on the detective eagerly Who is to go I have sent away both my assistants Of course I can telephone for another man or I might go myself No no dear colleague we cannot spare you just yet Telephone by all means I presume you would wish to be present at the rest of the interrogatories Certainly you are right We may elicit more about this maid Let us call in the porter now He is said to have had relations with her Something more may be got out of him The more did not amount to much Groote the porter came in cringing and wretched in the abject state of a man who has lately been drugged and is now slowly recovering Although sharply questioned he had nothing to add to his first story Speak out said the Judge harshly Tell us everything plainly and promptly or I shall send you straight to gaol The order is already made out and as he spoke he waved a flimsy bit of paper before him I know nothing the porter protested piteously That is false We are fully informed and no fools We are certain that no such catastrophe could have occurred without your knowledge or connivance Indeed gentlemen indeed You were drinking with this maid at the buffet at Laroche You had more drink with her or from her hands afterwards in the car No gentlemen that is not so I could not she was not in the car We know better You cannot deceive us You were her accomplice and the accomplice of her mistress also I have no doubt I declare solemnly that I am quite innocent of all this I hardly remember what happened at Laroche or after I do not deny the drink at the buffet It was very nasty I thought and could not tell why nor why I could not hold my head up when I got back to the car You went off to sleep at once Is that what you pretend It must have been so Yes Then I know nothing more not till I was aroused And beyond this a tale to which he stuck with undeviating persistence they could elicit nothing He is either too clever for us or an absolute idiot and fool said the Judge wearily at last when Groote had gone out We had better commit him to Mazas and hold him there in solitary confinement under our hands After a day or two of that he may be less difficult It is quite clear he was drugged that the maid put opium or laudanum into his drink at Laroche And enough of it apparently for he says he went off to sleep directly he returned to the car the Judge remarked He says so But he must have had a second dose or why was the vial found on the ground by his seat asked the Chief thoughtfully as much of himself as of the others I cannot believe in a second dose How was it administered by whom It was laudanum and could only be given in a drink He says he had no second drink And by whom The maid He says he did not see the maid again Pardon me M le Juge but do you not give too much credibility to the porter For me his evidence is tainted and I hardly believe a word of it Did he not tell me at first he had not seen this maid after Amberieux at eight P M Now he admits that he was drinking with her at the buffet at Laroche It is all a tissue of lies his losing the pocket book and his papers too There is something to conceal Even his sleepiness his stupidity are likely to have been assumed I do not think he is acting he has not the ability to deceive us like that Well then what if the Countess took him the second drink Oh oh That is the purest conjecture There is nothing whatever to suggest or support that Then how explain the finding of the vial near the porter s seat May it not have been dropped there on purpose put in the Commissary with another flash of intelligence On purpose queried the detective crossly foreseeing an answer that would not please him On purpose to bring suspicion on the lady I don t see it in that light That would imply that she was not in the plot and plot there certainly was everything points to it The drugging the open window the maid s escape A plot no doubt but organized by whom These two women only Could either of them have struck the fatal blow Hardly Women have the wit to conceive but neither courage nor brute force to execute There was a man in this rest assured Granted But who That fire eating Sir Collingham quickly asked the detective giving rein once more to his hatred That is not a solution that commends itself to me I must confess declared the Judge The General s conduct has been blameworthy and injudicious but he is not of the stuff that makes criminals Who then The porter No The clergyman No The French gentlemen well we have not examined them yet but from what I saw at the first cursory glance I am not disposed to suspect them What of that Italian asked the Commissary Are you sure of him His looks did not please me greatly and he was very eager to get away from here What if he takes to his heels Block is with him the Chief put in hastily with the evident desire to stifle an unpleasant misgiving We have touch of him if we want him as we may How much they might want him they only realized when they got further in their inquiry CHAPTER XII Only the two Frenchmen remained for examination They had been left to the last by pure accident The exigencies of the inquiry had led to the preference of others but these two well broken and submissive gentlemen made no visible protest However much they may have chafed inwardly at the delay they knew better than to object any outburst of discontent would they knew recoil on themselves Not only were they perfectly patient now when summoned before the officers of justice they were most eager to give every assistance to the law to go beyond the mere letter and if needs be volunteer information The first called in was the elder M Anatole Lafolay a true Parisian bourgeois fat and comfortable unctuous in speech and exceedingly deferential The story he told was in its main outlines that which we already know but he was further questioned by the light of the latest facts and ideas as now elicited The line adroitly taken by the Judge was to get some evidence of collusion and combination among the passengers especially with reference to two of them the two women of the party On this important point M Lafolay had something to say Asked if he had seen or noticed the lady s maid on the journey he answered yes very decisively and with a smack of the lips as though the sight of this pretty and attractive person had given him considerable satisfaction Did you speak to her Oh no I had no opportunity Besides she had her own friends great friends I fancy I caught her more than once whispering in the corner of the car with one of them And that was I think the Italian gentleman I am almost sure I recognized his clothes I did not see his face it was turned from me towards hers and very close I may be permitted to say And they were friendly More than friendly I should say Very intimate indeed I should not have been surprised if when I turned away as a matter of fact if he did not touch just touch her red lips It would have been excusable forgive me messieurs Aha They were so intimate as that Indeed And did she reserve her favours exclusively for him Did no one else address her pay her court on the quiet you understand I saw her with the porter I believe at Laroche but only then No the Italian was her chief companion Did any one else notice the flirtation do you think Possibly There was no secrecy It was very marked We could all see And her mistress too That I will not say The lady I saw but little during the journey A few more questions mainly personal as to his address business probable presence in Paris for the next few weeks and M Lafolay was permitted to depart The examination of the younger Frenchman a smart alert young man of pleasant insinuating address with a quick inquisitive eye followed the same lines and was distinctly corroborative on all the points to which M Lafolay spoke But M Jules Devaux had something startling to impart concerning the Countess When asked if he had seen her or spoken to her he shook his head No she kept very much to herself he said I saw her but little hardly at all except at Modane She kept her own berth Where she received her own friends Oh beyond doubt The Englishmen both visited her there but not the Italian The Italian Are we to infer that she knew the Italian That is what I wish to convey Not on the journey though Between Rome and Paris she did not seem to know him It was afterwards this morning in fact that I came to the conclusion that there was some secret understanding between them Why do you say that M Devaux cried the detective excitedly Let me urge you and implore you to speak out and fully This is of the utmost of the very first importance Well gentlemen I will tell you As you are well aware on arrival at this station we were all ordered to leave the car and marched to the waiting room out there As a matter of course the lady entered first and she was seated when I went in There was a strong light on her face Was her veil down Not then I saw her lower it later and as I think for reasons I will presently put before you Madame has a beautiful face and I gazed at it with sympathy grieving for her in fact in such a trying situation when suddenly I saw a great and remarkable change come over it Of what character It was a look of horror disgust surprise a little perhaps of all three I could not quite say which it faded so quickly and was followed by a cold deathlike pallor Then almost immediately she lowered her veil Could you form any explanation for what you saw in her face What caused it Something unexpected I believe some shock or the sight of something shocking That was how it struck me and so forcibly that I turned to look over my shoulder expecting to find the reason there And it was That reason Was the entrance of the Italian who came just behind me I am certain of this he almost told me so himself not in words but the mistakable leer he gave her in reply It was wicked sardonic devilish and proved beyond doubt that there was some secret some guilty secret perhaps between them And was that all cried both the Judge and M Flocon in a breath leaning forward in their eagerness to hear more For the moment yes But I was made so interested so suspicious by this that I watched the Italian closely awaiting expecting further developments They were long in coming indeed I am only at the end now Explain pray as quickly as possible and in your own words It was like this monsieur When we were all seated I looked round and did not at first see our Italian At last I discovered he had taken a back seat through modesty perhaps or to be out of observation how was I to know He sat in the shadow by a door that in fact which leads into this room He was thus in the background rather out of the way but I could see his eyes glittering in that far off corner and they were turned in our direction always fixed upon the lady you understand She was next me the whole time Then as you will remember monsieur you called us in one by one and I with M Lafolay was the first to appear before you When I returned to the outer room the Italian was still staring but not so fixedly or continuously at the lady From time to time his eyes wandered towards a table near which he sat and which was just in the gangway or passage by which people must pass into your presence There was some reason for this I felt sure although I did not understand it immediately Presently I got at the hidden meaning There was a small piece of paper rolled up or crumpled up into a ball lying upon this table and the Italian wished nay was desperately anxious to call the lady s attention to it If I had had any doubt of this it was quite removed after the man had gone into the inner room As he left us he turned his head over his shoulder significantly and nodded very slightly but still perceptibly at the ball of paper Well gentlemen I was now satisfied in my own mind that this was some artful attempt of his to communicate with the lady and had she fallen in with it I should have immediately informed you the proper authorities But whether from stupidity dread disinclination a direct definite refusal to have any dealings with this man the lady would not at any rate did not pick up the ball as she might have done easily when she in her turn passed the table on her way to your presence I have no doubt it was thrown there for her and probably you will agree with me But it takes two to make a game of this sort and the lady would not join Neither on leaving the room nor on returning would she take up the missive And what became of it then asked the detective in breathless excitement I have it here M Devaux opened the palm of his hand and displayed the scrap of paper in the hollow rolled up into a small tight ball When and how did you become possessed of it I got it only just now when I was called in here Before that I could not move I was tied to my chair practically and ordered strictly not to move Perfectly Monsieur s conduct has been admirable And now tell us what does it contain Have you looked at it By no means It is just as I picked it up Will you gentlemen take it and if you think fit tell me what is there Some writing a message of some sort or I am greatly mistaken Yes here are words written in pencil said the detective unrolling the paper which he handed on to the Judge who read the contents aloud Be careful Say nothing If you betray me you will be lost too A long silence followed broken first by the Judge who said at last solemnly to Devaux Monsieur in the name of justice I beg to thank you most warmly You have acted with admirable tact and judgment and have rendered us invaluable assistance Have you anything further to tell us No gentlemen That is all And you you have no more questions to ask Then I presume I may withdraw Beyond doubt it had been reserved for the last witness to produce facts that constituted the very essence of the inquiry CHAPTER XIII The examination was now over and the dispositions having been drawn up and signed the investigating officials remained for some time in conference It lies with those three of course the two women and the Italian They are jointly conjointly concerned although the exact degrees of guilt cannot quite be apportioned said the detective And all three are at large added the Judge If you will issue warrants for arrest M le Juge we can take them two of them at any rate when we choose That should be at once remarked the Commissary eager as usual for decisive action Very well Let us proceed in that way Prepare the warrants said the Judge turning to his clerk And you he went on addressing M Flocon dear colleague will you see to their execution Madame is at the Hotel Madagascar that will be easy The Italian Ripaldi we shall hear of through your inspector Block As for the maid Hortense Petitpre we must search for her That too sir you will of course undertake I will charge myself with it certainly My man should be here by now and I will instruct him at once Ask for him said M Flocon to the guard whom he called in The inspector is there said the guard pointing to the outer room He has just returned Returned You mean arrived No monsieur returned It is Block who left an hour or more ago Block Then something has happened he has some special information some great news Shall we see him M le Juge When Block appeared it was evident that something had gone wrong with him His face wore a look of hot flurried excitement and his manner was one of abject cringing self abasement What is it asked the little Chief sharply You are alone Where is your man Alas monsieur how shall I tell you He has gone disappeared I have lost him Impossible You cannot mean it Gone now just when we most want him Never It is so unhappily Idiot Triple idiot You shall be dismissed discharged from this hour You are a disgrace to the force M Flocon raved furiously at his abashed subordinate blaming him a little too harshly and unfairly forgetting that until quite recently there had been no strong suspicion against the Italian We are apt at times to expect others to be intuitively possessed of knowledge that has only come to us at a much later date How was it Explain Of course you have been drinking It is that or your great gluttony You were beguiled into some eating house Monsieur you shall hear the exact truth When we started more than an hour ago our fiacre took the usual route by the Quais and along the riverside My gentleman made himself most pleasant No doubt growled the Chief Offered me an excellent cigar and talked not about the affair you understand but of Paris the theatres the races Longchamps Auteuil the grand restaurants He knew everything all Paris like his pocket I was much surprised but he told me his business often brought him here He had been employed to follow up several great Italian criminals and had made a number of important arrests in Paris Get on get on come to the essential Well in the middle of the journey when we were about the Pont Henri Quatre he said Figure to yourself my friend that it is now near noon that nothing has passed my lips since before daylight at Laroche What say you Could you eat a mouthful just a scrap on the thumb nail Could you And you greedy gormandizing beast you agreed My faith monsieur I too was hungry It was my regular hour Well at any rate for my sins I accepted We entered the first restaurant that of the Reunited Friends you know it perhaps monsieur A good house especially noted for tripe a la mode de Caen In spite of his anguish Block smacked his fat lips at the thought of this most succulent but very greasy dish How often must I tell you to get on Forgive me monsieur but it is all part of my story We had oysters two dozen Marennes and a glass or two of Chablis then a good portion of tripe and with them a bottle only one monsieur of Pontet Canet after that a beefsteak with potatoes and a little Burgundy then a rum omelet Great Heavens you should be the fat man in a fair not an agent of the Detective Bureau It was all this that helped me to my destruction He ate this devilish Italian like three and I too I was so hungry forgive me sir I did my share But by the time we reached the cheese a fine ripe Camembert had our coffee and one thimbleful of green Chartreuse I was plein jusqu au bec gorged up to the beak And what of your duty your service pray I did think of it monsieur but then he the Italian was just the same as myself He was a colleague I had no fear of him not till the very last when he played me this evil turn I suspected nothing when he brought out his pocketbook it was stuffed full monsieur I saw that and my confidence increased called for the reckoning and paid with an Italian bank note The waiter looked doubtful at the foreign money and went out to consult the manager A minute after my man got up saying There may be some trouble about changing that bank note Excuse me one moment pray He went out monsieur and piff paff he was no more to be seen Ah nigaud ass you are too foolish to live Why did you not follow him Why let him out of your sight But monsieur I was not to know was I I was to accompany him not to watch him I have done wrong I confess But then who was to tell he meant to run away M Flocon could not deny the justice of this defence It was only now at the eleventh hour that the Italian had become inculpated and the question of his possible anxiety to escape had never been considered He was so artful went on Block in further extenuation of his offence He left everything behind His overcoat stick this book his own private memorandum book seemingly Book Hand it me said the Chief and when it came into his hands he began to turn over the leaves hurriedly It was a small brass bound note book or diary and was full of close writing in pencil I do not understand not more than a word here and there It is no doubt Italian Do you know that language M le Juge Not perfectly but I can read it Allow me He also turned over the pages pausing to read a passage here and there and nodding his head from time to time evidently struck with the importance of the matter recorded Meanwhile M Flocon continued an angry conversation with his offending subordinate You will have to find him Block and that speedily within twenty four hours to day indeed or I will break you like a stick and send you into the gutter Of course such a consummate ass as you have proved yourself would not think of searching the restaurant or the immediate neighbourhood or of making inquiries as to whether he had been seen or as to which way he had gone Pardon me monsieur is too hard on me I have been unfortunate a victim to circumstances still I believe I know my duty Yes I made inquiries and what is more I heard of him Where how asked the Chief gruffly but obviously much interested He never spoke to the manager but walked out and let the change go It was a note for a hundred lire a hundred francs and the restaurant bill was no more than seventeen francs Hah that is greatly against him indeed He was much pressed in a great hurry Directly he crossed the threshold he called the first cab and was driving away but he was stopped The devil Why did they not keep him then Stopped but only for a moment and accosted by a woman A woman Yes monsieur They exchanged but three words He wished to pass on to leave her she would not consent then they both got into the cab and were driven away together The officials were now listening with all ears Tell me said the Chief quick this woman what was she like Did you get her description Tall slight well formed dressed all in black Her face it was a policeman who saw her and he said she was good looking dark brunette black hair It is the maid herself cried the little Chief springing up and slapping his thigh in exuberant glee The maid the missing maid CHAPTER XIV The joy of the Chief of Detectives at having thus come as he supposed upon the track of the missing maid Hortense Petitpre was somewhat dashed by the doubts freely expressed by the Judge as to the result of any search Since Block s return M Beaumont le Hardi had developed strong symptoms of discontent and disapproval at his colleague s proceedings But if it was this Hortense Petitpre how did she get there by the bridge Henri Quatre when we thought to find her somewhere down the line It cannot be the same woman I beg your pardon gentlemen interposed Block May I say one word I believe I can supply some interesting information about Hortense Petitpre I understand that some one like her was seen here in the station not more than an hour ago Peste Why were we not told this sooner cried the Chief impetuously Who saw her Did he speak to her Call him in let us see how much he knows The man was summoned one of the subordinate railway officials who made a specific report Yes he had seen a tall slight neat looking woman dressed entirely in black who according to her account had arrived at ten point thirty by the slow local train from Dijon Fichtre said the Chief angrily and this is the first we have heard of it Monsieur was much occupied at the time and indeed then we had not heard of your inquiry I notified the station master quite early two or three hours since about nine A M This is most exasperating Instructions to look out for this woman have only just reached us monsieur There were certain formalities I suppose For once the detective cursed in his heart the red tape roundabout ways of French officialism Well well Tell me about her he said with a resignation he did not feel Who saw her I monsieur I spoke to her myself She was on the outside of the station alone unprotected in a state of agitation and alarm I went up and offered my services Then she told me she had come from Dijon that friends who were to have met her had not appeared I suggested that I should put her into a cab and send her to her destination But she was afraid of losing her friends and preferred to wait A fine story Did she appear to know what had happened Had she heard of the murder Something monsieur Who could have told her Did you No not I But she knew Was not that in itself suspicious The fact has not yet been made public It was in the air monsieur There was a general impression that something had happened That was to be seen on every face in the whispered talk the movement to and fro of the police and the guards Did she speak of it or refer to it Only to ask if the murderer was known whether the passengers had been detained whether there was any inquiry in progress and then What then This gentleman pointing to Block came out accompanied by another They passed pretty close to us and I noticed that the lady slipped quickly on one side She recognized her confederate of course but did not wish to be seen just then Did he the person with Block here see her Hardly I think it was all so quick and they were gone in a minute to the cab stand What did your woman do She seemed to have changed her mind all at once and declared she would not wait for her friends Now she was in quite a hurry to go Of course and left you like a fool planted there I suppose she took a cab and followed the others Block here and his companion I believe she did I saw her cab close behind theirs It is too late to lament this now said the Chief after a short pause looking at his colleagues At least it confirms our ideas and brings us to certain definite conclusions We must lay hands on these two Their guilt is all but established Their own acts condemn them They must be arrested without a moment s delay If you can find them suggested the Judge with a very perceptible sneer That we shall certainly do Trust to Block who is very nearly concerned His future depends on his success You quite understand that my man Block made a gesture half deprecating half confident I do not despair gentlemen and if I might make so bold sir I will ask you to assist If you would give orders direct from the Prefecture to make the round of the cab stands to ask of all the agents in charge the information we need Before night we shall have heard from the cabman who drove them what became of this couple and so get our birds themselves or a point of fresh departure And you Block where shall you go Where I left him or rather where he left me replied the inspector with an attempt at wit which fell quite flat being extinguished by a frigid look from the Judge Go said M Flocon briefly and severely to his subordinate and remember that you have now to justify your retention on the force Then turning to M Beaumont le Hardi the Chief went on pleasantly Well M le Juge it promises I think it is all fairly satisfactory eh I am sorry I cannot agree with you replied the Judge harshly On the contrary I consider that we or more exactly you for neither I nor M Garraud accept any share in it you have so far failed and miserably Your pardon M le Juge you are too severe protested M Flocon quite humbly Well Look at it from all points of view What have we got What have we gained Nothing or if anything it is of the smallest and it is already jeopardized if not absolutely lost We have at least gained the positive assurance of the guilt of certain individuals Whom you have allowed to slip through your fingers Ah not so M le Juge We have one under surveillance My man Galipaud is there at the hotel watching the Countess Do not talk to me of your men M Flocon angrily interposed the Judge One of them has given us a touch of his quality Why should not the other be equally foolish I quite expect to hear that the Countess also has gone that would be the climax It shall not happen I will take the warrant and arrest her now at once myself cried M Flocon Well that will be something yet not much Yes she is only one and not to my mind the most criminal We do not know as yet the exact responsibility of each the exact measure of their guilt but I do not myself believe that the Countess was a prime mover or indeed more than an accessory She was drawn into it perhaps involved how or why we cannot know but possibly by fortuitous circumstances that put an unavoidable pressure upon her a consenting party but under protest That is my view of the lady M Flocon shook his head Prepossessions with him were tenacious and he had made up his mind about the Countess s guilt When you again interrogate her M le Juge by the light of your present knowledge I believe you will think otherwise She will confess you will make her your skill is unrivalled and you will then admit M le Juge that I was right in my suspicions Ah well produce her We shall see said the Judge somewhat mollified by M Flocon s fulsome flattery I will bring her to your chamber of instruction within an hour M le Juge said the detective very confidently But he was doomed to disappointment in this as he was in other respects CHAPTER XV Let us go back a little in point of time and follow the movements of Sir Charles Collingham It was barely eleven A M when he left the Lyons Station with his brother 
7702-96101-0000	train-other-500	the Reverend Silas and the military attache Colonel Papillon They paused for a moment outside the station while the baggage was being got together
none	none	 See Silas said the General pointing to the clock you will have plenty of time for the eleven point fifty train to Calais for London 
7702-96101-0001	train-other-500	but you must hurry up and drive straight across Paris to the Nord I suppose he can go Jack Certainly as he has promised to return if called upon And mister Collingham promptly took advantage of the permission
none	none	 But you General what are your plans 
7702-96101-0002	train-other-500	went on the attache I shall go to the club first get a room dress and all that Then call at the Hotel Madagascar There is a lady there one of our party in fact and I should like to ask after her She may be glad of my services
7702-96101-0003	train-other-500	English Is there anything we can do for her Yes she is an Englishwoman
none	none	 but the widow of an Italian 
7702-96101-0004	train-other-500	the Contessa di Castagneto Oh but I know her said Papillon I remember her in Rome two or three years ago A deuced pretty woman very much admired but she was in deep mourning then and went out very little
7702-96101-0005	train-other-500	I wished she had gone out more There were lots of men ready to fall at her feet You were in Rome then some time back Did you ever come across a man there Quadling the banker Of course I did Constantly
7702-96101-0006	train-other-500	He was a good deal about a rather free living self indulgent sort of chap
none	none	 And now you mention his name I recollect they said he was much smitten by this particular lady the Contessa di Castagneto 
7702-96101-0007	train-other-500	And did she encourage him Lord how can I tell Who shall say how a woman s fancy falls It might have suited her too
none	none	 They said she was not in very good circumstances and he was thought to be a rich man 
7702-96101-0008	train-other-500	Of course we know better than that now Why now Haven t you heard It was in the Figaro yesterday and in all the Paris papers Quadling s bank has gone to smash he has bolted with all the ready he could lay hands upon He didn t get far then
7702-96101-0009	train-other-500	cried Sir Charles You look surprised Jack Didn t they tell you This Quadling was the man murdered in the sleeping car It was no doubt for the money he carried with him Was it Quadling My word what a terrible Nemesis Well
7702-96101-0010	train-other-500	nil nisi bonum but I never thought much of the chap and your friend the Countess has had an escape But now sir I must be moving My engagement is for twelve noon If you want me
none	none	 mind you send two hundred seven Rue Miromesnil or to the Embassy 
7702-96101-0011	train-other-500	but let us arrange to meet this evening eh
none	none	 Dinner and a theatre what do you say 
7702-96101-0012	train-other-500	Then Colonel Papillon rode off and the General was driven to the Boulevard des Capucines having much to occupy his thoughts by the way It did not greatly please him to have this story of the Countess s relations with Quadling as first hinted at by the police
7702-96101-0013	train-other-500	endorsed now by his friend Papillon Clearly she had kept up her acquaintance her intimacy to the very last why otherwise should she have received him alone been closeted with him for an hour or more on the very eve of his flight
7702-96101-0014	train-other-500	It was a clandestine acquaintance too or seemed so for Sir Charles although a frequent visitor at her house had never met Quadling there
none	none	 What did it all mean 
7702-96101-0015	train-other-500	And yet what after all did it matter to him A good deal really more than he chose to admit to himself even now when closely questioning his secret heart The fact was the Countess had made a very strong impression on him from the first
7702-96101-0016	train-other-500	He had admired her greatly during the past winter at Rome but then it was only a passing fancy as he thought
none	none	 the pleasant platonic flirtation of a middle aged man who never expected to inspire or feel a great love 
7702-96101-0017	train-other-500	Only now when he had shared a serious trouble with her had passed through common difficulties and dangers he was finding what accident may do how it may fan a first liking into a stronger flame
7702-96101-0018	train-other-500	It was absurd of course He was fifty one he had weathered many trifling affairs of the heart and here he was bowled over at last and by a woman he was not certain was entitled to his respect What was he to do
7702-96101-0019	train-other-500	The answer came at once and unhesitatingly as it would to any other honest chivalrous gentleman By George I ll stick to her through thick and thin I ll trust her whatever happens or has happened come what may
7702-96101-0020	train-other-500	Such a woman as that is above suspicion She must be straight I should be a beast and a blackguard double distilled to think anything else I am sure she can put all right with a word can explain everything when she chooses
7702-96101-0021	train-other-500	I will wait till she does Thus fortified and decided Sir Charles took his way to the Hotel Madagascar about noon At the desk he inquired for the Countess and begged that his card might be sent up to her The man looked at it
7702-96101-0022	train-other-500	then at the visitor as he stood there waiting rather impatiently then again at the card At last he walked out and across the inner courtyard of the hotel to the office Presently the manager came back bowing low and holding the card in his hand
7702-96101-0023	train-other-500	began a desultory conversation Yes yes cried the General angrily cutting short all references to the weather and the number of English visitors in Paris But be so good as to let Madame la Comtesse know that I have called Ah to be sure
none	none	 I came to tell Monsieur le General that madame will hardly be able to see him 
7702-96101-0024	train-other-500	She is indisposed I believe At any rate she does not receive to day As to that we shall see I will take no answer except direct from her Take or send up my card without further delay I insist Do you hear
7702-96101-0025	train-other-500	said the General so fiercely that the manager turned tail and fled up stairs Perhaps he yielded his ground the more readily that he saw over the General s shoulder the figure of Galipaud the detective looming in the archway
none	none	 It had been arranged that 
7702-96101-0026	train-other-500	as it was not advisable to have the inspector hanging about the courtyard of the hotel the clerk or the manager should keep watch over the Countess and detain any visitors who might call upon her Galipaud had taken post at a wine shop over the way and was to be summoned whenever his presence was thought necessary
7702-96101-0027	train-other-500	There he was now standing just behind the General and for the present unseen by him
none	none	 But then a telegraph messenger came in and up to the desk 
7702-96101-0028	train-other-500	He held the usual blue envelope in his hand and called out the name on the address Castagneto Contessa Castagneto
none	none	 At sound of which the General turned sharply to find Galipaud advancing and stretching out his hand to take the message 
7702-96101-0029	train-other-500	Pardon me cried Sir Charles promptly interposing and understanding the situation at a glance
none	none	 I am just going up to see that lady 
7702-96101-0030	train-other-500	Give me the telegram Galipaud would have disputed the point when the General who had already recognized him said quietly No no Inspector you have no earthly right to it I guess why you are here but you are not entitled to interfere with private correspondence
7702-96101-0031	train-other-500	Stand back and seeing the detective hesitate he added peremptorily
none	none	 Enough of this I order you to get out of the way And be quick about it 
7702-96101-0032	train-other-500	The manager now returned and admitted that Madame la Comtesse would receive her visitor A few seconds more and the General was admitted into her presence How truly kind of you to call
7702-96101-0033	train-other-500	she said at once coming up to him with both hands outstretched and frank gladness in her eyes Yes she was very attractive in her plain dark travelling dress draping her tall graceful figure her beautiful pale face was enhanced by the rich tones of her dark brown wavy hair
7702-96101-0034	train-other-500	while just a narrow band of white muslin at her wrists and neck set off the dazzling clearness of her skin Of course I came I thought you might want me or might like to know the latest news he answered as he held her hands in his for a few seconds longer than was perhaps absolutely necessary
7702-96101-0035	train-other-500	Oh do tell me Is there anything fresh There was a flash of crimson colour in her cheek which faded almost instantly This much They have found out who the man was Really
none	none	 Positively Whom do they say now Perhaps I had better not tell you

none	none	 I have had too many shocks already 
7702-96101-0037	train-other-500	Who do they think it is A mister Quadling a banker who is supposed to have absconded from Rome She received the news so impassively with such strange self possession that for a moment he was disappointed in her But then
7702-96101-0038	train-other-500	quick to excuse he suggested You may have already heard
none	none	 Yes the police people at the railway station told me they thought it was mister Quadling 
7702-96101-0039	train-other-500	But you knew him Certainly They were my bankers much to my sorrow
none	none	 I shall lose heavily by their failure That also has reached you then 
7702-96101-0040	train-other-500	interrupted the General hastily and somewhat uneasily To be sure The man told me of it himself
none	none	 Indeed he came to me the very day I was leaving Rome and made me an offer a most obliging offer To share his fallen fortunes Sir Charles Collingham How can you 
7702-96101-0041	train-other-500	That creature The contempt in her tone was immeasurable I had heard well some one said that Speak out General I shall not be offended I know what you mean It is perfectly true that the man once presumed to pester me with his attentions But
7702-96101-0042	train-other-500	I would as soon have looked at a courier or a cook And now There was a pause The General felt on delicate ground He could ask no questions anything more must come from the Countess herself
7702-96101-0043	train-other-500	But let me tell you what his offer was I don t know why I listened to it I ought to have at once informed the police I wish I had
none	none	 It might have saved him from his fate 
7702-96101-0044	train-other-500	Every villain gets his deserts in the long run she said with bitter sententiousness And this mister Quadling is But wait you shall know him better He came to me to propose what do you think that he his bank I mean
7702-96101-0045	train-other-500	should secretly repay me the amount of my deposit all the money I had in it To join me in his fraud in fact The scoundrel Upon my word he has been well served And that was the last you saw of him I saw him on the journey
7702-96101-0046	train-other-500	at Turin at Modane at
none	none	 Oh Sir Charles do not ask me any more about him she cried with a sudden outburst 
7702-96101-0047	train-other-500	half grief half dread I cannot tell you I am obliged to I I Then do not say another word he said promptly There are other things But my lips are sealed at least for the present You do not will not think any worse of me
7702-96101-0048	train-other-500	She laid her hand gently on his arm and his closed over it with such evident good will that a blush crimsoned her cheek It still hung there and deepened when he said warmly As if anything could make me do that Don t you know
7702-96101-0049	train-other-500	you may not but let me assure you Countess that nothing could happen to shake me in the high opinion I have of you Come what may I shall trust you believe in you think well of you always How sweet of you to say that and now of all times
7702-96101-0050	train-other-500	she murmured quite softly and looking up for the first time shyly to meet his eyes Her hand was still on his arm covered by his and she nestled so close to him that it was easy natural indeed
7702-96101-0051	train-other-500	for him to slip his other arm around her waist and draw her to him And now of all times may I say one word more he whispered in her ear Will you give me the right to shelter and protect you to stand by you share your troubles
7702-96101-0052	train-other-500	or keep them from you No no no indeed not now She looked up appealingly the tears brimming up in her bright eyes I cannot will not accept this sacrifice
7702-96101-0053	train-other-500	You are only speaking out of your true hearted chivalry You must not join yourself to me you must not involve yourself He stopped her protests by the oldest and most effectual method known in such cases
7702-96101-0054	train-other-500	That first sweet kiss sealed the compact so quickly entered into between them And after that she surrendered at discretion There was no more hesitation or reluctance she accepted his love as he had offered it
7702-96101-0055	train-other-500	freely with whole heart and soul crept up under his sheltering wing like a storm beaten dove reentering the nest and there cooing softly My knight my own true knight and lord yielded herself willingly and unquestioningly to his tender caresses
none	none	 Such moments snatched from the heart of pressing anxieties are made doubly sweet by their sharp contrast with a background of trouble CHAPTER XVI They sat there these two hand locked in hand saying little satisfied now to be with each other and their new found love The time flew by far too fast till at last Sir Charles with a half laugh suggested Do you know dearest Countess She corrected him in a soft low voice My name is Sabine Charles Sabine darling It is very prosaic of me perhaps but do you know that I am nearly starved I came on here at once I have had no breakfast Nor have I she answered smiling I was thinking of it when when you appeared like a whirlwind and since then events have moved so fast Are you sorry Sabine Would you rather go back to to before She made a pretty gesture of closing his traitor lips with her small hand Not for worlds But you soldiers you are terrible men Who can resist you Bah It is you who are irresistible But there why not put on your jacket and let us go out to lunch somewhere Durand s Voisin s the Cafe de le Paix Which do you prefer I suppose they will not try to stop us Who should try he asked The people of the hotel the police I cannot exactly say whom but I dread something of the sort I don t quite understand that manager He has been up to see me several times and he spoke rather oddly rather rudely Then he shall answer for it snorted Sir Charles hotly It is the fault of that brute of a detective I suppose Still they would hardly dare A detective What Here Are you sure Perfectly sure It is one of those from the Lyons Station I knew him again directly and he was inclined to be interfering Why I caught him trying but that reminds me I rescued this telegram from his clutches He took the little blue envelope from his breast pocket and handed it to her kissing the tips of her fingers as she took it from him Ah A sudden ejaculation of dismay escaped her when after rather carelessly tearing the message open she had glanced at it What is the matter he asked in eager solicitude May I not know She made no offer to give him the telegram and said in a faltering voice and with much hesitation of manner I do not know I hardly think of course I do not like to withhold anything not now And yet this is a business which concerns me only I am afraid I ought not to drag you into it What concerns you is very much my business too I do not wish to force your confidence still She gave him the telegram quite obediently with a little sigh of relief glad to realize now for the first time after many years that there was some one to give her orders and take the burden of trouble off her shoulders He read it but did not understand it in the least It ran I must see you immediately and beg you will come You will find Hortense here She is giving trouble You only can deal with her Do not delay Come at once or we must go to you Ripaldi Hotel Ivoire Rue Bellechasse What does this mean Who sends it Who is Ripaldi asked Sir Charles rather brusquely He he oh Charles I shall have to go Anything would be better than his coming here Ripaldi Haven t I heard the name He was one of those in the sleeping car I think The Chief of the Detective Police called it out once or twice Am I not right Please tell me am I not right Yes yes this man was there with the rest of us A dark man who sat near the door Ah to be sure But what what in Heaven s name has he to do with you How does he dare to send you such an impudent message as this Surely Sabine you will tell me You will admit that I have a right to ask Yes of course I will tell you Charles everything but not here not now It must be on the way I have been very wrong very foolish but oh come come do let us be going I am so afraid he might Then I may go with you You do not object to that I much prefer it much Do let us make haste She snatched up her sealskin jacket and held it to him prettily that he might help her into it which he did neatly and cleverly smoothing her great puffed out sleeves under each shoulder of the coat still talking eagerly and taking no toll for his trouble as she stood patiently passively before him And this Hortense It is your maid is it not the woman who had taken herself off How comes it that she is with that Italian fellow Upon my soul I don t understand not a little bit I cannot explain that either It is most strange most incomprehensible but we shall soon know Please Charles please do not get impatient They passed together down into the hotel courtyard and across it under the archway which led past the clerk s desk into the street On seeing them he came out hastily and placed himself in front quite plainly barring their egress Oh madame one moment he said in a tone that was by no means conciliatory The manager wants to speak to you he told me to tell you and stop you if you went out The manager can speak to madame when she returns interposed the General angrily answering for the Countess I have had my orders and I cannot allow her Stand aside you scoundrel cried the General blazing up or upon my soul I shall give you such a lesson you will be sorry you were ever born At this moment the manager himself appeared in reinforcement and the clerk turned to him for protection and support I was merely giving madame your message M Auguste when this gentleman interposed threatened me maltreated me Oh surely not it is some mistake the manager spoke most suavely But certainly I did wish to speak to madame I wished to ask her whether she was satisfied with her apartment I find that the rooms she has generally occupied have fallen vacant in the nick of time Perhaps madame would like to look at them and move Thank you M Auguste you are very good but at another time I am very much pressed just now When I return in an hour or two not now The manager was profuse in his apologies and made no further difficulty Oh as you please madame Perfectly By and by later when you choose The fact was the desired result had been obtained For now on the far side from where he had been watching Galipaud appeared no doubt in reply to some secret signal and the detective with a short nod in acknowledgment had evidently removed his embargo A cab was called and Sir Charles having put the Countess in was turning to give the driver his instructions when a fresh complication arose Some one coming round the corner had caught a glimpse of the lady disappearing into the fiacre and cried out from afar Stay Stop I want to speak to that lady detain her It was the sharp voice of little M Flocon whom most of those present certainly the Countess and Sir Charles immediately recognized No no no don t let them keep me I cannot wait now she whispered in earnest urgent appeal It was not lost on her loyal and devoted friend Go on he shouted to the cabman with all the peremptory insistence of one trained to give words of command Forward As fast as you can drive I ll pay you double fare Tell him where to go Sabine I ll follow in less than no time The fiacre rattled off at top speed and the General turned to confront M Flocon The little detective was white to the lips with rage and disappointment but he also was a man of promptitude and before falling foul of this pestilent Englishman who had again marred his plans he shouted to Galipaud Quick After them Follow her wherever she goes Take this he thrust a paper into his subordinate s hand It is a warrant for her arrest Seize her wherever you find her and bring her to the Quai l Horloge the euphemistic title of the headquarters of the French police The pursuit was started at once and then the Chief turned upon Sir Charles Now it is between us he said fiercely You must account to me for what you have done Must I answered the General mockingly and with a little laugh It is perfectly easy Madame was in a hurry so I helped her to get away That was all You have traversed and opposed the action of the law You have impeded me the Chief of the Detective Service in the execution of my duty It is not the first time but now you must answer for it Dear me said the General in the same flippant irritating tone You will have to accompany me now to the Prefecture And if it does not suit me to go I will have you carried there bound tied hand and foot by the police like any common rapscallion taken in the act who resists the authority of an officer Oho you talk very big sir Perhaps you will be so obliging as to tell me what I have done You have connived at the escape of a criminal from justice That lady Psha She is charged with a heinous crime that in which you yourself were implicated the murder of that man on the train Bah You must be a stupid goose to hint at such a thing A lady of birth breeding the highest respectability impossible All that has not prevented her from allying herself with base common wretches I do not say she struck the blow but I believe she inspired concerted approved it leaving her confederates to do the actual deed Confederates The man Ripaldi your Italian fellow traveller her maid Hortense Petitpre who was missing this morning The General was fairly staggered at this unexpected blow Half an hour ago he would have scouted the very thought indignantly repelled the spoken words that even hinted a suspicion of Sabine Castagneto But that telegram signed Ripaldi the introduction of the maid s name and the suggestion that she was troublesome the threat that if the Countess did not go they would come to her and her marked uneasiness thereat all this implied plainly the existence of collusion of some secret relations some secret understanding between her and the others He could not entirely conceal the trouble that now overcame him it certainly did not escape so shrewd an observer as M Flocon who promptly tried to turn it to good account Come M le General he said with much assumed bonhomie I can see how it is with you and you have my sincere sympathy We are all of us liable to be carried away and there is much excuse for you in this But now believe me I am justified in saying it now I tell you that our case is strong against her that it is not mere speculation but supported by facts Now surely you will come over to our side In what way Tell us frankly all you know where that lady has gone help us to lay our hands on her Your own people will do that I heard you order that man to follow her Probably still I would rather have the information from you It would satisfy me of your good will I need not then proceed to extremities I certainly shall not give it you said the General hotly Anything I know about or have heard from the Contessa Castagneto is sacred besides I still believe in her thoroughly Nothing you have said can shake me Then I must ask you to accompany me to the Prefecture You will come I trust on my invitation The Chief spoke quietly but with considerable dignity and he laid a slight stress upon the last word Meaning that if I do not you will have resort to something stronger That will be quite unnecessary I am sure at least I hope so Still I will go where you like only I will tell you nothing more not a single word and before I start I must let my friends at the Embassy know where to find me Oh with all my heart said the little detective shrugging his shoulders We will call there on our way and you can tell the porter They will know where to find us CHAPTER XVII Sir Charles Collingham and his escort M Flocon entered a cab together and were driven first to the Faubourg saint Honore The General tried hard to maintain his nonchalance but he was yet a little crestfallen at the turn things had taken and M Flocon who on the other hand was elated and triumphant saw it But no words passed between them until they arrived at the portals of the British Embassy and the General handed out his card to the magnificent porter who received them Kindly let Colonel Papillon have that without delay The General had written a few words I have got into fresh trouble Come on to me at the Police Prefecture if you can spare the time The Colonel is now in the Chancery will not monsieur wait asked the porter with superb civility But the detective would not suffer this and interposed answering abruptly for Sir Charles No It is impossible We are going to the Quai l Horloge It is an urgent matter The porter knew what the Quai l Horloge meant and he guessed intuitively who was speaking Every Frenchman can recognize a police officer and has as a rule no great opinion of him Very well now said the porter curtly as he banged the wicket gate on the retreating cab and he did not hurry himself in giving the card to Colonel Papillon Does this mean that I am a prisoner asked Sir Charles his gorge rising as it did easily It means monsieur that you are in the hands of justice until your recent conduct has been fully explained said the detective with the air of a despot But I protest I wish to hear no further observations monsieur You may reserve them till you can give them to the right person The General s temper was sorely ruffled He did not like it at all yet what could he do Prudence gained the day and after a struggle he decided to submit lest worse might befall him There was in truth worse to be encountered It was very irksome to be in the power of this now domineering little man on his own ground and eager to show his power It was with a very bad grace that Sir Charles obeyed the curt orders he received to leave the cab to enter at a side door of the Prefecture to follow this pompous conductor along the long vaulted passages of this rambling building up many flights of stone stairs to halt obediently at his command when at length they reached a closed door on an upper story It is here said M Flocon as he turned the handle unceremoniously without knocking Enter A man was seated at a small desk in the centre of a big bare room who rose at once at the sight of M Flocon and bowed deferentially without speaking Baume said the Chief shortly I wish to leave this gentleman with you Make him at home the words were spoken in manifest irony and when I call you bring him at once to my cabinet You monsieur you will oblige me by staying here Sir Charles nodded carelessly took the first chair that offered and sat down by the fire He was to all intents and purposes in custody and he examined his gaoler at first wrathfully then curiously struck with his rather strange figure and appearance Baume as the Chief had called him was a short thick set man with a great shock head sunk in low between a pair of enormous shoulders betokening great physical strength he stood on very thin but greatly twisted bow legs and the quaintness of his figure was emphasized by the short black blouse or smock frock he wore over his other clothes like a French artisan He was a man of few words and those not the most polite in tone for when the General began with a banal remark about the weather M Baume replied shortly I wish to have no talk and when Sir Charles pulled out his cigarette case as he did almost automatically from time to time when in any situation of annoyance or perplexity Baume raised his hand warningly and grunted Not allowed Then I ll be hanged if I don t smoke in spite of every man jack of you cried the General hotly rising from his seat and speaking unconsciously in English What s that asked Baume gruffly He was one of the detective staff and was only doing his duty according to his lights and he said so with such an injured air that the General was pacified laughed and relapsed into silence without lighting his cigarette The time ran on from minutes into nearly an hour a very trying wait for Sir Charles There is always something irritating in doing antechamber work in kicking one s heels in the waiting room of any functionary or official high or low and the General found it hard to possess himself in patience when he thought he was being thus ignominiously treated by a man like M Flocon All the time too he was worrying himself about the Countess wondering first how she had fared next where she was just then last of all and longest whether it was possible for her to be mixed up in anything compromising or criminal Suddenly an electric bell struck in the room There was a table telephone at Baume s elbow he took up the handle put the tube to his mouth and ear got his message answered and then rising said abruptly to Sir Charles Come When the General was at last ushered into the presence of the Chief of the Detective Police he found to his satisfaction that Colonel Papillon was also there and at M Flocon s side sat the instructing judge M Beaumont le Hardi who after waiting politely until the two Englishmen had exchanged greetings was the first to speak and in apology You will I trust pardon us M le General for having detained you here and so long But there were as we thought good and sufficient reasons If those have now lost some of their cogency we still stand by our action as having been justifiable in the execution of our duty We are now willing to let you go free because because We have caught the person the lady you helped to escape blurted out the detective unable to resist making the point The Countess Is she here in custody Never Undoubtedly she is in custody and in very close custody too went on M Flocon gleefully Au secret if you know what that means in a cell separate and apart where no one is permitted to see or speak to her Surely not that Jack Papillon this must not be I beg of you implore insist that you will get his lordship to interpose But sir how can I You must not ask impossibilities The Contessa Castagneto is really an Italian subject now She is English by birth and whether or no she is a woman a high bred lady and it is abominable unheard of to subject her to such monstrous treatment said the General But these gentlemen declare that they are fully warranted that she has put herself in the wrong greatly culpably in the wrong I don t believe it cried the General indignantly Not from these chaps a pack of idiots always on the wrong tack I don t believe a word not if they swear But they have documentary evidence papers of the most damaging kind against her Where How He M le Juge has been showing me a note book and the General s eyes following Jack Papillon s were directed to a small carnet or memorandum book which the Judge interpreting the glance was tapping significantly with his finger Then the Judge said blandly It is easy to perceive that you protest M le General against that lady s arrest Is it so Well we are not called upon to justify it to you not in the very least But we are dealing with a brave man a gentleman an officer of high rank and consideration and you shall know things that we are not bound to tell to you or to any one First he continued holding up the note book do you know what this is Have you ever seen it before I am dimly conscious of the fact and yet I cannot say when or where It is the property of one of your fellow travellers an Italian called Ripaldi Ripaldi said the General remembering with some uneasiness that he had seen the name at the bottom of the Countess s telegram Ah now I understand You had heard of it then In what connection asked the Judge a little carelessly but it was a suddenly planned pitfall I now understand replied the General perfectly on his guard why the note book was familiar to me I had seen it in that man s hands in the waiting room He was writing in it Indeed A favourite occupation evidently He was fond of confiding in that note book and committed to it much that he never expected would see the light his movements intentions ideas even his inmost thoughts The book which he no doubt lost inadvertently is very incriminating to himself and his friends What do you imply hastily inquired Sir Charles Simply that it is on that which is written here that we base one part perhaps the strongest of our case against the Countess It is strangely but convincingly corroborative of our suspicions against her May I look at it for myself went on the General in a tone of contemptuous disbelief It is in Italian Perhaps you can read that language If not I have translated the most important passages said the Judge offering some other papers Thank you if you will permit me I should prefer to look at the original and the General without more ado stretched out his hand and took the note book What he read there as he quickly scanned its pages shall be told in the next chapter It will be seen that there were things written that looked very damaging to his dear friend Sabine Castagneto CHAPTER XVIII Ripaldi s diary its ownership plainly shown by the record of his name in full Natale Ripaldi inside the cover was a commonplace note book bound in shabby drab cloth its edges and corners strengthened with some sort of white metal The pages were of coarse paper lined blue and red and they were dog eared and smirched as though they had been constantly turned over and used The earlier entries were little more than a record of work to do or done Jan eleven To call at Cafe di Roma twelve point thirty Beppo will meet me Jan thirteen Traced M L Last employed as a model at S s studio Palazzo B Jan fifteen There is trouble brewing at the Circulo Bonafede Louvaih Malatesta and the Englishman Sprot have joined it All are noted Anarchists Jan twenty Mem pay Trattore The Bestia will not wait X is also pressing and Mariuccia Situation tightens Jan twenty three Ordered to watch Q Could I work him No Strong doubts of his solvency Feb ten eleven twelve After Q No grounds yet Feb twenty seven Q keeps up good appearance Any mistake Shall I try him Sorely pressed X threatens me with Prefettura March one Q in difficulties Out late every night Is playing high poor luck March three Q means mischief Preparing for a start March ten Saw Q about here there everywhere Then followed a brief account of Quadling s movements on the day before his departure from Rome very much as they have been described in a previous chapter These were made mostly in the form of reflections conjectures hopes and fears hurry scurry of pursuit had no doubt broken the immediate record of events and these had been entered next day in the train March seventeen the day previous He has not shown up I thought to see him at the buffet at Genoa The conductor took him his coffee to the car I hoped to have begun an acquaintance twelve point thirty Breakfasted at Turin Q did not come to table Found him hanging about outside restaurant Spoke got short reply Wishes to avoid observation I suppose But he speaks to others He has claimed acquaintance with madame s lady s maid and he wants to speak to the mistress Tell her I must speak to her I heard him say as I passed close to them Then they separated hurriedly At Modane he came to the Douane and afterwards into the restaurant He bowed across the table to the lady She hardly recognized him which is odd Of course she must know him then why There is something between them and the maid is in it What shall I do I could spoil any game of theirs if I stepped in What are they after His money no doubt So am I I have the best right to it for I can do most for him He is absolutely in my power and he ll see that he s no fool directly he knows who I am and why I m here It will be worth his while to buy me off if I m ready to sell myself and my duty and the Prefettura and why shouldn t I What better can I do Shall I ever have such a chance again Twenty thirty forty thousand lire more even at one stroke why it s a fortune I could go to the Republic to America North or South send for Mariuccia no cos petto I will continue free I will spend the money on myself as I alone will have earned it and at such risk I have worked it out thus I will go to him at the very last just before we are reaching Paris Tell him threaten him with arrest then give him his chance of escape No fear that he won t accept it he must whatever he may have settled with the others Altro I snap my fingers at them He has most to fear from me The next entries were made after some interval a long interval no doubt after the terrible deed had been done and the words were traced with trembling fingers so that the writing was most irregular and scarcely legible Ugh I am still trembling with horror and fear I cannot get it out of my mind I never shall Why what tempted me How could I bring myself to do it But for these two women they are fiends furies it would never have been necessary Now one of them has escaped and the other she is here so cold blooded so self possessed and quiet who would have thought it of her That she a lady of rank and high breeding gentle delicate tender hearted Tender the fiend Oh shall I ever forget her And now she has me in her power But have I not her also We are in the same boat we must sink or swim together We are equally bound I to her she to me What are we to do How shall we meet inquiry Santissima Donna why did I not risk it and climb out like the maid It was terrible for the moment but the worst would have been over and now There was yet more scribbled in the same faltering agitated handwriting and from the context the entries had been made in the waiting room of the railroad station I must attract her attention She will not look my way I want her to understand that I have something special to say to her and that as we are forbidden to speak I am writing it herein that she must contrive to take the book from me and read unobserved Cos petto she is stupid Has fear dazed her entirely No matter I will set it all down Now followed what the police deemed such damaging evidence Countess Remember Silence absolute silence Not a word as to who I am or what is common knowledge to us both It is done That cannot be undone Be brave resolute admit nothing Stick to it that you know nothing heard nothing Deny that you knew him or me Swear you slept soundly the night through make some excuse say you were drugged anything only be on your guard and say nothing about me I warn you Leave me alone Or but your interests are my interests we must stand or fall together Afterwards I will meet you I must meet you somewhere If we miss at the station front write to me Poste Restante Grand Hotel and give me an address This is imperative Once more silence and discretion This ended the writing in the note book and the whole perusal occupied Sir Charles from fifteen to twenty minutes during which the French officials watched his face closely and his friend Colonel Papillon anxiously But the General s mask was impenetrable and at the end of his reading he turned back to read and re read many pages holding the book to the light and seeming to examine the contents very curiously Well said the Judge at last when he met the General s eye Do you lay great store by this evidence asked the General in a calm dispassionate voice Is it not natural that we should Is it not strongly conclusively incriminating It would be so of course if it were to be depended upon But as to that I have my doubts and grave doubts Bah interposed the detective that is mere conjecture mere assertion Why should not the book be believed It is perfectly genuine Wait sir said the General raising his hand Have you not noticed surely it cannot have escaped so astute a police functionary that the entries are not all in the same handwriting What Oh that is too absurd cried both the officials in a breath They saw at once that if this discovery were admitted to be an absolute fact the whole drift of their conclusions must be changed Examine the book for yourselves To my mind it is perfectly clear and beyond all question insisted Sir Charles I am quite positive that the last pages were written by a different hand from the first CHAPTER XIX For several minutes both the Judge and the detective pored over the note book examining page after page shaking their heads and declining to accept the evidence of their eyes I cannot see it said the Judge at last adding reluctantly No doubt there is a difference but it is to be explained Quite so put in M Flocon When he wrote the early part he was calm and collected the last entries so straggling so ragged and so badly written were made when he was fresh from the crime excited upset little master of himself Naturally he would use a different hand Or he would wish to disguise it It was likely he would so wish further remarked the Judge You admit then that there is a difference argued the General shrewdly But there is more than a disguise The best disguise leaves certain unchangeable features Some letters capital G s H s and others will betray themselves through the best disguise I know what I am saying I have studied the subject of handwriting it interests me These are the work of two different hands Call in an expert you will find I am right Well well said the Judge after a pause let us grant your position for the moment What do you deduce What do you infer therefrom Surely you can see what follows what this leads us to said Sir Charles rather disdainfully I have formed an opinion yes but I should like to see if it coincides with yours You think I know corrected the General I know that as two persons wrote in that book either it is not Ripaldi s book or the last of them was not Ripaldi I saw the last writer at his work saw him with my own eyes Yet he did not write with Ripaldi s hand this is incontestable I am sure of it I will swear it ergo he is not Ripaldi But you should have known this at the time interjected M Flocon fiercely Why did you not discover the change of identity You should have seen that this was not Ripaldi Pardon me I did not know the man I had not noticed him particularly on the journey There was no reason why I should I had no communication no dealings with any of my fellow passengers except my brother and the Countess But some of the others would surely have remarked the change went on the Judge greatly puzzled That alone seems enough to condemn your theory M le General I take my stand on fact not theory stoutly maintained Sir Charles and I am satisfied I am right But if that was not Ripaldi who was it Who would wish to masquerade in his dress and character to make entries of that sort as if under his hand Some one determined to divert suspicion from himself to others But stay does he not plainly confess his own guilt What matter if he is not Ripaldi Directly the inquiry was over he could steal away and resume his own personality that of a man supposed to be dead and therefore safe from all interference and future pursuit You mean Upon my word I compliment you M le General It is really ingenious remarkable indeed superb cried the Judge and only professional jealousy prevented M Flocon from conceding the same praise But how what I do not understand asked Colonel Papillon in amazement His wits did not travel quite so fast as those of his companions Simply this my dear Jack explained the General Ripaldi must have tried to blackmail Quadling as he proposed and Quadling turned the tables on him They fought no doubt and Quadling killed him possibly in self defence He would have said so but in his peculiar position as an absconding defaulter he did not dare That is how I read it and I believe that now these gentlemen are disposed to agree with me In theory certainly said the Judge heartily But oh for some more positive proof of this change of character If we could only identify the corpse prove clearly that it is not Quadling And still more if we had not let this so called Ripaldi slip through our fingers You will never find him M Flocon never The detective hung his head in guilty admission of this reproach We may help you in both these difficulties gentlemen said Sir Charles pleasantly My friend here Colonel Papillon can speak as to the man Quadling He knew him well in Rome a year or two ago Please wait one moment only the detective touched a bell and briefly ordered two fiacres to the door at once That is right M Flocon said the Judge We will all go to the Morgue The body is there by now You will not refuse your assistance monsieur One moment As to the other matter M le General went on M Flocon Can you help us to find this miscreant whoever he may be Yes The man who calls himself Ripaldi is to be found or at least you would have found him an hour or so ago at the Hotel Ivoire Rue Bellechasse But time has been lost I fear Nevertheless we will send there The woman Hortense was also with him when last I heard of them How do you know began the detective suspiciously Psha interrupted the Judge that will keep This is the time for action and we owe too much to the General to distrust him now Thank you I am pleased to hear you say that went on Sir Charles But if I have been of some service to you perhaps you owe me a little in return That poor lady Think what she is suffering Surely to oblige me you will now set her free Indeed monsieur I fear I do not see how consistently with my duty protested the Judge At least allow her to return to her hotel She can remain there at your disposal I will promise you that How can you answer for her She will do what I ask I think if I may send her just two or three lines The Judge yielded smiling at the General s urgency and shrewdly guessing what it implied Then the three departures from the Prefecture took place within a short time of each other A posse of police went to arrest Ripaldi the Countess returned to the Hotel Madagascar and the Judge s party started for the Morgue only a short journey where they were presently received with every mark of respect and consideration The keeper or officer in charge was summoned and came out bareheaded to the fiacre bowing low before his distinguished visitors Good morning La Peche said M Flocon in a sharp voice We have come for an identification The body from the Lyons Station he of the murder in the sleeping car is it yet arrived But surely at your service Chief replied the old man obsequiously If the gentlemen will give themselves the trouble to enter the office I will lead them behind direct into the mortuary chamber There are many people in yonder It was the usual crowd of sightseers passing slowly before the plate glass of this the most terrible shop front in the world where the goods exposed the merchandise are hideous corpses laid out in rows upon the marble slabs the battered tattered remnants of outraged humanity insulted by the most terrible indignities in death Who make up this curious throng and what strange morbid motives drag them there Those fat comfortable looking women with their baskets on their arms the decent workmen in dusty blouses idling between the hours of work the riffraff of the streets male or female in various stages of wretchedness and degradation A few no doubt are impelled by motives we cannot challenge they are torn and tortured by suspense trembling lest they may recognize missing dear ones among the exposed others stare carelessly at the day s take wondering perhaps if they may come to the same fate one or two are idle sightseers not always French for the Morgue is a favourite haunt with the irrepressible tourist doing Paris Strangest of all the murderer himself the doer of the fell deed comes here to the very spot where his victim lies stark and reproachful and stares at it spellbound fascinated filled more with remorse perchance than fear at the risk he runs So common is this trait that in mysterious murder cases the police of Paris keep a disguised officer among the crowd at the Morgue and have thereby made many memorable arrests This way gentlemen this way and the keeper of the Morgue led the party through one or two rooms into the inner and back recesses of the buildings It was behind the scenes of the Morgue and they were made free of its most gruesome secrets as they passed along The temperature had suddenly fallen far below freezing point and the icy cold chilled to the very marrow Still worse was an all pervading acrid odour of artificially suspended animal decay The cold air process that latest of scientific contrivances to arrest the waste of tissue has now been applied at the Morgue to preserve and keep the bodies fresh and allow them to be for a longer time exposed than when running water was the only aid There are moreover many specially contrived refrigerating chests in which those still unrecognized corpses are laid by for months to be dragged out if needs be like carcasses of meat What a loathsome place cried Sir Charles Hurry up Jack let us get out of this in Heaven s name Where s my man quickly asked Colonel Papillon in response to this appeal There the third from the left whispered M Flocon We hoped you would recognize the corpse at once That Impossible You do not expect it surely Why the face is too much mangled for any one to say who it is Are there no indications no marks or signs to say whether it is Quadling or not asked the Judge in a greatly disappointed tone Absolutely nothing And yet I am quite satisfied it is not him For the simple reason that Yes yes go on That Quadling in person is standing out there among the crowd CHAPTER XX M Flocon was the first to realize the full meaning of Colonel Papillon s surprising statement Run run La Peche Have the outer doors closed let no one leave the place Draw back gentlemen he went on and he hustled his companions with frantic haste out at the back of the mortuary chamber Pray Heaven he has not seen us He would know us even if we do not him Then with no less haste he seized Colonel Papillon by the arm and hurried him by the back passages through the office into the outer public chamber where the astonished crowd stood silent and perturbed awaiting explanation of their detention Quick monsieur whispered the Chief point him out to me The request was not unnecessary for when Colonel Papillon went forward and putting his hand on a man s shoulder saying mister Quadling I think the police officer was scarcely able to restrain his surprise The person thus challenged was very unlike any one he had seen before that day Ripaldi most of all The moustache was gone the clothes were entirely changed a pair of dark green spectacles helped the disguise It was strange indeed that Papillon had known him but at the moment of recognition Quadling had removed his glasses no doubt that he might the better examine the object of his visit to the Morgue that gruesome record of his own fell handiwork Naturally he drew back with well feigned indignation muttering half unintelligible words in French denying stoutly both in voice and gesture all acquaintance with the person who thus abruptly addressed him This is not to be borne he cried Who are you that dares Ta ta quietly put in M Flocon we will discuss that fully but not here Come into the office come I say or must we use force There was no escaping now and with a poor attempt at bravado the stranger was led away Now Colonel Papillon look at him well Do you know him Are you satisfied it is mister Quadling late banker of Rome I have not the slightest doubt of it I recognize him beyond all question That will do Silence sir This to Quadling No observations I too can recognize you now as the person who called himself Ripaldi an hour or two ago Denial is useless Let him be searched thoroughly you understand La Peche Call in your other men he may resist They gave the wretched man but scant consideration and in less than three minutes had visited every pocket examined every secret receptacle and practically turned him inside out After this there could no longer be any doubt of his identity still less of his complicity in the crime First among the many damning evidences of his guilt was the missing pocketbook of the porter of the sleeping car Within was the train card and the passengers tickets all the papers which the man Groote had lost so unaccountably They had of course been stolen from his person with the obvious intention of impeding the inquiry into the murder Next in another inner pocket was Quadling s own wallet with his own visiting cards several letters addressed to him by name above all a thick sheaf of bank notes of all nationalities English French Italian and amounting in total value to several thousands of pounds Well do you still deny Bah it is childish useless mere waste of breath At last we have penetrated the mystery You may as well confess Whether or no we have enough to convict you by independent testimony said the Judge severely Come what have you to say But Quadling with pale averted face stood obstinately mute He was in the toils the net had closed round him they should have no assistance from him Come speak out it will be best Remember we have means to make you Will you interrogate him further M Beaumont le Hardi Here at once No let him be removed to the Prefecture it will be more convenient to my private office Without more ado a fiacre was called and the prisoner was taken off under escort M Flocon seated by his side one policeman in front another on the box and lodged in a secret cell at the Quai l Horloge And you gentlemen said the Judge to Sir Charles and Colonel Papillon I do not wish to detain you further although there may be points you might help us to elucidate if I might venture to still trespass on your time Sir Charles was eager to return to the Hotel Madagascar and yet he felt that he should best serve his dear Countess by seeing this to the end So he readily assented to accompany the Judge and Colonel Papillon who was no less curious agreed to go too I sincerely trust said the Judge on the way that our people have laid hands on that woman Petitpre I believe that she holds the key to the situation that when we hear her story we shall have a clear case against Quadling and who knows she may completely exonerate Madame la Comtesse During the events just recorded which occupied a good hour the police agents had time to go and come from the Rue Bellechasse They did not return empty handed although at first it seemed as if they had made a fruitless journey The Hotel Ivoire was a very second class place a lodging house or hotel with furnished rooms let out by the week to lodgers with whom the proprietor had no very close acquaintance His clerk did all the business and this functionary produced the register as he is bound by law for the inspection of the police officers but afforded little information as to the day s arrivals Yes a man calling himself Dufour had taken rooms about midday one for himself one for madame who was with him also named Dufour his sister he said and he went on at the request of the police officers to describe them Our birds said the senior agent briefly They are wanted We belong to the detective police All right Such visits were not new to the clerk But you will not find monsieur he is out there hangs his key Madame No she is within Yes that is certain for not long since she rang her bell There it goes again He looked up at the furiously oscillating bell but made no move Bah they do not pay for service let her come and say what she needs Exactly and we will bring her said the officer making for the stairs and the room indicated But on reaching the door they found it locked From within Hardly for as they stood there in doubt a voice inside cried vehemently Let me out Help Help Send for the police I have much to tell them Quick Let me out We are here my dear just as you require us But wait step down Gaston and see if the clerk has a second key If not call in a locksmith the nearest A little patience only my beauty Do not fear The key was quickly produced and an entrance effected A woman stood there in a defiant attitude with arms akimbo she no doubt of whom they were in search A tall rather masculine looking creature with a dark handsome face bold black eyes just now flashing fiercely rage in every feature Madame Dufour began the police officer Dufour Rot My name is Hortense Petitpre who are you La Rousse Police At your service Have you anything to say to us We have come on purpose to take you to the Prefecture quietly if you will let us or I will go quietly I ask nothing better I have to lay information against a miscreant a murderer the vile assassin who would have made me his accomplice the banker Quadling of Rome In the fiacre Hortense Petitpre talked on with such incessant abuse virulent and violent of Quadling that her charges were neither precise nor intelligible It was not until she appeared before M Beaumont le Hardi and was handled with great dexterity by that practised examiner that her story took definite form What she had to say will be best told in the clear formal language of the official disposition The witness inculpated stated She was named Aglae Hortense Petitpre thirty four years of age a Frenchwoman born in Paris Rue de Vincennes No three hundred seventy four Was engaged by the Contessa Castagneto November nineteen one hundred eighty nine in Rome as lady s maid and there at her mistress s domicile became acquainted with the Sieur Francis Quadling a banker of the Via Condotti Rome Quadling had pretensions to the hand of the Countess and sought by bribes and entreaties to interest witness in his suit Witness often spoke of him in complimentary terms to her mistress who was not very favourably disposed towards him One afternoon two days before the murder Quadling paid a lengthened visit to the Countess Witness did not hear what occurred but Quadling came out much distressed and again urged her to speak to the Countess He had heard of the approaching departure of the lady from Rome but said nothing of his own intentions Witness was much surprised to find him in the sleeping car but had no talk to him till the following morning when he asked her to obtain an interview for him with the Countess and promised a large reward In making this offer he produced a wallet and exhibited a very large number of notes Witness was unable to persuade the Countess although she returned to the subject frequently Witness so informed Quadling who then spoke to the lady but was coldly received During the journey witness thought much over the situation Admitted that the sight of Quadling s money had greatly disturbed her but although pressed would not say when the first idea of robbing him took possession of her Note by Judge That she had resolved to do so is however perfectly clear and the conclusion is borne out by her acts It was she who secured the Countess s medicine bottle she beyond doubt who drugged the porter at Laroche In no other way can her presence in the sleeping car between Laroche and Paris be accounted for presence which she does not deny Witness at last reluctantly confessed that she entered the compartment where the murder was committed and at a critical moment An affray was actually in progress between the Italian Ripaldi and the incriminated man Quadling but the witness arrived as the last fatal blow was struck by the latter She saw it struck and saw the victim fall lifeless on the floor Witness declared she was so terrified she could at first utter no cry nor call for help and before she could recover herself the murderer threatened her with the ensanguined knife She threw herself on her knees imploring pity but the man Quadling told her that she was an eye witness and could take him to the guillotine she also must die Witness at last prevailed on him to spare her life but only on condition that she would leave the car He indicated the window as the only way of escape but on this for a long time she refused to venture declaring that it was only to exchange one form of death for another Then as Quadling again threatened to stab her she was compelled to accept this last chance never hoping to win out alive With Quadling s assistance however she succeeded in climbing out through the window and in gaining the roof He had told her to wait for the first occasion when the train slackened speed to leave it and shift for herself With this intention he gave her a thousand francs and bade her never show herself again Witness descended from the train not far from the small station of Villeneuve on the line and there took the local train for Paris Landed at the Lyons Station she heard of the inquiry in progress and then waiting outside saw Quadling disguised as the Italian leave in company with another man She followed and marked Quadling down meaning to denounce him on the first opportunity Quadling however on issuing from the restaurant had accosted her and at once offered her a further sum of five thousand francs as the price of silence and she had gone with him to the Hotel Ivoire where she was to receive the sum Quadling had paid it but on one condition that she would remain at the Hotel Ivoire until the following day Apparently he had distrusted her for he had contrived to lock her into her compartment As she did not choose to be so imprisoned she summoned assistance and was at length released by the police This was the substance of Hortense Petitpre s deposition and it was corroborated in many small details When she appeared before the Judge with whom Sir Charles Collingham and Colonel Papillon were seated the former at once pointed out that she was wearing a dark mantle trimmed with the same sort of passementerie as that picked up in the sleeping car L Envoi Quadling was in due course brought before the Court of Assize and tried for his life There was no sort of doubt of his guilt and the jury so found but having regard to certain extenuating circumstances they recommended him to mercy The chief of these was Quadling s positive assurance that he had been first attacked by Ripaldi he declared that the Italian detective had in the first instance tried to come to terms with him demanding fifty thousand francs as his price for allowing him to go at large that when Quadling distinctly refused to be black mailed Ripaldi struck at him with a knife but that the blow failed to take effect Then Quadling closed with him and took the knife from him It was a fierce encounter and might have ended either way but the unexpected entrance of the woman Petitpre took off Ripaldi s attention and then he Quadling maddened and reckless stabbed him to the heart It was not until after the deed was done that Quadling realized the full measure of his crime and its inevitable consequences Then in a daring effort to extricate himself he intimidated the woman Petitpre and forced her to escape through the sleeping car window It was he who had rung the signal bell to stop the train and give her a chance of leaving it It was after the murder too that he conceived the idea of personating Ripaldi and having disfigured him beyond recognition as he hoped he had changed clothes and compartments On the strength of this confession Quadling escaped the guillotine but he was transported to New Caledonia for life The money taken on him was forwarded to Rome and was usefully employed in reducing his liabilities to the depositors in the bank The other word Some time in June the following announcement appeared in all the Paris papers Yesterday at the British Embassy General Sir Charles Collingham K C B was married to Sabine Contessa di Castagneto widow of the Italian
