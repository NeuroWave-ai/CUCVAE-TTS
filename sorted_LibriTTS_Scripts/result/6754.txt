32_21625_000019_000002	train-clean-100	Though he owned the land where it stood those that lived there thought they had every right to stay there as long as they pleased without being disturbed 
none	none	It was in this village that Brownie Beaver and his neighbors lived 
32_21625_000020_000001	train-clean-100	It was a different sort of town too from the one where Farmer Green went each week 
none	none	Over beyond Blue Mountain all the houses were built in a pond And all their doors were under water But nobody minded that because like Brownie Beaver everybody that dwelt there was a fine swimmer Years and years before Brownie s time his forefathers had come there and finding that there were many trees in the neighborhood with the sort of bark they liked to eat such as poplars willows and box elders they had decided that it was a good place to live 
32_21625_000021_000001	train-clean-100	There was a small stream too which was really the beginning of Swift River 
none	none	And by damming it those old settlers made a pond in which they could build their houses They had ideas of their own as to what a house should be like and very good ideas they were though you perhaps might not care for them at all They wanted their houses to be surrounded by water because they thought they were safer when built in that manner And they always insisted that a door leading into a house should be far beneath the surface of the water for they believed that that made a house safer too To you such an idea may seem very strange But if you were chased by an enemy you might be glad to be able to swim under water down to the bottom of a pond and slip inside a door which led to a winding hall which in its turn led upwards into your house Of course your enemy might be able to swim as well as you But maybe he would think twice or even three times before he went prowling through your crooked hall For if you had enormous strong sharp teeth with which you could gnaw right through a tree he would not care to have you seize him as he poked his head around a corner in a dark passage of a strange house It was in a house of that kind that Brownie Beaver lived And he built it himself because he said he would rather have a neat new house than one of the big old dwellings that had been built many years before when his great great grandfather had helped throw the dam across the stream 
32_21625_000026_000000	train-clean-100	The dam was there still 
32_21625_000026_000001	train-clean-100	It was so old that trees were growing on it And there was an odd thing about it it was never finished 
none	none	Though Brownie Beaver was a young chap he worked on the dam sometimes like all his neighbors You see the villagers kept making the dam wider And since it was built of sticks and mud the water sometimes washed bits of it away so it had to be kept in repair 
32_21625_000027_000000	train-clean-100	If Brownie Beaver and his friends had neglected their dam they would have waked up some day and found that their pond was empty and without any water to hide their doorways they would have been safe no longer 
32_21625_000028_000000	train-clean-100	They would have had no place either to store their winter s food For they were in the habit of cutting down trees and saving the bark and branches too in order to have plenty to eat when cold weather came and the ice closed their pond 
32_21625_000029_000000	train-clean-100	Some of their food they carried into their houses through a straight hall which was made for that very purpose 
none	none	And some of the branches they fastened under water near the dam 
32_21625_000029_000002	train-clean-100	It was just like putting green things into a refrigerator so they will keep 
32_21625_000030_000000	train-clean-100	Now you see why Brownie Beaver would no more have thought of building his house on dry land than you would think of building one in a pond Everybody likes his own way best 
none	none	And it never once occurred to Brownie Beaver that his way was the least bit strange Perhaps it was because his family had always lived in that fashion II HOW TO FELL A TREE Brownie Beaver could do many things that other forest people except his own relations were not able to do at all For instance cutting down a tree was something that nobody but one of the Beaver family would think of attempting But as for Brownie Beaver if he ever saw a tree that he wanted to cut down he set to work at once without even going home to get any tools And the reason for that was that he always had his tools with him For strange as it may seem he used his teeth to do all his wood cutting The first thing to be done when you set out to fell a tree with your teeth is to strip off the bark around the bottom of the trunk so that a white band encircles it At least that was the way Brownie Beaver always began And no doubt he knew what he was about After he had removed the band of bark Brownie began to gnaw away chips of wood where the white showed And as he gnawed he slowly sidled round and round the tree until at last only the heart of the tree was left to keep the tree from toppling over Then Brownie Beaver would stop his gnawing and look all about to pick out a place where he wanted the tree to fall And as soon as Brownie had made up his mind about that he quickly gnawed a few more chips out of the heart of the tree on the side toward the spot where he intended it to come toppling down upon the ground Brownie Beaver would not have to gnaw long before the tree would begin to lean All the time it leaned more and more And the further over it sagged the faster it tipped Luckily Brownie Beaver always knew just the right moment to jump out of the way before the tree fell If you had ever seen him you might have thought he was frightened because he never failed to run away and hide as the tree crashed down with a sound almost like thunder But Brownie was not at all frightened He was merely careful Knowing what a loud noise the falling tree would make and that it might lead a man or some other enemy to come prowling around to see what had happened Brownie used to stay hidden until he felt quite sure that no one was going to trouble him You can understand that waiting as he did was no easy matter when you stop to remember that one of Brownie s reasons for cutting down a tree was that he wanted to eat the tender bark to be found in the tree top It was exactly like knowing your dinner was on the table all ready for you and having to hide in some dark corner for half an hour before going into the dining room You know how hungry you would get if you had to do that Well Brownie Beaver used to get just as hungry as any little boy or girl How he did tear at the bark when he finally began to eat And how full he stuffed his mouth And how he did enjoy his meal But everybody will admit that he had a right to enjoy his dinner for he certainly worked hard enough to get it III STICKS AND MUD Like the dam that held back the water to form the pond where Brownie Beaver lived Brownie s house was made of sticks and mud He cut the sticks himself from trees that grew near the bank of the pond and after dragging and pushing them to the water s edge he swam with them without much trouble to the center of the pond where he wished to build his house Of course the sticks floated in the water so Brownie found that part of his work to be quite easy He had chosen that spot in the center of the pond because there was something a good deal like an island there only it did not rise quite out of the water A good firm place on which to set his house Brownie Beaver considered it While he was building his house Brownie gathered his winter s food at the same time Anyone might think he would have found it difficult to do two things at once like that But while he was cutting sticks to build his new house it was no great trouble to peel the bark off them The bark you know was what Brownie Beaver always ate And when he cut sticks for his house there was only one thing about which he had to be careful he had to be particular to use only certain kinds of wood Poplar cottonwood or willow birch elm box elder or aspen those were the trees which bore bark that he liked But if he had cut down a hickory or an ash or an oak tree he wouldn t have been able to get any food from them at all because the bark was not the sort he cared for That was lucky in a way because the wood of those trees was very hard and Brownie would have had much more work cutting them down A good many of Brownie Beaver s neighbors thought he was foolish to go to the trouble of building a new house when there were old ones to be had And there was a lazy fellow called Tired Tim who laughed openly at Brownie When you re older you ll know better than to work like that Tired Tim told him Why don t you do the way I did he asked I dug a tunnel in the bank of the pond and it s a good enough house for anybody It s much easier than building a house of sticks and mud But Brownie told Tired Tim that he didn t care to live in a hole in the bank Nobody but a very lazy person would be willing to have a house like that Brownie said Tired Tim only laughed all the harder Old Grandaddy Beaver has been talking to you he remarked I saw him taking you over to the dam day before yesterday and telling you where to work on it Of course that s all right if you re willing to work for the whole village But I say let others do the work As for me I ve never put a single stick nor a single armful of mud on that dam and what s more I never intend to either My tunnel in the bank suits me very well Of course it may not be so airy in summer as a house such as you re making for yourself But I don t live in my house in summer So what s the difference to me In summer I go up the stream or down just as it suits me and I see something of the world and have a fine time There s nothing like travel you know to broaden one said Tired Tim Brownie Beaver stopped just a moment and looked at the lazy fellow He was certainly broad enough Brownie thought He was so fat that his sides stuck far out But it was no wonder for he never did any work You d better take my advice Tired Tim told Brownie But Brownie Beaver had returned to his wood cutting He didn t even stop to answer To him working was just fun And building a fine house was as good as any game IV THE FRESHET The rain had fallen steadily for two days and two nights not just a gentle drizzle but a heavy downpour For some time it did not in the least disturb Brownie Beaver and his neighbors that is to say all but one of them For there was a very old gentleman in the village known as Grandaddy Beaver who began to worry almost as soon as it began to rain We re a going to have a freshet he said to everybody he met I ve seen em start many a time and I can always tell a freshet almost as soon as I see it coming Grandaddy Beaver s friends paid no heed to his warning And some of them were so unkind as to laugh when the old gentleman crawled on top of his house and began to mend it You young folks can poke fun at me if you want to said Grandaddy Beaver but I m a going right ahead and make my house as strong as I can For when the freshet gets here I don t want my home washed away All day long people would stop to watch the old fellow at work upon his roof And everybody thought it was a great joke until the second day came and everybody noticed that it was raining just as hard as ever But no one except Grandaddy Beaver had ever heard of a freshet at that time of year So even then nobody else went to work on his house though some people did stop smiling A freshet you know is a serious thing As the second day passed the rain seemed to fall harder And still Grandaddy Beaver kept putting new sticks on the roof of his house and plastering mud over them And at last Brownie Beaver began to think that perhaps the old gentleman was right after all and that maybe everybody else was wrong So Brownie went home and set to work And all his neighbors at once began to smile at him But Brownie Beaver didn t mind that My roof needed mending anyhow he said And if we should have a freshet I ll be ready for it And if we don t have one there ll be no harm done Illustration mister Crow Called Down the Chimney Now all this time the water had been rising slowly But that was no more than everyone expected since it was raining so hard But when the second night came the water began to rise very fast It rose so quickly that several families found their bedroom floors under water almost before they knew it Then old Grandaddy Beaver went through the village and stopped at every door What do you think about it now he asked Is it a freshet or isn t it In the houses where the water had climbed above the bedroom floors the people all agreed that it was a freshet and that Grandaddy Beaver had been right all the time But there were still plenty of people who thought the old gentleman was mistaken The water won t come any higher they said It never has at this time of year But they looked a bit worried in spite of what they said It s a going to be the worst freshet that s happened since you were born their caller croaked You mark my words When he came to Brownie Beaver s house Grandaddy found that there was one person at least that had taken his advice I see you re all ready for the freshet the old gentleman remarked They laughed at me but I was right he said They laughed at me too Brownie Beaver told him There s nobody in this village that ll laugh again tonight Grandaddy said very solemnly for there s a going to be a flood before morning V BROWNIE SAVES THE DAM Brownie Beaver was always glad that he had taken Grandaddy s advice about the freshet And Brownie s neighbors were glad that he had too For that was really the only thing that saved the village from being carried away by the flood of water that swept down upon the pond after it had rained for two days and two nights The pond rose so quickly and the water rushed past so fast that people had to scramble out of their houses and begin working on them to keep them from being washed away That rush of water meant only one thing The pond was full and running over And just as likely as not the dam would be carried away the dam on which Grandaddy Beaver had worked when he was a youngster and on which his own grandaddy had worked before him It would take years and years to build another such dam as that Now with almost everybody working on his own house there was almost no one left to work upon the dam But people never stopped to think about that They never once remembered that out of the whole village old Grandaddy and Brownie Beaver were the only persons whose houses had been made ready for the freshet and that those two were the only people with nothing to do at home There ll be plenty to help save the dam everybody said to himself I ll just work on my house Now Brownie Beaver knew that there was nothing more he could do to make his house safe so he swam over to the dam expecting to find a good many of his neighbors there But old Grandaddy Beaver was the only other person he found And he seemed worried It s a great pity he said to Brownie Here s this fine dam which has taken so many years to build and it s a going to be washed away you mark my words What makes you think that asked Brownie There s nobody here to do anything said Grandaddy Beaver The spillways of this dam ought to be made as big as possible to let the freshet pass through But I can t do it for I can t swim as well as I could once Brownie Beaver looked at the rushing water which poured over the top of the dam in a hundred places and was already carrying off mud and sticks eating the dam away before his very eyes I ll save the dam he cried You Grandaddy Beaver exclaimed Why what do you think you can do Being so old he couldn t help believing that other people were too young to do difficult things Watch me and I ll show you Brownie Beaver told him And without saying another word he swam to the nearest spillway and began making it bigger Sometimes he had to fight the freshet madly to keep from being swept over the dam himself Sometimes too as he stood on the dam it crumbled beneath him and he found himself swimming again How many narrow escapes he had that day Brownie Beaver could never remember When they happened he didn t have time to count them he was working so busily And if old Grandaddy Beaver hadn t told everyone afterward how Brownie saved the great dam from being swept away and how hard he had worked and how he had swum fearlessly into the torrent people wouldn t have known anything about it To be sure they had noticed that the water went down almost as suddenly as it rose But they hadn t stopped to think that there must have been some reason for that And when they learned that Brownie Beaver was the reason the whole village gave him a vote of thanks They wanted to give him a gold headed cane too But they were unable to find one anywhere When Brownie Beaver heard of that he said it was just as well because he seldom walked far on land and there wasn t much use in a person s carrying a cane when he swam anyhow Although it was sometimes done he had always considered it a silly practice and one that he would not care to follow VI A HAPPY THOUGHT Brownie Beaver liked to know what was going on in the world But living far from Pleasant Valley as he did he seldom heard any news before it was quite old I wish he said to mister Crow one day when that old gentleman was making him a visit I wish someone would start a newspaper in this neighborhood mister Crow told Brownie that he would be glad to bring him an old newspaper whenever he happened to find one Thank you Brownie Beaver said You re very kind But an old newspaper would be of no use to me Why not mister Crow inquired They make very good beds I ve been told And I suppose that is what you want one for Not at all Brownie replied I d like to know what s happening over in Pleasant Valley It takes so long for news to reach us here in our pond that it s often hardly worth listening to when we hear it it s so old Now what I d really prefer is a newspaper that would tell me everything that s going to happen a week later mister Crow said he never heard of a newspaper like that Well somebody ought to start one Brownie Beaver answered mister Crow thought deeply for some minutes without saying a word And at last He cried suddenly I have an idea Have you Brownie Beaver exclaimed What is it mister Crow I ll be your newspaper mister Crow told him At that Brownie Beaver looked somewhat doubtful That s very kind of you he said But I m afraid it wouldn t do me much good You re so black that the ink wouldn t show on you at all unless he added they use white ink to print on you You don t understand old mister Crow said What I mean is this I ll fly over here once a week and tell you everything that s happened Of course he continued I can t very well tell you everything that is going to take place the following week But I ll do my best Brownie Beaver was delighted And when mister Crow asked him what day he wanted his newspaper Brownie said that Saturday afternoon would be a good time That s the last day of the week Brownie Beaver remarked so you ought to have plenty of news for me You know if you came the first day of the week there would be very little to tell That s so said mister Crow Well say Saturday then And you shall have your newspaper without fail unless he explained unless there should be a bad storm or unless I should be ill And of course if Farmer Green should want me to help him in his cornfield I wouldn t be able to come There might be other things too to keep me at home which I can t think of just now said mister Crow Again Brownie Beaver looked a bit doubtful I hope you ll try to be regular he told mister Crow When a person takes a newspaper he doesn t like to be disappointed you know Old mister Crow said that he hoped nothing would prevent his coming to Brownie s house every Saturday afternoon There s only one more thing I can think of he croaked that would make it impossible for me to be here And that is if I should lose count of the days of the week or have to see a baseball game or fly south for the winter But that s three things instead of only one Brownie Beaver objected Well maybe it is mister Crow replied the way you count But I call it only one because I said it all in one breath without a single pause I hope you won t tell me the news as fast as that said Brownie Beaver for if you did I should never be able to remember one half of it But mister Crow promised that he would talk very slowly You ll be perfectly satisfied he told Brownie And now I must go home at once to begin gathering news VII A NEWFANGLED NEWSPAPER 
32_21631_000005_000000	train-clean-100	After mister Crow flew back to Pleasant Valley to gather news for him Brownie Beaver carefully counted each day that passed 
none	none	Since mister Crow had agreed to be his newspaper and come each Saturday afternoon to tell him everything that had happened during the week Brownie was in a great hurry for Saturday to arrive In order to make no mistake he put aside a stick in which he gnawed a notch each day And in that way he knew exactly when Saturday came That was probably the longest day in Brownie Beaver s life 
32_21631_000007_000001	train-clean-100	At least it seemed so to him 
32_21631_000007_000002	train-clean-100	Whenever he saw a bird soaring above the tree tops he couldn t help hoping it was mister Crow 
none	none	And whenever he heard a caw caw far off in the distance Brownie Beaver dropped whatever he happened to be doing expecting that mister Crow would flap into sight at any moment Brownie had many disappointments 
32_21631_000008_000001	train-clean-100	But mister Crow really came at last 
32_21631_000008_000002	train-clean-100	He lighted right on top of Brownie Beaver s house and called Paper down the chimney just like that 
none	none	Brownie happened to be inside his house 
32_21631_000009_000001	train-clean-100	And in a wonderfully short time his head appeared above the water and he soon crawled up beside mister Crow 
none	none	Well I am glad to see you he told mister Crow Peter Mink caught a monstrous eel in the duck pond on Monday mister Crow said 
32_21631_000011_000001	train-clean-100	Being a newspaper he thought he ought to say nothing except what was news not even Good afternoon 
none	none	mister Rabbit of Pine Ridge with his wife and fourteen children is visiting his brother mister Jeremiah Rabbit missus Jeremiah Rabbit says she does not know when her husband s relations are going home mister Crow continued to relate in a singsong voice Goodness gracious Brownie Beaver exclaimed
32_21631_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 Fatty Coon mister Crow said Fatty Coon was confined to his house by illness Tuesday night 
none	none	He ate too many dried apples Well well Brownie Beaver murmured And he started to ask mister Crow a question But mister Crow interrupted him with more news missus Bear had a birthday on Wednesday 
32_21631_000016_000001	train-clean-100	An enjoyable time was had by all except the pig 
32_21631_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 Pig Brownie Beaver asked 
32_21631_000017_000001	train-clean-100	 What pig 
32_21631_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 The pig they ate said mister Crow 
32_21631_000018_000001	train-clean-100	And he went right on talking 
32_21631_000018_000002	train-clean-100	 On Thursday mister Woodchuck went to visit his cousins in the West 
32_21631_000018_000003	train-clean-100	missus Woodchuck is worried 
none	none	What s she worried about Brownie inquired
32_21631_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 She s afraid he s coming back again mister Crow explained 
none	none	I have heard he was lazy Brownie said
32_21631_000021_000001	train-clean-100	 What happened on Friday 
32_21631_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 Tommy Fox made a visit 
32_21631_000022_000001	train-clean-100	But he didn t have a good time at all mister Crow reported and he left faster than he came 
none	none	Brownie Beaver wanted to know where Tommy Fox made his visit
32_21631_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 At Farmer Green s hen house mister Crow explained 
none	none	Why did he hurry away Brownie asked
32_21631_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 Old dog Spot chased him mister Crow replied 
none	none	But you mustn t ask questions he complained You can t ask questions of a newspaper you know Well what happened on Saturday
32_21631_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 There you go again cried mister Crow 
32_21631_000028_000001	train-clean-100	 Another question 
none	none	I declare I don t believe you ever took a newspaper before did you Brownie Beaver admitted that he never had
32_21631_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 Then said mister Crow then don t interrupt me again please 
32_21631_000030_000001	train-clean-100	I ll tell you all the news I ve brought 
none	none	And when I ve finished I ll stop being a newspaper and be myself for a while 
32_21631_000030_000003	train-clean-100	And then we can talk 
32_21631_000030_000004	train-clean-100	But not before he insisted 
none	none	Brownie Beaver nodded his head He was afraid that if he said another word mister Crow would grow angry and fly away without telling him any more news On Saturday this morning to be exact said mister Crow there came near being a bad accident 
32_21631_000032_000001	train-clean-100	Jimmy Rabbit almost cut off Frisky Squirrel s tail 
32_21631_000033_000000	train-clean-100	mister Crow paused and looked at Brownie Beaver out of the corner of his eye 
32_21631_000033_000001	train-clean-100	He knew that Brownie would want to know what prevented the accident 
none	none	But he was in no hurry to tell him For a few moments Brownie waited to hear the rest But a few moments was more than he could endure Why didn t Jimmy cut off his tail Brownie asked eagerly There said mister Crow
32_21631_000036_000001	train-clean-100	 You ve done just as I told you not to 
none	none	So I shall not tell you the rest until next Saturday 
32_21631_000036_000003	train-clean-100	You see you have a few things to learn about taking a newspaper And he would give Brownie no more news that day 
none	none	To be sure he was willing to talk but only about things that had happened where Brownie Beaver lived VIII mister CROW IS UPSET Brownie Beaver couldn t help feeling that mister Crow had not treated him very well because mister Crow hadn t told him all the news about Frisky Squirrel s tail He thought that maybe there were things about a newspaper that even mister Crow didn t know Another week had passed Brownie knew that it had because since mister Crow s last call he had cut a notch in a stick each day And there were now seven of them Late Saturday afternoon mister Crow came back again He lighted on top of Brownie s house and called Paper down the chimney just as he had a week before Brownie Beaver came swimming up once more Look here he said to mister Crow I don t believe yon know much about being a newspaper do you That surprised mister Crow What do you mean he asked A newspaper said Brownie Beaver a newspaper is always left on a person s doorstep I ve talked with a good many people and not one of them ever heard of a paper being left on the roof mister Crow s face seemed to grow blacker than ever he was so angry How can anybody leave a newspaper on your doorstep when the step s under water he growled Brownie Beaver did not answer that question for he had something else to say to mister Crow I ve talked with a good many people he said once more and not one of them ever heard of such rudeness as shouting down a person s chimney If there was anybody asleep in the house it would certainly wake him and if a person had a fire in his house shouting down the chimney might put it out mister Crow looked rather foolish I ll try to think of some way of leaving your newspaper that will suit us both he said Then he hemmed and began to tell Brownie the week s news On Sunday said mister Crow there was a freshet I knew that before you did said Brownie Beaver mister Crow looked disappointed How he asked Why I live further up the river than you said Brownie Beaver And since freshets always come down a river this one didn t reach you till after it had passed me Something made mister Crow peevish I don t believe you d care to hear any more of my news he said You appear to know it already Perhaps you ll be kind enough to tell me the sort of news you prefer to hear Certainly Brownie Beaver replied Now there s the weather I ve talked with a good many people and they all say that a good newspaper ought to tell the weather for the next day mister Crow cocked an eye up at the sky To morrow will be fair he said I m told that a good newspaper ought to tell a few jokes Brownie Beaver continued But mister Crow sneered openly at that I m a newspaper not a jest book he announced Then you refuse to tell any jokes do you Brownie Beaver asked him I certainly do mister Crow cried indignantly Very well Brownie said I see I ll have to take some other newspaper though I must say I hate to change after taking this one so long I hope you ll find one to suit you mister Crow said in a cross voice And he flew away without another word He was terribly upset You see he had enjoyed being a newspaper because it gave him an excuse for asking people the most inquisitive questions He had intended all that week to ask Aunt Polly Woodchuck whether she wore a wig But he hadn t been able to find her at home And now it was too late for mister Crow was a newspaper no longer As for Brownie Beaver he succeeded in getting Jasper Jay to be his newspaper Though Jasper told him many jokes Brownie found that he could not depend upon Jasper s news And as a matter of fact Jasper made up most of it himself He claimed that the newest news was the best That s why I invent it myself right on the spot he explained IX THE SIGN ON THE TREE On one of Brownie Beaver s long excursions down the stream he came upon a tree to which a sign was nailed Now Brownie had never learned to read But he had heard that Uncle Jerry Chuck could tell what a sign said So Brownie asked a pleasant young fellow named Frisky Squirrel if he would mind asking Uncle Jerry to come over to Swift River on a matter of important business When Uncle Jerry Chuck appeared Brownie Beaver said he was glad to see him and that Uncle Jerry was looking very well I ve sent for you said Brownie because I wanted you to see this sign I can tell by the tracks under the tree that the sign was put up only to day And I thought you ought to know about it at once Uncle Jerry As soon as he heard that Uncle Jerry Chuck stepped close to the tree and began to read the sign Now there was something about Uncle Jerry s reading that Brownie Beaver had heard People had told him that Uncle Jerry Chuck couldn t tell what a sign said unless he read it aloud That was why Brownie Beaver had sent for him for Brownie knew Uncle Jerry well enough to guess that if anybody asked Uncle Jerry to read the sign Uncle Jerry would insist on being paid for his trouble But now Uncle Jerry was going to read the sign for himself And Brownie Beaver moved up beside him to hear what he said The sign looked like this NO HUNTING OR FISHING ALOUD Uncle Jerry repeated the words in a sing song tone I don t think much of that he said It s bad enough to be hunted by people who make a noise though you have some chance of getting away then But if they can t make a noise it will be much more dangerous for all of us forest people If Tommy Fox hadn t happened to come along just then Uncle Jerry wouldn t have found out his mistake But Tommy Fox soon set him right As soon as he had talked a bit with Uncle Jerry he said What the sign really means is that no hunting or fishing will be permitted That last word should be allowed instead of aloud It s spelled wrong he explained That s better Uncle Jerry cried Now there ll be no more hunting in the neighborhood and we ll all be quite safe Farmer Green is kinder than I supposed When Brownie Beaver heard that he said good by and started home at once to tell the good news to all his friends He had leaped into the river and was swimming up stream rapidly when Uncle Jerry called to him to stop There s something I want to say Uncle Jerry shouted I think you ought to pay me for reading the sign But Brownie Beaver shook his head I didn t ask you to read the sign for me he declared You read it for yourself Uncle Jerry And besides you didn t know what it meant until Tommy Fox came along and told you If you want to know what I think I ll tell you I think you ought to pay Tommy Fox something Uncle Jerry at once began to look worried He said nothing more but plunged out of sight into some bushes as if he were afraid Tommy Fox might come back and find him Illustration Brownie Beaver Returned to His Wood cutting X A HOLIDAY There was great rejoicing in the little village in the pond when Brownie Beaver returned with the good news that there would be no more hunting and fishing And when old Grandaddy Beaver said that everybody ought to take a holiday to celebrate the occasion all the villagers said it was a fine idea 
32_21634_000004_000000	train-clean-100	So they stopped working for once and began to plan the celebration They thought that there ought to be swimming races and tree felling contests 
none	none	And Brownie Beaver said that after the holiday was over he would suggest that someone be chosen to go down and thank Farmer Green for putting the notice on the tree The whole village agreed to Brownie s proposal and they voted to see who should be sent 
32_21634_000005_000001	train-clean-100	Brownie Beaver himself passed his hat around to take up the votes 
32_21634_000005_000002	train-clean-100	And it was quickly found that every vote was for Brownie Beaver 
none	none	He had even voted for himself 
32_21634_000005_000004	train-clean-100	But no one seemed to care about that 
none	none	Then the swimming races began There was a race under water a race with heads out of water and another in which each person who took part had to stay beneath the surface as long as he could That last race caused some trouble A young scamp called Slippery Sam won it And many people thought that he had swum up inside his house where he could get air without being seen But no one could prove it so he won the race just the same Next came the tree felling contest 
32_21634_000008_000001	train-clean-100	There were six including Brownie Beaver that took part in it 
none	none	Grandaddy Beaver had picked out six trees of exactly the same size Each person in the contest had to try to bring his tree to the ground first 
32_21634_000008_000004	train-clean-100	And that caused some trouble too because some claimed that their trees were of harder wood than others and more difficult to gnaw while others complained that the bark of their trees tasted very bitter and of course that made their task unpleasant 
none	none	Those six trees falling one after another made such a racket that old mister Crow heard the noise miles away and flew over to see what was happening 
32_21634_000010_000000	train-clean-100	After everybody crept out of his hiding place some time afterward everyone had to hide for a while you know there was mister Crow sitting upon one of the fallen trees 
none	none	What s going on he inquired
32_21634_000011_000001	train-clean-100	 You re not going to cut down the whole forest I hope 
none	none	Then they told him about the celebration 
32_21634_000012_000001	train-clean-100	And mister Crow began to laugh 
32_21634_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 What are you going to do next he asked 
none	none	We re a going to send Brownie Beaver over to Pleasant Valley to thank Farmer Green for his kindness in putting an end to hunting and fishing said old Grandaddy Beaver And he s a going to start right away 
32_21634_000015_000000	train-clean-100	mister Crow looked around 
none	none	And there was Brownie Beaver with a lunch basket in his hand all ready to begin his long journey
32_21634_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 Say good by to him then said mister Crow for you ll never see him again 
32_21634_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 What do you mean Grandaddy Beaver asked 
none	none	And as for Brownie he was so frightened that he dropped his basket right in the water I mean said mister Crow I mean that it s a very dangerous errand You don t seem to have understood that sign In the first place it was not Farmer Green but his son Johnnie who nailed It to the tree Ah Brownie Beaver cried That is why one of the words was misspelled
32_21634_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 No doubt mister Crow remarked 
none	none	As a matter of fact not being able to read he hadn t known about the word that was spelled wrong
32_21634_000020_000002	train-clean-100	 In the second place he continued the sign doesn t mean that hunting and fishing are to be stopped 
none	none	It means that no one but Johnnie Green is going to hunt and fish in this neighborhood He wants all the hunting and fishing for himself 
32_21634_000020_000005	train-clean-100	That s why he put up that sign 
none	none	And instead of hunting and fishing being stopped I should say that they were going to begin to be more dangerous than ever They tell me he added that Johnnie Green had a new gun on this birthday Brownie Beaver said at once that he was not going on the errand of thanks I resign he said and anyone that wants to go in my place is welcome to do so 
32_21634_000023_000000	train-clean-100	But nobody cared to go 
32_21634_000023_000001	train-clean-100	And the whole village seemed greatly disappointed until Grandaddy Beaver made a short speech 
none	none	We ve all had a good holiday anyhow he said And I should say that was something to be thankful for XI BAD NEWS Have you heard the news Tired Tim asked Brownie Beaver one day There s going to be a cyclone A cyclone Brownie exclaimed What s that I never heard of one It s a big storm with a terrible wind Tired Tim explained The wind will blow so hard that it will snap off big trees Good Brownie Beaver cried Then I won t have to cut down any more trees in order to reach the tender bark that grows in their tops Tired Tim laughed You won t think it s very good he said when the cyclone strikes the village Why not Brownie inquired Because said Tired Tim because the wind will blow every house away It will snatch up the sticks of which the houses are built and carry them over the top of Blue Mountain Then I guess you ll wish you had taken my advice and not built that new house of yours I shall be safe enough the lazy rascal continued All I ll have to do will be to crawl inside my house in the bank for the wind can t very well blow the ground away Brownie Beaver thought that Tired Tim was just trying to scare him I don t believe there s going to be any such thing he exclaimed Don t you Tim grinned You just go and ask Grandaddy Beaver He s the one that says there s going to be a cyclone At that Brownie Beaver stopped working and hurried off to find old Grandaddy Beaver And to his great dismay Grandaddy said that what Tired Tim had told him was the truth It s a coming Grandaddy Beaver declared I saw one once before in these parts years before anybody else in this village was born And when I see a cyclone a coming I can generally tell it a long way off When is it going to get here Brownie asked in a quavering voice Next Tuesday Grandaddy replied What makes you think it s coming Well everything looks just the way it did before the last cyclone Grandaddy Beaver explained as he took a mouthful of willow bark The moon looks just the same and the sun looks just the same I had a twinge of rheumatics in my left shoulder yesterday and to day the pain s in my right It was exactly that way before the last cyclone Brownie Beaver did not doubt that the old gentleman knew what he was talking about He remembered that Grandaddy Beaver had warned everyone there was going to be a freshet And though people had laughed at the old chap the freshet had come Sadly worried Brownie went and called on all his neighbors and asked them what they were going to do And to his surprise he found that they were laughing at Grandaddy once more They seemed to have forgotten about the freshet But Brownie Beaver could not forget that dreadful night And now he tried to think of some way to keep his new house from being blown away by the great wind which Grandaddy Beaver said was coming on Tuesday without fail XII GRANDADDY BEAVER THINKS It was on a Friday that Brownie Beaver first heard the cyclone was coming And after making sure that Grandaddy Beaver knew what he was talking about when he said the great wind would sweep down upon the village on the following Tuesday Brownie spent a good deal of time wondering what he had better do He wanted to save his house from being blown over the top of Blue Mountain And he wanted to save himself from being carried along at the same time Before Friday was gone Brownie Beaver began to heap more mud and sticks upon his house to make it stronger And when Tired Tim came swimming past the lazy scamp laughed harder than ever I see you re afraid of the cyclone he called But what you re doing won t help you any The wind will blow away those sticks easily enough What you ought to do is to dig a house like mine in the bank Then you won t have to worry about any cyclone So Brownie set to work and made him a house like Tired Tim s On Monday he had finished it But he didn t like his new home at all It s no better than a rat s hole he said My family have never lived in such a place and I m not used to it I prefer my house that s built of sticks and mud And I m going to see if there isn t some way I can make it safe So Brownie went to Grandaddy Beaver again and asked him what he ought to do The old gentleman said he would try to think of a plan to save Brownie s house I wish you would hurry Brownie urged him To day is Monday and tomorrow the cyclone will be here What are you going to do to your own house Grandaddy My house said Grandaddy Beaver my house is very old It has had mud and sticks piled upon it every season for over a hundred years You can see for yourself that it s much bigger than yours And I reckon it s strong enough to stay where it is no matter how hard the wind blows But your house is different Let me think a minute the old gentleman said Brownie waited in silence while the old gentleman thought with his eyes shut tight Brownie watched him for a long time Once or twice he thought he heard something that sounded like a snore But he knew it couldn t be that it was only the thoughts trying to get inside Grandaddy s head At last Grandaddy sat up with a start Have you thought of something Brownie inquired What s that Grandaddy asked Oh yes I ve a good idea he said What you must do is to tie your house so the wind can t blow it away Brownie thanked him And he went away feeling quite happy again until he reached home and started to follow Grandaddy s advice Then he saw that he had forgotten something He hadn t anything with which to tie his house and make it safe from the cyclone XIII A LUCKY FIND Brownie Beaver almost wished he hadn t spent so much time waiting for Grandaddy to tell him to tie down his house so it wouldn t be carried away by the big wind on the following day With no rope or anything else to tie the house with Brownie could not see that Grandaddy s advice was of any use to him Anyhow he was glad he had done as Tired Tim had suggested and dug a house in the bank where he could hide until the storm passed But he felt sad at the thought of losing his comfortable home And since he could hardly bear to look at it and imagine how dreadful it would be to have it blown over the top of Blue Mountain into Pleasant Valley Brownie went for a stroll through the woods to try to forget his trouble He found himself at last in a clearing where loggers had been at work They had chopped down many trees And the sight made Brownie Beaver angry This is an outrage he cried aloud I d like to know who has been stealing our trees I suppose it s Farmer Green for they say he s always up to such tricks He took a good look around And then he turned to go back to the village and tell what he had discovered Just as he turned he tripped on something And something clinked beneath his feet It didn t sound like a stone So Brownie Beaver looked down to see what was there Now in his anger he had quite forgotten the great storm But as he saw what had tripped him he remembered it again But he was no longer worried Hurrah Brownie cried Here s just what I need And then he hurried back home again but not to tell about the trees that had been stolen He hastened home to chain down his house and save it from the great wind For Brownie Beaver had found a chain which the loggers had used to haul the logs out of the woods and had forgotten It was almost dark when Brownie reached his house in the village in the pond He was never a very good walker And dragging that heavy chain behind him through the forest only made him slower than ever Sometimes the chain caught on a bush and tripped him But Brownie was so pleased with his find that he only laughed whenever he fell for he was not hurt The whole village gathered round his house to watch him while he tied the chain on it and anchored the ends of the chain to the bottom of the pond with a big stone Why do you do that people asked He s afraid of the cyclone to morrow Tired Tim piped up without waiting for Brownie to answer You know old Grandaddy Beaver says that there s going to be a great wind This young feller said Tim he s already dug a house in the bank near mine ha ha He thinks Grandaddy knows But I say that Grandaddy Beaver is a a fine noble old gentleman Tired Tim stammered He had happened to glance around while he was talking and to his surprise there was Grandaddy floating in the water close behind him He certainly is everybody agreed But we hope he s mistaken about the great wind When Tuesday came which was the very next day Brownie Beaver crept into his tunnel in the bank at sunrise And he never came outside again until the sun had set When he saw that his house was still there in the middle of the pond he shouted with joy Hurrah he cried The chain saved my house Then he noticed that all the other houses were still there too How s this he asked Tired Tim who stood on the bank beside him Did my chain save the whole village Tired Tim grinned for he was not too lazy to do that There wasn t any cyclone he said There wasn t a breath of wind all day And old Grandaddy Beaver is so upset that he s gone to bed and won t talk with anybody XIV WAS IT A GUN Everybody in the village where Brownie Beaver lived was very much upset Most people were angry too And no doubt it was natural that they should feel that way because while they were taking their midday naps a man had come and paddled about their village in a boat Brownie Beaver was the first to hear him and he quickly spread the alarm There was a great scurrying as all the villagers stole out of their houses and swam away under water to hide in holes in the bank of the pond and in other places they knew Toward night when they all came back again the man had gone But Brownie and his neighbors were still angry You must remember that their rest had been disturbed and they were feeling somewhat sleepy So far as they could see the man had done no damage either to their houses or to the dam But people felt a bit uneasy just the same until old Grandaddy Beaver looked all around and reported that the man had set no traps You see Grandaddy knew a great deal about traps He had been caught in one when he was young Luckily he managed to get away and he learned a few things that he never forgot Now Brownie Beaver had begun to cut down a tree the night before Something had interrupted him and he had left the tree not quite gnawed through and needing only a few more bites to bring it down He was intending to finish his task soon after dark which was the time he liked best for working Accordingly after Brownie had finished his supper and had called at every house in the village to talk over the visit of the strange man he swam to the shore of the pond and made his way to the slanting tree which stood a short distance from the water It was quite dark And that was what Brownie liked because he could work without being disturbed at least that was what he thought Since he could see quite well in spite of the dark he had no trouble in finding his tree And he lost no time in setting to work on it again He began to gnaw at it once more But he hadn t moved more than half way around the tree trunk when something happened that almost frightened him out of his skin Right out of the darkness came a blinding flash of light And at the same time a queer click sounded in the bushes close by Just for a moment Brownie Beaver was stiff with fear But when the darkness closed in upon him again he ran for his life toward the pond And plunging into the water he swam quickly to the bottom and hurried up his winding hall into his bedroom where he crouched trembling upon his bed wondering whether he had been shot Brownie knew that at night a gun made a flash of light But this gun if it was a gun made no roar such as was made by the guns Brownie had sometimes heard at a distance in the woods He wished that old Grandaddy Beaver was there For he did not doubt that the old gentleman could tell him exactly what had happened XV JASPER JAY S STORY After the blinding flash of light and the queer click had sent Brownie Beaver hurrying home from his partly gnawed tree he stayed in his house for a long time before he ventured out again Indeed the night was half gone when he at last he stole forth to find Grandaddy Beaver and tell him about his awful fright Brownie found the old gentleman resting after several hours work upon the big dam And when young Brownie told Grandaddy what had happened the old gentleman didn t know just what to think It couldn t have been a moonbeam he said because there s no moon to night And I don t see how it could have been a gun because there was no roar Did you hear a sort of whistle he asked Anything that sounded like a bullet passing over your head Brownie Beaver shuddered at the mere mention of a bullet I heard nothing but that odd click he replied That s what a gun sounds like when it s cocked said Grandaddy Beaver But with a gun the click comes first the flash next and the roar last of all And here you tell me the flash came first the click next and there was no roar at all What s a body a going to think I d like to know It wasn t a gun that s sure And if you want to know what I say about it why I say that it was a very strange thing that happened to you And I d keep away from that tree for a long time I had made up my mind that I d do that Brownie told him And then he went home again But he never went to sleep until almost noon the following day for whenever he closed his eyes he seemed to see that blinding flash of light again When Jasper Jay came on Saturday afternoon to tell Brownie Beaver what had happened in the world during the past week he had an astounding piece of news Here s something about you Jasper told Brownie as soon as he could catch his breath Jasper had flown faster than usual that day because he had such interesting news Your picture he told Brownie is in the photographer s window way over in the town where Farmer Green goes sometimes Brownie Beaver gave Jasper a quick look I ve often suspected he said that you don t always tell me the truth And now I know it I ve never been to the photographer s in my life So how could he have my picture I should like to know But you don t have to go to the photographer s to have your picture taken Jasper Jay retorted Why couldn t the photographer come to you I suppose he could Brownie Beaver said But he s never been here Jasper Jay gave one of his loud laughs That he said that is just where you are mistaken And when I explain how I came by this news maybe you ll believe me Tommy Fox told it to me Jasper went on and old dog Spot told it to him Everybody knows that old Spot sometimes goes to town with his master They were there yesterday And Spot saw your picture himself What s more he heard the photographer tell Farmer Green that he came up here almost a week ago hid his camera in some bushes and set a flashlight near a half gnawed tree And when you started to work on the tree that night you brushed against a wire and the flashlight flared up and the camera took your picture before you could jump away Now what do you say Jasper Jay demanded Now do you think I m telling you the truth Brownie Beaver was so surprised that it was several minutes before he could speak Then he said Grandaddy Beaver was right It wasn t a gun I was just having my picture taken Brownie was actually pleased because he knew he was the only person in his village that had ever had such a thing happen to him After that he was ready to believe everything Jasper Jay told him So Jasper related some wonderful news And it would hardly be fair for anyone not present at the time to say that it wasn t perfectly true every word of it Illustration The Chain Caught on a Bush and Tripped Him XVI LOOKING PLEASANT After Jasper Jay left Brownie Beaver on that day when Jasper told Brownie that the photographer had made a flashlight picture of him Brownie could hardly wait for it to grow dark He had made up his mind that he would go back to that same tree which was still not quite gnawed through and he hoped that he would succeed in having his picture taken again Like many other people Brownie Beaver felt that he could not have too much of a good thing There was another reason too for his going back to the tree If the light flared again and the click sounded in the bushes Brownie intended to go right into the thicket and get his picture before anybody else could carry it away with him You can understand how little he understood about taking photographs Well the dark found Brownie back at the tree once more And he began once more to gnaw at it He tried to look pleasant too because he had heard that that was the way one should look when having his picture taken He found it rather difficult gnawing chips out of the tree and smiling at the same time But he was an earnest youngster and he did the best he could Brownie Beaver kept wishing the flashlight would go off because what with smiling and gnawing his face began to ache But no glare of light broke through the darkness It was not long before Brownie had gnawed away so many chips that the tree began to nod its head further and further toward the ground And Brownie wished that the flash light would hurry and go off before the tree fell But there was not even the faintest flicker of light It was most annoying And Brownie was so disappointed that for once he forgot to be careful when he was cutting down a tree He kept his eyes on the bushes all the time instead of on the tree as he should have done And all the time the tree leaned more and more At last there was a snap Brownie Beaver should have known what that meant But he was so eager to have his picture taken that he mistook the snap for the click that he had first heard almost a week before He thought it must be the click of a camera hidden in the bushes And he stood very still and looked extremely pleasant Now Brownie Beaver should have known better But like most people for once he made a mistake What he really heard was the tree snapping And before he could jump out of the way the tree came crashing down upon him and pinned him fast to the ground He saw a flash of light to be sure and a good many stars But all that only came from the knock on his head which the tree gave him XVII BROWNIE ESCAPES When the tree crashed down upon Brownie Beaver and held him fast it was some time before he came to his senses Then he did not know at first where he was nor what had happened to him But at last he remembered that he had been cutting down a tree not far from the pond and he saw that it must have fallen upon him Of course the first thing that occurred to him was to call for help But just as he opened his mouth to shout another thought came into his head Perhaps some man might hear him or a bear And Brownie Beaver closed his mouth as quickly as he had opened it Then he tried to squirm from under the tree trunk But he couldn t move himself at all Next he tried to push the tree away from him But he couldn t move the tree either For a long while Brownie Beaver struggled first at one impossible thing and then at the other And all the time the tree seemed to grow heavier and heavier Finally Brownie stopped trying to get free and began to feel hungry You can see that he must have been worried because there was the tree with plenty of bark on it which he could eat But he never noticed it for a long time At last however he happened to remember that in the beginning he had started to cut down that very tree so he could reach the bark and eat it Then Brownie Beaver had a good meal And just as he finished eating another thought came into his head Why shouldn t he gnaw right through the tree Since there seemed to be no answer to that question he began to gnaw big chips out of the wood And in a surprisingly short time he had cut the tree apart just where it pressed upon him Then of course all he had to do was to get up and walk away When he reached the village he found that all his neighbors had been looking everywhere for him That is Grandaddy Beaver explained we looked everywhere except near the tree where you had that adventure a few nights ago I said you wouldn t be there for I advised you to keep away from that spot as you will recall Now Brownie Beaver said nothing more He knew that it was an unheard of thing for one of the Beaver family to be caught by a falling tree To have everyone know what had happened to him would be a good deal like a disgrace But there are plenty of people who would think they had done something quite clever if they had gnawed through a tree with their teeth though that was something that never once entered Brownie Beaver s head XVIII mister FROG S QUESTION Why don t you get some new clothes It was mister Frog that asked the question and he asked it of Brownie Beaver who was at work on top of his house mister Frog had been hiding among the lily pads watching Brownie But Brownie hadn t noticed him until he stuck his head out of the water and spoke At first mister Frog s question made Brownie a bit peevish What s the matter with my clothes he asked hotly There s nothing the matter with them nothing at all said mister Frog except that they are not as becoming to you as they might be Of course he added as he saw that Brownie Beaver was frowning you look handsome in them But you ve no idea how you d look in clothes of my making Brownie Beaver felt more agreeable as soon as mister Frog had told him what he meant Do you make clothes he inquired I m a tailor mister Frog replied And I ve just opened a shop at the upper end of the pond What s the matter with my tail Brownie snapped He was angry again Then mister Frog explained that a tailor made suits We ve nothing to do with tails he said unless it s coat tails What about cattails Brownie asked You re pretty close to some right now So you can hardly say you have nothing to do with them mister Frog smiled I see you re a joker he said And it really seems a pity he went on that a bright young fellow like you shouldn t wear the finest clothes to be had anywhere If you ll come to my shop I ll make you a suit such as you never saw before in all your life I ll come Brownie Beaver promised I ll be there at sunset And he went mister Frog was waiting for him with a broad smile on his face Any smile of his just had to be broad because he had such a wide mouth Come right in mister Frog said I ll measure you at once So Brownie Beaver stepped inside mister Frog s shop to be measured for his new suit It was all over in a few minutes mister Frog scratched some figures on a flat stone And then he went into the back room of his shop He stayed there a long time And when he came into the front part again he found Brownie Beaver still there What are you waiting for mister Frog asked He seemed surprised that Brownie had not left I m waiting for my suit of course Brownie Beaver said Oh That won t be ready for three days mister Frog told him I have to make it you know Brownie thought that mister Frog must be a slow worker and he told him as much But mister Frog did not agree with him I m very spry he claimed On the jump every minute As Brownie started away mister Frog called him back I d get a new hat if I were you he suggested What s the matter with this hat Brownie wanted to know It s a beaver hat one my great grandfather used to wear It s been in our family a good many years and I d hate to part with it You needn t part with it mister Frog said pleasantly Just don t wear it that s all For it won t look well with the clothes I m going to make for you Then Brownie Beaver moved away once more And again mister Frog stopped him I d buy a collar if I were you he said What s the matter with this neckerchief Brownie Beaver demanded It belonged to my great grandmother Then I d be careful of it if I were you mister Frog told him And please get a stiff white collar to wear Won t it get limp in the water Brownie asked doubtfully Get a celluloid one of course mister Frog replied That s the only kind of collar you ought to wear So Brownie Beaver left the tailor shop And he was feeling quite unhappy He had always been satisfied with his clothes But now he began to dislike everything he had on And he could hardly wait for three day to pass he was in such a hurry for mister Frog to finish his new suit XIX THE NEW SUIT Three days had passed And as soon as he had finished his breakfast Brownie Beaver hastened to the tailor shop of mister Frog who had been making him a suit of clothes Much to Brownie s disappointment he found that mister Frog s door was locked But he sat down on the doorstep and waited a long time And at last mister Frog appeared After bidding Brownie Beaver good morning mister Frog yawned widely remarking that he had been out late the night before at a singing party he said What can I do for you he asked Brownie Beaver You can let me have my new suit of clothes Brownie told him You must be mistaken mister Frog replied I don t remember you I m not making any suit for you At that Brownie Beaver became much excited Why he exclaimed I was here three days ago and you measured me Don t you know me now he asked Sorry to say I don t was mister Frog s answer Brownie Beaver was desperate He had looked forward eagerly to having his new suit And he wanted it at once You advised me to get a new hat and a collar Brownie reminded him mister Frog smiled Ah That s it he cried You re wearing them now and it s no wonder I didn t recognize you You look ten years younger Brownie Beaver was puzzled I m not ten yet he said So if I look ten years younger I must appear very young indeed The new clothes will fix that mister Frog assured him But you just told me you were not making a suit for me said Brownie Quite true too answered mister Frog because it s all finished So of course I m not making it now They had stepped inside the shop And mister Frog carefully took some garments off a peg and spread them before Brownie Beaver There he said with an air of pride The finest suit you ever saw I ll slip it on said Brownie Oh I wouldn t do that mister Frog told him You might stretch it But nothing could have kept Brownie Beaver out of his new suit He scrambled into it quickly while the tailor stood by with a worried look upon his face The coat seems to be all right Brownie remarked But there s something wrong with the trousers I can t see my feet He bent over and gazed down where his feet ought to have been But they had vanished And an end of each trouser leg trailed on the floor These trousers are too long Brownie declared Then you stretched them putting them on mister Frog said I warned you you know I was very careful Brownie said I m sure it can t be that Then your legs are too short mister Frog told him glibly They look to me to be much shorter than they were when I measured you My legs Brownie Beaver exclaimed my legs are exactly the same length they were three days ago You ve made a mistake mister Frog That s what s the matter with these trousers But mister Frog shook his head I made them according to your measurements he insisted Let me see your figures Brownie Beaver cried But mister Frog shook his head again I don t do business that way he explained As soon as I ve finished a suit I throw away the stone on which I ve written the measurements It saves trouble if there s any complaint afterwards Well said Brownie What can we do about this I can t wear the trousers as they are You ll have to get your legs stretched mister Frog told him Just tie a stone to each foot and wear the trousers for a few days As soon as you see your feet take off the stones It s simple enough He helped tie some heavy stones to Brownie s feet And then Brownie swam away Now swimming with your feet weighted like that is no easy matter But Brownie managed to reach home He stayed there too for the rest of the day because it was hard for him to move about And since he had nothing else to do he went to sleep When he awoke about an hour before sunset he couldn t think at first what made his feet feel so heavy He thought he must be ill until he remembered about the stones being tied to his feet Then he looked down And to his great surprise and joy there were his feet sticking out of his trousers just as they ought to stick out Brownie untied the stones He had not supposed his legs would stretch so quickly as that And he told himself that mister Frog was a good tailor He certainly knew his business Now as a matter of fact mister Frog was a very careless person He had thrown away Brownie s measurements before he made his clothes instead of afterwards And he had made the new suit entirely by guesswork It was only natural that he would make some mistake and so he had cut the trousers entirely too long When he discovered that he wanted to get Brownie out of his shop And what happened next was simply this After Brownie s trousers were
