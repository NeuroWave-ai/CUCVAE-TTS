none	none	so he whirled his pony about urging the little animal into a side street so that he might be out of the way of the body of men whom he saw rushing down upon them on galloping ponies Hurry Tad he called from the protection of the side street That others in the street had heard and seen as well was evident from the frantic haste with which they scrambled for the sidewalk crowding those already there over yard fences into stores and stairways in an effort to get clear of the roadway A sudden panic had seized them for well did they know the meaning of the shooting and the shouting A band of wild uncontrollable cowboys free for the time from the exacting work of the range were sweeping down on the town determined to do their part in the observance of the day Yet Tad Butler the freckle faced boy remained where he was undisturbed by the uproar finding great interest in the excited throngs that were hurrying to cover Nor did he appear to be alarmed when a moment later he found himself almost the sole occupant of the street at that point with his pony backed up against the curbing tossing its head and champing its bit restlessly As for the freckle faced boy and his companion the reader no doubt has recognized in them our old friends Tad Butler and Ned Rector the Pony Rider Boys After their exciting experiences in the Rockies and their discovery of the Lost Claim which gave each of the boys a little fortune of his own as narrated in the preceding volume The Pony Rider Boys in the Rockies the Pony Riders had turned toward Texas as the scene of their next journeying With Walter Perkins and Stacy Brown the boys under the guidance of Professor Zepplin were to join a cattle outfit at San Diego whence they were to travel northward with it This was to be one of the biggest cattle drives of recent years A cattle dealer

none	none	Thomas B Miller had purchased a large herd of Mexican cattle which he decided to drive across the state on the old trail instead of shipping them by rail to his ranch in Oklahoma It had been arranged that the Pony Riders were to become members of the working force of the outfit during what was called the drive across the State of Texas The boys were awaiting the arrival of the herd at San Diego on this Fourth of July morning Though they did not suspect it the Pony Rider Boys were destined on this trip to pass through adventures more thrilling and hardships more severe than anything they had even dreamed of before The cattle had arrived late the previous evening though the boys had not yet been informed of the fact The animals were to be allowed to graze and rest for the day while the cowmen or such of them as could be spared were given leave to ride into town in small parties It was the advance guard of the cowboys whose shots and yells had stirred the people in the street to such sudden activity On they came a shouting yelling mob Tad turned to look at them now The sight was one calculated to stir the heart and quicken the pulses of any boy But the face of Tad Butler reflected only mild curiosity as he gazed inquiringly at the dashing horsemen each one of whom was riding standing in his stirrups waving sombrero and gun on high What interested the freckle faced boy most was their masterful horsemanship Y e e e o w exploded the foremost of the riders Bang Bang Bang Bang As many puffs of white smoke leaped into the air from the revolvers of the skylarking cowmen W h o o o p e they chorused in a mighty yell letting go at the same time a rattling fire Y e e e o w As they swept down toward the spot where Tad was sitting on his pony the cowboys swung into line six abreast thus filling the street from curb to curb This time however instead of shooting into the air they lowered the muzzles of their revolvers sending volley after volley into the street ahead of them the leaden missiles viciously kicking up the dirt into miniature clouds like those from heavy drops of rain in advance of a thunder squall Tad s pony began to show signs of nervousness Whoa commanded the boy sharply tightening his rein and pressing his knees firmly against the animal s sides The prancing pony was quickly mastered by its rider though it continued to shake its head in emphatic protest Out of the way you tenderfoot yelled a cowman espying the boy and pony directly in his path Tad Butler did not move Y e e e o w shrieked the band in a series of shrill cries When they saw that the boy was holding his ground so calmly their revolvers began to bark spitefully flicking up a semicircle of dust about the pony s feet causing the little animal to prance and rear into the air At this Tad s jaws set stubbornly his lips pressing themselves firmly together The boy brought his quirt down sharply on the pony s flank at the same time pressing the pointless rowels of his spurs against the sides of the frightened animal Though Tad determinedly held his mount in its place he was no longer able to check its rearing and plunging for the wiry little animal was wholly unused to such treatment Besides a volley of revolver bullets about its feet would disturb the steadiest horse Two cowboys on his side of the street had driven their mounts toward the lad with a yell Tad did not wholly divine their purpose though he knew that their intent was to frighten him into giving them the street He felt instinctively that if he should refuse to do so some sort of violence would be visited upon him It followed a moment later Observing that the boy had no intention of giving way to them the two cowboys held their course their eyes fixed on the offending tenderfoot until finally only a few rods separated them Suddenly both men pulled their mounts sharply to the right and digging in the spurs plunged straight for Tad So that s their game is it thought the boy They were going to run him down Tad s eyes flashed indignantly yet still he made no move to pull his pony out of the street Keep off he shouted Don t you run me down W h o o o p howled the pair at the same time letting go a volley right under the hoofs of his pony It seemed to the lad that the powder from their weapons had burned his face so close had the guns been when they pulled the triggers Tad had braced himself for the shock that he knew was coming gathering the reins tightly in his right hand and leaning slightly forward in his saddle They were fairly upon him now Two revolvers exploded into the air accompanied by the long shrill yell of the plainsmen But just when it seemed that the lad must go down under the rush of beating hoofs Tad all but lifted his pony from the ground turned the little animal and headed him in the direction in which the wild horsemen were going The boy s clever horsemanship had saved him Yet one of the racing cow ponies struck the boy and his horse a glancing blow For the moment Tad felt sure his left leg must have been broken He imagined that he had heard it snap As he swept past the boy the cowboy had uttered a jeering yell Tad brought down his quirt with all his force on the rump of the kicking cow pony whose hoofs threatened to wound his own animal Then a most unexpected thing happened that is unexpected to the cowboy Looking back at the boy he had attempted to unhorse the cowman was leaning over far to the left in his saddle when Tad struck his horse The pony under the sting of the unexpected blow leaped into the air with arching back and a squeal of rage The cowboy s weight on the side of the startled animal overbalanced it and the animal plunged sideways to the street The cowpuncher managed to free his left leg from the stirrup but quick as he was he was not quick enough to save himself wholly from the force of the fall The fellow ploughed the dirt of the street on his face while the pony springing to its feet was off with a bound The other cowpunchers set up a great jeering yell as they saw the unhorsing of their companion by a mere boy while the villagers and country folks laughed as loudly as they dared Yet there was not one of them but feared that the angry cowpuncher would visit his wrath upon the lad who had been the cause of his downfall With a roar of rage he scrambled to his feet In his fall the fellow s gun had been wrenched from his hand and lay in the street He picked it up as he started for Tad Butler Tad who had sat in his saddle calmly now realized that he must act quickly if he expected to save himself His plan was formed in a flash Digging in the spurs and at the same time slapping the little animal smartly on its side the lad caused his little pony to leap violently forward Drop that gun As he uttered the stern command the boy brought his quirt down across the cowman s knuckles with a resounding whack The cowman with a yell of rage sprang at him but the blow aimed at Tad Butler s head never reached him CHAPTER II THE PONY RIDERS JOIN THE OUTFIT At that instant a man clad in the dress of a cowboy leaped from the sidewalk He caught the angry cowman by the collar From the way in which the newcomer swung the fellow around it was evident that he was possessed of great strength Stop it he thundered Tad s assailant turned on the newcomer with an angry snarl his rage now beyond all control Let me alone Let me get at the cub he cried making a vicious pass at the man The cowboy s blow was neatly parried and a mighty fist was planted squarely between his eyes sending him to earth in a heap Get up commanded the man who had felled him The cowboy struggled to his feet standing sullenly before his conqueror Look at me Lumpy Didn t I tell you that I d fire you if you got into any trouble in town to day The cowboy nodded Is this the way you obey orders What sort of recommend do you suppose Boss Miller will give you when I tell him I found you trying to shoot up a kid I don t care I ain t askin any recommends Besides he he got in Never mind what he did I saw it all Get your pony and back to the camp for yours Let Bert come in your place You get no more lay offs till I see fit to let you Now git Thoroughly subdued but with angry muttered protests the cowboy walked down the street jerking his pony s head about and swinging himself into the saddle Don t be rough on the fellow Let him stay The newcomer turned to Tad glancing up at the boy inquiringly Young fellow you ve got nerve more nerve than sense Thank you But I asked you to let the man stay He won t do it again urged Tad I m the best judge of that And as for you young fellow I would advise you to ride your pony away from here First thing I know you will be mixing it up with some of the rest of the bunch I may not be around to straighten things out then and you ll get hurt Thank you sir I think I have as much right here as anyone else If those are your men I should think you might be able to teach them to respect other people s rights What teach a cowboy laughed the other You don t know the breed Take my advice and skip Tad s rescuer strode away The lad s introduction to cowboy life had not been of an encouraging nature though it was difficult for him to believe that all cowboys were like the one he had just encountered Well you made a nice mess of it didn t you chuckled Ned Rector riding up beside his companion a few minutes later I didn t see it but I heard all about it from Bob Stallings Stallings Who s he The foreman of the cowboys with whom we are going And were those the fellows that tried to crowd me off the street I reckon those were the boys said Ned Rector quietly Then I can see a nice time when we join them They will have no love for me after what has happened this morning Where is the camp I don t know Professor Zepplin says it s about four miles to the west of here When do we join them Some time to night The foreman says they are going to start at daylight He s over at the hotel talking with the Professor now He was telling the Professor about your mix up with Lumpy Bates That s the name of the cowboy who ran into you And how he did laugh when I told him you belonged to our crowd chuckled Ned What did he say Said he thought you d do He says we can t use our ponies on the drive Why not asked Tad looking up quickly Because they are not trained on cattle work Pshaw I m sorry Have we got to leave them here No He says we may turn them in with their herd and use them for anything we care to except around the cattle We shall have to ride some of the bronchos when we are on duty I think I see somebody falling off laughed Tad Ever ride one of them Ned No Well you ll know more about them after you have I think I should like to go over and see mister Stallings declared Tad All right come along then They found the foreman of the outfit discussing the plans for their journey with Professor Zepplin while Stacy Brown and Walter Perkins were listening with eager attention This is Master Tad Butler mister Stallings announced the Professor I think I have met the young man before answered the foreman with a peculiar smile Tad I am surprised that you should involve yourself in trouble so soon after getting out of my sight I The boy was not to blame mister Professor My cowpunchers were wholly in the wrong But you need have no fears of any future trouble The bunch will be given to understand that the young gentlemen are to be well treated You will find no luxuries but lots of hard work on a cattle drive young men Do do we get plenty to eat interrupted Stacy Brown apprehensively All joined in the laugh at the lad s expense Chunky s appetite is a wonderful thing mister Stallings said Tad I think we shall be able to satisfy it laughed the foreman Our cook is a Chinaman His name is Pong but he knows how to get up a meal I believe if he had nothing but sage grass and sand he could make a palatable dish of them provided he had the seasoning Have you boys brought your slickers with you What s a slicker demanded Chunky A rubber blanket that Oh yes We bought an outfit of those at Austin answered Tad Anything else that you wish us to get The boys don t carry guns do they Professor Zepplin shook his head emphatically Most certainly not They can get into enough trouble without them We have rifles in our kit but I imagine there will be little use for such weapons on this trip You can t always tell about that smiled the foreman I remember in the old days when we used to have to fight the rustlers that a rifle was a pretty good thing to have Who were the rustlers asked Walter Fellows who rustled cattle that didn t belong to them But the old days have passed Such a drive as we are making now hasn t been done on so large a scale in nearly twenty years Why not asked Ned The iron trails have put the old cow trails out of business Iron trails wondered Tad Railroads We men of the plains refer to them as the iron trails That s what they are in reality Professor do you wish the boys to take their turns on the herd to night As you wish mister Stallings I presume they will be anxious to begin their life as cowboys I understand that s an ambition possessed by most of your American boys All right laughed the foreman I ll send them out as I find I can with some of the other cowpunchers until they learn the ropes There is too great a responsibility on a night man to trust the boys alone with that work now But they can begin if they wish I ll see first how the bunch get back from their celebration of the glorious Fourth You ll come out and have supper with us No I think not We shall ride out just after supper if you will have some one to show us the way answered the Professor Sure I ll send in Big foot Sanders to pilot you out You boys need not be afraid of Big foot He s not half so savage as he looks but he s a great hand with cows Big foot Sanders rode up to the hotel shortly after six o clock Leading his pony across the sidewalk he poked his shaggy head just inside the door of the hotel Ki yi he bellowed causing everybody within hearing of his voice to start up in alarm Where s that bunch of tenderfeet Are you mister Sanders from the Miller outfit asked the Professor stepping toward him Donno about the Mister I m Big foot Sanders I m lookin for a bunch of yearlings that s going on with the outfit The young gentlemen will join you in a moment mister Sanders They will ride their ponies around from the stable and meet you in front of the house You one of the bunch I am Professor Zepplin a sort of companion you know for the young men Huh grunted Big foot I reckon you d better forget the hard boiled hat you re wearin or the boys ll be for shooting it full of holes Take my advice drop it pardner Oh you mean this laughed the Professor removing his derby hat Thank you I shall profit by your advice and leave it here when I start All the bunch got hard boiled ones Oh no The boys have their sombreros answered the Professor Big foot grunted but whether in disapproval or approval Professor Zepplin did not know The cowpuncher threw himself into his saddle on which he sat stolidly awaiting the arrival of the Pony Riders In a short time they came galloping from the stable at the rear of the hotel and pulled up facing the cowman This mister Sanders is Tad Butler announced the Professor Huh grunted Big foot again Hello Pinto he said after a sharp glance into the freckled face Who s the gopher over there That s Stacy Brown otherwise known as Chunky laughed Tad This is Ned Rector and the young gentleman at your left is Walter Perkins all members of the Pony Rider Boys party We are ready to start whenever you are For answer Big foot touched his pony with a spur the little animal springing into a gallop without further command The Pony Riders followed immediately Tad riding up beside the big muscular looking cowboy which position he held for half an hour without having been able to draw a word from him Leaving the town due east of them the party galloped off across the country in a straight line until finally the cowman pointed off across the plain to indicate where their destination lay A slow moving mass of red and brown and white met the inquiring gaze of the boys At first they were unable to make out what it was Cows growled the guide observing that they did not understand What are they doing mister Sanders asked Tad Don t mister me I m Big foot Never had a handle to my name Never expect to They re grazing Be rounding them up for bed pretty soon Ever been on a trail before

none	none	We have been up in the Rockies on a hunting trip This is my first experience on the plains Huh Got good and plenty coming to you then And I am ready for it answered the lad promptly The rougher the better There s the bunch waiting for us All of them got back from town The foreman don t allow the fellows to hang out nights when they re on a drive like this Now the rest of the Pony Rider Boys understanding that they were nearing the camp of the cowboys urged their ponies into a brisk gallop and drew up well into line with Tad and Big foot That is all did save Stacy Brown who as was his habit lagged behind a few rods The cowboys were standing about watching the approach of the new arrivals curiously but not with any great enthusiasm for they did not approve of having a lot of tenderfeet with the outfit on a journey such as they were taking now They were bent on grim and serious business man s work the sort of labor that brings out all that is in him It was no place for weaklings and none realized this better than the cowmen themselves Yet they did not know the mettle that was in these four young American boys though they were to realize it fully before the boundaries of the Lone Star State had been left behind them The Pony Riders dashed up to the waiting cowpunchers with a brave showing of horsemanship and sprang from their saddles their eyes glowing with excitement and anticipation Bob Stallings the foreman was the first to greet them Fellows this is the bunch I ve been telling you about was Bob s introduction Where s Lumpy he demanded glancing about him with a scowl Lumpy s over behind the chuck wagon answered the cowboy of whom the question had been asked Lumpy bellowed the foreman The fellow with whom Tad Butler had had such an unpleasant meeting earlier in the day came forward reluctantly a sudden scowl on his face Lumpy this is Tad Butler Stick out your fist and shake hands with him Lumpy did so Howd y he growled but scarcely loud enough for any save Tad to hear The lad smiled up at him good naturedly You and I bumped ponies this morning I guess said Tad Maybe I was to blame after all I ll apologize anyway and I hope there will be no hard feelings Lumpy warned Stallings when he noticed that the cowpuncher had made no reply to Tad s apology No hard feelings grunted Lumpy Bates He was about to turn away and again seek the seclusion of the chuck wagon as the cook wagon was called by the cow boys when Chunky came rolling along In the excitement of the meeting the boys had forgotten all about him The Pony Riders swung their sombreros and gave three cheers for Chunky Brown as he dashed up Chunky took off his sombrero and waved it at them Just then Chunky met with one of those unfortunate accidents that were always occurring to him His galloping pony put a forefoot into a gopher hole going down in a heap Chunky however kept on When the accident happened he was almost upon the waiting cowboys his intention having been to pull his pony up sharply to show off his horsemanship then drop off and make them a sweeping bow Stacy Brown was possessed of the true dramatic instinct yet few things ever came off exactly as he had planned them As he shot over the falling pony s head his body described a half curve in the air his own head landing fairly in the pit of Lumpy Bates s stomach Cowboy and Pony Rider went over in a struggling heap with the Pony Rider uppermost Stacy had introduced himself to the cowboys in a most unusual manner and to the utter undoing of one of them for the boy s head had for the moment knocked all the breath out of the surly Lumpy Bates CHAPTER III PUTTING THE COWS TO BED The cowpunchers roared at the funny sight of the fat boy bowling over their companion Stallings however fearing for the anger of Lumpy sprang forward and hauled the lad back by the collar while Lumpy was allowed to get up when he got ready He did so a few seconds later sputtering and growling scarcely able to contain his rage That s a bad way to get off a pony young man laughed the foreman I hope you won t dismount in that fashion around the cattle at night If you do you sure will stampede the herd Chunky grinned sheepishly It doesn t take much to start a bunch of cows on the run after dark continued the foreman I ve known of such a thing as a herd being stampeded because they were frightened at the rising moon Haven t you Big foot Sanders nodded The gopher ll do it too he s a clumsy lout he answered referring to Stacy in a withering tone And now boys I will tell you how our watches are divided after which you can go out with the cowboys and see them bed down the cows Bed them down spoke up Chunky his curiosity aroused That s funny I didn t know you had to put cattle to bed You ll see that we do Boys the night of the cowman on the march is divided into four tricks The first guard goes on at half past eight coming off at half past ten The second guard is on duty from that time till one o clock in the morning the third from that hour till half past three while the fourth remains out until relieved in the morning He usually wakes up the cook too And by the way you boys haven t made the acquaintance of Pong have you I ll call him Unless you get on the right side of Pong you will suffer Pong That s funny Sounds like ping pong I used to play that interrupted Stacy Pong is as funny as his name even if he is a Chinaman laughed Stallings Pong come here The Chinaman having heard his name spoken was peering inquiringly from the tail of the chuck wagon Hopping down he trotted over to the group his weazened yellow face wreathed in smiles Shake hands with these young gentlemen Pong They will be with us for the next two weeks said the foreman Allee same likee this chuckled Pong clasping his palms together and gleefully shaking hands with himself That s the Chinaman s idea of shaking hands laughed Stallings He always shakes hands with himself instead of the other fellow Stacy Brown suddenly broke into a loud laugh attracting all eyes to him Funniest thing I ever heard of he muttered abashed by the inquiring looks directed at him Now watch the heathen while I ask him what he is going to have for breakfast said the foreman Pong what are you going to give us out of the chuck wagon in the morning Allee same likee this chattered the Chinaman quickly turning to his questioner at the same time rapidly running through a series of pantomime gestures The Pony Riders looked at each other blankly He says we are going to have fried bacon with hot biscuit and coffee Stallings informed them with a hearty laugh Pong is not much of a talker That s about as much as you ever will hear him say He s weak on talk and strong on motions The foreman glanced up at the sky It s time to put the cows to bed You young gentlemen may ride along on your own ponies but keep well back from the cattle Those of you who go out to night will have to ride our ponies All ready now The entire outfit mounted and set off over the plain to where the cattle were moving slowly about but not grazing much They had had their fill of grass and water and were now ready for the night Where s their beds asked Chunky gazing about him curiously Right ahead of you answered Stallings The foreman s quick eye already had picked out a nice elevation on which the old dry grass of the previous summer s growth lay matted like a carpet for the cattle to bed down on How many of them are there in the herd asked Tad About two thousand That was the first count Since then we have picked up a few stray cows We will be cutting those out in a day or so when you will see some real cow work Perhaps you will be able to help by that time Now the cowmen galloped out on the plain separating widely until they had practically surrounded the herd They began circling slowly about the herd at the same time gradually closing in on them The animals appeared to understand fully what was expected of them for they had been on the road several nights already Besides having had their fill they were anxious to turn in for the night As they found spots to their liking the animals began to throw themselves down Tad uttered an exclamation of delight as he watched the steers going to their knees in hundreds then dropping on their sides contentedly chewing their cuds It was such a sight as he never before had seen What are those steers on the outside there those fellows without any horns asked Stacy Those are the muleys Having no horns they keep well out of the bunch and
64_76973_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 wait 
none	none	until the others have gone to bed as you see the foreman informed him You will notice after a while that they will lie down outside the circle If any of the cows get ugly during the night the muleys will spring up and get out of the way In half an hour the last one of the great herd had bedded down and those of the cowboys who were not on guard rode leisurely back toward camp It had been decided that Tad Butler should go out on the first guard Walter Perkins on the second Ned Rector third and Stacy Brown fourth Tad was all eagerness to begin One of the cowmen exchanged ponies with him riding Tad s horse back to camp You see our ponies understand what is wanted of them explained Stallings who had remained out for a while to give Tad some instruction in the work before him Give the ordinary cow pony his head and he will almost tend a herd by himself Three men ordinarily constituted the guard In this case Tad Butler made a fourth Taking their stations some four rods from the edge of the herd they began lazily circling it part going in one direction and part in another In this position it would have been well nigh impossible for any animal to escape without being noticed by the riders Now I guess you will be all right smiled the foreman Make no sudden moves to frighten the cattle Do they ever run asked Tad Run Well rather And I tell you it takes a long legged Mexican steer to set the pace Those fellows can run faster than a horse at least some of them can
64_76974_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 A stampede 
none	none	is a thing most dreaded by the cowmen Our ponies stampeded in the Rockies I know something about that spoke up Tad Well compare the stampeding of your four or five ponies with two thousand head of wild steers and you ll get something like the idea of what it means In that case unless you know your business you had better get out of the way as fast as hoss flesh will carry you Now Master Tad I ll bid you good night and leave you to your first night on the plains How shall I know when to come in When the second guard comes out You will hear them If you should not they will let you know as they pass you With that the foreman walked his pony away from the herd After some little time Tad heard him galloping toward camp At first Tad took the keenest enjoyment in his surroundings then the loneliness of the plains came over him He began to feel a longing for human companionship A dense mantle of darkness settled down over the scene Remembering the advice of the foreman the lad gave his pony the rein The hardy little animal with nose almost touching the ground began its monotonous crawling pace about the herd It seemed more asleep than awake In a short time a sheet of bright light appeared on the eastern horizon Tad looked at it inquiringly then smiled It s the moon he decided The boy felt a great sense of relief in his lonely vigil Just ahead of him he saw a pony and rider leisurely approaching It proved to be Red Davis one of the first guard Red waved his hand to the boy in passing but no word was spoken on either side After having circled the herd twice Tad suddenly discovered a small bunch of cattle that had just scrambled to their feet and had begun grazing a little way outside the circle The rest of the herd were contentedly chewing their cuds in the moonlight grunting and blowing over contented stomachs The lad was not sure just what he ought to do His first inclination was to call to some of the other guards Then remembering the injunction placed upon him by the foreman he resisted the impulse I am sure those cattle have no business off there he decided after watching them for a few moments in silent uncertainty I believe I will try to get them back Tightening the grip on his reins and clucking to the pony Tad headed for the steers that were slowly moving off taking a step with every mouthful or so He steered his pony well outside and headed in toward them The pony with keen intelligence forced its way up to the leading steer and sought to nose it around The animal resisted and swung its sharp horns perilously near to the side of the horse which quickly leaped to one side almost upsetting its rider Guess I d better let the pony do it himself He knows how and I don t muttered Tad slackening on the reins The straying animal was quickly turned and headed toward the herd after which the pony whirled and went after one of the others turning this one as it did the others In a short time the truants were all back in the herd That s the way to do it young fellow I told the gang back there that the Pinto had the stuff in him Tad turned sharply to meet the smiling face of Big foot Sanders who sitting on his pony had been watching the boy s efforts and nodding an emphatic approval You ll make a cowman all right said Big foot CHAPTER IV THE FIRST NIGHT IN CAMP The camp fire was burning brightly when the first guard having completed its tour of duty came galloping in In a few moments the sound of singing was borne to the ears of the campers What s the noise demanded Stacy Brown sitting up with a half scared look on his face It s the Cowboy s Lament laughed Bob Stallings Listen Off on the plain they heard a rich tenor voice raised in the song of the cowman Little black bull came down the hillside Down the hillside down the hillside Little black bull came down the hillside Long time ago I don t call that much of a song sniffed Chunky contemptuously after a moment of silence on the part of the group Even if I can t sing I can beat that Better not try it out on the range smiled the foreman Not on the range Why not demanded the boy Bob thinks it might stampede the herd spoke up Big foot Sanders A loud laugh followed at Chunky s expense When you get to be half as good a man on cows as your friend the Pinto here you ll be a full grown man added Big foot The Pinto rounded up a bunch of stray cows to night as well as I could do it myself and he didn t go about it with a brass band either The foreman nodded with an approving glance at Tad Tad s eyes were sparkling from the experiences of the evening as well as from the praise bestowed upon him by the big cowpuncher The pony did most of it admitted the lad I just gave him his head and that s all there was to it More than most tenderfeet would have done growled Big foot Walter had gone out with the second guard and the others had gathered around the camp fire for their nightly story telling Now I don t want you fellows sitting up all night objected the foreman None of you will be fit for duty to morrow We ve got a hard drive before us and every man must be fit as a fiddle You can enjoy yourselves sleeping just as well as sitting up Humph grunted Curley Adams I ll give it as a horseback opinion that the only way to enjoy such a night as this is to sit up until you fall asleep with your boots on That s the way I m going to do it to night The cowboy did this very thing but within an hour he found himself alone the others having turned in one by one Where are your beds asked Stacy after the foreman had urged the boys to get to sleep Beds grunted Big foot Anywhere everywhere Our beds on the plains are wherever we happen to pull our boots off You will find your stuff rolled up under the chuck wagon boys said Stallings I had Pong get out the blankets for you seeing that you have only your slickers with you The lads found that a pair of blankets had been assigned to each of them with an ordinary wagon sheet doubled for a tarpaulin These they spread out on the ground using boots wrapped in coats for pillows Stacy Brown proved the only grumbler in the lot declaring that he could not sleep a wink on such a bed as that In floundering about making up his bunk the lad had fallen over two cowboys and stepped full on the face of a third Instantly there was a chorus of yells and snarls from the disturbed cowpunchers accompanied by dire threats as to what they would do to the gopher did he ever disturb their rest in that way again This effectually quieted the boy for the night and the camp settled down to silence and to sleep The horses of the outfit save those that were on night duty and two or three others that had developed a habit of straying had been turned loose early in the evening for animals on the trail are seldom staked down For these a rope had been strung from a rear wheel of the wagon and another from the end of the tongue back to a stake driven in the ground thus forming a triangular corral Besides holding the untrustworthy horses it afforded a temporary corral for catching a change of mounts In spite of their hard couches the Pony Riders slept soundly even Professor Zepplin himself never waking the whole night through Ned Rector had come up smiling when awakened for his trick on the third guard With Stacy Brown however severe measures were necessary when one of the returning guard routed him out at half past three in the morning Stacy grumbled turned over and went to sleep again The guard chanced to be Lumpy Bates and he administered what to him was a gentle kick to hurry the boy along Ouch yelled Chunky sitting up and rubbing his eyes Keep still you baby growled the cowman Do you want to wake up the whole outfit There ll be a lively muss about the time you do I reckon and you ll wish you hadn t If you can t keep shut the boss ll be for making you sleep under the chuck wagon If you make a racket there Pong will dump a pot of boiling water over you You won t be so fast to wake up hard working cowboys after that I reckon What do you want demanded the boy What d you wake me up for It s your trick Get a move on you and keep still There s the pony ready for you I wouldn t have saddled it but the boss said I must I don t take no stock in tenderfoot kids growled the cowpuncher Is breakfast ready asked the boy tightening his belt and jamming his sombrero down over his head Breakfast jeered Lumpy You re lucky to be alive in this outfit let alone filling yourself with grub Get out Stacy ruefully and still half asleep made a wide circle around the sleeping cowmen that he might not make the mistake of again stepping on any of them Lumpy watched him with disapproving eyes The lad caught the pony that stood moping in the corral not appearing to be aware that his rider was preparing him for the range Chunky all the time muttering to himself Leading the pony out the boy gathered up the reins on the right side of the animal and prepared to mount Lumpy Bates came running toward him not daring to call out for fear of waking the camp The cowman was swinging his arms and seeking to attract the lad s attention Chunky however was too sleepy to see anything so small as a cowman swinging his arms a rod away Placing his right foot in the stirrup the boy prepared to swing up into the saddle Hi there hissed Lumpy filled with indignation that anyone should attempt to mount a pony from the right side His warning came too late Stacy Brown s left leg swung over the saddle No sooner had the pony felt the leather over him than he raised his back straight up his head going down almost to the ground Stacy shot up into the air as if he had been propelled from a bow gun He struck the soft sand several feet in advance of the pony his face and head ploughing a little furrow as he drove along on his nose He had no more than struck however before the irate cowboy had him by the collar and had jerked the lad to his feet You tenderfoot he snarled accenting the words so that they carried a world of meaning with them Don t you know any more than to try to get onto a broncho from the off side Say don t you He shook the lad violently N n n o gasped Stacy D d does it m m make any difference w w h i ch side you get on Does it make any difference The cowboy jerked his own head up and down as if the words he would utter had wedged fast in his throat Git out of here before I say something The boss said the first man he heard using language while you tenderfeet were with us would get fired on the spot Without taking the chance of waiting until Stacy had mounted the pony Lumpy grabbed the boy and tossed him into the saddle giving the little animal a sharp slap on the flank as he did so At first the pony began to buck then evidently thinking the effort was not worth while settled down to a rough trot which soon shook the boy up and thoroughly awakened him The rest of the fourth guard had already gone out Chunky meeting the returning members of the third coming in Better hurry up kid they chuckled The cows ll sleep themselves out of sight before you get there if you don t get a move on Where are they asked the boy Keep a going and if you re lucky you ll run plumb into them was the jeering answer as the sleepy cowmen spurred their ponies on toward camp muttering their disapproval of taking along a bunch of boys on a cattle drive In a few moments they too had turned their ponies adrift and had thrown themselves down beside their companions pulling their blankets well about them for the night had grown chill Out on the plains the fourth guard were drowsily crooning the lullaby about the bull that came down the hillside long time ago It seemed as if scarcely a minute had passed since the boys turned in before they were awakened by the strident tones of the foreman Roll out Roll out he roared bringing the sleepy cowpunchers grumbling to their feet Almost before the echoes of his voice had died away a shrill voice piped up from the tail end of the chuck wagon Grub pi i i le Grub pi i i le It was the Chinaman Pong sounding his call for breakfast in accordance with the usage of the plains Grub pi i i le he finished in a lower tone after which his head quickly disappeared under the cover of the wagon By the time the cowmen and Pony Riders had refreshed themselves at the spring near which the outfit had camped a steaming hot breakfast had been spread on the ground with a slicker for a table cloth Three cowboys fell to with a will gulping down their breakfast in a hurry that they might ride out and relieve the fourth guard on the herd You boys don t have to swallow your food whole smiled the foreman observing that the Pony Riders seemed to think they were expected to hurry through their meal as well Those fellows have to go out Take your time The fourth guard has to eat yet so there is plenty of time How did you all sleep Fine chorused the boys And you mister Professor Surprisingly well It is astonishing with how little a man can get along when he has to Who is the wrangler this morning asked the foreman glancing about at his men I am spoke up Shorty Savage promptly Wrangler What s a wrangler demanded Stacy delaying the progress of a large slice of bacon which hung suspended from the fork half way between plate and mouth A wrangler s a wrangler answered Big foot stolidly He s a fellow who s all the time making trouble isn t he asked Stacy innocently Oh no this kind of a wrangler isn t laughed the foreman The trouble is usually made for him and it s served up hot off the spider The horse wrangler is the fellow who goes out and rounds up the ponies Sometimes he does it in the middle of the night when the thunder and lightning are smashing about him like all possessed and the cattle are on the rampage He s a trouble curer not a troublemaker except for himself I guess there are some words that aren t in the dictionary laughed Tad I think you will find them all there Master Tad if you will consult the big book said the Professor The meal was soon finished Pong having stood rubbing his palms a happy smile on his face during the time they were eating A very fine breakfast sir announced the Professor looking up at the Chinaman He knows what would happen to him if he didn t serve good meals smiled Stallings What do you mean asked Ned Rector Pong tell the young gentlemen what would become of you if you were to serve bad meals to this outfit of cowpunchers The Chinaman showed two rows of white teeth in his expansive grin Allee same likee this he explained How asked Tad Pong going through the motions of drawing a gun from his belt and puffing out his cheeks uttered an explosive pouf Oh you mean they would shoot you asked Walter I hardly think they would do that Pong Allee same grinned the Chinaman I guess we are pretty sure of having real food to eat then laughed Tad as the boys rose from the table ready for the active work of the day We will now get to work on the herd announced the foreman We had better start the drive this morning When we make camp at noon we will cut out the strays I trust none of you will be imprudent and get into trouble for we shall have other things to look after to day However the Pony Riders were destined not to pass the day without one or more exciting adventures CHAPTER V CUTTING OUT THE HERD Getting ready for rain announced the foreman glancing up at the gathering clouds That will mean water for the stock anyway Already the great herd was up and grazing when the cowboys reached them But there was no time now for the animals to satisfy their appetites They were supposed to have eaten amply since daylight The trail was to be taken up again and by the time the steers were bedded down at night they should be all of fifteen miles nearer the Diamond D Ranch for which they were headed The start was a matter of keen interest to the Pony Riders To set the herd in motion cowboys galloped along the sides of the line giving vent to their shrill wolf keyed yell while others pressed forward directly in the rear As soon as the cattle had gotten under way six men were detailed on each side and in a short time the herd was strung out over more than a mile of the trail Two riders known as point men rode well back from the leaders and by riding forward and closing in occasionally were able to direct the course of the drive Others known as swing men rode well out from the herd their duty being to see that none of the cattle dropped out or strayed away Once started the animals required no driving This was a matter of considerable interest to the Pony Riders Don t they ever stop to eat asked Tad of the foreman Occasionally When they do we have to start them along without their knowing we are doing so It s a good rule to go by that you never should let your herd know they are under restraint Yet always keep them going in the proper direction The trail wagon carrying the cooking outfit and supplies was not forgotten Drawn by a team of four mules the party seldom allowed it to get far away from them and never under ordinary circumstances out of their sight The driver walked beside the mules while the grinning face of Pong was always to be seen in the front end of the wagon He was the only member of the outfit who never seemed to mind the broiling mid day heat He was riding there on this hot forenoon never leaving his seat until the foreman by a gesture indicated that the herd was soon to be halted for its noonday meal While the cattle were grazing the cowboys would fall to and satisfy their own appetites After the cattle had finally been halted three men were left on guard while the others rode back to the rear of the line In the meantime Pong had been preparing the dinner which was ready almost as soon as the men had cast aside their hats When it comes to cooking for an outfit like this a Chinaman beats anything in the world laughed Stallings At least this Chinaman does Pong was too busy to do more than grin at the compliment even if he fully grasped the meaning of it The meal was nearly half finished when the cowpunchers were startled by a volley of revolver shots accompanied by a chorus of shrill yells What s up now demanded Ned Rector and Tad in one breath Every member of the outfit had sprung to his feet Sounds like a stampede flung back the foreman making a flying leap for his pony The other cowboys were up like a flash and into their saddles uttering sharp ki yis and driving in the spurs while they laid their quirts mercilessly over the rumps of the ponies Tad Butler Ned Rector and Walter Perkins were not far behind the cowmen in reaching their own ponies and leaping into their saddles Not so with Chunky He only paused in his eating long enough to look his surprise and to direct an inquiring look at the Chinaman while the others went dashing across the plain toward the herd Allee same likee this announced Pong making a succession of violent gestures that Stacy did not understand But the boy nodded his head wisely and went on with his eating Out where the grazing herd had been peacefully eating its noonday meal all was now excitement and action Revolvers were popping cowboys were yelling and the herd was surging back and forth bellowing and dashing in and out a shifting confused mass of color and noise The boys did not know what to make of it Yes they are stampeding decided Ned riding alongside of Tad Butler I don t believe it answered Tad It looks to me as if something else were the trouble What I don t know It s an awful mix up whatever they may call it Yes see They are fighting Surely enough large numbers of the cattle seemed to be arrayed against each other sending up great clouds of dust as they ran toward each other locked horns and engaged in desperate conflict It was noticed however that the muleys kept well out of harm s way standing aloof from the herd and looking on ready to run at the shake of a horn in their direction Now look there What are they doing asked Walter They seem to be cutting out a bunch of steers answered Tad That s funny I can t imagine what it is all about Neither could Professor Zepplin who had ridden up at a more leisurely pace explain to the boys the meaning of the scene they were viewing If we knew we might turn in and help suggested Walter That s right replied Tad Suppose we ride up there where the men are at work We may find something to do Anyway we ll find out what the trouble is Starting up their ponies the boys galloped up the line keeping a safe distance from the herd as they did so and halting only when they had reached the trail leaders as the cattle at the head of the line are called What s the trouble shouted Ned as they came within hailing distance of the perspiring foreman Mixed herd he called back curtly driving his pony into the thick of the fight and yelling out his orders to the men I know almost as much about it as I did before announced Ned disgustedly Got any idea Tad Yes I have For goodness sake let s have it then If I don t find out what s going on here pretty soon I shall jump into the fight in sheer desperation mister Stagings said it was a mixed herd Don t you think that must mean that a lot of cattle who don t belong there have mixed up with ours asked the freckle faced boy I guess that s the answer Tad But if so how can they tell one from the other wondered Walter From the brands I have learned that much about the business Every one of our herd is branded with a capital D in the center of a diamond That is the brand of mister Miller s ranch the Diamond D Ranch Evidently they are cutting out all that haven t that brand on Hello There s Chunky Now what do you suppose he is up to exclaimed Ned Stacy Brown had finished his meal mounted his pony and was now riding toward the herd at what was for him a reckless speed All at once they saw him pull his mount sharply to the left and drive straight at a bunch of cattle that the cowboys had separated from the herd a few moments before The boy was too far away the racket too loud for their voices to reach him in a warning shout Stacy having observed the cattle straying away and having in mind Tad Butler s achievement in driving back a bunch of stray steers thought he would do something on his own account I ll show them I can drive steers as well as anybody he told himself bringing down the quirt about the pony s legs The strong limbed little beast sprang to his work with a will He understood perfectly what was wanted of him A few moments more and he had headed off the rapidly moving bunch effectually turning the leaders sending them on a gallop back toward the vast herd fighting and bellowing in the cloud of dust they had stirred up The cowboys were so fully occupied with their task that they had failed to observe Stacy Brown s action nor would they have known anything about it had not Tad yelling himself hoarse managed to attract the attention of the foreman Tad pointed off to where Chunky was jumping his pony at the fleeing cattle forcing them on with horse and quirt They had almost reached the main herd before Tad succeeded in informing the foreman One look was enough for Stallings Before he could act however the stray herd had once more mingled and merged with his own The work of the cowboys had gone for naught Stallings fired three shots into the air as a signal to his men to stop their cutting out Will you young men do me a favor he asked Certainly mister Stallings answered Tad Then ride around the herd and tell the boys not to try any more cutting out until the herd has quieted down The dust is so thick that we can t do anything with the cows anyway You have some sense but that s more than I can say for your friend Brown Of all the idiotic oh what s the use Tell him to mind his own business and keep half a mile away from this herd for the rest of the afternoon All right sir Where did those cattle come from I don t know Tad They have broken away from some nearby ranch Probably somebody has cut a wire fence and let them out That s the worst of the wire fence in the modern cow business They can get through wire without being seen But they can t get by a cowpuncher without his seeing them How many cattle do you think have got mixed with ours I should imagine there were all of five hundred of them answered the foreman Tad uttered a long drawn whistle of astonishment Will will you ever be able to separate them asked Ned We sure will But it means a hot afternoon s work May we help you mister Stallings spoke up Walter Yes I shall be able to use you boys some I guess It s a wonder to me that those cows didn t stampede our whole herd Had it been night our stock would have been spread over a dozen miles of territory by this time Being day however our herd preferred to stay and fight the newcomers I hope they clean up the bunch for keeps Pleased that they had been given a task to perform the boys rode away Tad and Walter going in one direction while Ned Rector galloped off in another that they might reach the cowmen in the shortest possible time The men they found sitting on their horses awaiting orders though they understood what was in the mind of the foreman almost as well as if he had told them by word of mouth They found Big foot and Lumpy Bates expressing their opinion of the mix up in voices loud with anger But upon discovering the boys the cowmen quickly checked their flow of language Did you see what that that bellowed Lumpy as Tad rode up to him Yes I saw it laughed Tad You think this is some kind of a joke eh roared Lumpy starting his pony toward Tad The boy s smile left his face and clucking to his pony he rode slowly forward toward the angry cowpuncher meeting the fellow s menacing eyes unflinchingly Is there anything you wish to say to me mister Bates asked the lad calmly Lumpy s emotions were almost too great for speech He controlled himself with an effort No only this I I ll forget myself some day and clean up one of you idiotic tenderfeet Perhaps you would like to begin on me sir said Tad steadily If you feel that way I should prefer to have you do that rather than to try it on any of my companions Stacy Brown may be indiscreet but I d have you understand he is no idiot What what You have determined to get square with us ever since we joined out with you last night and I knew that you and I would have to have an understanding before long We might as well have it now though there s nothing of enough consequence to have a quarrel about You threaten me Nothing of the kind mister Bates I only wish to tell you that my companions are the guests of this outfit and we propose to act like gentlemen Every other member of the outfit not excepting the Chinaman has given us fine treatment You have hung back hoping you would have a chance to get us run off the trail The cowpuncher s fingers were opening and closing convulsively You you run into me The whole bunch had the laugh on me and If I remember correctly it was you who ran me down But we ll drop that Will you shake hands and forget your bad temper asked the lad reaching over and offering a hand to the cowboy For an instant the fellow glared at him then with a snarl he jerked his pony about and drove in the rowels of the spurs Lumpy s got on the grouch that won t come off grinned Big foot Better keep a weather eye on the cayuse If he gets obstreperous just you let me know Thank you smiled Tad I thought I had better say something to him before it went too far I knew he meant mischief to us ever since he ran into me yesterday at San Diego Tad then delivered his message and rode on to the next cowpuncher For fully an hour the cattle surged and fought some being killed and trampled under foot while others were so seriously wounded that they had to be shot later in the day After a time the battle dwindled down to individual skirmishes with two or three animals engaged at a time until finally the entire herd moved off to the fresher ground that had not been trodden upon and began grazing together as contentedly as if nothing had occurred to disturb them All immediate danger of a stampede having passed Stallings fired a shot as a signal for the cowmen to join him This they did on the gallop After a conference during which each man gave his opinion as to whom the stray herd belonged to none recognizing the brand Stallings made up his mind what to do You will begin at the lower end and cut out as you go through the herd Cut the newcomers to the west which will be starting them back toward where they came from wherever that may be At the same time while we cut we will be moving our cows north which is the direction in which we want them to go In the meantime Stacy Brown had ridden up He was sitting disconsolately on his pony near where the conference was being held having been roundly scored by every cowboy in the outfit The foreman motioned him to ride over to him Young man can you carry a message back to camp and get it straight Stacy thought he could Then go back and tell the heathen to pack up his belongings and come on There will be no more eating done in this outfit till we have cut out that new bunch Tell the driver to be ready to move when he sees us start We ll get in a few miles before dark yet if we have good luck Stacy rode away full of importance to deliver the foreman s order Then the cutting out began Cowboy after cowboy dashed into the herd coming out usually with his pony pressing against the side of an unwilling steer and pushing him along in the right direction by main force And here was where the Pony Riders made themselves useful As an animal was cut out the boys would ride in behind it and worry the steer along until they had gotten it a safe distance to the west of the main herd There s a Diamond D steer in that bunch Tad informed one of the cowpunchers as he rushed a big white steer out Never mind we ll trim the mixed outfit after we get more of the bunch out answered the cowboy riding back into the herd While doing the cutting out the men also drove out the few cattle that had strayed into the herd earlier in the journey For three hours this grilling work had kept up the perspiring cowboys yelling their ponies squealing under the terrific punishment they were getting from both riders and steers But in the excitement of their own work the Pony Riders had had little time in which to observe what the cowmen were doing Tad thought of a plan by which he might assist them further So he galloped his pony over to the edge of the main herd and waited until the foreman dashed out with two red fighting steers which he gave a lively start on their way to join the mixed herd mister Stallings may I cut back some of the Diamond D animals in the mixed herd he asked Think you can do it kid I can try All right Go ahead Be careful that you don t turn back any of the other brands though Above all look out for yourself Tad galloped back to his companions his face flushed the dust standing out on his blue shirt turning it almost gray Keep this herd up fellows he shouted I m going to try my hand at cutting out Fortunately the pony understood what was wanted of it and the moment it had located an animal which it was desired to cut out the pony went at the work with a will Tad triumphant and warm rode out driving a Diamond D steer ahead of him applying his quirt vigorously to the animal s rump until he had landed it safely in the ranks of the main herd Again and again had the boy ridden in among the cattle seemingly taking no account of the narrow escapes both rider and pony were having from the sharp horns of the long legged Mexican cattle One big white fellow gave the lad more trouble than all the rest that he had cut out and when once Tad had run him out into the open the perspiration was dripping from his face But his battle was not yet won The steer for some reason best known to itself did not wish to return to its own herd It fought every inch of the way wearing down pony and rider until they were almost exhausted Tad Butler s blood was up however He set his jaw stubbornly and plunged into the work before him Bob Stallings shooting a glance in the boy s direction understood what he had in hand for the foreman had made the acquaintance of this same steer himself earlier on the drive The lad had worried the animal nearly to its own herd after half an hour s struggle when despite all his efforts it broke away and dashed back toward the mixed bunch I ll get him if it s the last thing I ever do vowed the boy A rawhide lariat hung from his saddle bow and though he had practised with the rope on other occasions he did not consider himself an expert with it He had watched the cowboys in their use of it and knew how they threw a cow with the rope On the spur of the moment Tad decided to use the lariat Lifting it in his right hand and swinging the great loop high above his head he dashed up to the running steer and when near enough to take a cast let go of the loop It fell over the horns of the white animal as neatly as a cowboy could have placed it there The coil ran out in a flash yet quick as the boy was he found himself unable to take a hitch around the pommel of his saddle with the free end The running steer straightened the rope and Tad shot from his saddle still clinging desperately to the line CHAPTER VI TAD TAKES A DESPERATE CHANCE When the freckle faced boy took his unexpected plunge it chanced that neither cowboys nor Pony Riders were looking his way No one knew of his plight As he felt the line running through his hand Tad Butler had given it a quick hitch around his right wrist so that when the rope drew taut and the pony braced itself to meet the shock the lad fairly flew through the air The white steer had been headed for the mixed bunch which the Pony Riders were guarding With the stubbornness of its kind it wheeled about the instant it felt the tug on the rope and dashed for the main herd Tad s body ploughing up the dust as he trailed along at a fearful pace behind the wild animal whirling over and over in his rapid flight The lad s eyes were so full of sand dust that he was unable to see where he was going He had slight realization of the peril that confronted him Look Look cried Walter Perkins What is it cried Ned Rector What s that the steer is dragging I don t know And there s Tad s pony standing out there alone added Walter You you don t think Tad As I m alive it is Tad He is being dragged by the steer He ll be killed Watch this herd I am going after him shouted Ned putting spurs to his pony and dashing toward the main herd At that moment the white steer trailing its human burden rushed in among the other cattle and was soon lost among them Ned did not dare to set up a loud shout of warning for fear of frightening the cattle However he was waving his hat and excitedly trying to attract the attention of some of the cowmen They were too busy to give any heed to him Ned drove his pony in among the struggling cattle with no thought of his own danger The cowmen were roping and rushing the stock that did not belong to them As it chanced however most of them were working at the upper end or head of the herd The foreman for some reason had galloped down the line casting his eyes keenly over the herd Instantly he noticed that something was wrong though just what it was he was unable to decide Then his eyes caught the figure of Ned Rector the center of a sea of moving backs and tossing horns The boy was standing in his stirrups still swinging his sombrero above his head It took the foreman but an instant to decide what to do Wheeling his pony he fairly dived into the mass of cattle lashing to the right and left of him with his ready quirt the cattle resentfully shaking threatening heads at pony and rider and making efforts to reach them with their sharp pointed horns What is it shouted Stallings after he had ridden in far enough to make his voice reach Ned Rector It s Tad What about him He s in there answered Ned pointing Where What do you mean I don t know It s the white steer He dragged him Stallings thought he understood He had seen the lad working with the unruly animal only a few moments before What s the trouble did the boy rope him shouted the foreman Ned nodded He ll be trampled to death snapped the foreman rising high in his stirrups and looking over the herd There were several white steers in the bunch but the one in question was so much larger than the others that Stallings thought he would have no difficulty in picking out the animal Not finding him at once the foreman fired two shots in the air to attract the attention of the cowboys Three of them soon were seen working their way in Open up the herd he shouted Whereabouts asked Reddy Davis Anywhere Look out for the big white cow The boy s roped to him They understood at once Big foot Sanders had heard and began working like an automatic machine The way the cattle big and little fell away before his plunging pony and ready quirt was an object lesson for those of the Pony Riders who were near enough to see his effort In the thick of it was Ned Rector driving his pony here and there anxiously watching for the white steer There he is shouted Ned suddenly espying the animal still dashing about Where There to the right of you Forcing his mount through the crowded ranks Stallings in a moment found himself within reach of the white beast However there were three or four cattle between himself and the one he wanted The foreman s rope circled in the air above his head then the great loop squirmed out over the backs of the cattle dropping lightly over the horns of the white one The steer felt the touch of the rope and knew the meaning of it As the animal sprang forward Stallings took a quick turn about the pommel of his saddle and the pony braced its fore feet When the shock came the cattle over whose backs the rope lay felt it even more than did the pony itself Three of them were forced to their knees bawling with sudden fright and pain The head of the white steer was jerked to one side A swing of the rope and the steer was thrown heavily Get in there roared Stallings Ned at the moment chanced to be nearer than were any of the others to the animal and to him fell the perilous work of holding down the kicking beast He knew exactly what was expected of him having seen a cowboy hold a steer down for a quick branding that morning Ned spurred in and leaped to the ground Without an instant s hesitation he threw himself on the neck of the struggling animal whose flying hoofs made the attempt doubly dangerous This act of Ned enabled Stallings to jump from his pony and run to the lad s assistance leaving the pony braced to hold the line taut The foreman sprang to the rear where he observed the form of Tad Butler doubled up lying half under the body of a big red steer Stallings picked him up quickly cutting the lariat Slip the loops off his horns he commanded Look out that you don t get pinked by them Is Tad hurt called Ned anxiously Lucky if he ain t dead answered the foreman hurrying to his pony which he mounted taking the boy in his arms By this time Ned had the ropes and had sprung away from the steer s dangerous horns Tad s form hung limp and lifeless over the saddle His face with the sand and dust ground into it was scarcely recognizable Ned followed the foreman as soon as he could get his pony By the time Ned reached them Stallings had laid Tad down and was making a quick examination Get water Hurry he commanded sharply Where asked Ned glancing about him undecided which way to turn The chuck wagon Ride kid Ride Ned bounced into his saddle without so much as touching his stirrup With a sharp yell to the animal he sped away over the plain urging on the little pony with quirt and spur The way Ned Rector rode that day made those of the cowmen who saw him open their eyes Ned began shouting for water as soon as he came in sight of the wagon which by this time was packed for the start Pong understanding from the boy s tone that the need was urgent was filling a jug from the tap barrel by the time Ned rode up beside the wagon He had less than a minute to wait Grabbing the jug from the hands of the grinning Chinaman and unheeding Pong s chuckled allee same Ned whirled about and raced for the herd The lad struggled to keep back the tears as he realized that even with all his haste it might be too late That Tad should come out of that melee of flying hoofs and prodding horns without being at least seriously injured was more than he could hope Faster and faster ran the pony behind him a rising cloud of yellow dust Ned s fingers were stiff and numb from carrying the heavy jug and the lump in his throat was growing larger it seemed to him with every leap of the animal under him Now Ned could see the cowmen galloping in and gazing from their ponies He knew they were looking at Tad Stallings was bent over him pouring something down the boy s throat Ned s heart gave a great bound Tad Butler must be alive or there would be no need for the liquid that the foreman was forcing down his throat CHAPTER VII THE HERD FORDS THE RIVER Is he is he asked Ned weakly after they had taken the jug of water from his hand He s alive if that s what you mean answered Stallings I m afraid he s got a slight concussion of the brain He doesn t come around the way I should like to see him Sure it isn t a fracture asked the Professor who had just arrived on the scene No I hardly think so The foreman washed the unconscious boy s face soaking Tad s head and neck and searching for the seat of the trouble Huh Steer kicked him grunted Stallings It was a glancing blow luckily for the kid They worked over the lad for fully half an hour before he began to show signs of returning consciousness At last his trembling eyelids struggled apart and he smiled up at them weakly Ah He s all right now I guess laughed the foreman with a world of relief in his tone Boys get busy now and cut out the rest of those cows If the young man is not able to ride we ll put him in the chuck wagon when it comes up Feel bad anywhere now he asked My my head weighs a ton I should think it would Did the white steer kick you I I don t know Hello Professor I roped him all right didn t I mister Stallings You did But you got roped yourself too I reckon Think you ll be able to ride in the trail wagon If not we ll have to send you back to town That ll be the best place for the tenderfoot growled Lumpy Bates Stallings turned a stern eye upon him Lumpy when I want your opinion I ll let you know What are you doing here anyway Get into that cut out and be mighty quick about it Lumpy rode away growling I ll ride in no trail wagon announced Tad Butler with emphasis I guess you will have to my boy I ll ride my pony if I have to be tied on he declared resolutely The foreman laughed heartily Well we ll see about that You boys all have good stuff in you I see that Master Walter and the gopher are still out there looking after that bunch of cattle I told them to do so spoke up Tad And they are obeying orders That s the first thing to learn in this business May I sit up now You may try Tad s head spun round when he raised himself up The lad fought his dizziness pluckily and mastered it After a little while they helped him to his feet Finally feeling himself able to walk he started unsteadily away from them Where are you going demanded the Professor Pony answered Tad I protest Tad You will come back here at once Tad turned obediently Please Professor I m all right Let the boy go He will be all right in a few moments after he has gotten into the saddle urged the foreman Besides he s too much of a man to be treated like a weakling He ll get more bumps than that before he leaves this outfit if I m any judge The Professor motioned to Tad to go on which the lad did petting his pony as he reached him and then pulling himself into the saddle with considerable effort I m ready for business now he smiled waving a hand to the foreman Better look on and let the rest do the work advised Stallings mounting his own tough pony and riding into the thick of the cutting out process But Tad Butler could no more sit idly by while the exciting work was going on than could the foreman himself The first steer that was cut out from the main herd after Stallings went back found Tad Butler alongside of it crowding it toward his own herd farther out And this work he kept up until all the strangers had been separated from the Diamond D stock There I m glad that job is done exclaimed Stallings whipping off his hat and drawing a sleeve across his perspiring brow Too bad I had to go and upset things so said Tad Never mind It s all in a day s work On a cattle drive if it isn t one thing it s sure to be another We have been lucky enough not to have a stampede thus far That isn t saying we won t however If you feel like working you can ride up and join the point men We ll make five or six miles before it is time to bed down the herd To Tad s companions was left the task of driving the strange cattle a couple of miles to the west and leaving them there The boys could not well lose the main herd for no sooner had they started on the trail than a great cloud of dust slowly floated up into the air Tad in his position near the head of the line and well out to one side of it was free from this annoyance The longer the lad was in the saddle the stronger he seemed to feel and the only trace that was now left of his recent experience among the hoofs of the Mexican steers was a bump on one side of his head almost as large as a hen s egg It was near sundown when the foreman who had ridden on ahead some time before came back with the information that a broad stream that was not down on his map lay just ahead of them There s not more than thirty feet of swimming water there and I believe I ll make a crossing before we go into camp he announced briefly How deep is the water asked Big foot Sanders In the middle deep enough to drown but on the edges it s fordable The cows will be glad of a drink and a swim after the heat of to day With this in mind the cowmen were instructed to urge the cattle along at a little stronger pace that they might all get well over before the night came on The animals seemed to feel the presence of water ahead of them for they ceased their grazing by the wayside and swung into a rapid pace such a pace as always gladdens the heart of the cowboy The steers held it until the rays of the setting sun were reflected on the surface of the broad sluggish stream The Pony Riders dashed forward intent upon reaching the stream first Tad followed them upon receiving permission from the foreman to do so The banks on each side were high and steep making it far from an ideal fording place Stallings however thought it better to cross there than to take the time to work the herd further down Joining the boys he cast his glance up and down the stream to decide whether his judgment had been correct I thought we were going to cross the river said Stacy Brown That s exactly what we are going to do replied the foreman But where s the bridge I don t see any objected the lad Right there in front of you Where Chunky there is no bridge Tad informed him We have to wade just as the cattle will And swim too part of the way added Stallings But we ll get wet wailed Chunky No doubt about that roared the foreman Swim the river with our horses exclaimed Ned Hurrah That will be great I shall be glad to get some of this dust washed off me laughed Tad Besides the bump on my head will feel better for it I think Spread out boys The cattle are coming up on the run They will push you into the river before you are ready if you happen to be in their way warned Stallings The riders clucked to their ponies and all galloped up stream some distance that they might be well out of the way of the oncoming herd The thirsty animals plunged into the water with a mighty splash Some forded until their feet could no longer touch the ground after which they swam to the other side while others paused to drink until those behind them forced them out into the stream also In a few moments the stream was alive with swimming cattle the herd being spread out for a full quarter of a mile up and down the stream To the rear yelling cowboys were urging on the stragglers and forcing the herd into the cool waters It was an inspiring sight for the boys Here and there a cowman would ride his pony into the water and turn the leaders who were straying too far up or down the river After half an hour of watering the men began to force the cattle to the opposite bank There was a great scramble when the steers started to climb the steep bluff The first ones to try it went half way up on a run Losing their footing they came tumbling to the foot of the bluff knocking a number of the other cattle back into the water There was much bellowing and floundering about but the relentless forcing from the other side swept the unfortunate ones to the crest of the tide and up the steep bank Now that the loose dirt had slipped down the footing grew more secure and the animals soon fell into trails of their own making up which they crept three and four abreast Once on the other side they started to graze as contentedly as if they had not just passed through a most trying experience Two of the cowmen who had forded the stream further down now appeared opposite the main fording place to take charge of the cattle Get across boys shouted the foreman With an answering shout Tad and Ned slid their ponies down the sharp bluff plunging into the water and heading straight across Slip out of your saddles and hang on called the foreman Without an instant s hesitation the two boys slid into the water with a splash but keeping tight hold on the pommels of their saddles Let go the reins directed Stallings The ponies know where to go Now the lads were being drawn rapidly through the water and almost before they knew it their feet rested on the bottom of the shallow stream a short distance from the opposite bank Hooray shouted Tad waving his water soaked sombrero Come in The water s great Come on Chunky called Ned I ll wait and go over in the wagon decided Chunky You ll do nothing of the sort snapped the foreman You will swim if you get over at all Professor Zepplin not to be outdone by his young charges bravely rode his animal into the stream The boys set up a shout of glee when he too finally dropped into the river with a great splash Instead however of allowing the pony to tow him the Professor propelled himself along with long powerful strokes of his left hand while with the right he clung to the saddle pommel Three cheers for Professor Zepplin cried Tad as the German dripping but smiling emerged from the water and scrambled up the bank leaving his pony to follow along after him The cheers were given with a will Stacy Brown however was still on the other side with the straggling cattle which were coming along in small bunches Young man if you expect to get in for supper you d better be fording the stream suggested Big foot Sanders The mention of supper was all that Stacy needed to start him Gid ap The pony slid down the bank on its haunches Stacy leaning far back in the saddle that he might not pitch over the animal s head Chunky would make a good side hill rider wouldn t he jeered Ned Depends upon whether he were going up or down decided Tad Look out There he goes exclaimed Walter The boy s mount had mired one foot in a quicksand pocket and had gone down on its knees But Chunky kept right on going He hit the water flat on his stomach arms and legs outspread clawing and kicking desperately The fat boy opened his mouth to cry out for help As a result Stacy swallowed all the water that came his way Floundering about like a drowning steer choking and coughing he disappeared from sight CHAPTER VIII THE APPROACH OF THE STORM He s gone down cried a voice from the other side of the stream Tad sprang down the bank and leaped in striking out for the spot where Stacy had last been seen Cattle were scattered here and there and the boy had to keep his eyes open to prevent being run down He had almost reached the place where he had made up his mind to dive should Stacy not rise to the surface when a great shout from the bluff caused Tad to turn Wha what is it he called Look Look cried Ned Rector I don t see anything Is it Chunky Is he all right Yes He s driving oxen just now answered Ned By this time the cowpunchers had joined in the shouting Tad could see however that they were shouting with merriment though for the life of him he could not understand what there was to laugh about Several steers were between him and the spot on which the glances of the others were fixed Come on in called Ned The lad swam shoreward with slow easy strokes Then he discovered what they were laughing at Stacy grasping desperately as he went down had caught the tail of a swimming steer He had been quickly drawn to the surface and out through an opening between the treading animals appeared the fat boy s head Chunky was not swimming He was allowing the steer to do that for him clinging to its tail with all his strength The lad s eyes were blinded for the moment by the water that was in them He did not release his hold of the tail when they had reached the shore but hung on desperately while the steer dragging him along through the mire scrambled up the bank There was no telling how long Stacy might have hung to the animal s tail had not Stallings grabbed him by the collar as he rose over the crest of the bank Stallings shook him until the water soaked clothes sent out a miniature rain storm and the boy had coughed himself back to his normal condition Well you are a nice sort of cowboy laughed the foreman When you are unable to do anything else to interest your friends you try to drown yourself Go shake yourself Stacy rubbed the water from his eyes I I fell in didn t I he grinned After having ferried the trail wagon over everybody was ready for supper No one seemed to mind the wetting he had gotten Professor Zepplin made a joke of his own bedraggled condition and the boys gave slight heed to theirs The cattle were quickly bedded down and guards placed around them almost immediately for the clouds were threatening Stallings watchful eyes told him that a bad night was before them How bad perhaps he did not even dream Supper was ready a short time after the arrival of the wagon and laughing and joking the boys gathered about the spread with a keen zest for the good things that had been placed before them Do you boys feel like going out on guard to night asked the foreman while they were eating I do for one answered Tad And I chorused the rest of the lads I see your recent wetting has not dampened your spirits any laughed Stallings Conditions make a lot of difference in the lives of all of us announced the Professor Now were these boys at home they d all catch cold after what they have been through this afternoon Their clothes as it is will not be dry much before sunrise And perhaps not even then added the foreman with an apprehensive glance at the sky What did you say mister Stallings I am thinking that it looks like rain What do we do when it rains asked Stacy Brown Same as any other time kid growled Big foot Sanders I know but what do you do persisted Chunky Young feller we usually git wet snapped Curley Adams his mouth so full of potatoes that they could scarcely understand him He means where do we sleep spoke up Tad Oh in the usual place answered the foreman The only difference is that the bed is not quite so hard as at other times How s that mister Stallings inquired Walter Because there s usually a puddle of water under you I ve woke up many a morning on the plains with only my head out of water I d a been drowned if I hadn t had the saddle under my head for a pillow However it doesn t matter a great sight After it has been raining a little while a fellow can t get any wetter so what s the odds That s what I say added Ned Rector Stacy Brown shook his head disapproval plainly written on his face I don t agree with you I have never been so wet that I couldn t be wetter How about when you came out of the river at the end of a cow s tail this afternoon Think you could have been any more wet jeered Ned Sure thing I might have drowned then I d been wet on the inside as well as the outside answered the fat boy wisely his reply causing a ripple of merriment all around the party I guess the gopher scored that time eh grinned Big foot That night Stacy was sent out on the second guard from ten thirty to one o clock They had found him asleep under the chuck wagon whence he was hauled out feet first by one of the returning guards Tad had turned in early as he was to be called shortly before one to go out with the third guard and to remain on duty till half past three For reasons of his own the foreman had given orders that all the ponies not on actual duty that night were to be staked down instead of being hobbled and turned out to graze Tad heard the order given and noting the foreman s questioning glances at the heavens imagined that it had something to do with weather conditions Do you think mister Stallings is worried about the weather asked the lad of Big foot Sanders as he rode along beside the big cowman on the way to the bedding place of the herd I reckon he is was the brief answer Then you think we are going to have a storm Ever been through a Texas storm asked Big foot by way of answering the boy s question No Well you won t call it a storm after you have There ain t no name in the dictionary that exactly fits that kind of a critter A stampede is a Sunday in a country village as compared with one of them Texas howlers You ll be wishing you had a place to hide in about a minute after that kind of a ruction starts Are they so bad as that Well almost answered the cowman I ve heard tell he continued that they ve been known to blow the horns off a Mexican cow Why you couldn t check one of them things with a three inch rope and a snubbing post Tad laughed at the quaintness of his companion s words The sky near the horizon was a dull leaden hue though above their heads the stars twinkled reassuringly It doesn t look very threatening to me decided Tad Butler gazing intently toward the heavens Well here s where we split announced the cowboy riding off to the left of the herd Tad taking the right Shortly after the lad heard the big cowman break out in song Two little niggers upstairs in bed One turned ober to de oder an said How bout dat short nin bread How bout dat short nin bread Tad pulled up his pony and listened until the song had been finished It was the cowpuncher s way of telling the herd that he had arrived and was on hand to guard them against trouble Big foot seems to have a new song to night mused Tad Now the lad noticed that there was an oppressiveness about the air that had not been present before A deep orange glow showed on the southern horizon for an instant then settled back into the prairie leaving the gloom about the young cowboy even more dense than it had been before Feels spooky was Tad s comment Not being able to sing to his own satisfaction Tad shoved his hands deep into his trousers pockets and began whistling Old Black Joe It was the most appropriate tune he could think of Kind of fits the night he explained to the pony which was picking its way slowly about the great herd Then he resumed his whistling The guards passed each other without a word some being too sleepy others too fully occupied with their own thoughts The night by this time had grown intensely still even the insects and night birds having hushed their weird songs A flash more brilliant than the first attracted the lad s attention Lightning he muttered glancing off to the south I guess mister Stallings was right about the storm Yet directly overhead the stars still sparkled In the distance Tad saw the comforting flicker of the camp fire about which the cowmen were sleeping undisturbed by the oppressiveness of the night I guess the foreman knew what he was talking about when he said we were going to have a storm repeated Tad I wonder how the cattle will behave if things get lively As if in answer to his question there came a stir among the animals on the side nearest him Tad began whistling at once and the cows quieted down They must like my whistling It s the first time anything ever did thought the lad Far over on the other side of the herd Big foot crooned to his charges the song of the Two little niggers upstairs in bed Sanders stock must be walking in their sleep too I wonder A brilliant flash lighted the entire heaven causing Tad Butler to cut short the remark he was about to make A deep rumble of thunder that seemed to roll across the plain like some great wave followed a few seconds later The lad shivered slightly He was not afraid Yet he realized that he was lonely and wished that some of the other guards might come along to keep him company Glancing up Tad made the discovery that the small spot of clear sky had disappeared By now he was unable to see anything He made no effort to direct the pony leaving it to the animal s instinct to keep a proper distance from the herd and follow its formation The thunder gradually became louder and the flashes of lightning more frequent The herd was disturbed He could hear the cattle scrambling to their feet Now and then the sound of locking horns reached him as the beasts crowded their neighbors too closely in their efforts to move about Tad tried to sing but gave it up and resumed his whistling I m glad Chunky is not out on this trick thought the boy aloud I am afraid he would be riding back to camp as fast as his pony could carry him No sooner had the words left his mouth than a flash so brilliant that it blinded Tad for the moment lighted up the prairie A crash which as it seemed to him must have split the earth wide open followed almost instantly Another roar different from that caused by the thunder rose on the night air accompanied by the suggestive rattle of meeting horns and the bellowing of frightened cattle By this time Tad had circled around to the west side of the herd The instant this strange startling noise reached him he halted his pony and listened Off to the north of him he saw the flash of a six shooter Another answered it from his rear Then a succession of shots followed quickly one after the other The lad began slowly to understand He could hear the rush and thunder of thousands of hoofs The cattle are stampeding cried Tad CHAPTER IX CHASED BY A STAMPEDING HERD Whoa oo ope Whoa oo ope The long soothing cry echoed from guard to guard It was the call of the cowman in an effort to calm the frightened animals Here and there a gun would flash as the guards shot in front of the stampeding herd hoping thereby to turn the rush and set the animals going about more in a circle in order to keep them together until they could finally be quieted It was all a mad chaos of noise and excitement to the lad who sat in his saddle hesitatingly not knowing exactly what was expected of him under the circumstances Off toward the camp a succession of flashes like fireflies told the cowpunchers on guard that their companions were racing to their assistance as fast as horseflesh could carry them The storm had disturbed the herd from the instant of the first flash of lightning and as other flashes followed the excitement of the animals increased until at last throwing off all restraint they dashed blindly for the open prairie Desperately as the guards struggled to turn the herd their efforts had no more effect than if they had been seeking to beat back the waves of the sea Tad was recalled to a realization of his position when in a dazzling flash of lightning he caught a momentary glimpse of Big foot Sanders bearing down on him at a tremendous speed Tad saw something else too a surging mass of panic stricken cattle heads hanging low horns glistening and eyes protruding sweeping toward him Ride Ride shouted Big foot Wh where asked Tad in as strong a voice as he could command Keep out of their way Work up to the point as soon as you can and try to point in the leaders We ve got to keep the herd from scattering I ll stay in the center and lead them till the others get here Bob will send along some of the fellows to help you as soon as possible While delivering his orders Big foot had turned his pony and with Tad was riding swiftly in advance of the cattle in the same direction that they were traveling To have paused where they were would have meant being crushed and trampled beneath the hoofs of the now maddened animals Now git Tad pulled his pony slightly to the right Use your gun shouted Big foot Burn plenty of powder in front of their noses if they press you too closely He had forgotten that the lad did not carry a gun nor did he realize that he was sending the boy into a situation of the direst peril Tad by this time had a pretty fair idea of the danger of the task that had been assigned to him But he was not the boy to flinch in an emergency Pressing the rowels of his spurs against the flanks of the reaching pony and urging the little animal on with his voice Tad swept obliquely along in front of the herd Now and then a flash of lightning would show him a solid mass of cattle hurling themselves upon him At such times the lad would swerve his mount to the left a little and shoot ahead for a few moments in an attempt to get sufficient lead of them to enable him to reach the right or upper end of the line In this way Tad Butler soon gained the outside of the leaders By dropping back and working up the line he pointed them in to the best of his ability The lightning got into his eyes as he strained them wide open to take account of his surroundings He would pass a hand over his face instinctively as if to brush the flash away groping for an instant for his bearings after he had done so He remembered what Bob Stallings had said in speaking of a stampede Keep them straight and hold them together That s all you can do You can t stop them the foreman had said The lad was doing this now as best he could yet he wondered that none of the cowmen had come to his assistance Again and again did Tad Butler throw his pony against the great unreasoning wave on the right of the line and again and again was he buffeted back only to return to the battle with desperate courage All at once the lad found himself almost surrounded by the beasts A lightning flash had shown him this at the right time Had it been a few seconds later Tad must have gone down under their irresistible rush The pony seeming to realize the danger fully as much as did its rider bent every muscle in its little body to bear itself and rider to safety Yet try as they would they were unable to get back to the right point to take up the turning work again The cattle had closed in about the lad in almost a crescent formation Tad s position being about the center of it Whoa oo ope Whoa oo ope shouted Tad taking up the cry that he had heard the cowboys utter earlier in the stampede His voice was lost in the roar of the storm and the thunder of the rushing herd Tad realized that there was only one thing left for him to do That was to keep straight ahead and ride He would have to ride fast too if he were to keep clear of the long legged Mexican cattle They were descending a gradual slope that led down into a broad sandy arroyo where still stood the rotting stumps of oak and cottonwood trees that once lined the ancient water course By this time the main herd lay to the rear nearly two miles the cattle having separated into several bands However the lad was unaware of this Suddenly in the darkness rider and pony crashed into a dense mesquite thicket There was not a second to hesitate for they were already in The leading cattle tore in after Tad with a crashing of brush and a rattle of horns sounds that sent a chill up and down his spine in spite of all the lad s sturdy courage The herd was closing in on him leaving the boy no alternative but to go through the thicket himself and to go fast at that Tad formed his plan instantly He made up his mind to ride it out and let his pony have its own way Yet the boy never expected to come through the mesquite thicket without being swept from his pony and trampled under the feet of the savage steers He gave the pony a free rein clutched both cantle and pommel of the saddle and braced himself for the shock that he was sure would come The cow pony tore through the growth at a fearful pace while the boy s clothes hung in shreds where they had been raked by the mesquite thorns All at once Tad felt himself going through the air with a different motion He realized that he was falling The pony had stumbled and with its rider was plunging headlong to the ground The cattle were thundering down upon them CHAPTER X A MIRACULOUS ESCAPE That settles me said the lad bitterly The next instant he hit the ground with a force that partially stunned him His pony whose nose had ploughed the ground was up like a flash Realizing its danger the little animal gave a snort and plunged into the mesquite leaving its rider lying on the ground with a fair prospect of being crushed to death beneath the hoofs of the stampeding steers Tad recovered himself almost instantly His first instinct was to run in the hope of overtaking the fleeing pony That ll be sure death he told himself The cattle were almost upon him If he were to do anything to save himself he would have to act quickly It came to him suddenly that what the pony had fallen over might be made to act as a shield for himself The boy sprang forward groping in the dark amid the roaring of the storm and the thunder of the maddened herd His hands touched a log He found that it had so rotted away on one side as to make a partial shell It was not enough to admit a human body but it served as a sort of screen for him Tad burrowed into it as far as he could get I hope there are no snakes in here he thought snuggling close Yet between the two he preferred to take his chances with snakes at that moment rather than with the crazy steers The leaders of the steers cleared the log just grazing it with their hind feet as they went over sending a shower of dust and decayed wood over Tad The cattle immediately following the leaders did not fare so well A number of them leaping over the log at the same instant fell headlong as the pony had done before them However the steers were less fortunate Before they were able to scramble to their feet others following had tumbled over on top of them and Tad Butler found himself wedged in behind a barricade of bellowing cattle whose flying hoofs made him hastily burrow deeper into the decayed log This obstruction soon caused the main body to swerve Their solid front had been broken at last yet they continued on as wildly as before bellowing and horning one another in their mad flight The rain which had held back during the brilliant electrical display now came down in drenching torrents packing down the sand of the plain which the wind before had picked up and tossed into the air in dense clouds Tad was soaked to the skin almost instantly But he did not mind this His thought now was to get out of his perilous position and follow the herd The cattle that had fallen so near him were now one by one extricating themselves from their predicament each one giving vent to a bellow as it did so and dashing after its companions The lad was not slow to crawl from his hiding place the moment he considered it safe to do so As it was he got away before the snarl of steers had entirely unraveled itself What to do Tad did not know His pony gone and with no sense of direction left he was in sore straits I ll follow the cattle he decided Besides it s my business to stay with them if I can I ll do it as long as I ve got a leg to stand on he declared cautiously working around those of the cattle that were leaping from the heap and running away The mesquite was still full of stragglers dashing wildly here and there In the darkness the boy was really in great danger There were no large trees behind which he could dodge to get out of the way of the animals as they rushed toward him nor was he able to see them when they did get near him He was obliged to judge of their direction by sound alone This was made doubly difficult since the rain had begun to fall for now young Butler could scarcely distinguish one sound from another Once a plunging steer hit the lad a glancing blow with its great side hurling him into a thicket of bristling mesquite The thorns gashed his face and body almost stripping the remnants of his tattered clothes from him Still with indomitable pluck the lad sprang to his feet stubbornly working his way through the thicket He came out finally on the other side and floundering about for a time found himself once more on a plain which he had observed in the light from a flash of lightning extended away indefinitely Off to the west he plainly made out a large body of cattle Apparently they were now headed to the northwest It was almost a hopeless task for one to expect to be able to overhaul them on foot and even were he to do so he could accomplish nothing after reaching them But Tad kept on just the same with the rain beating him until he was gasping for breath the lightning playing about him in lingering sheets of yellow flame He had run on in this way for fully half an hour when a flash disclosed an object to the right of him It was moving but Tad was sure it was not a steer The boy changed his course somewhat and trotted along with more caution shading his eyes with a hand that he might make out what it was when the next flash came It s a pony he shouted It s my pony The animal was standing with lowered head gazing straight at the boy Tad whistled and called with a long drawn Whoa oo ope The pony made no move to approach nor did it attempt to run away But Tad had had experience enough with the cow ponies by this time to know that the animal was not likely to stand still and permit him to come up with it At any moment it was likely to kick its heels in the air and dash away I ve got to make a run for him decided the lad stepping cautiously forward making a slight detour that he might come up from the animal s left instead of approaching him directly from the front After having done this Tad waited crouching low He chuckled to himself as he observed that the pony was looking straight ahead not having discovered his master s new position The boy was not more than two rods from him Measuring the distance with his eyes he waited until the lightning flash died out then ran on his toes straight for where he believed the horse was standing It was Tad s purpose to grab the animal about the neck Instead he ran straight against the pony s side with a resounding bump The pony uttered a grunt of fear springing straight up into the air Whoa Barney coaxed the lad But Barney had no idea of obeying the command at that moment It is doubtful if in the fright of the sudden collision he even understood what was wanted of him Tad s hands had missed the neck Instead they had grasped the pommel and cantle of the saddle so that when the pony leaped Tad s feet were jerked clear of the ground As the animal came down on all fours Tad threw himself into the saddle Instantly the pony s back arched and with a cough it went off into a series of bucks twisting whirling and making desperate efforts to unseat its rider For the first few minutes the lad could do no more than hold on At the first opportunity however he let go of the pommel long enough to reach forward and pick up the reins which hung well down on the pony s neck Now buck Barney you rascal shouted Tad gleefully giving a gentle pressure with the spurs Barney at once decided to stop bucking Tad clucked to him and shook out the reins Away they went on the trail of the cattle heading to the northwest where the lad could plainly see them running At the pace the pony was going they were able to overhaul the herd in a short time Tad had clung to his quirt when he was thrown Reaching the head of the line of charging beasts he rode straight at the leaders bringing the quirt again and again across the noses of those nearest to him This treatment served to deflect the line a little yet try as he would Tad seemed unable to turn the bunch toward home Yet he kept steadily at his work milling the steers as the turning process is called until pony and rider were well nigh exhausted Tad knew he was a long way from camp and alone with the herd After a time the animals seemed to him to be slackening their speed Discovering this he untied the slicker or rubber blanket from the saddle cantle and riding against the leaders again flaunted the slicker in their faces shouting and urging at the same time If I had a gun I believe I could stop them right away he said But I m going to turn them if it s the last thing I ever do The fury of the storm was abating and the lightning flashes were becoming less frequent Now that he had succeeded in turning the point of the herd it proved much easier to keep them under control Besides it gave both boy and pony a breathing spell The hard riding was not now necessary Round and round young Butler kept the herd circling for nearly an hour The steers moving more and more slowly Tad concluded wisely that they were growing tired of this and that they would quiet down His judgment proved correct The storm passed He could hear it roaring off to the northwest where the lightning flamed up in intermittent flashes Wonder what time it is queried Tad aloud searching about in his clothes for his watch Pshaw I ve lost it he exclaimed Well it is not so much of a loss after all I paid only a dollar for it and I ve had more than a dollar s worth of fun to night I wonder what I look like I must be a sight It now lacked only an hour of dawn but of course the boy did not know this In the darkness preceding the dawn he had no idea of the size of the bunch of cattle that he had led out over the plain He knew it must be large however At last daybreak was at hand the landscape and the herd being faintly outlined in the thin morning light Tad was surprised to find that he had milled the cattle into a compact bunch Now the boy began galloping around the herd speaking words of encouragement to the animals as he went whistling and trying to sing until finally he was rewarded by seeing some of them begin to graze I ve done it shouted Tad gleefully I ve bagged the whole bunch I wonder what mister Stallings will say to that I don t believe Big foot Sanders could beat that The next question is where am I I don t know I guess I m lost for sure But I ve got lots of company To add to his perplexity a light fog was drifting over the plain from the southeast shutting out what little view there was in the early morning light The cattle were now grazing as contentedly as if they never had known such an experience as a stampede It was useless however to attempt to drive them for he might be leading them away from camp instead of toward it Tad was wet and hungry and now that he was able to get a look at himself he discovered that his belt was about the only whole thing left of his equipment Scarcely a vestige of his trousers remained his shirt hung in ribbons his hat was lost and his leggins had been stripped off clean Tad laughed heartily as he surveyed himself Well I am a sight I guess I shall need a whole new harness before I drive cattle much more All he could do now was to wait for the sun to rise Then he might be able to determine something about his position But the sun was a long time in making its appearance that day CHAPTER XI THE VIGIL ON THE PLAINS I wish I had a drink of water said Tad after some hours had passed Instead of drifting away the fog had become more dense He could see only part of the herd now However as they showed no disposition to run Tad felt no concern in that direction He was obliged to ride around the herd more frequently than would otherwise have been the case in order to keep the straying ones well rounded in The hours passed slowly and with their passing Tad s appetite grew He sat on his pony enviously watching the cattle filling their stomachs with the wet grass I almost wish I were a steer declared Tad I could at least satisfy my hunger Then the lad once more took up his weary round Off to the eastward all was still excitement The herd had broken up into many parts during the stampede and the cowmen were having a hard time in rounding up the scattered bunches A few of them had succeeded in working some of the animals back to the bedding ground of the previous night where the animals were left in charge of one man With the coming of the morning and the fog which blanketed everything their work became doubly difficult The storm had wiped out almost all traces of the trail made by the different herds in their escape until even an Indian would have been perplexed in an effort to follow them Who is missing asked Stallings riding into camp after a fruitless search for his cattle Tad Butler for one answered Walter Perkins Let s see He was on guard with Big foot Sanders mused the foreman Big foot has not shown up so the young man probably is with him No need to worry about them Big foot knows this country like a book You can t lose him Then there s Curley Adams and Lumpy Bates to come in yet I can see us eating our Thanksgiving dinner on the trail if this thing keeps up much longer Yet despite these discouragements the foreman kept his temper and his head Is there nothing we can do toward finding the boy asked Professor Zepplin anxiously Does it look like it answered Stallings motioning toward the fog that lay over them like a dull gray cheerless blanket Late in the afternoon Curley and Lumpy came straggling into camp with the remnants of the herd with which they had raced out hours before An hour afterwards Big foot Sanders drove in with a bunch of two hundred more Where s the Pinto asked Stallings as Big foot rode up to the trail wagon and reported The Pinto Why I haven t seen the kid since the bunch started on the rampage last night I thought he was with me on the other end of the herd Hasn t he come in yet No Then the kid s lost All the cows back I don t know I ll look over the herd and make an estimate You come along with me Together the foreman and the big cowman rode out to the grazing ground where they circled the great herd glancing critically over them as they rode What do you think asked Big foot as they completed the circuit of the herd I should say we were close to five hundred head short decided the foreman How does it look to you I reckon you re about right Suffering cats but that was a run Never saw a bunch scatter so in my life Couldn t be helped The night was so dark you couldn t tell whether you had a hundred or a thousand with you Did you strike any cross trails while you were coming in Nary a one not in the direction I came from If I d kept on last night at the rate I was going I d have rounded up in Wyoming some time to day I reckon Sorry the Pinto s strayed away He ll have a time of it finding his way back Reckon we won t see the kid again this trip decided Big foot We ve got to answered the foreman sharply We don t move from this bed till he s been picked up even if it takes all summer You you don t reckon he s with that other bunch do you I shouldn t be surprised The boy has pluck and I have an idea that if he got in with a lot of cows he d stick to them till the pony went down under him More n likely that s what happened I ll tell you what we had better do Get all the boys together who are not needed on guard interrupted Stallings Let them circle out to the west and southwest and shoot Have each man fire a shot every five minutes by the watch as they move out That will keep them in touch with each other and will act as a guide to the kid if he happens to be within hearing How far shall we go Half an hour out It s not safe to leave the herd any longer unless the fog clears away As soon as that goes we ll organize a regular search I want those cows and I want to find the boy The men quickly mounted their ponies and disappeared in the fog following the orders given by the foreman After a time those in camp could faintly hear the distant cracks of the cowpunchers pistols as they fired their signals into the air In the meantime Tad Butler was keeping his lonely vigil on the fogbound plains many miles away The fog was still hovering over the herd as the afternoon waned and the lad s body was dripping wet from it Occasionally he brushed a hand across his face wiping away the moisture Darkness settled down earlier than usual that night Yet to the boy s great relief the fog lifted shortly afterwards and the stars came out brightly With the skill of an old cowman Tad had bedded down the herd and began to ride slowly about them whistling vigorously His face ached from the constant puckering of his lips and his wounds gave him considerable pain Yet he lost none of his cheerfulness At times Tad found himself drooping in his saddle as his sleepiness overcame him But he fought the temptation to doze by talking to himself and bringing the quirt sharply against his legs Tad Butler don t you dare to go to sleep he warned himself It s the first real duty you have had to perform so you re not going to make a mess of it My but I m hungry From that on the boy never allowed his eyelids to drop though at times they felt as if weighted down with lead After what seemed an eternity the gray dawn appeared on the eastern horizon Immediately Tad began routing out the cows that they might have an opportunity to graze before the rising of the sun It was his intention to point them toward where he believed the camp to be the moment they had grazed to their satisfaction Until then it would not be wise to start the animals on their course About six o clock deciding that they had eaten enough Tad began galloping up and down shouting and applying his quirt here and there to the backs of the cows It was slow work for one lone horseman to start five hundred cattle on the trail Yet after half an hour of effort he had the satisfaction of seeing them begin to move Whoop shouted the boy I m a real cowboy this time Yet his task was more difficult than he had imagined it could be While he was urging on one part of the herd the others would lag by the wayside and begin to graze Constant effort and continual moving about at high speed on his part were necessary to keep up any sort of movement among the cattle The lad headed as nearly as possible for the southeast believing that he had come from that direction At the same time a party had set out from the camp in search of young Butler They had laid their course more toward the southwest Holding these directions the two parties would not come within some miles of each other Tad s eyes were continually sweeping the plains in hope of discovering a horseman or some signs of the main herd which he was sure must have been rounded up long before Not a trace of them could he discover Once the boy straightened up in his saddle believing he had heard the report of a gun After listening for some time he came to the conclusion that he had been in error I guess it s my stomach imagining things grinned Tad Butler He had now been out for two nights and was now well along on the second day During all that time he had not had a mouthful to eat His lips were dry and parched his throat burned fearfully Still he kept resolutely on About two o clock in the afternoon the herd came upon a clump of trees Tad at sight of it spurred his pony on attracted by the greenness of the grass about the place hoping that he might find a spring But he was doomed to disappointment There was no sign of water to be found With almost a sob in his throat the boy swung himself into his saddle again Barney you and I ought to be camels Then we could carry all the water we need he told the pony If we don t find some pretty soon I reckon we ll dry up and blow away Gid ap Barney Once more the lad began his monotonous pounding back and forth along the side of the herd which was now spread out over a full half mile of territory urging with all his strength in order to get the animals to quicken their pace In the camp Stallings and the others had begun to show their worriment Not a trace had been found of boy or herd The main hope of the foreman was that Tad might come upon a ranch or a town somewhere in his course and in that way get help to direct him back to camp As for the cattle he feared that they had become so split up that it would be well nigh impossible to get them together again During the whole afternoon Bob Stallings had been riding about his own herd sweeping the plain with a pair of field glasses A speck of dust far to the northwest suddenly attracted his attention Stallings halted his pony and sitting in his saddle almost motionless gazed intently at the tiny point that had come within range of his vision I wonder what that is mused the foreman It can t be any of our party for they would not be likely to be away off there that is unless they have rounded up the bunch Stallings after a while wheeled his pony and dashed back to camp If any of the men come in tell them to head northwest and come on as fast as they can Do you see anything asked the Professor anxiously I don t know I hope I do answered the foreman leaping into his saddle and putting spurs to his mount It may be some other herd crossing the state he muttered keeping his eyes fixed on the speck that was slowly developing into a miniature cloud The foreman urged his pony to its best pace and in the course of half an hour he was able to make out a herd of cattle That was all he could tell about it However it was not long before he discovered a lone horseman working up and down the herd Stallings was in too great a hurry to use his glasses now He was driving his pony straight at the yellow mark off there on the plain without swerving or appearing to exert any pressure at all on the bridle rein It s the Pinto as I m alive he breathed The horseman with the herd saw him now and rising in his saddle waved a hand at the foreman In a few moments Stallings came rushing up with a shout of joy Illustration Good for You Kid Good for you kid How are you Baked to a turn answered Tad hoarsely but with face lighting up joyously I never was so thirsty in my life What Haven t you had anything to drink Not a drop in two days Great heavens boy You head that pony for camp mighty quick Ride for it You will have no difficulty in following my trail back Don t drink much at a time Take it in little sips commanded the foreman in short jerky sentences Yes but what about the herd asked Tad Butler Never you mind the herd I ll see to them You move Stallings noticed that the boy sat in his saddle very straight and he knew well enough the effort it cost him to do so I think I ll stay answered the lad after a moment of indecision You ll go Tad shook his head I ve pulled them through even if I have had quite a time of it Now I m going to stay with them I guess I can stand it as well as any of your men could under similar circumstances They wouldn t desert the herd would they Stallings glanced at him sharply All right he said If you insist upon it By good rights I ought to order you in But I understand just how you feel kid Here take a drink of this brandy It will brace you up said the foreman producing a flask from his pocket I keep it for emergencies as the men are not allowed to use it while on duty Thank you answered the boy with an emphatic shake of the head I don t drink I understand But this is medicine urged the foreman It will set you right up I haven t the least doubt of it grinned the boy But I don t want to be set up that way You ll excuse me mister Stallings Don t urge me please The foreman replaced the flask in his pocket a queer smile flickering about the corners of his mouth You are the right stuff kid he muttered If you stayed in this business you d be a foreman before you knew it You are a heap sight better than a lot of them now Fall in I ll ride around on the other side of the herd and urge them along from the rear You ride up to the right of the line and keep them pointed Follow our trail You will make out the main herd very soon With renewed strength Tad went at his work though it was with an effort that he kept his saddle He was afraid he must collapse before reaching the camp and his straining eyes kept searching for the herd and the white topped wagon that he knew held what he needed most of all at that moment drink and food Soon Tad and the foreman made out a rising cloud of dust approaching them at a rapid rate Stallings waved his hand toward the cloud and nodded to Tad being too far away to call The lad shook his head in reply He understood what the foreman meant Men were coming to their assistance and the boy was to push on for camp alone The cowpunchers began to laugh as they rode up and observed the boy s tattered condition So the Pinto got a dose this time eh jeered Lumpy Bates You shut up snarled Big foot Sanders turning on him menacingly He s brought them cows back and I ll bet a new saddle it s more n you could have done Don t you see the kid s near all in Here you Pinto you hike for camp he shouted I m staying with the cattle announced Tad firmly Cattle nothing It s the camp for yours and mighty quick Without waiting for argument Big foot grasped the reins of Tad s bridle and whirling his own mount about galloped away fairly dragging Tad Butler and his tired pony after him With no reins in his hands the boy was powerless to interfere All he could do was to sit in his saddle and be towed into camp Please don t take me in this way Let me ride in he begged as they neared the camp All right laughed Big foot slacking up and tossing the reins back over the pony s neck It s a terrible thing to be proud when a fellow s down and out But I want to say one thing kid Yes There ain t a gamer critter standing on two hoofs than you bar none And that goes Tad laughed happily I haven t done anything I Haven t done anything growled Big foot riding close and peering down into the boy s scarred and grimy face Say don t pass that out to the bunch Lumpy ll say you re fishin for compliments I don t want to thump him but if he passes out any talk as reflects on what you ve done for this outfit I ll thrash him proper They were now so near to the camp that the Professor and the boys were able to recognize the horsemen They set up a great shout Meet me with a pail of water yelled Tad I m hot Pong heard him and almost immediately emerged from the chuck wagon with a tin pail full of water Throw it on me quick commanded the lad leaping from his pony Pong tipped the pail and was about to dash it over the lad when Big foot suddenly freed a foot from the stirrup He gave the pail a powerful kick sending it several feet from him its contents spilling over the ground You idiot You fool heathen roared Big foot The Pinto didn t say he wanted boiling hot water thrown on him He said he was hot If you wasn t the cook of this outfit and we d all starve to death without you I d shoot you plumb full of holes you blooming idiot of a heathen Chinee Allee same chuckled Pong showing his gleaming teeth What You climb into that wagon before I forget you re the cook fumed Big foot jumping his pony threateningly toward the Chinaman Pong leaped into the protection of his wagon Boys said the big cowman the Pinto has come back with the crazy steers He s rounded up the whole bunch and never lost a critter Look at him if you don t believe me Ain t he a sight Tad smiled proudly as he sipped the water which one of the boys had brought to him Any man as says he ain t a sight has got a fight on with Big foot Sanders And that goes too announced the cowman glaring about him Three cheers for Tad Butler champion cowpuncher cried Ned Rector Hooray bellowed Big foot Y e e e o w Hip hip hooray chorused the boys hurling their sombreros into the air Their wild yells and cat calls made the cattle off on the grazing grounds raise their heads in wonder Allee same likee this chuckled the grinning Chinaman from the front end of the chuck wagon at the same time making motions as if he too were cheering The boys roared with laughter Big foot Sanders grunted and turned his back on the grinning face of Pong One of these days I sure will forget that heathen s the cook he growled CHAPTER XII UNDER A STRANGE INFLUENCE We will move to morrow shortly after daybreak announced the foreman at supper that night Will you put me on the fourth guard this evening mister Stallings asked Tad Butler You take the fourth guard A cowpuncher who hasn t had a wink in more than two days Why I wouldn t ask a steer to do that No kid you roll up in your blankets and sleep until the cook routs you out for breakfast I ll take my trick just the same I can sleep at home when I get back I don t want to miss a minute of this fun returned Tad Fun he calls it fun grunted Lumpy It s just the beginning of the fun answered Big foot I knew things would begin to happen when we got near the Nueces Why asked Ned Rector I don t know There seems to be some queer influence at work round these parts Last time I was over this part of the trail we had a stampede almost every night for a week Two months ago I heard of an outfit that lost more n half its stock How about it mister Stallings laughed Tad Are you superstitious too The boys noted that the foreman frowned and would not answer at once Not exactly Big foot means the adobe church of San Miguel What s that interrupted Chunky An old Mexican church on the plains Probably hasn t been used for a hundred years or more You boys will have a chance to explore the place It s not far from the Ox Bow ranch where we take in another herd We shall be there a couple of days or so until the cattle get acquainted Besides we shall have to buy some fresh ponies Four of ours broke their legs in the stampede and had to be shot Oh that s too bad answered Tad I m sorry I don t like to see a horse get hurt No more do I Master Tad But in this business it is bound to happen I think we shall be able to get some green bronchos They usually have a bunch of them at the Ox Bow ranch You will see some fun when we break them in laughed the foreman I think I should like to take a hand in that myself But I am anxious to hear more about the haunted church Who said anything about a haunted church demanded Stacy Brown The gopher is right The church isn t haunted It just happens that cowmen fall into a run of hard luck in that neighborhood now and then Do you believe in spooks mister Stallings asked Walter Never having seen one I don t know whether I do or not Were I to see one I might believe in them laughed the foreman I saw a ghost once began Stacy Brown Never mind explaining about it objected Ned We ll take your word for it and let it go at that Tad Butler had gotten into a fresh change of clothes after having taken a bath in a wash tub behind the trail wagon His wounds pained him and he was sleepy so the lad turned in shortly after his supper and was soon sound asleep Nothing occurred to disturb the camp that night and when finally Tad was awakened to take his watch it seemed as if he had been asleep only a few minutes However he sprang up wide awake and ready for the work ahead of him As usual he went out with Big foot A warm friendship had sprung up between the big cowboy and Tad Butler They were together much of the time when their duties permitted Is there any truth in that spook story asked Tad as the two rode slowly out to where the herd was bedded down Big foot hesitated You can call it whatever you want to I only know that things happen to most every outfit that gets within a hundred miles of the place Why out at the Ox Bow ranch they have the worst luck of any cattle place in the state If it wasn t for the fact that they keep their cows fenced in with wire fences they wouldn t have a critter on the place But I don t understand protested Tad I don t seem to get it through my head what it is that causes all the trouble you tell me about No more does anybody else They just know that hard luck is lying around waiting for them when they get near and that s all they know about it When shall we be near there asked Tad Butler We are near enough now Our troubles have begun already Herd stampeded Ponies broke their legs and had to be shot Nobody knows what else will break loose before we get a hundred miles further on I am anxious to see the place commented Tad You won t be after you ve been there I worked on a cow herd near the place two years ago Yes Well I got out after I d been pitched off my pony and got a broken leg That was only one of the things that happened to me but it was enough I got out And here I am running my head right into trouble again Say kid Yes You d better ask the Herr Professor to let you carry a gun You ll need it What for to lay ghosts with laughed the boy Well mebby something of that sort Don t need it I guess my fists will lay out any kind of a ghost that I run against If they won t no gun will do any good I don t believe in a boy s carrying a pistol in his pocket It will get him into more trouble than it will get him out of Well that s some horseback sense grunted Big foot I never built up against that idee before but I reckon it s right We don t need em much either except to frighten the cows with when they start on a stampede and It doesn t seem to stop them retorted Tad with a little malicious smile It strikes me that a boy without a gun can stop a runaway herd about as quickly as can a cowboy with one Right again my little pardner Scored a bull s eye that time I guess Big foot Sanders hasn t any call to be arguing with you We were talking about spooks the boy reminded him I am anxious to see that church I ve wanted to see one all my life What A church No a spook Oh Can t promise to show you nothing of the sort But I ll agree to stack you up against a run of hard luck that will make you wobbly on your legs That will be nothing new Big foot I ve had that already Sure thing That s the beginning of the trouble As I was saying before we don t need the guns for any other reason unless it s against cattle rustlers Sometimes they steal cattle these days but not so much as they did in the early days of the cattle business Think we will meet any rustlers asked Tad with sudden interest Nary a rustler will tackle this herd First place we are not yet in the country where they can work profitably Where s that Oh anywhere where there s mountains for them to hide in I ll show you where the rustlers used to work when we get further along on the trail But as I was saying there are no rustlers hereabouts Oh answered Tad Butler somewhat regretfully You never mind about hunting trouble Trouble is coming to this outfit good and plenty and I reckon a kid like you will be in the middle of it too You ain t the kind that goes sneaking for cover when things are lively I saw that the other night Stallings is going to write to Boss Miller about the way you stuck to the herd when it ran away What for I dunno Guess cause he knows it ll make the old man smile We boys will come in for an extra fiver at the end of the trip for saving the herd I reckon That s where you have the best of me laughed Tad No fives for me I get my pay out of the fun I am having I think I am overpaid at that Well so long Big foot announced the lad as they finally reached the herd So long answered the cowman turning his pony off to take the opposite side of the sleeping cattle In a few moments Tad heard his strident voice singing to the herd again The hours passed more quickly than had been the case the last time Tad was on guard for he had much to think of and to wonder over Daybreak had arrived almost before he knew it and the call for breakfast sounded across the plain As soon as he had been relieved Tad Butler galloped back to camp bright eyed and full of anticipation both for the meal and for the ride that was before them that day Corn cakes were on the bill of fare that morning and the Pony Riders shouted with glee when they discovered what Pong had prepared for them Bring on the black strap called Stallings Stacy Brown glanced at the foreman suspiciously Why do you want a black strap for breakfast he demanded To put on the corn cakes of course boy laughed Stallings I ve heard of using a black strap to hitch horses with And to correct unruly boys added Professor Zepplin But I never did hear of eating it on corn cakes Everybody laughed at Chunky s objection You will eat this strap when you see it answered Stallings taking a jug from the hands of the Chinaman and pouring some of its contents over the cakes on his plate What is it asked Ned Rector Molasses It s what we call black strap Help yourselves Never mind the gopher there He never eats black straps for breakfast the foreman jeered Here I want some of that demanded Stacy half rising and reaching for the jug My but it s good he decided with his mouth full That s all right answered Walter But please do not forget that there are some others in this outfit who like cakes and molasses Please pass that jug this way Yes the pony won t be able to carry him to day if he keeps on for ten minutes more at the rate he s been going laughed Ned Rector I never did have any sort of use for a glutton Neither did I added Chunky solemnly at which both Pony Riders and cowboys roared with laughter Going to be another scorcher decided the foreman rising and surveying the skies critically We shall not be able to make very good time I fear When do you expect to reach the Nueces River asked the Professor I had hoped to get there by to morrow However it doesn t look as if we should be able to do so if it comes off so hot Is the Nueces a large river asked Walter Sometimes And it is a lively stream when there happens to be a freshet and both forks are pouring a flood down into it We will try to bed down near the river and you boys can have some sport swimming Do all of you swim Yes they chorused That s good The cowpunchers will have a time of it too I can float Stacy Brown informed him eagerly So could I if I were as fat as you I could float all day retorted Ned Rector You couldn t sink if you were to fill your pockets with stones There is some advantage in being fat anyway He didn t seem to float the day he fell in among the steers said one of the cowboys That isn t fair interrupted Stallings The steers put the gopher under that day Any of you would have gone down with a mob of cows piling on top of you The river is near the church you were telling me about isn t it inquired Tad of Big foot in a low tone Sanders nodded solemnly Tad s eyes sparkled eagerly He finished his breakfast rather hurriedly and rose from the table As he walked away he met the horse wrangler bringing the day ponies The lad quickly saddled his own mount after a lively little struggle and much squealing and bucking from the pony Tad was eager to reach the river and get sight of the mysterious church beyond Yet he did not dream of the thrilling experiences that were awaiting them all at the very doors of the church of San Miguel CHAPTER XIII CHUNKY ROPES A COWBOY Wow Help Help The herd had been moving on for several hours grazing comfortably along the trail when the sudden yell startled the entire outfit The cowboys reined in their ponies and grasped their quirts firmly fully expecting that another stampede was before them Instead they saw Stacy Brown riding away from the herd urging his pony to its best speed Right behind him with lowered head and elevated tail was a white muley evidently chasing the lad What the boy had done to thus enrage the animal no one seemed to know However it was as pretty a race as they had seen thus far on the drive Point him back He can t hurt you shouted the foreman Instead of obeying the command Stacy brought down his quirt on the pony causing the little animal to leap away across the plain in a straight line The cowboys were shouting with laughter at the funny spectacle Somebody get after that steer roared the foreman The boy never will stop as long as the critter keeps following him and we ll have the herd following them before we know it I ll go if you wish said Tad Butler Then go ahead Got your rope Yes It ll be good practice for you Tad was off like a shot leaving a cloud of dust behind him That boy s got the making of a great cowpuncher in him said the foreman nodding his head approvingly Tad s pony was the swifter of the two and besides he was riding on an oblique line toward the runaway outfit It was the first opportunity the lad had had to show off his skill as a cowman for none had seen his pointing of the herd on the night of the stampede He was burning with impatience to get within roping distance of the steer before they got so far away that the cowmen would be unable to see the performance Pull up and turn him Chunky called Tad I can t Why not Turn in a half circle then I shall be able to catch up with you sooner Can t The muley won t stop long enough for me to turn around Tad laughed aloud He now saw that it was to be a race between the steer and his own pony The odds however were in favor of the steer for Stacy Brown was pacing him at a lively gait and Tad was still some distance behind The latter s pony was straining every muscle to overhaul the muley Tad finally slipped the lariat from the saddle bow Swinging the great loop above his head he sent it squirming through the air At that instant the muley changed its course a little and the rope missed its mark by several feet Now it was dragging behind the running pony By this time Tad had fallen considerably behind He took up the race again with stubborn determination Coiling the rope as he rode on he made another throw The noose fell fairly over the head of the muley steer this time Profiting by a previous experience the lad took a quick turn about the pommel of the saddle The pony braced itself ploughing up the ground with its little hoofs as it did so A jolt followed that nearly threw Tad from his saddle The muley steer s head was suddenly jerked to one side and the next instant the animal lay flat on its back its heels wildly beating the air Whoop shouted Tad in high glee waving his hat triumphantly to the watching cowpunchers The steer was up in a moment with Tad Butler watching him narrowly Cast your rope over his head Chunky Chunky made a throw and missed The angry steer rose to its feet and charged him Stacy Brown held the muleys in wholesome awe though having no horns they were the least dangerous of the herd Yeow shrieked Chunky putting spurs to his pony and getting quickly out of harm s way The steer was after him at a lively gallop with Tad Butler and his pony in tow Tad had prudently shaken out the reins when he saw the animal preparing to take up the chase again Waiting until the steer had gotten under full headway the lad watched his chance then pulled his pony up sharply This time the muley s head was jerked down with such violence that it turned a partial somersault landing on its back with a force that must have knocked the breath out of it Again and again did Tad repeat these tactics the pony seemingly enjoying the sport fully as much as did the boy himself After a time he succeeded in getting the unruly beast headed toward the herd Once he had done that he let the animal have its head and they sailed back over the trail at a speed that made the cowboys laugh Tad seemed to be driving the steer with Stacy Brown riding well up to the animal s flanks laying on his quirt to hasten its speed every time he got a chance As they neared the herd Tad in attempting to release the rope from the pommel let it slip through his hands The lad was chagrined beyond words Rope him quick Chunky he cried Lumpy Bates observing the mishap had spurred toward the running steer intending to cast a lariat over one of the animal s feet and throw it so they could remove the lariat from its neck Just as the cowboy wheeled his mount in order to reach one of the steer s hind feet Chunky clumsily cast his own rope Instead of reaching the muley steer the loop caught the left hind foot of the cowpuncher s galloping pony Cinch it called Tad as the loop followed an undulating course through the air Chunky did cinch it gleefully about his saddle pommel At the same time he cinched something else The cowpuncher s mount went down its nose burrowing into the turf Lumpy was so taken by surprise that he had no time to save himself He shot over the pony s neck landing flat on his back several feet in advance of the pony s nose The watching cowboys set up a jeering yell Lumpy scrambled to his feet his face purple with rage You tenderfoot shrieked Curley Adams To let the gopher rope you like a yearling steer Chunky sat on his mount with blanched face now realizing the enormity of his act I I didn t mean to do it he stammered At first Lumpy did not know what had caused his pony to fall But no sooner had he gotten to his feet than he comprehended With a savage roar he sprang for the fat boy with quirt raised above his head prepared to bring it down on Stacy Brown the instant he reached him The blow would have been bad enough had it been delivered in the ordinary way The cowboy however had gasped the quirt by the small end and was preparing to use the loaded butt on the head of the boy who had been the cause of his fall Tad had halted upon observing the accident laughing uproariously at the spectacle of Lumpy Bates being roped by Stacy Brown When he saw the quirt in the hands of the cowpuncher however and realized what his purpose was the laughter died on the lips of Tad Butler Drop that quirt Lumpy he commanded sternly Lumpy gave no heed to the command but broke into a run for Stacy Tad who was a few rods away put spurs to his pony at the same time slipping off the lariat from the other side of his saddle The Pinto s going to rope him gasped the cowboys All were too far away to be of any assistance Stallings was with another part of the herd else he would have jumped in and interfered before Tad s action had become necessary Tad s pony leaped forward under the pressure of the spurs The boy began spinning the noose of the lariat above his head The cowboys were watching in breathless suspense Tad sent the loop squirming through the air turning his pony so as to run parallel with the one on which Stacy was sitting half paralyzed with fear as he gazed into the rage contorted face of Lumpy Bates As the quirt was descending Tad s rope slipped over the cowboy s head and under one arm This time however the lad did not cinch the rope over his saddle pommel He held it firmly in his hand with a view to letting go after it had served its purpose having no desire to injure his victim Lumpy Bates went over as if he had been bowled over with a club and before he had realized the meaning of it he had been dragged several feet Tad jerked his pony up sharply and slowly rode back to where his victim was desperately struggling to free himself Y e e e o ow screamed the cowboys circling about the scene their ponies on a dead run discharging their six shooters into the air giving cat calls and wild war whoops in the excess of their joy Big foot Sanders however had not joined in their merriment Instead he had ridden up within a couple of rods of where Lumpy Bates was lying Big foot sat quietly on his pony awaiting the outcome At last Lumpy tore off the lariat s grip and scrambled to his feet He glared about him to see whence had come this last indignity I did it Lumpy announced Tad Butler quietly You Wait a minute before you tell me what you are going to do commanded Tad Chunky did not mean to throw you He was trying to rope the steer He ll tell you he is sorry But you were going to hit him because you were mad If you d struck him with the butt of that quirt you might have killed him I had to rope you to prevent that Is there anything you want to say to me now I ll show you what I ve got to say snarled the cowboy starting for Tad Stop Lumpy Bates if you come another foot nearer to me I ll ride you down warned Tad directing a level gaze at the eyes of his adversary The cowboy gazed defiantly at the slender lad for a full moment I ll fix you for that he growled turning away At that moment Big foot Sanders rode in front of him and pulled up his pony What s that ye say Nothing I said I d be even with that cub I reckon ye d better not try it Lumpy The kid s all right Big foot Sanders is his friend And that s the truth Don t let it get away from you CHAPTER XIV ON A WILD NIGHT RIDE Your fat friend over there is making queer noises Master Tad Must be having a bad dream Big foot had reached a ponderous hand from his blankets and shaken Tad roughly Mebby the gopher s having a fit Better find out what ails him The rain was falling in torrents The men were soaked to the skin but it did not seem to disturb them in the least judging by the quality of their snores Tad listened Stacy Brown surely was having trouble of some sort The lad threw off his blankets and ran over to where his companion was lying Chunky s drowning he exclaimed in a voice full of suppressed excitement Big foot leaped to his feet hurrying to the spot Stacy was lying in a little depression in the ground a sort of puddle having formed about him and when Tad reached him the lad had turned over on his face only the back part of his head showing above the water He appeared to be struggling but unable to free himself from his unpleasant position They jerked him up choking and coughing shaking him vigorously to get the water out of him Wha what s the matter stammered the boy Matter enough Trying to drown yourself growled the cowboy Di did I fall in Did you fall in Where do you think you are I I thought I fell in the river and I was trying to swim out answered the boy with a sheepish grin that caused his rescuers to shake with merriment Guess we ll have to get a life preserver for you chuckled Big foot You ain t safe to leave around when the dew is falling Dew Call this dew This is a flood Go find a high piece of ground and go to bed We haven t got time to lie awake watching you Be careful that you don t step on any of the bunch They ain t likely to wake up in very good humor a night like this and besides Lumpy Bates is sleeping not more n a rope s length from you You can imagine what would happen if you stepped on his face to night Chunky shivered slightly He had had one experience with the ill natured cowpuncher that day and did not care for another I ll go to bed he chattered You d better What s that exclaimed the cowpuncher sharply pausing in a listening attitude Some one coming answered Tad They seem to be in a hurry Yes I should say they were I reckon the trouble is coming kid A horseman dashed up to the camp that lay enshrouded in darkness save for the lantern that hung at the tail board of the chuck wagon Roll out Roll out It was the voice of Curley Adams The cowpunchers scrambled to their feet with growls of disapproval demanding to know what the row was about What is it a stampede called Big foot hastily rolling his blankets and dumping them in the wagon No but it may be The boss wants the whole gang to turn out and help the guard For what The cows are restless They re knocking about ready to make a break at any minute What Haven t they bedded down yet asked Big foot No nary one of them And they ain t going to to night I knew it announced the cowman with emphasis Knew what asked Tad That we were in for trouble And it s coming a running By this time the horse wrangler had rounded up the ponies and the cowboys grumbling and surly were hurriedly cinching on saddles A few moments later the whole party was riding at full gallop toward the herd Where s the gopher inquired Big foot after they had ridden some distance Did we leave him behind I guess Chunky is asleep laughed Tad Best place for him He d have the herd on the run in no time if he was to come out to night Never knew a human being who could stir up so much trouble out of nothing as he can We re coming up with the herd now Be careful where you are riding too All was excitement The cattle were moving restlessly about prodding each other with their horns while guards were galloping here and there talking to them soothingly and whipping into line those that had strayed from the main herd Bunches of fifteen or twenty were continually breaking through the lines and starting to run Quirts and ropes were brought into use to check these individual rushes the cowmen fearing to use their weapons lest they alarm the herd and bring on a stampede What s the trouble demanded Big foot as they came up with the foreman I don t know Bad weather I guess The evil one seems to have gotten into the critters to night Lead your men up to the north end of the line We will take care of these fellows down here as best we can The men galloped quickly to their stations Then in the driving rain that soaked and chilled them the cowmen began their monotonous songs interrupted now and then by a shout of command from some one in charge of a squad There was no thunder or lightning this time The men were thankful for that it needed only some sudden disturbance to start the animals going The disturbance came after an hour s work The cowmen had brought some sort of order out of the chaos and were beginning to breathe easier Stallings rode up to the head of the herd giving orders that the cattle be pointed in and kept in a circle if possible To do this he called away all the men at the right save Tad Butler and Big foot Sanders As it chanced they were at the danger spot when the trouble came Chunky had been awakened by the disturbance in camp not having fully aroused himself until after the departure of the men however He sat up rubbing his eyes grumbling about the weather and expressing his opinion of a cowpuncher s life in no uncertain terms Finding that all had left him the lad decided to get his pony and follow What s the matter Pong he called observing the Chinaman up and fixing the curtains about his wagon Allee same likee this answered Pong hopping about in imitation of an animal running away He s crazy muttered Chunky going to his pony and swinging himself into the saddle Chunky urged the animal along faster and faster He could hear the cowboys on beyond him though he was able to see only a few yards ahead of him However the boy was becoming used to riding in the dark and did not feel the same uncertainty that he had earlier I ll bet they are getting ready to run away he decided In that Stacy was right Before he realized where he was he had driven his pony full into the rear ranks of the restless cattle Chunky uttered a yell as he found himself bumping against the sides of the cows and sought to turn his pony about The startled steers nearest to him fought desperately to get away from the object that had so suddenly hurled itself against them Instantly there was a mix up with bellowing plunging steers all about him Help Help shouted the boy Now his pony was biting and kicking in an effort to free itself from the animals that were prodding it with horns and buffeting it from side to side Only a moment or so of this was necessary to fill the cattle with blind unreasoning fear With one common impulse they lunged forward Those ahead of them felt the impetus of the thrust just as do the cars of a freight train under the sudden jolt of a starting engine What s up roared the foreman They re off yelled a cowman Head them Can t They re started in the center of the herd With heads down the entire herd was now charging straight ahead Big foot Sanders and Tad Butler nearly half a mile ahead felt the impetus too Keep your head boy warned the cowpuncher We are in for a run for our money now It came even as he spoke With a bellow the cattle started forward at a lively gallop Whoa oo ope cried Big foot riding in front of the plunging leaders He might as well have sought to stay the progress of the wind The leaders swept man and boy aside and dashed on Better keep them straight and not try to stop them hadn t we shouted Tad with rare generalship That s the trick Can you hold your side roared Big foot in reply I ll try answered the boy riding so close to the leaders that they rubbed sides with his pony The latter understanding what was wanted of him pushed sturdily on holding the cattle with his side leaning toward them to give the effort the benefit of his entire weight One end of Tad s neckerchief had come loose and was streaming straight out behind him while the broad brim of his sombrero was tipped up by the rushing breeze It was a wild and perilous ride Yet the lad thought nothing of this His whole thought was centered on the work in hand that of keeping the cattle headed northward Tad was unable to tell whether they were going in a straight line or not but this time he had the big cowman to rely upon Give way a little warned Big foot Right answered the lad pulling his pony to one side then straightening him again We ll hit the Injun Territory by daylight if we keep on at this gait You all right Yes But I think the herd is spreading out behind me answered Tad Never mind that They ll likely follow the leaders Off to the rear they could hear the sharp reports of the cowboys revolvers as they sought to stay the mad rush Big foot however had thought it best not to resort to shooting tactics They were making altogether too good headway If only they were able to keep the cattle headed the way they were going the herd would be none the worse off for the rush and the outfit would be that much further along on the journey The thundering hoof beats behind them as the living tide swept down upon them was not a pleasant sound to hear Yet Big foot and Tad were altogether too busy to be greatly disturbed by it They had gone on for fully half an hour after that with no apparent decrease in the speed of the stampede The ponies were beginning to show their fatigue Tad slowed down a little patting his faithful little animal to encourage it and quiet its nerves As he did so the boy s attention was again called to the fact that a solid wall of cattle had apparently closed in behind him Big foot he shouted Yes answered the cowboy in a far away voice for some distance now separated the two It looks to me as if they were closing in on us What do you think Wait I ll see The cowboy pulled up a little and listened Right you are They have spread out in a solid wall What shall we do Ride Ride for your life came the excited reply Where To your right Don t let them catch you or you ll be trampled under their feet They ll never stop now till they get to the river Is it near here Only a few miles ahead I can hear it roar now A flood is coming down it Hurry Tad had barely heard the last word Already he had swung his pony about and was galloping with all speed to the right in an effort to get free of the herd before they crowded him and his pony into the turbulent swollen river CHAPTER XV FORDING A SWOLLEN RIVER The first light of the morning revealed to Tad Butler the narrow escape he had had He had barely passed the outer point of the stampeding herd when the cattle rushed by him On beyond less than half a mile away he made out the river in the faint light His companion was nowhere to be seen However that was not surprising as the cattle now covered a large area so large that Tad was unable to see to the other side of the herd As the day dawned the cattle began to slacken their speed and by the time the leaders reached the river bank the rush was at an end Some of the stock plunged into the edge of the stream where they began drinking while others set to grazing contentedly As the light became stronger the lad made out the figure of Big foot Sanders approaching him at an easy gallop We did it didn t we Big foot exulted Tad Butler That we did Pinto And there comes the rest of the bunch now Big foot added pointing to the rear where others of the cowboys were to be seen riding up Stallings was the first to reach them Good job he grinned We are at the river several hours ahead of schedule time Doesn t look very promising does it River s pretty high Are you thinking of fording it this morning asked Big foot looking over the swollen stream We might as well The water will be higher later in the day We may not be able to get across in several days if we wait too long What do you think started the cattle this time asked Tad I don t think I know what did it Yes It was that clumsy friend of yours The gopher asked Big foot Allee same as Pong would say That boy is the limit Is he always falling into trouble that way Yes or falling off a pony laughed Tad There he comes now Stacy rode up to them his face serious and thoughtful Well young man what have you to say for yourself asked the foreman I was going to ask you sir where we are going to get our breakfast Stallings glanced at Tad and Big foot with a hopeless expression in his eyes Go ask the Chinaman he answered rather brusquely I can t He isn t here Well that s the answer laughed the foreman riding to the river bank and surveying the stream critically Tad and Big foot Sanders joined him almost immediately Think we can make it chief I think so Sanders One of us had better ride over and back to test the current I ll try it for you said Tad Go ahead Sanders you ride back and tell Lumpy to return to camp and bring on the outfit They can t reach us until late in the afternoon as it is I presume that slant eyed cook is sitting in his wagon waiting for us to come back Hurry them along for we shall be hungry by the time we have finished this job Tad promptly spurred his pony into the stream After wading out a little way he slipped off into the water hanging by the pommel swimming with one hand to relieve the pony as much as possible The boy made the crossing without mishap Stallings observing the performance to note how far down the stream the pony would drift Tad landed some five rods lower down On the return the drift was not quite so noticeable We ll make it announced the foreman If you want to dry out ride back and tell the bunch to crowd the cattle in as rapidly as possible The faster we can force them in the less they will drift down stream Very well sir replied the boy galloping off to deliver his message With a great shouting and much yelling the cowboys began their task of urging the cattle into the river Not being over thirsty it was no easy task to induce the animals to enter the water but when the leaders finally plunged in the rest followed fairly piling on top of one another in their efforts to follow the pilots of the herd Above and below the cowboys who were not otherwise engaged were swimming the river endeavoring to keep the animals from straying one way or another Tad Butler and his companions were aiding in this work shouting from the pure joy of their experience and in an hour s time the last steer had swum the stream and clambered up the sloping bank on the other side There announced the foreman That s a bad job well done I wish the trail wagon were here A cup of hot coffee wouldn t go bad after an hour in the water After several of them you mean added Tad You know we have been out in the rain all night Yes and you did a bang up piece of work you and Big foot How did you happen to lead the cattle straight ahead instead of turning the leaders It was the kid s suggestion answered Big foot Sanders He s got a man s head on his shoulders that more n makes up for what the gopher hasn t got It does indeed agreed Stallings How are we going to get that trail wagon over when it comes up asked one of the men That s what s bothering me answered the foreman Perhaps our young friend here can give us a suggestion His head is pretty full of ideas added the foreman more with an intent to compliment Tad than in the expectation of getting valuable suggestions from him What is your usual method asked the boy Well to tell the truth I ve never had quite such a proposition as this on my hands I guess you will have to float it over It won t float It ll sink You can protect it from that How asked the foreman now keenly interested First take all the stuff out of it That will save your equipment if anything happens to the wagon Ferry the equipment over on the backs of the ponies If it s too heavy take over what you can Well what next asked Stallings Get some timbers and construct a float under the wagon Where you going to get timber around these parts demanded Big foot I see plenty of trees near the river Cut down a few and make a raft of them By George the kid s hit it exclaimed Stallings clapping his thigh vigorously That s exactly what we ll do But we ll have to wait till the wagon gets here The axes are all in the wagon Mebby I m particularly thick to day but I d like to inquire how you expect to get the outfit over after you have the raft under it demanded Shorty Savage Answer that if you can I think that is up to the foreman smiled Tad Were I doing it I think I should hitch ropes to the tongue and have the ponies on the other side draw the wagon across Of course you are liable to have an accident The ropes may break or the current may tip your wagon over That s your lookout Now will you be good grinned the foreman You know all about it and it would be a good idea to let the thought simmer in your thick head for a while It may come in handy some day when you want to get across a river Shorty walked away none too well pleased About three o clock in the afternoon the wagon hove in sight and the boys rode out to meet it It was decided to camp on the river bank until after they had eaten their evening meal after which there would still be time to ferry over While the meal was being cooked Stallings sent some of the men out to cut down four small trees and haul them in They grumbled considerably at this but obeyed orders Tad went along at the suggestion of the foreman to pick out such trees as he thought would best serve their purpose The trail wagon s teams were used to haul the logs in and by the time the work was finished a steaming hot supper had been spread by the smiling Chinaman Professor Zepplin had come along with the wagon He said he was a little stiff from the wetting he had received but otherwise was all right Now young man I ll let you boss the job announced Stallings as Tad rose from the table I give you a free hand With a pleased smile Tad set about constructing his raft Ned Rector swam the river with the ropes and fastened them to trees so they would not be carried away by the current The wagon was then run down into the water by hand the ropes made fast and all was ready for the start What are you going to do about the drift asked the foreman who had been interestedly watching the preparations We are going to tie ropes to the two wheels on the upper side One is to be held on this side of the river the other from the opposite side I think the kitchen will ford the river as straight as you could draw a chalk line announced Tad I guess it will answered the foreman with a suggestive glance at Professor Zepplin All right when you get ready over there called Tad to the waiting cowboys on the other side They had taken firm hold of the ropes with their right hands their left hands holding to the pommels of their saddles Ready came the warning cry from the other side Haul away shouted Tad The ropes secured to the tongue of the trail wagon straightened and the wagon began to move out into the stream Be careful Don t pay out that rope too fast directed Tad to the man on his side of the stream The trail wagon floated out easily on the swiftly moving current It was greeted by a cheer from the Pony Rider Boys Those of the cowboys who were not otherwise engaged joined with a will There s that fool Chinaman growled Stallings observing the grinning face of Pong peering from the tail of the wagon Look out the dragon will get you sure if you fall out he warned I don t care anything about you but we can t afford to be without a cook There goes the fool cried Big foot Now we sure will starve to death Illustration As the Wagon Lurched Pong Plunged Overboard As the wagon lurched in the current the Chinaman had plunged overboard and disappeared beneath the surface CHAPTER XVI A BRAVE RESCUE Save him somebody The fool s fallen overboard roared the foreman I can t let go this rope Tad had not seen the cook take his plunge so for the moment he did not realize what had occurred Who s overboard young Butler demanded sharply The cook answered Stallings excitedly Can t any of you slow pokes get busy and fish him out Pong cried Tad as the head of the Chinaman appeared on the surface Without an instant s hesitation the lad leaped into his saddle Yip he shouted to the pony accentuating his command by a sharp blow with the quirt The pony leaped forward Here he s not up there he s in the river I tell you shouted the foreman Tad had driven his mount straight up the bank behind them He paid no attention to the warning of the foreman having already mapped out his own plan of action Reaching the top of the sloping bank Tad pulled his pony to the right and dashed along the bluff headed down the river Watch your lines or you ll have the wagon overboard too he called back I ll get Pong out Big foot Sanders scratched his head reflectively Ain t the Pinto the original whirlwind though he grinned I never did see the like of him now He ll get that heathen out while we are standing here trying to make up our minds what to do Yes but I m afraid the Chinaman will drown before Tad gets to him said the foreman with a shake of his head Here don t let go of this rope while you are staring at the kid I can t hold it alone Tad drove his pony to its utmost speed until he had reached a point some little distance below where the head of the Chinaman had last been seen All at once the lad turned sharply the supple limbed pony taking the bank in a cat like leap landing in the water with a splash Tad kept his saddle until the pony s feet no longer touched the bottom Then he dropped off clinging to the mane with one hand The cook was nowhere to be seen but Tad was sure he had headed him off and was watching the water above him with keen eyes There he is below you shouted a voice on shore Look out you ll lose him Tad turned at the same instant giving the pony s neck a sharp slap to indicate that he wanted the animal to turn with him The lad saw the Chinaman s head above the water Evidently the latter was now making a desperate effort to keep it there for his hands were beating the water frantically Keep your hands and feet going and hold your breath roared Tad I ll be Before he could add there the lad suddenly discovered that there was something wrong with his pony It was the latter which was now beating the water and squealing with fear One of the animal s hind hoofs raked Tad s leg pounding it painfully Tad released his hold of the mane and grasped the rein Throwing up its head uttering a snort the pony sank out of sight carrying its master under Tad quickly let go the reins and kicked himself to the surface The pony was gone What had caused its sudden sinking the lad could not imagine There was no time to speculate not an instant to lose if he were to rescue the drowning cook Throwing himself forward headed downstream Tad struck out with long overhand strokes for the Chinaman Going so much faster than the current the boy rapidly gained on the victim Yet just as he was almost within reach of Pong the latter threw up his hands and went down Tad dived instantly The swollen stream was so muddy that he could see nothing below the surface His groping hands grasped nothing except the muddy water The lad propelled himself to the surface shaking the water from his eyes There before him he saw the long yellow arms of the Chinaman protruding above the surface of the river This time Tad was determined that the cook should not escape him Tad made a long curving dive not unlike that of a porpoise This time the lad s hands reached the drowning man The long yellow arms twined themselves about the boy and Tad felt himself going down With rare presence of mind the boy held his breath making no effort to wrench himself free from the Chinaman s grip He knew it would be effort wasted and besides he preferred to save his strength until they reached the surface once more Half a dozen cowpunchers had plunged their ponies into the river and were swimming toward the spot where Tad had been seen to go down while the foreman was shouting frantic orders at them The wagon had been ferried to the other side and Stallings had run to his pony on which he was now dashing madly along the river bank Look out that you don t run them down he roared Keep your wits about you They re both down already shouted a cowboy in reply We ll lose the whole outfit at this rate growled another Yet not a man was there unless perhaps it may have been Lumpy Bates who would not have risked his own life freely to save that of the plucky lad After going down a few feet Tad began treading water with all his might This checked their downward course and in a second or so he had the satisfaction of realizing that they were slowly rising The current however was forcing them up at an angle This to a certain extent worked to the boy s advantage for the Chinaman was underneath him thus giving Tad more freedom than had their positions been reversed There they are cried Big foot Sanders as the Chinaman and his would be rescuer popped into sight Go after them commanded Stallings Urging their ponies forward by beating them with their quirts the cowboys made desperate efforts to reach the two Tad managed to free one arm which he held above his head The rope He wants the rope Rope him you idiots bellowed the foreman Big foot made a cast However from his position in the water he could not make an accurate throw and the rope fell short Tad saw it He was struggling furiously now ducking and parrying the sweep of that long yellow arm with which Pong sought to grasp him A quick eddy caught the pair and swept them out into the center of the stream around a bend where they were caught by the full force of the current This left their pursuers yards and yards to the rear Tad saw that they would both drown if he did not resort to desperate measures Drawing back his arm the lad drove a blow straight at Pong s head but a swirl of the current destroyed the boy s aim and his fist barely grazed the cheek of the Chinaman Quick as a flash Tad Butler launched another blow This time the Chinaman s head was jolted backwards Tad s fist having landed squarely on the point of the fellow s jaw But Pong was still struggling and the lad completed his work by delivering another blow in the same place I hope I haven t hurt him gasped the boy Tad threw himself over on his back breathing heavily and well nigh exhausted He kept a firm grip on the cook however supporting and keeping the latter s head above water by resting the Chinaman s neck on his arm as they floated with the current In the meantime Stallings was dashing along the bank roaring out his orders to the cowboys calling them ashore and driving them in further down Yet each time it seemed as though the floating pair drifted farther and farther away But Tad Butler was still cool Now that he was getting his strength back he began slowly to kick himself in toward shore aiding in the process by long windmill strokes of his free arm He did not make the mistake of heading directly for the shore but sought to make it by a long tack moving half with the current and half against it The lad had made up his mind that the cowboys would never reach them and that what was to be done must be done by himself Can you make it called Stallings Yes But have some one on the other side toss me a rope as soon as possible I don t know whether Pong is done for or not answered the boy in short breaths Stallings plunged his pony into the current and swam for the other side Reaching there he galloped at full speed toward the point for which Tad seemed to be aiming The foreman rode into the water until it was up to his saddle and where the pony was obliged to hold its head high to avoid drowning There the foreman waited until the lad had gotten within roping distance Turn in a little directed Stallings You ll hit that eddy and land out in the middle if you don t A moment more and the foreman s lariat slipped away from the circle it had formed above his head Tad held an arm aloft and the loop dropped neatly over it Stallings pulled it and Tad grasped the rope after the loop had tightened about his arm Haul away he directed The foreman turned his pony about and slowly towed cook and boy ashore The cowboys observing that Tad was being hauled in headed for the shore Reaching it they put spurs to their ponies and came down to the scene at a smashing gait Leaping off they sprang into the water picking up Tad and the Chinaman and staggering ashore with them The lad was pale and shivering They laid him down on the bank But Tad quickly pulled himself to his feet I must look after Pong he said You let the heathen alone growled Big foot Sanders Us tenderfeet ll look after him That s what we are a bunch of rank tenderfeet You re the only seasoned all around dyed in the wool genuwine cowpuncher in the whole outfit That s the truth Tad smiled as he hurried to where the foreman was working over the unconscious cook Is he dead asked the lad apprehensively Dead Huh grunted Curley Adams Heathen Chinese don t die as easy as that After a few minutes the cook went off into a paroxysm of choking and coughing Then he opened his eyes Chunky Brown was standing near blinking down wisely into the yellow face of Pong You fell in didn t you he asked solemnly Allee samee grinned the yellow man weakly CHAPTER XVII MAKING NEW FRIENDS Professor Zepplin fully as wet as the others met the returning outfit Everybody was wet It seemed to have become their normal condition Did you get the wagon over asked Tad You bet replied the foreman As soon as we get all the water shook out of that heathen we ll set him to making coffee for the outfit It s too near dark now to do any more work and besides I guess the cattle are bedded down for the night I think they re ready for a night s rest along with ourselves What happened to that pony I m sure I don t know answered Tad That was too bad wasn t it Cramps I guess suggested Big foot They have been known to have em in the water That water must have had an iceberg in it somewhere up the state Never saw such all fired cold water in my life Whew That s one pony more we ve got to buy that s all But I don t care I d rather lose the whole bunch of them than have anything happen to the Pinto announced the foreman Or the cook added Tad with a smile Yes it s a very serious matter for an outfit of this kind to lose its cook We could get along without a foreman very well but not without a cook Especially when you have a bunch of hungry boys with you What about the new ponies I ll ride over to Colonel McClure s ranch in the morning and see what we can do You may go with me if you wish I should like to very much Is that where you expect to get the other herd of cattle as well Yes Better take an earlier trick on guard to night for we shall start right after breakfast in the morning Very well replied Tad Guess I ll get my coffee now Big foot Sanders was already helping himself to the steaming beverage when Tad reached the chuck wagon Well kid what about it greeted the big cowman What about what Trouble Tad smiled broadly There does seem to be plenty of it And plenty more coming You ll see more fun before we are clear of this part of the country I don t very well see how we can have much more of it I should imagine we have had our share Wait We ll be here three or four days yet and mebby more warned the cowboy Tad went out with the second guard that night Contrary to the expectations of Big foot Sanders and some others the night passed without incident the next morning dawning bright and beautiful For some reason the foreman decided at the last moment that he would not go to the Ox Bow ranch Instead he instructed Big foot Sanders to take three of the men with him and pick out what ponies they needed from Colonel McClure s stock They were to bring the animals out to camp where the boys would break them in Tad set out with them after a hurried breakfast leaving his young companions to amuse themselves as best they could How far do we have to ride Big foot asked the lad after they were in their saddles Mile or two I guess It s been a long time since I was through these parts There s that church I ve been telling you about Where There near the bedding down ground Seems as though the boss might have put the cows further away from the place Tad surveyed the structure with keen interest The white walls of the old adobe church reflected back the morning light in a whitish glare About the place he observed a rank growth of weeds and evil cacti the only touch of life to be seen being the birds that were perched on its crumbling ridges gayly piping their morning songs It looks deserted I reckon it is answered Big foot Anyway it ought to be Ain t fit for human beings to roost in Humph I don t believe there is anything spooky about that building I m going to investigate the first time I get the chance Have we time to stop this morning No we ll have to be getting along The ponies we are after will have to be hobbled and got back to camp somehow I expect we ll have a merry circus with them If we get back in time for supper we ll be lucky That will be fun exulted Tad mister Stallings promised me I might break one of them My pony having been drowned I should like to break a fresh one for myself And break your neck at the same time I know you ve got the sand but you let that job out kid You don t know them bronchos I thought you said I was no longer a tenderfoot laughed Tad Sure thing but this is different I ll chance it You show me the pony I cannot ride and I will confess that I am a tenderfoot Their arrival at the Ox Bow ranch was the signal for all the dogs on the place to try out their lungs whereat a dozen cowboys appeared to learn the cause of the uproar The McClure house stood a little back nestling under a bluff covered with scant verdure but well screened from the biting northers of the Texas winter Further to the south were the ranch buildings corrals the cook house and a log cabin outside of which hung any number of bridles and saddles some of which the ranchers were mending and polishing when Stalling s men arrived on the scene Big foot introduced himself and was received with many a shout and handshake Bill Blake the foreman of the ranch after greeting the new arrival turned inquiringly to Tad Butler who had dismounted I didn t know you used kids in your business Big foot he grinned Big foot flushed under the imputation Mebby you call him a kid but if you d see the lad work you d change your mind mighty quick answered the big cowman with a trace of irritation in his voice He explained to Blake what the boy was doing with the outfit at the same time relating some of the things that the slender freckle faced boy from the East had accomplished Shake Pinto exclaimed Bill Blake cordially I reckon mister McClure would like to talk with you Big foot and I have got some business over in the ranch house you see smiled the foreman I see replied Tad though not wholly sure whether he did or not He s over there talking with his boss wrangler now Come along and I ll give you a first class knock down to him Tad found the ranch owner to be a man of refinement and kindly nature yet whose keen quizzical eyes seemed to take the lad in from head to foot in one comprehensive glance So you are learning the business eh That s right my lad That s the way to go about it and there s no place like a drive to learn it for that s where a man meets about every experience that comes in the life of a cowman Tad explained about the Pony Riders and that their trip was in the nature of a pleasure jaunt they being accompanied by Walter Perkins s instructor and that they were with the outfit for a brief trip only mister McClure became interested at once I should like to hear more about your experiences he said Won t you come up to the house with me while your man talks horse with my foreman Tad flushed slightly as he glanced down over his own rough dust covered clothes I I am afraid I am not fit sir Tut tut We ranchers learn to take a man for what he is worth not for what he has on You have been riding Naturally you would not be expected to appear in broadcloth No more do we expect you to Had I a son I should feel far better satisfied to see him as you stand before me now than in the finest of clothes Come I want you to meet my family Tad somewhat reluctantly followed the rancher to his house Much to the lad s discomfiture he was ushered into the drawing room of the first southern home he had ever entered Be seated sir I will call my daughters We have so few guests here that the girls seldom see anyone during the time they are home from school mister McClure left the room and Tad after choosing a chair that he considered least liable to be soiled by his dusty clothes sat down gazing about him curiously He found himself in a room that was by far the handsomest he had ever seen while from the walls a long line of family ancestors looked down at him from their gilt frames Tad had found time for only a brief glance about him when the sound of voices attracted his attention At first he was unable to decide whence the voices came They seemed to be in the room with him yet there was no one there save himself Turning about he discovered that a curtained doorway led directly into another room and that it was from the adjoining room that the sound had come You say Ruth is bad again to day Margaret No mother I would not say that exactly Yet she does not seem to be quite herself and I thought it best to tell you I feared that perhaps she was going to have one of her old attacks Say nothing to her of your suspicions The last one passed over I think largely because we appeared to treat her mood lightly Poor child she has never ceased to grieve for the man whom her parents refused to permit her to marry I think your Aunt Jane made a grievous mistake I told her so plainly when she brought Ruth here to us hoping she might forget her youthful love affair Tad Butler s cheeks burned That he had unwittingly played eavesdropper troubled him not a little The boy rose and walking to a window on the further side of the room stood with hat crumpled in both hands behind him gazing out The voices ceased Yet a moment later Tad started and turned sharply Well young man what are you doing here Before him he saw a woman just short of middle age He inferred at once that she was the elder of the two women whom he had heard speaking behind the curtain I am waiting for mister McClure answered Tad bowing politely his face flushing under its tan Does he know that you are here she asked in a milder tone Oh yes He asked me to wait here until he returned Pardon me I Ah here you are my dear I have been looking for you I wish you to meet Master Thaddeus Butler who with three companions and a tutor is crossing the state with the Miller herd It is the most unique vacation in these days Master Butler this is missus McClure My daughters will join us in a moment missus McClure shook hands cordially with their young guest Welcome to Ox Bow she smiled At first as your back was turned to me I took you for one of the men Instantly you faced me I saw the mistake I had made Won t you be seated Under her cordial manner Tad Butler was soon at his ease Almost before he was aware of the fact missus McClure had drawn from him the main facts relating to the journeyings of the Pony Riders missus McClure s two daughters Sadie and Margaret entered the room soon afterwards Tad being presented to them Margaret the elder of the two was a fair haired girl of perhaps nineteen years while her sister Sadie who was darker Tad judged to be about his own age Both girls shook hands smilingly with their guest I hope you will pardon me for appearing in such a disreputable condition begged the lad I really am not fit to be seen His quaint way of putting it brought forth a general laugh You need make no apology We are all ranchers here Even my daughters and my niece ride and sometimes accompany the foreman on drives from one part of the ranch to another As for my niece though brought up in the East she is a born cattle woman There is hardly a cowman on the place who can ride better than she Your man tells us that you are the best horseman in your outfit said mister McClure I don t think I quite deserve that compliment sir answered Tad But I am very fond of horses I find by kind treatment one can do almost anything with them My idea exactly nodded mister McClure approvingly The cowpuncher doesn t look at it that way however He wouldn t feel at home on a horse that didn t break the monotony by bucking now and then Did you ever ride a bucker Once I expect to break one of the animals I understand we are to get from you His host whistled softly You have a large contract on hand young man The ponies I am turning off are the worst specimens we ever had on the ranch Some of them never had a bridle on for the very good reason that no one ever has been able to get close enough to them to put bridles on I hope you will not be foolish enough to try to break any of that stock Oh we ll rope them and get a headstall on anyway The rest will come along all right I think smiled Tad Ah my niece Miss Brayton exclaimed the rancher introducing a young woman who had just entered the room With the Miller outfit she asked Yes answered Tad Who is your foreman Stallings Bob Stallings Tad thought Miss Brayton one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen Yet there was something about her that affected him strangely Perhaps it was her abrupt manner of speaking At any rate the lad experienced a sense of uneasiness the moment she entered the room He did not stop to ask himself why Tad merely knew that this was true Miss Brayton had little to say but her quietness was more than atoned for by the vivacity of Sadie and Margaret As Tad was taking his leave the entire family accompanied him out into the yard If your duties will permit we should like to have you and your companions dine with us to morrow evening said Colonel McClure Yes by all means added missus McClure Yes mister Butler we should love to have you added Sadie Besides we want to meet your friends said Margaret And I am sure we should enjoy coming It seems almost an imposition for four of us boys to camp out in your dining room at the same time laughed Tad I assure you it will be doing us a favor protested the rancher You will bring your Professor also We ll have a real family party Tad somewhat reluctantly agreed to bring his companions though he disliked the idea of going to so fine a place for dinner in their rough weather beaten clothing The boy bade them all good bye and strode off toward the corral where the ponies were being roped preparatory to being taken over to the Miller herd Oh mister Butler Tad wheeled sharply Ruth Brayton was hurrying toward him The lad lifted his hat courteously and awaited the young woman s approach Yes Miss Brayton Tell me again who your foreman is Bob Stallings Stallings Stallings Where have I heard that name before mused the girl staring at Tad with vacant eyes Are you sure it isn t Hamilton Robert Hamilton Quite sure smiled the lad Do you know a cowboy or foreman by that name No I never heard the name before Miss Brayton turned abruptly and hurried away Tad heard her repeating the name of his foreman as she walked swiftly toward the ranch house CHAPTER XVIII BREAKING IN THE BRONCHOS My but that was a job laughed Tad after they had reached camp again with three wild bronchos in tow They had staked the new ponies down on the plain to think matters over while the cowboys sat down to their noon meal They sure are a bad lot agreed Big foot Sanders Never seen worse ones See that fellow over there don t even mind the pinch of that hackmore bridle He s the ugliest brute in the bunch That s the one I m going to break decided Tad Butler his eyes glowing as he observed the wild pitching and snorting of the staked animal The pony was running the length of his rope at full speed coming to a sudden halt when he reached its end with heels high in the air and head doubled up under him on the ground It seemed to the lad like unnecessarily harsh treatment yet he knew full well the quality of the temper of these animals of the plains I m afraid he ll break his neck objected Tad Let him snapped the foreman There s more where he came from By the way said Tad speaking to the Pony Riders I have an invitation for you fellows I had forgotten it in the excitement of getting the new ponies to camp Where to asked Ned Rector indifferently To take dinner at the home of Colonel McClure That will be fine glowed Walter But the question is what are we going to wear laughed Tad We don t look very beautiful for a drawing room Drawing room inquired Ned Rector with interest Did I hear you say drawing room Yes Huh There isn t one within a thousand miles of us You will think differently when you see the one at the ranch house Did did the colonel say what we were going to have to eat asked Stacy Brown in all seriousness His question provoked a loud laugh from cowboys and Pony Riders No Naturally I didn t ask him There are some very nice girls at the ranch too You don t say exclaimed Ned Will wonders never cease I ll believe I am not dreaming when I see all this with my own two eyes Yes Colonel McClure has two daughters and besides these there is a niece from the East visiting them She is considerably older than the daughters but a very beautiful woman Tad paused thoughtfully for a moment Professor I presume you will have no objection to our accepting Colonel McClure s invitation You are invited to join us Not at all young gentlemen But perhaps I had better not intrude Please go urged Tad Sure He ll go You will won t you Professor demanded Ned Of course if you really wish me to smiled Professor Zepplin good naturedly Of course we do chorused the boys Very well I will think it over I m afraid however that I do not look altogether presentable No more do we answered Walter Perkins Tad probably told them we did not Tad nodded They refused to accept that excuse So I told them we would come The boys were full of anticipation for this promised break in the monotony of their living and besides they looked forward keenly to meeting the young women about whom their companion had told them After the meal had been finished Tad asked when they were to begin breaking the new stock Stallings looked over the ponies critically I guess we ll let them stay where they are for an hour or so yet It will help to break their spirit Still think you can break one of them in I am sure of it answered Tad Butler confidently You shall have the chance However I shall not permit you to saddle him Some of the cowpunchers who are used to that had better do it for you the first time Unless one knows these little brutes he is liable to be kicked to death I am not afraid No that is the danger of it Neither is the pony afraid that is not until he is blindfolded About the middle of the afternoon the foreman announced that they would begin the breaking The cowmen uttered a shout for the process promised them much boisterous fun Is the gopher going to break one of the bronchos asked Lumpy Bates No but the Pinto is replied Curley Adams He ll want to go home right away if he tries it I reckon jeered Lumpy Don t you be too sure about that retorted Curley That kid s got the stuff in him I ve been watching him right along None of them lads is tenderfeet unless it s the gopher and he isn t half as bad as he looks By this time the foreman had taken hold of the rope that held the most violent of the ponies and was slowly shortening upon it As he neared the pony s head a cowboy began whipping a blanket over its back While the animal was plunging and kicking Stallings gripped him by the bridle after which there was a lively struggle and in a moment more a broad handkerchief had been tied over the pony s eyes What s that for Is he going to play blind man s buff demanded Chunky Huh Get out growled Big foot If he does you ll be it jeered Ned Rector At last the animal crouched down trembling He had never passed through an experience like that before and could not understand it Tad Butler standing near was observing the operation with keenly inquiring eyes All at once the little animal leaped clear of the foreman s grip its blinder came off and it launched into a series of wild bucks and grunts The air seemed full of flying hoofs and for the moment there was a lively scattering of cowpunchers and Pony Riders Once more and with great patience the foreman went all over the proceeding again This time the foreman got one hand on the animal s nose and the other in his mane All at once something happened A forty pound saddle was thrown not dropped on the back of the unsuspecting pony The broncho s back arched like a bow and the saddle went skyward Stacy Brown happened to be in the way of it as it descended so that boy and saddle went down together in a yelling heap The cowpunchers howled with delight as Chunky covered with dust wiping the sand from his eyes staggered angrily to his feet Did he kick me he demanded With his back yes chuckled Shorty Savage Again and again the saddle was shot into the air the instant it touched the pony s back It was back in place in no time however After a time the broncho paused as if to devise some new method of getting rid of the hated thing As he did so Big foot Sanders cautiously poked a stick under the animal pulling the girth toward him A moment more and he had slipped it through a large buckle and with a jerk made the girth fast Again the bucking began but more violently than before The saddle held though it slipped to one side a little I ve got him now cried Stallings The instant he lets up catch that flank girth and make fast Right answered Big foot It was accomplished almost before the boys realized it Walter and his companions set up a shout The pony stood panting head down legs braced apart The blinder had been torn from his eyes He was waiting for the next move Are you ready for me now asked Tad Butler quietly The foreman turned his head glancing at Tad questioningly Think you can stand it I can t any more than fall off Stallings nodded Tad slipped to the pony s side Cautiously placing his left foot in the stirrups he suddenly flung himself into the saddle The next instant Tad Butler was flying through the air over the pony s head

none	none	 GRIT WINS THE BATTLE 
64_76973_000003_000000	train-clean-360	The lad appeared to strike the ground head on 
none	none	Fortunately the spot where he landed was covered with soft sand
64_76973_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Are you hurt asked Big foot running to the boy and reaching out to assist him 
64_76973_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 I guess not answered Tad rubbing the sand from his eyes and blinking vigorously 
64_76973_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The skin had been scraped from his face in spots where the coarse sand had ground its way through 
64_76973_000006_000001	train-clean-360	His hair was filled with the dirt of the plain and his clothes were torn 
none	none	But Tad Butler nothing daunted smiled as he pulled himself to his feet You better let that job out 
64_76973_000008_000001	train-clean-360	You can t ride that critter 
64_76973_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll ride him if he kills me answered the boy his jaws setting stubbornly 
64_76973_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Tad hitched his belt tighter before making any move to approach the pony which Stallings was now holding by main force 
64_76973_000010_000001	train-clean-360	While doing so the lad watched the animal s buckings observantly 
none	none	What what happened demanded Stallings
64_76973_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Foot slipped out of the stirrup 
64_76973_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Think you can make it 
64_76973_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll try it if you have the time to spare 
64_76973_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 It takes time to break a bronch 
64_76973_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Don t you worry about that 
64_76973_000015_000002	train-clean-360	I don t want you to be breaking your neck however 
64_76973_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 My advice is that you keep off that animal declared Professor Zepplin 
64_76973_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 You cannot manage him that is plain 
64_76973_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Please do not say that Professor 
64_76973_000017_000001	train-clean-360	I must ride him now 
64_76973_000017_000002	train-clean-360	You wouldn t have me be a coward would you 
64_76973_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Stallings realizing the boy s position nodded slightly to the Professor 
64_76973_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Very well if mister Stallings thinks it is safe agreed Professor Zepplin reluctantly 
64_76973_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Tad s face lighted up with a satisfied smile 
64_76973_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Whoa boy he soothed patting the animal gently on the neck 
none	none	The pony s back arched and its heels shot up into the air again 
64_76973_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Once more Tad petted him 
none	none	No use said the foreman The iron hand is the only thing that will break this cayuse 
64_76973_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Don t know enough to know when he s well off 
64_76973_000023_000003	train-clean-360	Got your spurs on 
none	none	Yes Then drive them in when you get well seated Tad shook his head I do not think that will be necessary Guess he ll go fast enough without urging him with the rowels answered the boy backing away to wait until the pony had bounced itself into a position where another effort to mount him would be possible
64_76973_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Will you please coil up the stake rope and fasten it to the horn mister Stallings asked Tad 
64_76973_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 I don t want to get tangled up with that thing 
64_76973_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes if you are sure you can stick on him 
64_76973_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Leave that to me 
64_76973_000030_000001	train-clean-360	I know his tricks now 
64_76973_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Cautiously the rope was coiled and made fast to the saddle horn 
64_76973_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 I m coming said Tad in a quiet tense voice 
none	none	Ready answered the foreman with equal quietness 
64_76973_000034_000000	train-clean-360	The lad darted forward running on his toes his eyes fixed on the saddle 
64_76973_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Tad gave no heed to the pony 
64_76973_000035_000001	train-clean-360	It was that heavy bobbing saddle that he must safely make before the pony itself would enter into his considerations 
64_76973_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Lightly touching the saddle he bounded into it at the same time shoving both feet forward 
none	none	Fortunately his shoes slipped into the big boxed stirrups and the rein which lay over the pommel ready for him was quickly gathered up Stallings leaped from the animal s head and the cowpunchers made a quick sprint to remove themselves from the danger zone They were none too soon The broncho at last realized that his head was free 
64_76973_000039_000001	train-clean-360	His sides however were being gripped by a muscular pair of legs and his head was suddenly jerked up by a sharp tug at the rein 
none	none	Y e e e o w greeted the cowboys in their long drawn piercing cry
64_76973_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Yip answered Tad though more to the pony than in answer to them 
64_76973_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Down went the pony s head between his forward legs his hind hoofs beating a tattoo in the air 
64_76973_000043_000000	train-clean-360	The feet came down as suddenly as they had gone up 
64_76973_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Instantly the little animal began a series of stiff legged leaps into the air his curving back making it a very uncomfortable place to sit on 
64_76973_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Tad s head was jerked back and forth until it seemed as though his neck would be broken 
64_76973_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Look out for the side jump warned the foreman 
64_76973_000046_000000	train-clean-360	It came almost instantly and with a quickness that nearly unhorsed the plucky lad 
none	none	As it was the swift leap to the right threw Tad half way over on the beast s left side 
64_76973_000047_000001	train-clean-360	Fortunately the lad gripped the pommel with his right hand as he felt himself going and little by little he pulled himself once more to an upright posture 
none	none	All at once the animal took a leap into the air coming down headed in the opposite direction 
64_76973_000049_000000	train-clean-360	Tad s head swam 
none	none	He no longer heard the shouts of encouragement from the cowpunchers He was clinging desperately to his insecure seat with legs pressed tightly against the pony s sides 
64_76973_000049_000003	train-clean-360	As yet he had not seen fit to use the rowels 
64_76973_000050_000000	train-clean-360	There came a pause which was almost as disconcerting as had been the previous rapid movements 
64_76973_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 He s going to throw himself 
64_76973_000051_000001	train-clean-360	Don t get caught under him bellowed Big foot 
64_76973_000052_000000	train-clean-360	Tad was thankful for the suggestion for he was not looking for that move at the moment 
64_76973_000053_000000	train-clean-360	The pony struck the ground on its left side with a bump that made the animal grunt 
64_76973_000053_000001	train-clean-360	Tad however forewarned had freed his left foot from the stirrup and was standing easily over his fallen mount eyes fixed on the beast s ears ready to resume his position at the first sign of a quiver of those ears 
64_76973_000054_000000	train-clean-360	Like a flash the animal was on its feet again but with Tad riding in the saddle a satisfied smile on his face 
64_76973_000054_000001	train-clean-360	Once more the awful nerve racking bucking began 
64_76973_000054_000002	train-clean-360	It did not seem as if a human being could survive that series of violent antics and least of all a mere boy 
none	none	All at once the animal came up on its hind legs 
64_76973_000056_000000	train-clean-360	Tad knew instinctively what it meant 
none	none	He did not need the warning cry of the cowpunchers to tell him what the pony was about to do 
64_76973_000056_000002	train-clean-360	Over went the broncho on its back rolling to its side quickly 
64_76973_000057_000000	train-clean-360	Tad was on the ground beside it standing in a half crouching position with one foot on the saddle horn 
64_76973_000058_000000	train-clean-360	He had jerked the broncho s head clear of the ground with a strong tug on the reins making the animal helpless to rise until the lad was ready for him to do so 
64_76973_000059_000000	train-clean-360	The cowboys uttered a yell of triumph 
none	none	Great 
64_76973_000060_000001	train-clean-360	Great approved Bob Stallings 
64_76973_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Tenderfoot eh jeered Big foot Sanders 
64_76973_000061_000001	train-clean-360	 Hooray for the Pinto 
64_76973_000062_000000	train-clean-360	Tad s companions gave a shrill cheer 
none	none	Wait 
64_76973_000063_000001	train-clean-360	He ain t out of the woods yet growled Lumpy Bates 
64_76973_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Think you could do it better hey snapped Curley Adams 
64_76973_000064_000001	train-clean-360	 Why that cayuse would shake the blooming neck off you if you were in that saddle I never did see such a whirlwind 
64_76973_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Got springs in his feet I reckon grinned Big foot 
64_76973_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t let his head down till you re ready for the get away cautioned the foreman 
64_76973_000067_000000	train-clean-360	Tad suddenly allowed the head to touch the ground after the pony had lain pinned at his feet breathing hard for a full minute 
64_76973_000068_000000	train-clean-360	Boy and mount were in the air in a twinkling 
none	none	As they went up Ted brought down his quirt with all his strength It was time the ugly animal was taught that its enemy could strike a blow for himself 
64_76973_000069_000000	train-clean-360	With a quick pause as if in surprise the beast shot its head back to fasten its teeth in the leg of the rider 
64_76973_000069_000001	train-clean-360	Tad had jerked his leg away as he saw the movement with the result that only part of his leggin came away between the teeth of the savage animal 
64_76973_000070_000000	train-clean-360	Crack 
64_76973_000071_000000	train-clean-360	Down came the quirt again 
64_76973_000072_000000	train-clean-360	The broncho s head straightened out before him with amazing quickness He was beginning to fear as well as hate the human being who so persistently sat his back and tortured him 
64_76973_000073_000000	train-clean-360	The pony sprang into the air 
64_76973_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 They re off shouted the cowboys 
64_76973_000075_000000	train-clean-360	With amazing quickness the animal lunged ahead paused suddenly then shot across the plain in a series of leaps and twists 
64_76973_000076_000000	train-clean-360	Tad shook out the rein at the same time giving a gentle pressure to the rowels of his spurs 
64_76973_000077_000000	train-clean-360	Maddened almost beyond endurance the pony started at a furious pace not pausing until more than a mile had been covered 
64_76973_000077_000001	train-clean-360	When he did bring up it was with disconcerting suddenness 
none	none	Whoa boy soothed Tad patting the little animal on the neck 
64_76973_000078_000001	train-clean-360	Again the wide open mouth reached for the lad s left leg 
64_76973_000078_000002	train-clean-360	But this time Tad pressed in the spurs on the right side 
64_76973_000078_000003	train-clean-360	The pony tried to bite that way whereat its rider spurred it on the left side 
64_76973_000079_000000	train-clean-360	This was continued until at least in sheer desperation the animal started again to run 
none	none	He found that he was not interfered with in this effort 
64_76973_000079_000002	train-clean-360	However when he sought to unseat his rider by brushing against the trunk of a large tree he again felt the sting of the quirt on his flank 
64_76973_000080_000000	train-clean-360	Gradually Tad now began to work the animal around 
none	none	After a time he succeeded in doing this and was soon headed for camp They bore down at great speed to where the cowboys were swinging their hats and setting up a shout that carried far over the plain 
64_76973_000081_000000	train-clean-360	Tad s face was flushed with pride 
none	none	Yet he did not allow himself for an instant to forget his work 
64_76973_000081_000002	train-clean-360	The lad s whole attention was centered on the pony under him 
64_76973_000081_000003	train-clean-360	He was determined to make a grand finish that while exhibiting his horsemanship would at the same time give the pony a lesson not soon to be forgotten 
64_76973_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 You ve got him cried Ned Rector as Tad approached now at a gallop the animal s ears lying back angrily 
64_76973_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t be too sure answered Big foot 
none	none	See them ears 
64_76973_000083_000002	train-clean-360	That means more trouble 
64_76973_000084_000000	train-clean-360	It came almost before the words were out of the cowpuncher s mouth 
64_76973_000085_000000	train-clean-360	The broncho stiffened its hoofs ploughing little trails in the soft dirt of the plain as it skidded to a stop 
none	none	The jolt might have unhorsed Tad Butler had he not been expecting it from some indications that he read in the animal s actions 
64_76973_000086_000000	train-clean-360	Suddenly settling back on its haunches the broncho rolled over on its side 
64_76973_000086_000001	train-clean-360	Tad with a grin stepped off a few paces taking with him however the coil of rope one end of which was still fastened around the beast s neck 
none	none	With a snort and a bound realizing that it was free at last the little animal leaped to its feet and darted away 
64_76973_000088_000000	train-clean-360	Tad moved swiftly to the right so as not to get a tug on the rope over the back of the pony 
64_76973_000089_000000	train-clean-360	The coil was running out over his hands like a thing of life 
64_76973_000089_000001	train-clean-360	Grasping the end firmly the lad shook out the rest of the rope leaning back until it was almost taut 
none	none	By this time the animal was running almost at right angles to him 
64_76973_000091_000000	train-clean-360	Tad gave the rope a quick rolling motion just as it was being drawn taut 
64_76973_000091_000001	train-clean-360	The result was as surprising as it was sudden 
64_76973_000091_000002	train-clean-360	The animal s four feet were snipped from under it neatly sending the broncho to earth with a disheartening bump 
none	none	Illustration Tad Gave the Rope a Quick Rolling Motion 
64_76973_000093_000000	train-clean-360	Without giving it a chance to rise Tad sprang upon it and when the pony rose Tad Butler was sitting proudly in the saddle 
64_76973_000094_000000	train-clean-360	The little beast s head went down 
none	none	Its proud spirit had been broken by a boy who knew the ways of the stubborn animal 
64_76973_000095_000000	train-clean-360	A great shout of approval went up from cowpunchers and Pony Riders 
64_76973_000095_000001	train-clean-360	They had never seen a breaking done more skillfully 
64_76973_000096_000000	train-clean-360	Tad s gloved hand patted the neck of the subdued animal affectionately 
64_76973_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 I m sorry I had to be rough with you old boy but you shall have a lump of sugar 
none	none	We re going to be great friends now I know

none	none	 DINNER AT THE OX BOW
64_76974_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 Welcome to the Ox Bow young gentlemen greeted Colonel McClure 
64_76974_000003_000000	train-clean-360	The rancher and his wife were waiting at the lower end of the lawn as the Pony Rider Boys accompanied by Professor Zepplin rode up on the following afternoon 
64_76974_000004_000000	train-clean-360	The lads wore their regulation plainsman s clothes but for this occasion coats had been put on and hair combed each desiring to look his best as they were to meet the young ladies of the ranch 
64_76974_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 We owe you an apology sir for appearing in this condition announced the Professor 
64_76974_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Master Butler and myself have already settled that question answered the rancher 
64_76974_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 As Henry Ward Beecher once said Clothes don t make the man but when he is made he looks very well dressed up I must say however that these young men are about as likely a lot of lads as I have ever seen 
64_76974_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Clear eyed their faces tanned almost to a copper color figures erect and shoulders well back the Pony Rider Boys were indeed wholesome to look upon 
64_76974_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Perhaps Sadie and Margaret McClure were not blind to this for they blushed very prettily the boys thought upon being presented to their guests 
64_76974_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Ruth Brayton was in a sunny mood laughing gayly as she chatted with the boys 
64_76974_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Tad glanced at her inquiringly 
64_76974_000008_000001	train-clean-360	She was not the same girl that he had met the day before 
64_76974_000008_000002	train-clean-360	There was a difference in the eyes too 
64_76974_000008_000003	train-clean-360	Tad could not understand the change 
64_76974_000008_000004	train-clean-360	It perplexed him 
none	none	Colonel McClure took the Professor off to his study the boys being left with missus McClure and the young ladies to wander through the grounds and chat Each of the young women was an accomplished horsewoman and therefore evinced a keen interest in the experiences of the boys since they had been in saddle
64_76974_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 I had so often wanted to take a trip through the Rockies on horseback announced Miss Margaret 
none	none	I am afraid you would find it rather rough going said Ned Rector No worse than the plains replied Walter We have had more hardships in Texas during the short time we have been here than we ever experienced in the mountains
64_76974_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but you were driving cattle objected missus McClure 
64_76974_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 There probably is no harder work in the world 
64_76974_000013_000002	train-clean-360	We down here know something about that 
64_76974_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 I I killed a bobcat up in the mountains Stacy Brown informed them with enthusiasm 
none	none	Indeed smiled missus McClure indulgently He did 
64_76974_000016_000001	train-clean-360	And I fell off a mountain laughed Walter Perkins 
64_76974_000016_000002	train-clean-360	 You see we have had quite a series of experiences 
64_76974_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Indeed you have 
64_76974_000017_000001	train-clean-360	How long do you expect to remain with the herd 
64_76974_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Are you going through with them 
64_76974_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 I believe not answered Tad Butler 
64_76974_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 I think we shall be leaving very soon now 
64_76974_000018_000002	train-clean-360	We have a lot of traveling to do yet as it has been planned that we shall see a good deal of the country before it is time to return to school this fall 
none	none	And you are to remain out in the open in the saddle all summer asked Miss Brayton her eyes sparkling almost enviously
64_76974_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I believe so 
64_76974_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I should love it 
64_76974_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 We are getting to love it ourselves 
64_76974_000022_000001	train-clean-360	It will be hard to have to sleep indoors again 
64_76974_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Shortly afterwards all were summoned in to supper 
64_76974_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Stacy Brown s eyes sparkled with anticipation as he surveyed the table resplendent with silver and cut glass loaded too with good things to eat 
64_76974_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Ned Rector observed the look in his companion s eyes 
64_76974_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Now don t forget that we are not eating off the tail board of the chuck wagon Chunky he whispered in passing 
64_76974_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 Be as near human as you can and satisfy your appetite 
none	none	Chunky s face flushed
64_76974_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Take your advice to yourself he muttered 
64_76974_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Colonel McClure proved an entertaining host and the boys were led on to talk about themselves during most of the meal 
none	none	Especially were their hosts interested in the story of the discovery of the Lost Claim which the boys had found on their trip in the Rockies I have wanted to ask you about the old church between here and camp mister McClure said Tad at the first opportunity Very interesting old ruin sir answered the host
64_76974_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 Built by the Mexicans more than a hundred years ago 
64_76974_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes so I understand 
none	none	Is it true that there s spooks in that place interrupted Stacy Everybody laughed Tad glanced sharply at Ruth Brayton He noticed a curious flush on her face and the strained look that he had observed in her eyes on the previous day was again there 
64_76974_000033_000003	train-clean-360	Almost the instant he caught it it was gone 
64_76974_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 I m afraid you have been misinformed Master Stacy answered Colonel McClure 
64_76974_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 How about the trouble that the cattle men experience when near the place spoke up Ned Rector 
none	none	The cowmen are sure there is something in the story
64_76974_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing at all nothing at all 
64_76974_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Just a mere coincidence 
64_76974_000036_000002	train-clean-360	We live here and we have no more than the usual run of ill luck with our stock 
64_76974_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Stampedes asked Tad 
64_76974_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Seldom anything of that sort 
64_76974_000038_000001	train-clean-360	You see our stock is held by wire fences If they want to stampede we let them let them run until they are tired of it 
64_76974_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 I should like to explore the old church said Tad again referring to the subject uppermost in his mind 
64_76974_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing to hinder 
64_76974_000040_000001	train-clean-360	Ruth why can t you and the girls take the young men over there to morrow if the day is fine 
64_76974_000040_000002	train-clean-360	You know the place and its history 
none	none	I am sure they would enjoy having you do so
64_76974_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 We should be delighted answered Ned Rector promptly 
64_76974_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 We might make it a picnic suggested Margaret McClure 
64_76974_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 And have things to eat asked Stacy evincing a keen interest in the proposal 
64_76974_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course smiled missus McClure 
none	none	A picnic would not be a picnic without a spread on the ground 
64_76974_000044_000002	train-clean-360	I will send some of the servants over to serve the picnic lunch 
64_76974_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you smiled Tad gratefully 
64_76974_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 It will be a happy afternoon for all of us if Miss Brayton can find the time to take us 
64_76974_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course Ruth will go nodded missus McClure 
64_76974_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes answered the young woman 
64_76974_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 What time shall we arrange to start auntie 
none	none	Say eleven o clock if that will suit the young men
64_76974_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Perfectly answered Tad 
64_76974_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 You might first take a gallop to the Springs 
64_76974_000050_000001	train-clean-360	That will give you all an appetite 
none	none	Where are the Springs asked Ned
64_76974_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 About seven miles to the eastward of the ranch 
64_76974_000052_000001	train-clean-360	A most picturesque place answered Colonel McClure 
none	none	Professor while the young people are enjoying themselves suppose you ride over here and spend the afternoon with me 
64_76974_000052_000003	train-clean-360	We can ride about the ranch if it would please you 
64_76974_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 I should be delighted 
64_76974_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 I was going to suggest too that it might be a pleasant relief for all of you to accept the hospitality of the Ox Bow ranch and remain here while you are in the vicinity 
64_76974_000054_000001	train-clean-360	We have room to spare and would be glad to have you 
none	none	I am afraid the young men would prefer to remain in camp thank you They will get enough of sleeping in beds upon their return home discourteous as the statement may seem answered Professor Zepplin
64_76974_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Not at all not at all 
64_76974_000056_000001	train-clean-360	I understand you perfectly 
64_76974_000056_000002	train-clean-360	I shall not press the point 
64_76974_000056_000003	train-clean-360	But spend all the time you can with us 
64_76974_000056_000004	train-clean-360	The place is yours Make yourselves at home 
64_76974_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 No mister Stallings would not like it if we were to remain away over night 
64_76974_000057_000001	train-clean-360	You see he expects us to do our share of night guard duty explained Tad 
64_76974_000057_000002	train-clean-360	 We are earning our keep as it were 
none	none	The boys laughed
64_76974_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 That is some of us are corrected Ned with a sly glance at Stacy who was eating industriously 
64_76974_000059_000001	train-clean-360	 Others are eating for their keep 
64_76974_000060_000000	train-clean-360	The Pony Rider Boys caught the hidden meaning in his words but they tried not to let their hosts observe that it was a joke at the expense of one of them 
64_76974_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Stallings murmured Miss Brayton her eyes staring vacantly at Tad Butler 
none	none	Tad flushed at the memory of what he had heard on his first visit to the ranch 
64_76974_000063_000000	train-clean-360	Miss Brayton excused herself rather abruptly and left the room 
64_76974_000063_000001	train-clean-360	They did not see her again that evening 
64_76974_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 My niece has been ailing of late explained missus McClure 
none	none	Perhaps she had better not try to accompany us to morrow then suggested Tad
64_76974_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes I wish her to 
64_76974_000066_000001	train-clean-360	It will do her good it will take her mind from herself 
64_76974_000067_000000	train-clean-360	Tad Butler noted the last half of the sentence particularly 
64_76974_000067_000001	train-clean-360	For him it held a deeper meaning than it did for his companions 
none	none	I wonder if she knows mister Stallings mused Tad I m going to find out 
64_76974_000068_000002	train-clean-360	No I won t 
64_76974_000068_000003	train-clean-360	It s none of my business 
64_76974_000068_000004	train-clean-360	Still it will do no harm to ask him or to mention the name to him 
64_76974_000068_000005	train-clean-360	That surely would not be wrong 
none	none	Under the charm of the evening his mind soon drifted into other channels 
64_76974_000069_000001	train-clean-360	After supper games were brought out and a happy evening followed 
64_76974_000070_000000	train-clean-360	Ten o clock came and Professor Zepplin glancing at his watch was about to propose a return to camp when one of Colonel McClure s cowboys appeared in the doorway hat in hand 
64_76974_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 Beg pardon may I speak with you a moment asked the man 
none	none	Certainly replied the colonel with the same gracious manner Tad observed that he used toward his guests Excuse me a moment 
64_76974_000073_000000	train-clean-360	After a little their host returned but rather hurriedly it seemed and Tad s keen eyes noticed that he seemed disturbed 
64_76974_000074_000000	train-clean-360	mister McClure caught the lad s inquiring gaze fixed upon him 
64_76974_000074_000001	train-clean-360	He nodded 
64_76974_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 Is anything wrong asked the rancher s wife 
64_76974_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I am afraid there is he answered quietly 
none	none	What is it
64_76974_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 I am not sure 
64_76974_000078_000001	train-clean-360	Perhaps I should not alarm you young gentlemen but I think you should know 
64_76974_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 At the camp you mean asked Tad 
none	none	Yes
64_76974_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 What s that demanded Professor Zepplin sharply 
64_76974_000081_000001	train-clean-360	 Something wrong at the camp 
64_76974_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 My men think so 
64_76974_000082_000001	train-clean-360	They say they hear shooting off in that direction and want to know if they shall ride out 
none	none	You think it is a a began Tad A stampede 
64_76974_000084_000001	train-clean-360	Yes I should not be surprised 
64_76974_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 We must go announced the lad rising promptly 
64_76974_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 Why go asked Margaret 
64_76974_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 We may be needed 
64_76974_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 But my men have started already replied the rancher 
64_76974_000088_000001	train-clean-360	 They surely will be help enough 
none	none	mister 
64_76974_000089_000001	train-clean-360	Stallings will expect us 
64_76974_000089_000002	train-clean-360	We may be able to be of some assistance 
64_76974_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 Well if you must 
64_76974_000090_000001	train-clean-360	Yes you are right 
64_76974_000090_000002	train-clean-360	Business is business even when one is out on a pleasure trip 
64_76974_000090_000003	train-clean-360	It s a good sign in a young man 
64_76974_000090_000004	train-clean-360	Tell your foreman that he may call upon us to any extent 
64_76974_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you I will replied Tad 
64_76974_000092_000000	train-clean-360	Bidding their hosts a hasty good night and promising to be on hand at the appointed hour on the following day if the condition of the herd permitted the Pony Rider Boys ran for their ponies 
none	none	In a few moments they were racing toward camp 
64_76974_000092_000002	train-clean-360	They too were now able to hear the short spiteful bark of the six shooters 
64_76974_000093_000000	train-clean-360	It was a significant sound 
64_76974_000093_000001	train-clean-360	They had heard it too many times before not to understand it 
64_76974_000093_000002	train-clean-360	In their minds they could see the hardy cowboys riding in front of the unreasoning animals shooting into the ground in front of them seeking to check the rush 
64_76974_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you think about this business asked Tad Butler drawing up beside Ned Rector 
64_76974_000095_000000	train-clean-360	 I think there is more in this spook story than Colonel McClure knows of or at least will admit 
64_76974_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 So do I answered Tad 
none	none	We ll know when we hear how it happened Tad remembered at that moment the hasty departure of Ruth Brayton I wonder I wonder muttered the boy to himself CHAPTER XXI A CALL FOR HELP I told you so You have told me so many things Big foot that I can t remember them all laughed Tad What is it this time Trouble Oh you mean the stampede last night Yes Tell me about it You know I was not here when it started After a hard night s work in which the Pony Rider Boys had toiled heroically the cattle once more had been rounded up and Big foot and Tad Butler were riding into camp for breakfast It was the first opportunity they had found to talk over the incident Not much to tell It happened so quick What time interrupted Tad Bout half past nine I reckon Half past nine muttered the lad thoughtfully Yes go on We were sitting by the camp fire and Curley Adams was telling about the time he was mixed up with the rustlers on the Colorado Yes Well them ponies came down on us a whooping The ponies Did they get away too asked the lad in surprise Did they You ought to have seen the varmints Nearly run over us when they smashed through the camp One jumped clean over the fire Yes I understand but did you have any idea why the cattle stampeded Sure The ponies put them on the run The ponies started it Yes No telling how it happened The cows come a running after the ponies had broke through them and the whole outfit piled over the camp Do any damage I reckon Knocked over the chuck wagon and near killed the heathen Chinee The men on guard roped the runaway ponies and by the time you got on the job we had just about got straightened around ready to go after the cows I suppose you lay it to Adobe church answered the cowman conclusively I am going over there to day Big foot I am going to try to find out if there is anything in all this Candidly I don t believe it Even Colonel McClure says it s all foolishness That is I do not believe it is anything that cannot be explained The foreman was looking worried that morning It had been a succession of disasters ever since they had neared the locality This time it had been the ponies which were hobbled some little distance from the herd but which had become so frightened at what they saw that they bolted hobbles and all I want those cows from the McClure ranch brought over to day Stallings directed At least bring over half of them Get them over right after breakfast If we are going to have any more disturbances let s try to have them in the daytime Do you need us asked Tad No Go on and enjoy yourselves You all have earned a holiday The lads were in their saddles early Professor Zepplin went with them intending to spend the day at the ranch as arranged on the previous evening The young ladies of the household were waiting dressed in short skirts and wearing broad brimmed straw hats To the boys they were most attractive Their fresh young faces lighted with anticipation of the day s pleasure as assisted by the Pony Riders they swung into their saddles It fell to Tad Butler to ride beside Miss Brayton We had a stampede at the camp last night he told her after they had headed off to the east for the Springs which was to be their first objective point Yes so uncle told me I m sorry Did you lose any stock I believe not unless it was some of the new ponies I did not think to ask At what time did the trouble occur she asked absently I think it was shortly after you left us at dinner last night answered Tad in a matter of fact tone It was perhaps half an hour after that when your uncle told us Miss Brayton flushed painfully and quickly changed the subject Tad noticed her confusion and marveled at it Arriving at the Springs which proved to be a group of rocks rising out of the plain and from which several springs of pure sparkling water bubbled all dismounted and drank of the refreshing fluid After a few moments spent in chatting they remounted their ponies and set off for the adobe church the real object of the day s journey Reaching the historic place they tethered their ponies among the mesquite bushes in the rear of it after which all entered through a crumbling doorway The interior they found was in an excellent state of preservation Many surprising little alcoves and odd cell like rooms were distributed all through the church It was dark and cool in there Chunky shivered and said he didn t wonder people said there were spooks there Is there any cellar beneath the church asked Tad It has been said that there were once underground passages answered Miss Brayton No one in our time has ever discovered them That sounds interesting I think I should like to find the way into them So should I added Stacy Brown Look out that you don t fall in cautioned Ned Remember that s your failing Not much chance of that laughed Margaret These stone floors are too thick for anyone to fall through Does anyone ever come here asked Tad Not that I know of answered Miss Brayton But I saw a path when I came in Somebody has been hitching a pony out there in the bushes too said the boy Perhaps some of the cowmen may come in here out of the heat now and then replied the young woman carelessly Why Ruth you could not induce one of papa s men to enter the door of the old place You know they are half scared to death of it said Margaret Chunky s eyes were growing large Wow he said Let s go out doors and eat The lunch has not yet arrived It will be here soon Miss Brayton informed him We will spread it in the main room here if you have no objections It will be cool and pleasant and besides there are no flies in here For goodness sake forget your appetite growled Ned in Stacy s ear Can t a fellow talk about his appetite without being found fault with Chunky sulkily retorted Not the kind of an appetite you have It s a positive disgrace to the outfit Huh grunted Chunky walking away The lad wandered off by himself and the rest forgot all about him in their investigation of the old church Miss Brayton told them as much of its history as she knew Some of the former priests are said to have been buried somewhere in the edifice she said I don t see any signs of it said Tad No No one ever has in our time And it has even been hinted that treasure has been buried here too or secreted in some of the mysterious recesses of the church Where are they asked Walter I am beginning to get curious I am sure I do not know laughed the young woman There is a sort of garret if you can get to it above the gallery there Maybe you might find something there I have an idea that it is inhabited by bats I guess we will leave them undisturbed decided Tad I don t like bats There come the servants announced Miss Brayton Now your friend will be able to satisfy his appetite At her direction the servants brought in the baskets of food A cloth was spread over a stone table that they found at the far end of the church in the balcony What its use had been in those other days they did not know but it served their purpose very well now I am afraid we shall have to eat standing said Miss Sadie We have no chairs That will suit Chunky replied Ned Rector He always likes to eat standing Why asked Margaret glancing up at him inquiringly For some reasons of his own answered Ned mischievously As the good things were spread before them the eyes of the lads lighted appreciatively and all helped themselves gratefully It was a jolly party untouched by the air of mystery that was supposed to surround the place Why where is Master Stacy asked Ruth Brayton in surprise after they had been eating a few moments Chunky That s so where is he demanded Walter glancing over the railing into the auditorium below No one seemed to know He s prowling around the place somewhere said Ned But what surprises me is that he doesn t scent the food and come running It s not like him to hang back when there is anything good to eat Call him suggested Margaret I will O h h Chunky There was no reply I will go after him said Walter running lightly to the other end of the balcony and down the stone steps The lad returned in a few moments a perplexed frown on his face Find him asked Ned No Maybe he s gone back to camp He s a queer chap I think not I saw his pony there with the others Oh well never mind He ll get so hungry that he will have to come out wherever he is decided Tad I imagine he is hiding somewhere to make us think he has gone away Hark What was that A far away call for help echoed faintly through the church They looked at each other with growing uneasiness on their faces It s Chunky breathed Walter Wh where is he stammered Margaret I don t know Excuse me I must go exclaimed Tad The boy is in trouble again I knew it I knew he couldn t keep out of it he added hurrying away from them Ned sprang down the steps after Tad and together they disappeared through a rear door in the auditorium CHAPTER XXII LOST IN THE ADOBE CHURCH Those up in the gallery could hear the two boys calling to their companion There was no answer to their hails and one by one the little party left the gallery I tell you he is playing tricks on us said Ned after they had searched all over the place without finding any trace of Stacy No I don t agree with you answered Tad Something has happened to him What shall we do asked Walter Keep on looking That is all we can do just now Once more they began their search but with no better results than before Have you looked outside asked Miss Brayton Yes we looked out No use in hunting there for we can see all around the place from the side door here answered Tad He has gotten into some place that we know nothing about We ve got to find it that s all I would suggest that one of us ride to camp and get some of the men to come out and help us advised Walter I ll ride home and have father send some of his own men suggested Margaret Yes that would be best agreed Miss Brayton I wish you wouldn t replied Tad It would alarm them and Professor Zepplin would be frightened Ned suppose you hustle for camp and tell mister Stallings the fix we are in We shall need some help that s sure All right I m off Big foot Sanders and Curley Adams responded to the call on the run the foreman being out with the herd at the time I knew it was Big foot s first words as he rode up and threw himself from his pony where Tad was standing Now tell me all about it Tad did so the cowman nodding his head vigorously as Tad told him all he knew about Chunky s mysterious disappearance Which way did he go asked Curley That we do not know answered Miss Brayton His cry seemed to come from the back of the church somewhere spoke up Ned We ll go in and look around then decided Big foot striding into the church Whew smells pretty musty in here What s that up there That s where we were eating our lunch when we heard Chunky call Walter informed him How long since you had seen him was he up there with you No he had left us twenty minutes before we began eating lunch answered Ned Humph grunted the cowman gazing about him in perplexity Sure it isn t a trick Tad shook his head No He was in trouble I knew that from his tone Then he must have fallen in some place announced Big foot He couldn t fall up so there s no use looking anywhere but on the ground floor here he decided wisely Anybody know of any holes that he might drop into Not that I have seen answered Ned The floor is as solid as stone Well that beats all You boys scout around outside while Curley and I are looking things over in here Besides I want to be alone and think this thing over What do you make of it Big foot asked Curley Adams after the others had gone outside I ain t making When it comes to putting my wits against a spook place I m beyond roping distance We ll look into these holes in the wall around here first he said referring to the niches and cell like rooms that they saw leading off from the auditorium You make it your business to sound the floor We may find some kind of trap door Curley went about bringing down the heels of his heavy boots on the hard floor but it all sounded solid enough There was no belief in the mind of either that the lad could have disappeared in any of the places they had examined that is that he could have done so through any ordinary accident Like most cowboys both Curley and Big foot possessed a strong vein of superstition in their natures To them there was something uncanny in Stacy Brown s mysterious and sudden disappearance Here s a door but it s closed called Curley That s so agreed Big foot hurrying over to him The thing is sealed up with mortar Hasn t been used in fifty cats lives Wonder what s behind it Not the boy that s certain Nope He didn t fall through there Find any other doors open or closed Nary a one Well that seems to settle this part of the ranch we ve got to look somewhere else What bothers me is that we don t hear him call If he was anywhere near and had his voice he d be yelling for help decided the big cowboy Don t think he s dead do you I don t think at all I don t know answered Big foot It s my idea that the gopher isn t in here at all announced Curley with emphasis His companion eyed him thoughtfully You re almost human at times Curley I reckon you ve said the only true words that s been spoke by us this afternoon We look for the gopher and don t find him You say he ain t here and he isn t Great head But that don t find him The question is where is he We ll have to look outside answered Curley Right you are Come on But their search outside was as fruitless as had been their quest within the old adobe church Not a trace of Stacy Brown did they find Ned I think you had better take the young ladies home said Tad finally Want me to tell Professor Zepplin Not right away You can tell him on the way out here He will not have quite so long to worry but I think he should know about it The matter is serious Where did you say mister Stallings was Big foot Out with the new herd The cattle are pretty restless Walt you go in and tell the foreman the difficulty we are in I ll wait here and go on with the search If he can get away I wish he would come I ll tell him answered Walter hurrying away I am sorry we have spoiled your afternoon Miss Brayton said Tad It s too bad But I m afraid something serious has happened to our friend Shall we see you again mister Butler Of course I don t know when the herd will start on We certainly shall not do so until we have found Stacy Anyway we will ride over some time to morrow and bid you all good bye Assisting the young women into their saddles Tad bade their friends good afternoon and turned sadly back to the church while Ned Rector rode back to the Ox Bow ranch with the young women Well what do you think demanded the lad as he faced the big cowboy I don t think My thinker s all twisted out of shape answered Big foot I can t tell you what to do Wait till the boss gets here I guess that will be best replied Tad We have done all we know how to do The two men and the boy wandered about the church aimlessly saying little but thinking a great deal impatiently awaiting the arrival of Bob Stallings to whom they now looked to show them the way out of their difficulty The foreman arrived in the course of half an hour with his pony on a sharp run They had heard him approach and were outside waiting for him Well this is a nice kettle of fish exclaimed Stallings leaping to the ground tossing his reins to Curley Adams Tell me about it Once more Tad Butler related all the facts in his possession regarding Stacy Brown s mysterious disappearance Big foot thinks it s spooks added Tad That s all bosh exploded the foreman It s getting late in the afternoon and I ve no time to waste I ll find him for you What ails you Big foot Getting weak in the knees Not as I knows of This funny business is kinder getting on my nerves though Humph grunted the foreman starting for the church in long strides Nerves in a cowboy Humph They watched the tall figure of Stallings charging through the adobe house peering here and there asking questions in short snappy sentences going down on his knees in search of footprints Finally he rose from his task with a puzzled look in his eyes Tell me that story again he demanded Tad did so The foreman went outside and surveyed the building from all sides There s some secret room or passage in there somewhere The gopher has stumbled into it We are going to discover the mystery of the church of San Miguel before we have done here that is we are if we re lucky he added Bob Stallings words were prophetic though he did not know it The discovery was to be one that would give the big foreman the surprise of his life and that would affect all his after life as well CHAPTER XXIII SOLVING THE MYSTERY We can t do much of anything more until daylight announced the foreman finally You see it s getting dark now You you are going to leave him here asked Tad hesitatingly That s all we can do so far as I see But we ll put one of the men on guard to watch the place To morrow morning we ll take it upon ourselves to tear down that door that s sealed up It may lead into the place where the boy fell in Yes we ll bring down the whole miserable shack if necessary You you think he is here then Of course Where else could he be He walked away and disappeared right before your eyes He could not get away if he had gone outside So where is he In the church of course Then I will remain here and watch the place decided Tad firmly Stallings glanced at him hesitatingly All right I guess you have got the nerve to do it I can t say as much for the rest of the bunch You come along with me now and get your supper After that you may return if you want to Big foot you and Curley stay here until the Pinto gets back Better keep busy You may stumble upon something before you know it The two cowboys did not appear to be any too well pleased with the task assigned to them but they obeyed orders without protest The evening had grown quite dark by the time the cowmen had finished their supper All had been discussing the strange disappearance of Stacy Brown It did not seem to surprise them They had expected trouble when they reached the vicinity of the adobe church They had had little else during the time they had been in the camp Send Curley and Big foot in directed the foreman after Tad had announced his readiness to return to the church We ll all go spoke up Ned Rector It s not at all necessary answered Tad No I have decided to let Big foot go back after he has eaten He can remain with you until ten thirty when he takes his trick on guard Then the rest of you may go out if you wish It isn t fair to leave the Pinto there alone all night If I change my plans I ll send out Master Ned or Walter Run along now Tad The lad mounted his pony and galloped slowly out for his long vigil He was greatly disturbed over the loss of Chunky Yet he could not bring himself to believe that great harm had come to the boy Anything new he called as he rode up Nary a thing Plenty of funny noises inside the shack Kinder gives a fellow the creeps that s all You are to come back and remain with me until your watch I believe Big foot Nice job you ve cut out for me answered the cowman I had nothing to do with it It s the foreman s order answered Tad Better bring a lantern with you We may need it before the night is over All right answered Big foot swinging into his saddle After the cowmen had left Tad walked out a little way from the church and sat down in the sand He was within easy hearing of the place in case anyone should call out It was a lonely spot Tad had not sat there long before the noises that the cowmen had spoken of began again The lad listened intently for a moment Bats he said I can hear them flying about me I hope none of them hit me in the face I ve heard they do that sometimes The pony which had been staked down well out on the plain was now moving about restlessly I wonder if the noises are getting on the broncho s nerves too There s nothing here to be afraid of I m not afraid declared Tad firmly rising and pacing back and forth He was relieved just the same when the big cowman rode back an hour later and took up the vigil with him The two talked in subdued tones as they walked back and forth the lad expressing the opinion that they would find Stacy unharmed when they once discovered the mysterious place into which he had unwittingly stumbled You see those walls are so thick that we couldn t hear him even if he did call out He may even have gotten in where they buried those monks we ve heard about I hope not though He wouldn t know it said Big foot No probably not in the darkness Did you bring that lantern Pshaw I forgot it Mebby I d better go back and get it No never mind Big foot The moon will be up after a time Then we shall not need it You are going in for the ten thirty trick are you not That s what the boss said replied Big foot The right section of the herd was now bedded within a short distance of the church They could hear the singing of the cowboys as they circled slowly around the sleeping cattle Guess we are not going to have any more trouble with them said Tad nodding toward the herd Don t be too sure I feel it coming I have a feeling that trouble ain t more n a million miles away at this very minute I wish you wouldn t talk that way You ll get me feeling creepy first thing you know I ve got to stay here all night said Tad Big foot laughed They passed the time as best they could until the hour for the departure of the cowboy arrived Then Tad was left alone once more He circled about the church listening Once he thought he heard the hoof beats of a pony But the sound died away instantly and he believed he must have been wrong After half an hour Big foot returned The foreman had decided so long as the cattle were quiet to have him remain with Tad If the cowboy should be needed in a hurry the foreman was to fire a shot in the air as a signal Tad was intensely pleased at this arrangement After chatting a while they lay down on the ground speaking only occasionally and then in low tones The mystery of the night seemed to have awed them into silent thought They had lain there for some time when Tad suddenly rose on one elbow Did you hear that he whispered Yes breathed the cowman What what do you think it was Sounded as if some one had jumped to the ground We d better crawl up there It was by the church I told you it was coming Do you suppose it was Chunky No He d be afraid of the dark You d hear him yelling for help Tad had his doubts of that but just the same he too felt that the noise they had heard had not been made by Stacy Brown A silence of several minutes followed The two had crawled only a few feet toward the church when with one common impulse they flattened themselves on the ground and listened Now they could distinctly hear some one cautiously moving about in front of the church It seemed to Tad as if the mysterious intruder were standing on the broad stone flagging at the top of the steps leading into the adobe church Tad slowly rose to his feet Who s there he cried in a voice that trembled a little A sudden commotion followed the question and the listeners distinctly caught the sound of footsteps on the flagging A flash lighted the scene momentarily Big foot had fired a shot toward the church A slight scream followed almost instantly I winged it shouted the cowman lifting his weapon for another shot Tad struck the gun up The lad was excited now Stop he commanded Don t do that again Do you want to kill somebody With that Tad ran his feet fairly flying over the ground in the direction of the church steps In the flash of the gun he had caught a glimpse of a figure standing there The sight thrilled him through and through As the plucky lad reached the steps some one started to run down them Tripping the unknown plunged headlong to the ground The boy was beside the figure in an instant Big foot he shouted The cowman came tearing up to him What is it he bellowed in his excitement It s a woman Big foot It s a woman Oh I hope you did not hit her It s no woman it s a spook I know it s a spook fairly shouted the cowboy I tell you it s a woman cried Tad He was down on his knees by her side now raising her head Get help quick Sanders took the shortest way of doing this He too was alarmed now Raising his gun above his head he pulled the trigger three times in quick succession As many sharp flashes leaped into the air and as many quick reports followed Sure she ain t a spirit demanded the cowman peering down suspiciously fearfully He could make out the form on the ground but dimly Don t be foolish Run out there and meet them I hear the ponies coming Don t let any of them use their guns in the excitement or some one may get hurt warned Tad Butler with rare judgment Big foot hurried out into the open In the meantime Tad stroked the face and head of the woman She was unconscious but her flesh seemed warm to his touch I wonder what it means the perplexed boy asked himself Tad could feel his own pulses beating against his temples It seemed to him as if all the blood in his body were hurling itself against them Cowboys on their ponies came thundering up from different directions In the lead was Bob Stallings the foreman of the outfit You idiots he shouted Do you want to stampede the herd again What do you mean I ve winged a spook yelled Big foot Sanders She s over there by the steps now The kid s got her Spook nonsense snapped the foreman leaping from his pony and rushing to the spot indicated by Big foot What chorused the cowboys Is it the boy have they found him If you all don t insist on talking at once mebby we can find out what the row s about snarled Curley Adams The foreman stopped suddenly as he observed Tad sitting at the foot of the church steps He saw too another form there but it was so dimly outlined in the deep shadows that he was unable to make it out What does this mean he demanded sternly I don t know It s a woman I m afraid Big foot s bullet hit her We must have a light Bring matches roared the foreman No one had any Rustle for the camp and fetch a lantern and be quick about it I ve had enough of this fooling What was she doing how did it happen Tad explained as clearly as he could how they had been disturbed by the strange noises resulting finally in a shot from Big foot s gun The idiot It ll be a sorry day for him if he s done any damage growled the foreman He stooped over and ran his hand over the unconscious woman s face Then he applied his ear to the region of the heart Huh he snapped rising Find anything asked Tad in a half whisper She s alive Heart weak but I don t think she s seriously hurt I don t understand it at all No more do I I m getting dizzy over all this rapid fire business added the lad There they come with a light Stallings strode to the cowman who had brought the lantern Jerking it from the man s hand the foreman ran back We ll straighten her up against the steps and try to find out how badly she is hurt he said placing the lantern on the ground Tad had partially raised her when he let the girl drop with a sudden startled exclamation What is it demanded Stallings incisively It s Miss Ruth Who Miss Ruth By the dim lantern light the foreman saw her face outlined against the dark background of green His eyes were fixed upon her and Bob Stallings seemed scarcely to breathe Ruth Brayton he gasped Yes answered Tad in a low voice not fully comprehending the meaning of the scene that was being enacted before him Ruth Brayton repeated Stallings slowly passing a hand across his forehead Ruth he cried throwing himself to his knees beside her I tell ye I winged a spook insisted Big foot Sanders to a companion as they came up Tad raised a warning hand for silence CHAPTER XXIV CONCLUSION Get back to that herd commanded the foreman sharply All of you Tad you stay with me The girl has fallen and struck her head on the flagging I don t think she is seriously hurt Not understanding the meaning of it all the cowmen drew back and slouched to their ponies Most of them were off duty at the time so they took their way back to camp to be ready for whatever emergency might arise Not a man of them spoke until they had staked their ponies and seated themselves around the camp fire Such a silence was unusual among the cowboys Ned and Walter who had followed them in were standing aside equally silent and thoughtful Shorty Savage was the first to speak What s it all about That s what I d like to know he asked You won t find out from me answered Curley Big foot thinks he winged a spook said a voice Allee samee chuckled Pong who had been taking in the scene with mouth and eyes agape Big foot fixed him with a baneful eye I said I d forget you were the cook some day said he I m forgetting it now faster n a broncho can run Pong s pigtail bobbed up and down like the streaming neckkerchief of a cowboy in saddle as he dived for the protection of the trail wagon I reckon he can understand king s English when he wants to laughed Shorty Now how about that spook Big foot Sanders stood up hitched his trousers and tightened his belt a notch Reckon we ve all gone plumb daffy fellows I m the champeen dummy of the bunch The cowpunchers laughed heartily But was she a spook persisted Shorty She were not She were a woman a friend of the boss Shorty whistled Lucky for me I missed her I was rattled or I d never taken that shot Who is she asked Curley One of the young women from the Ox Bow It gets me what she was doing in that spook place alone at night I W o w The exclamation was uttered by a familiar voice at the sound of which the cowmen sprang to their feet It s the gopher they cried Chunky shouted Ned and Walter running forward with a yell I fell in wailed the fat boy At sight of him the cowboys yelled with merriment Chunky s clothes were torn He was covered with dirt from head to foot and his face was so grimy as to be scarcely recognizable Big foot was staring at him in amazement Striding forward he grasped the lad roughly by the shoulder jerking him into the full light of the camp fire Where you been gopher he demanded sternly I fell in stammered the boy Where Some kind of a well It was in the bushes just outside the back door I went there to hide I fell down to the bottom and went to sleep Just like him Have anything to eat down there jeered Ned Rector When I woke up it was dark Then I found another hole a passage It went both ways Guess one end went under the church I followed it the other way and came out near where the steers are bedded down Hold on a minute Let s get this straight interrupted Curley You mean you found an underground passage at the bottom of the old well Is that it Chunky nodded And the opening was near the spring at the point of rocks just above the herd Yes But I had to dig out through a brush heap Huh Not such a terrible mystery after all sniffed Curley contemptuously How came that underground passage there What s it for asked Big foot Probably dug out in Indian times I ll bet it has saved the scalp of more than one old fellow There s an opening into it from the church somewhere you can depend upon that I m thinking too that the well was a bluff that it wasn t intended for water at all We ll smash the mystery of the adobe church before we pull out of here to morrow see if we don t I come mighty near doing for one of them added Big foot Sanders ruefully Got anything to eat interrupted Stacy Brown For goodness sake boys take your fat friend over to the chuck wagon and fill him up He s like a Mexican steer he ll bed down safer when he s full of supper In the meantime another scene was being enacted off at the Ox Bow ranch a scene that was to add still another chapter to the romance of the trail Tad Butler was sitting alone in the darkness on the steps of the McClure mansion The boy chin in hands was lost in thought Stallings had carried Ruth Brayton in his arms all the way to the ranch where she had soon revived After leaving her the foreman and Colonel McClure had locked themselves in the library where they remained in consultation for more than an hour How is Miss Ruth asked the boy eagerly when Stallings finally came out Better than in many months answered the foreman There was a new note in his voice I m so glad breathed Tad Old man began Stallings slapping Tad on the shoulder come along with me We ll lead our ponies back to camp and talk I presume you are aching to know what all this mystery means laughed the foreman Naturally I am a bit curious admitted Tad It means Pinto that not only have you rendered a great service to mister Miller and his herd but you have done other things as well I ve mixed things up pretty well I guess No You have solved a riddle and made me the happiest man in the Lone Star State Miss Brayton and I have known each other almost since childhood When I was in Yale You a college man exclaimed Tad in surprise Yes We were engaged My people were quite wealthy but in a panic some years ago father lost everything dying soon after Miss Brayton s family then refused their consent to our marriage I determined to seek my fortune in the growing West My full name is Robert Stallings Hamilton though I never had used the middle name until I adopted it when I became a cowboy But to return to Miss Brayton Ruth was taken to Europe and then sent to her uncle here Her trouble preyed on her mind to such an extent that she grew queer She had heard that I was a cattle man somewhere in the West Strangely enough when in her moods she developed a strong antipathy to herds of cattle Whenever a herd was near Ruth would slip from the house and steal away to them in the night A stampede usually followed It s a wonder she wasn t shot Whether or not she caused these intentionally Ruth does not know And that is the mystery asked Tad Yes It is the strangest story I ever heard said the boy quietly What I was about to say is that the herd will go on without me Colonel McClure is sending his own foreman through with it instead Ruth and I are to be married at once and we shall go to my little ranch in Montana In view of the fact that Stallings was severing his connection with the herd Professor Zepplin decided to do likewise Next morning at sunrise Bob Stallings with Miss Ruth by his side both radiantly happy rode out to the camp The Pony Rider Boys had packed their kits and loaded their belongings on their ponies Regretfully they bade good bye to the cowmen Tad s parting with Big foot was most trying In the short time they had been together a strong affection had grown up between the two The plainsman had been quick to perceive Tad s manly qualities and the boy in his turn had been won by the big generous nature of the man They parted each vowing that they must see each other again As the great herd moved slowly northward three cheers were proposed for Bob Stallings and Miss Brayton This the cowboys gave with a will adding a tiger for the Pony Rider Boys The trail wagon pulling out at the same time held a grinning Chinaman huddled in the rear Good bye Pong shouted the lads Allee samee chuckled the cook shaking hands with himself enthusiastically And here for a time we will take leave of the Pony Rider Boys whose further exciting experiences will be chronicled in the next volume entitled The Pony Rider Boys in Montana Or the Mystery of the Old Custer Trail This will be a story of adventure full of absorbing interest and thrilling incidents The reader will then go over the same trails that General Custer rode in the wilder days The End HENRY ALTEMUS COMPANY S CATALOGUE OF The Best and Least Expensive Books For Real Boys and Girls THESE FASCINATING VOLUMES WILL INTEREST
