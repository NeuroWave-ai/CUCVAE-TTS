MANXMAN A NOVEL By Hall Caine SECOND EDITION APPLETON AND COMPANY eighteen ninety four THE MANXMAN PART I BOYS TOGETHER I Old Deemster Christian of Ballawhaine was a hard man hard on the outside at all events They called him Iron Christian and people said Don t turn that iron hand against you Yet his character was stamped with nobleness as well as strength He was not a man of icy nature but he loved to gather icicles about him There was fire enough underneath at which he warmed his old heart when alone but he liked the air to be congealed about his face He was a man of a closed soul One had to wrench open the dark chamber where he kept his feelings but the man who had done that had uncovered his nakedness and he cut him off for ever That was how it happened with his son the father of Philip He had two sons the elder was an impetuous creature a fiery spirit one of the masterful souls who want the restraint of the curb if they are not to hurry headlong into the abyss Old Deemster Christian had called this boy Thomas Wilson after the serene saint who had once been Bishop of Man He was intended however for the law not for the Church The office of Deemster never has been and never can be hereditary yet the Christians of Ballawhaine had been Deemsters through six generations and old Iron Christian expected that Thomas Wilson Christian would succeed him But there was enough uncertainty about the succession to make merit of more value than precedent in the selection and so the old man had brought up his son to the English bar and afterwards called him to practise in the Manx one The young fellow had not altogether rewarded his father s endeavours During his residence in England he had acquired certain modern doctrines which were highly obnoxious to the old Deemster New views on property new ideas about woman and marriage new theories concerning religion always re christened superstition the usual barnacles of young vessels fresh from unknown waters but the old man was no shipwright in harbour who has learnt the art of removing them without injury to the hull The Deemster knew these notions when he met with them in the English newspapers There was something awesome in their effect on his stay at home imagination as of vices confusing and difficult to true men that walk steadily but above all very far off over the mountains and across the sea like distant cities of Sodom only waiting for Sodom s doom And yet lo here they were in a twinkling shunted and shot into his own house and his own stackyard I suppose now he said with a knowing look you think Jack as good as his master No sir said his son gravely generally much better Iron Christian altered his will To his elder son he left only a life interest in Ballawhaine That boy will be doing something he said and thus he guarded against consequences He could not help it he was ashamed but he could not conquer his shame the fiery old man began to nurse a grievance against his son The two sons of the Deemster were like the inside and outside of a bowl and that bowl was the Deemster himself If Thomas Wilson the elder had his father s inside fire and softness Peter the younger had his father s outside ice and iron Peter was little and almost misshapen with a pair of shoulders that seemed to be trying to meet over a hollow chest and limbs that splayed away into vacancy And if Nature had been grudging with him his father was not more kind He had been brought up to no profession and his expectations were limited to a yearly charge out of his brother s property His talk was bitter his voice cold he laughed little and had never been known to cry He had many things against him Besides these sons Deemster Christian had a girl in his household but to his own consciousness the fact was only a kind of peradventure She was his niece the child of his only brother who had died in early manhood Her name was Ann Charlotte de la Tremouille called after the lady of Rushen for the family of Christian had their share of the heroic that is in all men She had fine eyes a weak mouth and great timidity Gentle airs floated always about her and a sort of nervous brightness twinkled over her as of a glen with the sun flickering through Her mother died when she was a child of twelve and in the house of her uncle and her cousins she had been brought up among men and boys One day Peter drew the Deemster aside and told him with expressions of shame interlarded with praises of his own acuteness a story of his brother It was about a girl Her name was Mona Crellin she lived on the hill at Ballure House half a mile south of Ramsey and was daughter of a man called Billy Ballure a retired sea captain and hail fellow well met with all the jovial spirits of the town There was much noise and outcry and old Iron sent for his son What s this I hear he cried looking him down A woman So that s what your fine learning comes to eh Take care sir take care No son of mine shall disgrace himself The day he does that he will be put to the door Thomas held himself in with a great effort Disgrace he said What disgrace sir if you please What disgrace sir repeated the Deemster mocking his son in a mincing treble Then he roared Behaving dishonourably to a poor girl that what s disgrace sir Isn t it enough eh eh More than enough said the young man But who is doing it I m not Then you re doing worse Did I say worse Of course I said worse Worse sir worse Do you hear me Worse You are trapsing around Ballure and letting that poor girl take notions I ll have no more of it Is this what I sent you to England for Aren t you ashamed of yourself Keep your place sir keep your place A poor girl s a poor girl and a Deemster s a Deemster Yes sir said Thomas suddenly firing up and a man s a man As for the shame I need be ashamed of nothing that is not shameful and the best proof I can give you that I mean no dishonour by the girl is that I intend to marry her What You intend to what Did I hear The old Deemster turned his good ear towards his son s face and the young man repeated his threat Never fear No poor girl should be misled by him He was above all foolish conventions Old Iron Christian was dumbfounded He gasped he stared he stammered and then fell on his son with hot reproaches What Your wife Wife That trollop that minx that and daughter of that sot too that old rip that rowdy blatherskite that And my own son is to lift his hand to cut his throat Yes sir cut his throat And I am to stand by No no I say no sir no The young man made some further protest but it was lost in his father s clamour You will though You will Then your hat is your house sir Take to it take to it No need to tell me twice father Away then away to your woman your jade God keep my hands off him The old man lifted his clenched fist but his son had flung out of the room It was not the Deemster only who feared he might lay hands on his own flesh and blood Stop come back you dog Listen I ve not done yet Stop you hotheaded rascal stop Can t you hear a man out then Come back Thomas Wilson come back sir Thomas Thomas Tom Where is he Where s the boy Old Iron Christian had made after his son bareheaded down to the road shouting his name in a broken roar but the young man was gone Then he went back slowly his grey hair playing in the wind He was all iron outside but all father within That day the Deemster altered his will a second time and his elder son was disinherited II Peter succeeded in due course to the estate of Ballawhaine but he was not a lawyer and the line of the Deemsters Christian was broken Meantime Thomas Wilson Christian had been married to Mona Crellin without delay He loved her but he had been afraid of her ignorance afraid also notwithstanding his principles of the difference in their social rank and had half intended to give her up when his father s reproaches had come to fire his anger and to spur his courage As soon as she became his wife he realised the price he had paid for her Happiness could not come of such a beginning He had broken every tie in making the one which brought him down The rich disowned him and the poor lost respect for him It s positively indecent said one It s potatoes marrying herrings said another It was little better than hunger marrying thirst In the general downfall of his fame his profession failed him He lost heart and ambition His philosophy did not stand him in good stead for it had no value in the market to which he brought it Thus day by day he sank deeper into the ooze of a wrecked and wasted life The wife did not turn out well She was a fretful person with a good face a bad shape a vacant mind and a great deal of vanity She had liked her husband a little as a lover but when she saw that her marriage brought her nobody s envy she fell into a long fit of the vapours Eventually she made herself believe that she was an ill used person She never ceased to complain of her fate Everybody treated her as if she had laid plans for her husband s ruin The husband continued to love her but little by little he grew to despise her also When he made his first plunge he had prided himself on indulging an heroic impulse He was not going to deliver a good woman to dishonour because she seemed to be an obstacle to his success But she had never realised his sacrifice She did not appear to understand that he might have been a great man in the island but that love and honour had held him back Her ignorance was pitiful and he was ashamed of it In earning the contempt of others he had not saved himself from self contempt The old sailor died suddenly in a fit of drunkenness at a fair and husband and wife came into possession of his house and property at Ballure This did not improve the relations between them The woman perceived that their positions were reversed She was the bread bringer now One day at a slight that her husband s people had put upon her in the street she reminded him in order to re establish her wounded vanity that but for her and hers he would not have so much as a roof to cover him Yet the man continued to love her in spite of all And she was not at first a degraded being At times she was bright and cheerful and except in the worst spells of her vapours she was a brisk and busy woman The house was sweet and homely There was only one thing to drive him away from it but that was the greatest thing of all Nevertheless they had their cheerful hours together A child was born a boy and they called him Philip He was the beginning of the end between them the iron stay that held them together and yet apart The father remembered his misfortunes in the presence of his son and the mother was stung afresh by the recollection of disappointed hopes The boy was the true heir of Ballawhaine but the inheritance was lost to him by his father s fault and he had nothing Philip grew to be a winsome lad There was something sweet and amiable and big hearted and even almost great in him One day the father sat in the garden by the mighty fuchsia tree that grows on the lawn watching his little fair haired son play at marbles on the path with two big lads whom he had enticed out of the road and another more familiar playmate the little barefooted boy Peter from the cottage by the water trough At first Philip lost and with grunts of satisfaction the big ones promptly pocketed their gains Then Philip won and little curly Peter was stripped naked and his lip began to fall At that Philip paused held his head aside and considered and then said quite briskly Peter hadn t a fair chance that time here let s give him another go The father s throat swelled and he went indoors to the mother and said I think perhaps I m to blame but somehow I think our boy isn t like other boys What do you say Foolish May be so may be so No difference Well no no But deep down in the secret place of his heart Thomas Wilson Christian broken man uprooted tree wrecked craft in the mud and slime began to cherish a fond idea The son would regain all that his father had lost He had gifts and he should be brought up to the law a large nature and he should be helped to develop it a fine face which all must love a sense of justice and a great wealth of the power of radiating happiness Deemster Why not Ballawhaine Who could tell The biggest noblest greatest of all Manxmen God knows Only only he must be taught to fly from his father s dangers Love Then let him love where he can also respect but never outside his own sphere The island was too little for that To love and to despise was to suffer the torments of the damned Nourishing these dreams the poor man began to be tortured by every caress the mother gave her son and irritated by every word she spoke to him Her grammar was good enough for himself and the exuberant caresses of her maudlin moods were even sometimes pleasant but the boy must be degraded by neither The woman did not reach to these high thoughts but she was not slow to interpret the casual byplay in which they found expression Her husband was taiching her son to dis respeck her She wouldn t have thought it of him she wouldn t really But it was always the way when a plain practical woman married on the quality Imperence and dis respeck that s the capers Imperence and disrespeck from the ones that s doing nothing and behoulden to you for everything It was shocking It was disthressing In such outbursts would her jealousy taunt him with his poverty revile him for his idleness and square accounts with him for the manifest preference of the boy He could bear them with patience when they were alone but in Philip s presence they were as gall and wormwood and whips and scorpions Go my lad go he would sometimes whimper and hustle the boy out of the way No the woman would cry stop and see the man your father is And the father would mutter He might see the woman his mother is as well But when she had pinned them together and the boy had to hear her out the man would drop his forehead on the table and break into groans and tears Then the woman would change quite suddenly and put her arms about him and kiss him and weep over him He could defend himself from neither her insults nor her embraces In spite of everything he loved her That was where the bitterness of the evil lay But for the love he bore her he might have got her off his back and been his own man once more He would make peace with her and kiss her again and they would both kiss the boy and be tender and even cheerful Philip was still a child but he saw the relations of his parents and in his own way he understood everything He loved his father best but he did not hate his mother She was nearly always affectionate though often jealous of the father s greater love and care for him and sometimes irritable from that cause alone But the frequent broils between them were like blows that left scars on his body He slept in a cot in the same room and he would cover up his head in the bedclothes at night with a feeling of fear and physical pain A man cannot fight against himself for long That deadly enemy is certain to slay When Philip was six years old his father lay sick of his last sickness The wife had fallen into habits of intemperance by this time and stage by stage she had descended to the condition of an utterly degraded woman There was something to excuse her She had been disappointed in the great stakes of life she had earned disgrace where she had looked for admiration She was vain and could not bear misfortune and she had no deep well of love from which to drink when the fount of her pride ran dry If her husband had indulged her with a little pity everything might have gone along more easily But he had only loved her and been ashamed And now that he lay near to his death the love began to ebb and the shame to deepen into dread He slept little at night and as often as he closed his eyes certain voices of mocking and reproach seemed to be constantly humming in his ears Your son they would cry What is to become of him Your dreams Your great dreams Deemster Ballawhaine God knows what You are leaving the boy who is to bring him up His mother Think of it At last a ray of pale sunshine broke on the sleepless wrestler with the night and he became almost happy I ll speak to the boy he thought I will tell him my own history concealing nothing Yes I will tell him of my own father also God rest him the stern old man severe yet just An opportunity soon befell It was late at night very late The woman was sleeping off a bout of intemperance somewhere below and the boy with the innocence and ignorance of his years in all that the solemn time foreboded was bustling about the room with mighty eagerness because he knew that he ought to be in bed I m staying up to intend on you father said the boy The father answered with a sigh Don t you asturb yourself father I ll intend on you The father s sigh deepened to a moan If you want anything aticular just call me d ye see father And away went the boy like a gleam of light Presently he came back leaping like the dawn He was carrying insecurely a jug of poppy head and camomile which had been prescribed as a lotion Poppy heads father Poppy heads is good I can tell ye Why arn t you in bed child said the father You must be tired No I m not tired father I was just feeling a bit of tired and then I took a smell of poppy heads and away went the tiredness to Jericho They is good The little white head was glinting off again when the father called it back Come here my boy The child went up to the bedside and the father ran his fingers lovingly through the long fair hair Do you think Philip that twenty thirty forty years hence when you are a man aye a big man little one do you think you will remember what I shall say to you now Why yes father if it s anything aticular and if it isn t you can amind me of it can t you father The father shook his head I shall not be here then my boy I am going away Going away father May I come too Ah I wish you could little one Yes truly I almost wish you could Then you ll let me go with you father Oh I am glad father And the boy began to caper and dance to go down on all fours and leap about the floor like a frog The father fell back on his pillow with a heaving breast Vain vain What was the use of speaking The child s outlook was life his own was death they had no common ground they spoke different tongues And after all how could he suffer the sweet innocence of the child s soul to look down into the stained and scarred chamber of his ruined heart You don t understand me Philip I mean that I am going to die Yes darling and only that I am leaving you behind I should be glad to go My life has been wasted Philip In the time to come when men speak of your father you will be ashamed Perhaps you will not remember then that whatever he was he was a good father to you for at least he loved you dearly Well I must needs bow to the will of God but if I could only hope that you would live to restore my name when I am gone Philip are you don t cry my darling There there kiss me We ll say no more about it then Perhaps it s not true although father tolded you Well perhaps not And now undress and slip into bed before mother comes See there s your night dress at the foot of the crib Wants some buttons does it Never mind in with you that s a boy Impossible impossible And perhaps unnecessary Who should say Young as the child was he might never forget what he had seen and heard Some day it must have its meaning for him Thus the father comforted himself Those jangling quarrels which had often scorched his brain like iron the memory of their abject scenes came to him then with a sort of bleeding solace Meanwhile with little catching sobs which he struggled to repress the boy lay down in his crib When half way gone towards the mists of the land of sleep he started up suddenly and called Good night father and his father answered him Good night Towards three o clock the next morning there was great commotion in the house The servant was scurrying up and downstairs and the mistress wringing her hands was tramping to and fro in the sick room crying in a tone of astonishment as if the thought had stolen upon her unawares Why he s going How didn t somebody tell me before The eyes of the sinking man were on the crib Philip he faltered They lifted the boy out of his bed and brought him in his night dress to his father s side and the father twisted about and took him into his arms still half asleep and yawning Then the mother recovering from the stupidity of her surprise broke into paroxysms of weeping and fell over her husband s breast and kissed and kissed him For once her kisses had no response The man was dying miserably for he was thinking of her and of the boy Sometimes he babbled over Philip in a soft inarticulate gurgle sometimes he looked up at his wife s face with a stony stare and then he clung the closer to the boy as if he would never let him go The dark hour came and still he held the boy in his arms They had to release the child at last from his father s dying grip The dead of the night was gone by this time and the day was at the point of dawn the sparrows in the eaves were twittering and the tide which was at its lowest ebb was heaving on the sand far out in the bay with the sound as of a rookery awakening Philip remembered afterwards that his mother cried so much that he was afraid and that when he had been dressed she took him downstairs where they all ate breakfast together with the sun shining through the blinds The mother did not live to overshadow her son s life Sinking yet lower in habits of intemperance she stayed indoors from week end to week end seated herself like a weeping willow by the fireside and drank and drank Her excesses led to delusions She saw ghosts perpetually To avoid such of them as haunted the death room of her husband she had a bed made up on a couch in the parlour and one morning she was found face downwards stretched out beside it on the floor Then Philip s father s cousin always called his Aunty Nan came to Ballure House to bring him up His father had been her favourite cousin and in spite of all that had happened he had been her lifelong hero also A deep and secret tenderness too timid to be quite aware of itself had been lying in ambush in her heart through all the years of his miserable life with Mona At the death of the old Deemster her other cousin Peter had married and cast her off But she was always one of those woodland herbs which are said to give out their sweetest fragrance after they have been trodden on and crushed Philip s father had been her hero her lost one and her love and Philip was his father s son III Little curly Pete with the broad bare feet the tousled black head the jacket half way up his back like a waistcoat with sleeves and the hole in his trousers where the tail of his shirt should have been was Peter Quilliam and he was the natural son of Peter Christian In the days when that punctilious worthy set himself to observe the doings of his elder brother at Ballure he found it convenient to make an outwork of the hedge in front of the thatched house that stood nearest Two persons lived in the cottage father and daughter Tom Quilliam usually called Black Tom and Bridget Quilliam getting the name of Bridget Black Tom The man was a short gross creature with an enormous head and a big open mouth showing broken teeth that were black with the juice of tobacco The girl was by common judgment and report a gawk a great slow eyed comely looking comfortable easy going gawk Black Tom was a thatcher and with his hair poking its way through the holes in his straw hat he tramped the island in pursuit of his calling This kept him from home for days together and in that fact Peter Christian while shadowing the morality of his brother found his own opportunity When the child was born neither the thatcher nor his daughter attempted to father it Peter Christian paid twenty pounds to the one and eighty to the other in Manx pound notes the boys daubed their door to show that the house was dishonoured and that was the end of everything The girl went through her censures silently or with only one comment She had borrowed the sheet in which she appeared in church from Miss Christian of Ballawhaine and when she took it back the good soul of the sweet lady thought to improve the occasion I was wondering Bridget she said gravely what you were thinking of when you stood with Bella and Liza before the congregation last Sunday morning two other Magda lenes had done penance by Bridget s side Deed mistress said the girl I was thinkin there wasn t a sheet at one of them to match mine for whiteness I d a been ashamed to be seen in the like of theirs Bridget may have been a gawk but she did two things which were not gawkish Putting the eighty greasy notes into the foot of an old stocking she sewed them up in the ticking of her bed and then christened her baby Peter The money was for the child if she should not live to rear him and the name was her way of saying that a man s son was his son in spite of law or devil After that she kept both herself and her child by day labour in the fields weeding and sowing potatoes and following at the tail of the reapers for sixpence a day dry days and fourpence all weathers She might have badgered the heir of Ballawhaine but she never did so That person came into his inheritance got himself elected member for Ramsey in the House of Keys married Nessy Taubman daughter of the rich brewer and became the father of another son Such were the doings in the big house down in the valley while up in the thatched cottage behind the water trough on potatoes and herrings and barley bonnag lived Bridget and her little Pete Pete s earliest recollections were of a boy who lived at the beautiful white house with the big fuchsia by the turn of the road over the bridge that crossed the glen This was Philip Christian half a year older than himself although several inches shorter with long yellow hair and rosy cheeks and dressed in a velvet suit of knickerbockers Pete worshipped him in his simple way hung about him fetched and carried for him and looked up to him as a marvel of wisdom and goodness and pluck His first memory of Philip was of sleeping with him snuggled up by his side in the dark hushed and still in a narrow bed with iron ends to it and of leaping up in the morning and laughing Philip s father a tall white gentleman who never laughed at all and only smiled sometimes had found him in the road in the evening waiting for his mother to come home from the fields that he might light the fire in the cottage and running about in the meantime to keep himself warm and not too hungry His second memory was of Philip guiding him round the drawing room over thick carpets on which his bare feet made no noise and showing him the pictures on the walls and telling him what they meant One an engraving of saint John with a death s head and a crucifix was according to this grim and veracious guide a picture of a brigand who killed his victims and always skinned their skulls with a cross handled dagger After that his memories of Philip and himself were as two gleams of sunshine which mingle and become one Philip was a great reader of noble histories He found them frayed and tattered at the bottom of a trunk that had tin corners and two padlocks and stood in the room looking towards the harbour where his mother s father the old sailor had slept One of them was his special favourite and he used to read it aloud to Pete It told of the doings of the Carrasdhoo men They were a bold band of desperadoes the terror of all the island Sometimes they worked in the fields at ploughing and reaping and stacking the same as common practical men and sometimes they lived in houses just like the house by the water trough But when the wind was rising in the nor nor west and there was a taste of the brine on your lips they would be up and say The sea s calling us we must be going Then they would live in rocky caves of the coast where nobody could reach them and there would be fires lit at night in tar barrels and shouting and singing and carousing and after that there would be ships rudders and figure heads and masts coming up with the tide and sometimes dead bodies on the beach of sailors they had drowned only foreign ones though hundreds and tons of them But that was long ago the Carrasdhoo men were dead and the glory of their day was departed One quiet evening after an awesome reading of this brave history Philip sitting on his haunches at the gable with Pete like another white frog beside him said quite suddenly Hush What s that I wonder said Pete There was never a sound in the air above the rustle of a leaf and Pete s imagination could carry him no further Pete said Philip with awful gravity the sea s calling me And me said Pete solemnly Early that night the two lads were down at the most desolate part of Port Mooar in a cave under the scraggy black rocks of Gobny Garvain kindling a fire of gorse and turf inside the remains of a broken barrel See that tremendous sharp rock below low water said Philip Don t I though said Pete There was never a rock the size of a currycomb between them and the line of the sky That s what we call a reef said Philip Wait a bit and you ll see the ships go splitting on top of it like like Like a tay pot said Pete We ll save the women though said Philip Shall we save the women Pete We always do Aw yes the women and the boys said Pete thoughtfully Philip had his doubts about the boys but he would not quarrel It was nearly dark and growing very cold The lads croodled down by the crackling blaze and tried to forget that they had forgotten tea time We never has to mind a bit of hungry said Philip stoutly Never a ha p orth said Pete Only when the job s done we have hams and flitches and things for supper Aw yes ateing and drinking to the full Rum Pete we always drinks rum We has to said Pete None of your tea said Philip Coorse not none of your ould grannie s two penny tay said Pete It was quite dark by this time and the tide was rising rapidly There was not a star in the sky and not a light on the sea except the revolving light of the lightship far a Way The boys crept closer together and began to think of home Philip remembered Aunty Nan When he had stolen away on hands and knees under the parlour window she had been sewing at his new check night shirt A night shirt for a Carrasdhoo man had seemed to be ridiculous then but where was Aunty Nannie now Pete remembered his mother she would be racing round the houses and crying and he had visions of Black Tom he would be racing round also and swearing Shouldn t we sing something Phil said Pete with a gurgle in his throat Sing said Philip with as much scorn as he could summon and give them warning we re watching for them Well you are a pretty mister Pete But just you wait till the ships goes wrecking on the rocks I mean the reefs and the dead men s coming up like corks hundreds and ninety and dozens of them my jove yes then you ll hear me singing The darkness deepened and the voice of the sea began to moan through the back of the cave the gorse crackled no longer and the turf burned in a dull red glow Night with its awfulness had come down and the boys were cut off from everything They don t seem to be coming not yet said Philip in a husky whisper Maybe it s the same as fishing said Pete sometimes you catch and sometimes you don t That s it said Philip eagerly generally you don t and then you both haves to go home and come again he added nervously But neither of the boys stirred Outside the glow of the fire the blackness looked terrible Pete nuzzled up to Philip s side and being untroubled by imaginative fears soon began to feel drowsy The sound of his measured breathing startled Philip with the terror of loneliness Honour bright mister Pete he faltered nudging the head on his shoulder and trying to keep his voice from shaking you call yourself a second mate and leaving all the work to me The second mate was penitent but in less than half a minute more he was committing the same offence again It isn t no use he said I m that sleepy you never seen Then let s both take the watch below i stead said Philip and they proceeded to stretch themselves out by the fire together Just lave it to me said Pete I ll hear them if they come in the night I ll always does I m sleeping that light it s shocking Why sometimes I hear Black Tom when he comes home tipsy I ve done it times We ll have carpets to lie on to morrow not stones said Philip wriggling on a rough one rolls of carpets kidaminstrel ones They settled themselves side by side as close to each other as they could creep and tried not to hear the surging and sighing of the sea Then came a tremulous whimper Pete What s that Don t you never say your prayers when you take the watch below Sometimes we does when mother isn t too tired and the ould man s middling drunk and quiet Then don t you like to then Aw yes though I m liking it scandalous The wreckers agreed to say their prayers and got up again and said them knee to knee with their two little faces to the fire and then stretched themselves out afresh Pete where s your hand Here you are Phil In another minute under the solemn darkness of the night broken only by the smouldering fire amid the thunderous quake of the cavern after every beat of the waves on the beach the Carrasdhoo men were asleep Sometime in the dark reaches before the dawn Pete leapt up with a start What s that he cried in a voice of fear But Philip was still in the mists of sleep and feeling the cold he only whimpered Cover me up Pete Phil cried Pete in an affrighted whisper Cover me up drawled Philip I thought it was Black Tom said Pete There was some confused bellowing outside the cave My goodness grayshers came in a terrible voice it s them though the pair of them Impozzible who says it s impozzible It s themselves I m telling you ma m Guy heng The woman s mad putting a scream out of herself like yonder Safe Coorse they re safe bad luck to the young wastrels You re for putting up a prayer for your own one Eh Well I m for hommering mine The dirts Weaned only yesterday and fetching a dacent man out of his bed to find them A fire at them too Well it was the fire that found them Pull the boat up boys Philip was half awake by this time They ve come he whispered The ships is come they re on the reef Oh dear me Best go and meet them P raps they won t kill us if if we Oh dear me Then the wreckers hand in hand quaking and whimpering stepped out to the mouth of the cave At the next moment Philip found himself snatched up into the arms of Aunty Nan who kissed him and cried over him and rammed a great chunk of sweet cake into his cheek Pete was faring differently Under the leathern belt of Black Tom who was thrashing him for both of them he was howling like the sea in a storm Thus the Carrasdhoo men came home by the light of early morning Pete skipping before the belt and bellowing and Philip holding a piece of the cake at his teeth to comfort him IV Philip left home for school at King William s by Castletown and then Pete had a hard upbringing His mother was tender enough and there were good souls like Aunty Nan to show pity to both of them But life went like a springless bogey nevertheless Sin itself is often easier than simpleness to pardon and condone It takes a soft heart to feel tenderly towards a soft head Poor Pete s head seemed soft enough and to spare No power and no persuasion could teach him to read and write He went to school at the old schoolhouse by the church in Maughold village The schoolmaster was a little man called John Thomas Corlett pert and proud with the sharp nose of a pike and the gait of a bantam John Thomas was also a tailor On a cowhouse door laid across two school forms he sat cross legged among his cloth his maidens and his smoothing irons with his boys and girls class by class in a big half circle round about him The great little man had one standing ground of daily assault on the dusty jacket of poor Pete and that was that the lad came late to school Every morning Pete s welcome from the tailor schoolmaster was a volley of expletives and a swipe of the cane across his shoulders The craythur The dunce The durt I m taiching him and taiching him and he won t be taicht The soul of the schoolmaster had just two human weaknesses One of these was a weakness for drink and as a little vessel he could not take much without being full Then he always taught the Church catechism and swore at his boys in Manx Peter Quilliam he cried one day who brought you out of the land of Egypt and the house of bondage Deed master said Pete I never was in no such places for I never had the money nor the clothes for it and that s how stories are getting about The second of the schoolmaster s frailties was love of his daughter a child of four a cripple whom he had lamed in her infancy by letting her fall as he tossed her in his arms while in drink The constant terror of his mind was lest some further accident should befall her Between class and class he would go to a window from which when he had thrown up its lower sash dim with the scratches of names he could see one end of his own white cottage and the little pathway between lines of gilvers coming down from the porch Pete had seen the little one hobbling along this path on her lame leg and giggling with a heart of glee when she had eluded the eyes of her mother and escaped into the road One day it chanced after the heavy spring rains had swollen every watercourse that he came upon the little curly poll tumbling and tossing like a bell buoy in a gale down the flood of the river that runs to the sea at Port Mooar Pete rescued the child and took her home and then as if he had done nothing unusual he went on to school dripping water from his legs at every step When John Thomas saw him coming in bare feet triddle traddle triddle traddle up the school house floor his indignation at the boy for being later than usual rose to fiery wrath for being drenched as well Waiting for no explanation concluding that Pete had been fishing for crabs among the stones of Port Lewaigue he burst into a loud volley of his accustomed expletives and timed and punctuated them by a thwack of the cane between every word The waistrel thwack The dirt thwack I m taiching him thwack and taiching him thwack and he won t be taicht Thwack thwack thwack Pete said never a word Boiling his stinging shoulders under his jacket and ramming his smarting hands like wet eels into his breeches pockets he took his place in silence at the bottom of the class But a girl a little dark thing in a red frock stepped out from her place beside the boy shot up like a gleam to the schoolmaster as he returned to his seat among the cloth and needles dealt him a smart slap across the face and then burst into a lit of hysterical crying Her name was Katherine Cregeen She was the daughter of Caesar the Cornaa miller the founder of Ballajora Chapel and a mighty man among the Methodists Katherine went unpunished but that was the end of Pete s schooling His learning was not too heavy for a big lad s head to carry a bit of reading if it was all in print and no writing at all except half a dozen capital letters It was not a formidable equipment for the battle of life but Bridget would not hear of more She herself meanwhile had annexed that character which was always the first and easiest to attach itself to a woman with a child but no visible father for it the character of a witch That name for his mother was Pete s earliest recollection of the high road and when the consciousness of its meaning came to him he did not rebel but sullenly acquiesced for he had been born to it and knew nothing to the contrary If the boys quarrelled with him at play the first word was your mother s a butch Then he cried at the reproach or perhaps fought like a vengeance at the insult but he never dreamt of disbelieving the fact or of loving his mother any the less Bridget was accused of the evil eye Cattle sickened in the fields and when there was no proof that she had looked over the gate the idea was suggested that she crossed them as a hare One day a neighbour s dog started a hare in a meadow where some cows were grazing This was observed by a gang of boys playing at hockey in the road Instantly there was a shout and a whoop and the boys with their sticks were in full chase after the yelping dog crying The butch The butch It s Bridget Tom Corlett s dogs are hunting Bridget Black Tom Kill her Laddie Kill her Sailor Jump dog jump One of the boys playing at hockey was Pete When his play fellows ran after the dogs in their fanatic thirst he ran too but with a storm of other feelings Outstripping all of them very close at the heels of the dogs kicking some striking others with the hockey stick while the tears poured down his cheeks he cried at the top of his voice to the hare leaping in front Run mammy run clink dodge mammy clink Aw mammy mammy run faster run for your life run The hare dodged aside shot into a thicket and escaped its pursuers just as Corlett the farmer who had heard the outcry came racing up with a gun Then Pete swept his coat sleeve across his gleaming eyes and leapt off home When he got there he found his mother sitting on the bink by the door knitting quietly He threw himself into her arms and stroked her cheek with his hand Oh mammy bogh he cried how well you run If you never run in your life you run then Is the boy mad said Bridget But Pete went on stroking her cheek and crying between sobs of joy I heard Corlett shouting to the house for a gun and a fourpenny bit and I thought I was never going to see mammy no more But you did clink mammy You did though The next time Katherine Cregeen saw Peter Quilliam he was sitting on the ridge of rock at the mouth of Ballure Glen playing doleful strains on a home made whistle and looking the picture of desolation and despair His mother was lying near to death He had left missus Cregeen Kath erine s mother a good soul getting the name of Grannie to watch and tend her while he came out to comfort his simple heart in this lone spot between the land and the sea Katherine s eyes filled at sight of him and when without looking up or speaking he went on to play his crazy tunes something took the girl by the throat and she broke down utterly Never mind Pete No I don t mean that but don t cry Pete Pete was not crying at all but only playing away on his whistle and gazing out to sea with a look of dumb vacancy Katherine knelt beside him put her arms around his neck and cried for both of them Somebody hailed him from the hedge by the water trough and he rose took off his cap smoothed his hair with his hand and walked towards the house without a word Bridget was dying of pleurisy brought on by a long day s work at hoeing turnips in a soaking rain doctor Mylechreest had poulticed her lungs with mustard and linseed but all to no purpose It s feeling the same as the sun on your back at harvest she murmured yet the poultices brought no heat to her frozen chest Caesar Cregeen was at her side John the Clerk too called John the Widow Kelly the rural postman who went by the name of Kelly the Thief as well as Black Tom her father Caesar was discoursing of sinners and their latter end John was remembering how at his election to the clerkship he had rashly promised to bury the poor for nothing Kelly was thinking he would be the first to carry the news to Christian Balla whaine and Black Tom was varying the exercise of pounding rock sugar for his bees with that of breaking his playful wit on the dying woman No use I m laving you I m going on my long journey said Bridget while Granny used a shovel as a fan to relieve her gusty breathing Got anything in your pocket for the road woman said the thatcher It s not houses of bricks and mortal I m for calling at now she answered Dear heart Put up a bit of a prayer whispered Grannie to her husband and Caesar took a pinch of snuff out of his waistcoat pocket and fell to wrastling with the Lord Bridget seemed to be comforted I see the jasper gates she panted fixing her hazy eyes on the scraas under the thatch from which broken spiders webs hung down like rats tails Then she called for Pete She had something to give him It was the stocking foot with the eighty greasy Manx banknotes which his father Peter Christian had paid her fifteen years before Pete lit the candle and steadied it while Grannie cut the stocking from the wall side of the bed ticking Black Tom dropped the sugar pounder and exposed his broken teeth in his surprise at so much wealth John the Widow blinked and Kelly the Thief poked his head forward until the peak of his postman s cap fell on to the bridge of his nose A sea fog lay over the land that morning and when it lifted Bridget s soul went up as well Poor thing Poor thing said Grannie The ways were cold for her cold cold A dacent lass said John the Clerk and oughtn t to be buried with the common trash seeing she s left money A hard working woman too and on her feet for ever but lowanced in her intellecks for all said Kelly And Caesar cried A brand plucked from the burning Lord give me more of the like at the judgment When all was over and tears both hot and cold were wiped away Pete shed none of them the neighbours who had stood with the lad in the churchyard on Maughold Head returned to the cottage by the water trough to decide what was to be done with his eighty good bank notes It s a fortune said one Let him put it with mister Dumbell said another Get the boy a trade first he s a big lump now sixteen for spring said a third A draper eh said a fourth May I presume My nephew Bobbie Clucas of Ramsey now A dacent man very said John the Widow but if I m not ambitious there s my son in law John Cowley The lad s cut to a dot for a grocer and what more nicer than having your own shop and your own name over the door if you plaze Peter Quilliam tay and sugar merchant they re telling me John will be riding in his carriage and pair soon Chut your grannie and your carriage and pairs shouted a rasping voice at last It was Black Tom Who says the fortune is belonging to the lad at all It s mine and if there s law in the land I ll have it Meanwhile Pete with the dull thud in his ears of earth falling on a coffin had made his way down to Ballawhaine He had never been there before and he felt confused but he did not tremble Half way up the carriage drive he passed a sandy haired youth of his own age a slim dandy who hummed a tune and looked at him carelessly over his shoulder Pete knew him he was Boss the boys called him Dross son and heir of Christian Ballawhaine At the big house Pete asked for the master The English footman in scarlet knee breeches left him to wait in the stone hall The place was very quiet and rather cold but all as clean as a gull s wing There was a dark table in the middle and a high backed chair against the wall Two oil pictures faced each other from opposite sides One was of an old man without a beard but with a high forehead framed around with short grey hair The other was of a woman with a tired look and a baby on her lap Under this there was a little black picture that seemed to Pete to be the likeness of a fancy tombstone And the print on it so far as Pete could spell it out was that of a tombstone too In loving memory of Verbena beloved wife of Peter Chr The Ballawhaine came crunching the sand on the hall floor He looked old and had now a pent house of bristly eyebrows of a different colour from his hair Pete had often seen him on the road riding by Well my lad what can I do for you he said He spoke in a jerky voice as if he thought to overawe the boy Pete fumbled his stocking cap Mothers dead he answered vacantly The Ballawhaine knew that already Kelly the Thief had run hot foot to inform him He thought Pete had come to claim maintenance now that his mother was gone So she s been telling you the same old story he said briskly At that Pete s face stiffened all at once She s been telling me that you re my father sir The Ballawhaine tried to laugh Indeed he replied it s a wise child now that knows its own father I m not rightly knowing what you mane sir said Pete Then the Ballawhaine fell to slandering the poor woman in her grave declaring that she could not know who was the father of her child and protesting that no son of hers should ever see the colour of money of his Saying this with a snarl he brought down his right hand with a thump on to the table There was a big hairy mole near the joint of the first finger Aisy sir if you plaze said Pete she was telling me you gave her this He turned up the corner of his jersey tugged out of his pocket from behind his flaps the eighty Manx bank notes and held them in his right hand on the table There was a mole at the joint of Pete s first finger also The Ballawhaine saw it He drew back his hand and slid it behind him Then in another voice he said Well my lad isn t it enough What are you wanting with more I m not wanting more said Pete I m not wanting this Take it back and he put down the roll of notes between them The Ballawhaine sank into the chair took a handkerchief out of his tails with the hand that had been lurking there and began to mop his forehead Eh How What d ye mean boy he stammered I mane said Pete that if I kept that money there is people would say my mother was a bad woman and you bought her and paid her I m hearing the like at some of them He took a step nearer And I mane too that you did wrong by my mother long ago and now that she s dead you re blackening her and you re a bad heart and a low tongue and if I was only a man and didn t know you were my father I d break every bone in your skin Then Pete twisted about and shouted into the dark part of the hall Come along there my ould cockatoo It s time to be putting me to the door The English footman in the scarlet breeches had been peeping from under the stairs That was Pete s first and last interview with his father Peter Christian Ballawhaine was a terror in the Keys by this time but he had trembled before his son like a whipped cur V Katherine Cregeen Pete s champion at school had been his companion at home as well She was two years younger than Pete Her hair was a black as a gipsy s and her face as brown as a berry In summer she liked best to wear a red frock without sleeves no boots and no stockings no collar and no bonnet not even a sun bonnet From constant exposure to the sun and rain her arms and legs were as ruddy as her cheeks and covered with a soft silken down So often did you see her teeth that you would have said she was always laughing Her laugh was a little saucy trill given out with head aside and eyes aslant like that of a squirrel when he is at a safe height above your head and has a nut in his open jaws Pete had seen her first at school and there he had tried to draw the eyes of the maiden upon himself by methods known only to heroes to savages and to boys He had prowled around her in the playground with the wild vigour of a young colt tossing his head swinging his arms screwing his body kicking up his legs walking on his hands lunging out at every lad that was twice as big as himself and then bringing himself down at length with a whoop and a crash on his hindmost parts just in front of where she stood For these tremendous efforts to show what a fellow he could be if he tried he had won no applause from the boys and Katherine herself had given no sign though Pete had watched her out of the corners of his eyes But in other scenes the children came together After Philip had gone to King William s Pete and Katherine had become bosom friends Instead of going home after school to cool his heels in the road until his mother came from the fields he found it neighbourly to go up to Ballajora and round by the network of paths to Cornaa That was a long detour but Caesar s mill stood there It nestled down in the low bed of the river that runs through the glen called Ballaglass Song birds built about it in the spring of the year and Caesar s little human songster sang there always When Pete went that way home what times the girl had of it Wading up the river clambering over the stones playing female Blondin on the fallen tree trunks that spanned the chasm slipping falling holding on any way up legs or arms by the rotten branches below then calling for Pete s help in a voice between a laugh and a cry flinging chips into the foaming back wash of the mill wheel and chasing them down stream racing among the gorse and then lying full length like a lamb without a thought of shame while Pete took the thorns out of her bleeding feet She was a wild duck in the glen where she lived and Pete was a great lumbering tame duck waddling behind her But the glorious happy make believe days too soon came to an end The swinging cane of the great John Thomas Corlett and the rod of a yet more relentless tyrant darkened the sunshine of both the children Pete was banished from school and Catherine s father removed from Cornaa When Caesar had taken a wife he had married Betsy the daughter of the owner of the inn at Sulby After that he had got religion and he held that persons in the household of faith were not to drink or to buy or to sell drink But Grannie s father died and left his house The Manx Fairy and his farm Glenmooar to her and her husband About the same time the miller at Sulby also died and the best mill in the island cried out for a tenant Caesar took the mill and the farm and Grannie took the inn being brought up to such profanities and no way bound by principle From that time forward Caesar pinned all envious cavillers with the text which says Not that which goeth into the mouth of a man defileth him but that which cometh out Nevertheless Caesar s principles grew more and more puritanical year by year There were no half measures with Caesar Either a man was a saved soul or he was in the very belly of hell though the pit might not have shut its mouth on him If a man was saved he knew it and if he felt the manifestations of the Spirit he could live without sin His cardinal principles were three instantaneous regeneration assurance and sinless perfection He always said he had said it a thousand times that he was converted in Douglas marketplace a piece off the west door of ould saint Matthew s at five and twenty minutes past six on a Sabbath evening in July when he was two and twenty for harvest While at Cornaa Caesar had been a local on the preachers plan a class leader and a chapel steward but at Sulby he outgrew the Union and set up a body of his own He called them The Christians a title that was at once a name a challenge and a protest They worshipped in the long barn over Caesar s mill and held strong views on conduct A saved soul must not wear gold or costly apparel or give way to softness or bodily indulgence or go to fairs for sake of sport or appear in the show tents of play actors or sing songs or read books or take any diversion that did not tend to the knowledge of God As for carnal transgression if any were guilty of it they were to be cut off from the body of believers for the souls of the righteous must be delivered The religion that s going among the Primitives these days is just Popery said Caesar Let s go back to the warm ould Methodism and put out the Romans When Pete turned his face from Ballawhaine he thought first of Caesar and his mill It would be more exact to say he thought of Katherine and Grannie He was homeless as well as penniless The cottage by the water trough was no longer possible to him now that the mother was gone who had stood between his threatened shoulders and Black Tom Philip was at home for a few weeks only in the year and Ballure had lost its attraction So Pete made his way to Sulby offered himself to Caesar for service at the mill and was taken on straightway at eighteenpence a week and his board It was a curious household he entered into First there was Caesar himself in a moleskin waistcoat with sleeves open three buttons up knee breeches usually unlaced stockings of undyed wool and slippers with the tongues hanging out a grim soul with whiskers like a hoop about his face and a shaven upper lip as heavy as a moustache for when religion like Caesar s lays hold of a man it takes him first by the mouth Then Grannie a comfortable body in a cap with an outlook on life that was all motherhood a simple tender peaceable soul agreeing with everybody and everything and seeming to say nothing but Poor thing Poor thing and Dear heart Dear heart Then there was Nancy Cain getting the name of Nancy Joe the servant in name but the mistress in fact a niece of Grannie s a bit of a Pagan an early riser a tireless worker with a plain face a rooted disbelief in all men a good heart an ugly tongue and a vixenish temper Last of all there was Katherine now grown to be a great girl with her gipsy hair done up in a red ribbon and wearing a black pinafore bordered with white braid Pete got on steadily at the mill He began by lighting the kiln fire and cleaning out the pit wheel and then on to the opening the flood gates in the morning and regulating the action of the water wheel according to the work of the day In two years time he was a sound miller safe to trust with rough stuff for cattle or fine flour for white loaf bread Caesar trusted him He would take evangelising journeys to Peel or Douglas and leave Pete in charge That led to the end of the beginning Pete could grind the farmers corn but he could not make their reckonings He kept his counts in chalk on the back of the mill house door a down line for every stone weight up to eight stones and a line across for every hundredweight Then once a day while the father was abroad Katherine came over from the inn to the desk at the little window of the mill and turned Pete s lines into ledger accounts These financial councils were full of delicious discomfiture Pete always enjoyed them after they were over John Robert Molleycarane did you say Molleycarane Pete Oh Mylecharane Myle c h a r a i n e Molleycarane ten stones did you say ten Oh eight e i g h t no eight oatmeal Pete Oh barley male meal I mean m e a l In the middle of the night Pete remembered all these entries They were very precious to his memory after Katherine had spoken them They sang in his heart the same as song birds then They were like hymns and tunes and pieces of poetry Caesar returned home from a preaching tour with a great and sudden thought He had been calling on strangers to flee from the wrath to come and yet there were those of his own house whose faces were not turned Zionwards That evening he held an all night prayer meeting for the conversion of Katherine and Pete Through six long hours he called on God in lusty tones until his throat cracked and his forehead streamed The young were thoughtless they had the root of evil in them they flew into frivolity from contrariness Draw the harrow over their souls plough the fallows of their hearts grind the chaff out of their household let not the sweet apple and the crabs grow on the same bough together give them a Melliah let not a sheaf be forgotten grant them the soul of this girl for a harvest home and of this boy for a last stook Caesar was dissatisfied with the results He was used to groaning and trembling and fainting fits Don t you feel the love he cried I do here under the watch pocket of my waistcoat Towards midnight Katherine began to fail Chain the devil cried Caesar Once I was down in the pit with the devil myself but now I m up in the loft seeing angels through the thatch Can t you feel the workings of the Spirit As the clock was warning to strike two Katherine thought she could and from that day forward she led the singing of the women in the choir among The Christians Pete remained among the unregenerate but nevertheless The Christians saw him constantly He sat on the back form and kept his eyes fixed on the singing seat Observing his regularity Caesar laid a hand on his head and told him the Spirit was working in his soul at last Sometimes Pete thought it was and that was when he shut his eyes and listened to Katherine s voice floating up up up like an angel s into the sky But sometimes he knew it was not and that was when he caught himself in the middle of Caesar s mightiest prayers crooking his neck past the pitching bald pate of Johnny Niplightly the constable that he might get a glimpse of the top of Katherine s bonnet when her eyes were down Pete fell into a melancholy and once more took to music as a comforter It was not a home made whistle now but a fiddle bought out of his wages On this he played in the cowhouse on winter evenings and from the top of the midden outside in summer When Caesar heard of it his wrath was fearful What was a fiddler He was a servant of corruption holding a candle to disorderly walkers and happy sinners on their way into the devil s pinfold And what for was fiddles Fiddles was for play actors and theaytres And theaytres is there said Caesar indicating with his foot one flag on the kitchen floor and hell flames is there he added rolling his toe over to the joint of the next one Grannie began to plead What was a fiddle if you played the right tunes on it Didn t they read in the ould Book of King David himself playing on harps and timbrels and such things And what was harps but fiddles in a way of spak ing Then warn t they all looking to be playing harps in heaven Deed yes though the Lord would have to be teaching her how to play hers Caesar was shaken Well of course certainly he said if there s a power in fiddling to bring souls out of bondage and if there s going to be fiddling and the like in Abraham s bosom why then of course well why not let s have the lad s fiddle up at The Christians Nothing could have suited Pete so well From that time forward he went out no more at nights to the cowhouse but stayed indoors to practise hymns with Katherine Oh the terrible rapture of those nightly practices They brought people to the inn to hear them and so Caesar found them good for profit both ways There was something in Caesar s definition nevertheless It was found that among the saints there were certain weaker brethren who did not want a hymn to their ale One of these was Johnny Niplightly the rural constable who was the complement of Katherine in the choir being leader of the singing among the men He was a tall man with a long nose which seemed to have a perpetual cold Making his rounds one night he turned in at The Manx Fairy when Caesar and Grannie were both from home and Nancy Joe was in charge and Pete and Katherine were practising a revival chorus Where s Caesar dough he snuffled At Peel buying the stock snapped Nancy Dank de Lord I mean where s Grannie Nursing Mistress Quiggin Niplightly eased the strap of his beaver liberated his lips took a deep draught of ale and then turned to Pete with apologetic smiles and suggested a change in the music At that Katherine leapt up as light as laughter A dance she cried a dance Good sakes alive said Nancy Joe Listen to the girl Is it the moon Kitty or what is it that s doing on you Shut your eyes Nancy said Katherine just for once now won t you You can do what you like with me with your coaxing and woaxing said Nancy Enjoy yourself to the full girl but don t make a noise above the singing of the kettle Pete tuned his strings and Katherine pinned up the tail of her skirt and threw herself into position At the sound of the livelier preludings there came thronging out of the road into the parlour certain fellows of the baser sort and behind them came one who was not of that denomination a fair young man with a fine face under an Alpine hat Heeding nothing of this audience the girl gave a little rakish toss of her head and called on Pete to strike up Then Pete plunged into one of the profaner tunes which he had practised in the days of the cowhouse and off went Katherine with a whoop The boys stood back for her bending down on their haunches as at a fight of gamecocks and encouraging her with shouts of applause Beautiful Look at that now Fine though fine Clane done aw clane Done to a dot There s leaping for you boys Guy heng did you ever see the like Hommer the floor girl higher a piece higher then Whoop did ye ever see such a nate pair of ankles Hould your dirty tongue you gobmouthed omathaun cried Nancy Joe She had tried to keep her eyes away but could not My goodness grayshers she cried Did you ever see the like though Screwing like the windmill on the schoolhouse Well well Kitty woman Aw Kirry Kirry Wherever did she get it then Goodsakes the girl s twisting herself into knots Pete was pulling away at the fiddle with both hands like a bottom sawyer his eyes dancing his lips quivering the whole soul of the lad lifted out of himself in an instant Hould on still Kate hould on girl he shouted Ma chree Machree The darling s dancing like a drumstick Faster cried Kate Faster The red ribbon had fallen from her head and the wavy black hair was tumbling about her face She was holding up her skirt with one hand and the other arm was akimbo at her waist Guggling chuckling crowing panting boiling and bubbling with the animal life which all her days had been suppressed and famished and starved into moans and groans she was carried away by her own fire gave herself up to it and danced on the flags of the kitchen which had served Caesar for his practical typology like a creature intoxicated with new breath Meantime Caesar himself coming home in his chapel hat his tall black beaver from Peel where he had been buying the year s stock of herrings at the boat s side had overtaken on the road the venerable parson of his parish Parson Quiggin of Lezayre Drawing up the gig with a Woa he had invited the old clergyman to a lift by his side on the gig s seat which was cushioned with a sack of hay The parson had accepted the invitation and with a preliminary Aisy Your legs a taste higher sir just to keep the pickle off your trousers a Gee up and a touch of the whip they were away together with the light of the gig lamp on the hind quarters of the mare as they bobbed and screwed like a mill race under the splash hoard It was Caesar s chance and he took it Having pinned one of the heads of the Church he gave him his views on the Romans and on the general encroachment of Popery The parson listened complacently He was a tolerant old soul with a round face expressive of perpetual happiness though he was always blinking his little eyes and declaring with the Preacher that all earthly things were vain Hence he was nicknamed Old Vanity of Vanities The gig had swept past Sulby Chapel when Caesar began to ask for the parson s opinion of certain texts And may I presume Pazon Quiggin what d ye think of the text Praise the Lord O my soul and all that is within me praise His Holy Name A very good text after meat mister Cregeen said the parson blinking his little eyes in the dark It was Caesar s favourite text and his fire was kindled at the parson s praise Man alive he cried his hot breath tickling the parson s neck I ve praiched on that text pazon till it s wet me through to the waistcoat They were near to The Manx Fairy by this time And talking of praise said Caesar I hear them there at their practices Asking pardon now it s proud I d be sir perhaps you d not be thinking mane to come in and hear the way we do Crown Him So the saints use the fiddle said the parson as the gig drew up at the porch of the inn Half a minute afterwards the door of the parlour flew open with a bang and Caesar stood and glared on the threshold with the parson s ruddy face behind him There was a moment s silence The uplifted toe of Katherine trailed back to the ground the fiddle of Pete slithered to his farther side and the smacking lips of Niplightly transfixed themselves agape Then the voice of the parson was heard to say Vanity vanity all is vanity and suddenly Caesar still on the threshold went down on his knees to pray Caesar s prayer was only a short one His mortified pride called for quicker solace Rising to his feet with as much dignity as he could command under the twinkling eyes of the parson he stuttered The capers Making a dacent house into a theaytre Respectable person too one of the first that s going So facing the spectators just help yourselves home the pack of you As for these ones turning on Kate Pete and the constable there ll be no more of your practices I ll do without the music of three saints like you In future I ll have three sinners to raise my singing These polices too he said with a withering smile Niplightly was worming his way out at the back of Parson Quiggin Who began it shouted Caesar looking at Katherine From the moment that Caesar dropped on his knees at the door Pete had been well nigh choked by an impulse to laugh aloud But now he bit his lip and said I did Behould ye now as imperent as a goat said Caesar working his eyebrows vigorously You ve mistaken your profession boy It s a play actorer they ought to be making of you You re wasting your time with a plain respectable man like me You must lave me Away to the loft for your chiss boy And just give sheet my lad and don t lay to till you ve fetched up at another lodgings Pete with his eye on the parson s face could control himself no longer and he laughed so loud that the room rang Right s the word ould Nebucannezzar he cried and heaved up to his feet So long Kitty woman S long We ll finish it another night though and then the ould man himself will be houlding the candle Outside in the road somebody touched him on the shoulder It was the young man in the Alpine hat My gough What Phil cried Pete and he laid hold of him with both hands at once I ve just finished at King William s and bought a boat said Philip and I came up to ask you to join me congers and cods you know good fun anyway Are you willing Willing cried Pete Am I jumping for joy And away they went down the road swinging their legs together with a lively step That s a nice girl though Kitty Kate what do you call her said Phil Were you in then So you saw her dancing said Pete eagerly Aw yes nice he said warmly nice uncommon he added absently and then with a touch of sadness shocking nice Presently they heard the pattering of light feet in the darkness behind them and a voice like a broken cry calling Pete It was Kate She came up panting and catching her breath in hiccoughs took Pete s face in both her hands drew it down to her own face kissed it on the mouth and was gone again without a word VI Philip had not been a success at school he had narrowly escaped being a failure During his earlier years he had shown industry without gifts during his later years he had shown gifts without industry His childish saying became his by word and half in sport half in earnest with a smile on his lips and a shuddering sense of fascination he would say when the wind freshened The sea s calling me I must be off The blood of the old sea dog his mother s father was strong in him Idleness led to disaster and disaster to some disgrace He was indifferent to both while at school but shame found him out at home You ll be sixteen for spring said Auntie Nan and what would your poor father say if he were alive He thought worlds of his boy and always said what a man he would be some day That was the shaft that found Philip The one passion that burned in his heart like a fire was reverence for the name and the will of his dead father The big hopes of the broken man had sometimes come as a torture to the boy when the blood of the old salt was rioting within him But now they came as a spur Philip went back to school and worked like a slave There were only three terms left and it was too late for high honours but the boy did wonders He came out well and the masters were astonished After all they said there s no denying it the boy Christian must have the gift of genius There s nothing he might not do If Phil had much of the blood of Captain Billy Pete had much of the blood of Black Tom After leaving the mill at Sulby Pete made his home in the cabin of the smack What he was to eat and how he was to be clothed and where he was to be lodged when the cold nights came never troubled his mind for an instant He had fine times with his partner The terms of their partnership were simple Phil took the fun and made Pete take the fish They were a pair of happy go lucky lads and they looked to the future with cheerful faces There was one shadow over their content and that was the ghost of a gleam of sunshine It made daylight between them though day by day as they ran together like two that run a race The prize was Katherine Cregeen Pete talked of her till Phil s heart awoke and trembled but Phil hardly knew it was so and Pete never once suspected it Neither confessed to the other and the shifts of both to hide the secret of each were boyish and beautiful There is a river famous for trout that rises in Sulby glen and flows into Ramsey harbour One of the little attempts of the two lads to deceive each other was to make believe that it was their duty to fish this river with the rod and so wander away singly up the banks of the stream until they came to The Manx Fairy and then drop in casually to quench the thirst of so much angling Towards the dusk of evening Philip in a tall silk hat over a jacket and knickerbockers would come upon Pete by the Sulby bridge washed combed and in a collar Then there would be looks of great surprise on both sides What Phil Is it yourself though Just thought I d see if the trouts were biting to night Dear me this is Sulby too And bless my soul The Fairy again I Well a drop of drink will do no harm Shall we put a sight on them inside eh After that prelude they would go into the house together This little comedy was acted every night for weeks It was acted on Hollantide Eve six months after Pete had been turned out by Caesar Grannie was sitting by the glass partition knitting at intervals serving at the counter occasionally and scoring up on a black board that was a mass of chalk hieroglyphics Caesar himself in ponderous spectacles and with a big book in his hands was sitting in the kitchen behind with his back to the glass so as to make the lamp of the business serve also for his studies On a bench in the bar sat Black Tom smoking spitting scraping his feet on the sanded floor and looking like a gigantic spider with enormous bald head At his side was a thin man with a face pitted by smallpox and a forehead covered with strange protuberances This was Jonaique Jelly barber clock mender and Manx patriot The postman was there too Kelly the Thief a tiny creature with twinkling ferret eyes and a face that had a settled look of age as of one born old being wrinkled in squares like the pointing of a cobble wall At sight of Pete Grannie made way and he pushed through to the kitchen where he seated himself in a seat in the fireplace just in front of the peat closet and under the fish hanging to smoke At sight of Phil she dropped her needles smoothed her front hair rose in spite of protest and wiped down a chair by the ingle Caesar eyed Pete in silence from between the top rim of his spectacles and the bottom edge of the big book but as Philip entered he lowered the book and welcomed him Nancy Joe was coming and going in her clogs like a rip rap let loose between the dairy and a pot of potatoes in their jackets which swung from the slowrie the hook over the fire A moment later Kate came flitting through the half lit kitchen her black eyes dancing and her mouth rippling in smiles She courtesied to Philip grimaced at Pete and disappeared Then from the other side of the glass partition came the husky voice of the postman saying Well I must be taking the road gentlemen There s Manx ones starting for Kim berley by the early sailing to morrow morning And then came the voice of the barber in a hoarse falsetto Kimberley That s the place for good men I m always saying There s Billy the Red back home with a fortune And ould Corlett look at ould Corlett the Ballabeg Five years away at the diggings and left a house worth twenty pounds per year per annum not to spake of other hereditaments After that the rasping voice of Black Tom in a tone of irony and contempt Of coorse aw yes of coorse there s goold on the cushags there they re telling me But I thought you were a man that s all for the island mister Jelly Lave me alone for that said the voice of the barber Manx land for the Manx man that s the text I m houlding to But what s it saying Custom must be indulged with custom or custom will die And with these English scouring over it like puffins on the Calf it isn t much that s left of the ould island but the name The best of the Manx boys are going away foreign same as these ones Well I ve letters for them to the packet office anyway said the postman Who are they mister Kelly called Philip through the doorway Some of the Quarks ones from Glen Rushen sir and the Gills boys from Castletown over Good night all goodnight The door closed behind the postman and Black Tom growled Slips of lads I know them Smart though smart uncommon said the barber that s the only sort they re wanting out yonder There was a contemptuous snort So You d better go to Kimberley yourself then Turn the clock back a piece and I ll start before you ve time to curl your hair said the barber Black Tom was lifting his pot That s the one thing said he the Almighty Himself gulp gulp can t do Which tittered the barber Both said Black Tom scratching his big head as bald as a bladder Caesar flashed about with his face to the glass partition You re like the rest of the infidels sir said he only spaking to contradick yourself calling God the Almighty and telling in the same breath of something He can t do Meanwhile an encounter of another sort was going on at the ingle Kate had re appeared with a table fork which she used at intervals to test the boiling of the potatoes At each approach to the fire she passed close to where Pete sat never looking at Phil above the level of his boots And as often as she bent over the pot Pete put his arm round her waist being so near and so tempting For thus pestering her she beat her foot like a goat and screwed on a look of anger which broke down in a stifled laugh but she always took care to come again to Pete s side rather than to Phil s until at last the nudging and shoving ended in a pinch and a little squeal and a quick cry of What s that from Caesar Kate vanished like a flash the dim room began to frown again and Phil to draw his breath heavily when the girl came back as suddenly bringing an apple and a length of string Mounting a chair she fixed one end of the string to the lath of the ceiling by the peck the parchment oatcake pan and the other end she tied to the stalk of the apple What s the jeel now said Pete Fancy Don t you know Not heard f Hop tu naa It s Hollantide Eve man said Kate Then setting the string going like a pendulum she stood back a pace with hands clasped behind her and snapped at the apple as it swung sometimes catching it sometimes missing it sometimes marking it sometimes biting it her body bending and rising with its waggle and nod and bob her mouth opening and closing her white teeth gleaming and her whole face bubbling over with delight At every touch the speed increased and the laughter grew louder as the apple went faster Everybody except the miller joined in the fun Phil cried out on the girl to look to her teeth but Pete egged her on to test the strength of them Snap at it Kitty cried Pete Aw lost Lost again Ow One in the cheek No matter Done And Black Tom and mister Jelly stood up to watch through the doorway My goodness grayshers cried one What a mouthful said the other Share it Kitty woman aw share and share alike you know But then came the thunderous tones of Caesar Drop it drop it Such practices is nothing but Popery Popery cried Black Tom from over the counter Chut nonsense man The like of it was going before saint Patrick was born Kate was puffing and panting and taking down the pendulum What does it mean then Tom she said it s you for knowing things Mane It manes fairies Fairies Black Tom sat down with a complacent air and his rasping voice came from the other side of the glass In the ould times gone by girl before Manxmen got too big for their breeches they d be off to bed by ten o clock on Hollantide Eve to lave room for the little people that s outside to come in And the big woman of the house would be filling the crocks for the fairies to drink and the big man himself would be raking the ashes so they might bake their cakes and a girl same as you would be going to bed backwards I know I know cried Kate near to the ceiling and clapping her hands She eats a roasted apple and goes to bed thirsty and then dreams that somebody brings her a drink of water and that s the one that s to be her husband eh You ve got it girl Caesar had been listening with his eyes turned sideways off his book and now he cried Then drop it I m telling you It s nothing but instruments of Satan and the ones that s telling it are just flying in the face of faith from superstition and contrariety It isn t dacent in a Christian public house and I m for having no more of it Grannie paused in her knitting fixed her cap with one of her needles and said Dear heart father Tom meant no harm Then glancing at the clock and rising But it s time to shut up the house anyway Good night Tom Good night all Good night Phil and Pete rose also Pete went to the door and pretended to look out then came back to Kate s side and whispered Come give them the slip there s somebody outside that s waiting for you Let them wait said the girl but she laughed and Pete knew she would come Then he turned to Philip A word in your ear Phil he said and took him by the arm and drew him out of the house and round to the yard of the stable Well good night Grannie said mister Jelly going out behind them But if I were as young as your grandson there mister Quilliam I would be making a start for somewhere Grandson grunted Tom heaving up I ve got no grandson or he wouldn t be laving me to smoke a dry pipe But he s making an Almighty of this Phil Christian that s it After they were gone Grannie began counting the till and saying As for fairies one two three it may be as Caesar says four five the like isn t in but it s safer to be civil to them anyway Aw yes said Nancy Joe a crock of fresh water and a few good words going to bed on Hollantide Eve does no harm at all at all Outside in the stable yard the feet of Black Tom and Jonaique Jelly were heard going off on the road The late moon was hanging low red as an evening sun over the hill to the south east Pete was puffing and blowing as if he had been running a race Quick boy quick he was whispering Kate s coming A word in your ear first Will you do me a turn Phil What is it said Philip Spake to the ould man for me while I spake to the girl What about said Philip But Pete could hear nothing except his own voice The ould angel herself she s all right but the ould man s hard Spake for me Phil you ve got the fine English tongue at you But what about Philip said again Say I may be a bit of a rip but I m not such a bad sort anyway Make me out a taste Phil and praise me up Say I ll be as good as goold yes will I though Tell him he has only to say yes and I ll be that studdy and willing and hardworking and persevering you never seen But Pete Pete Pete whatever am I to say all this about Pete s puffing and panting ceased What about Why about the girl for sure The girl said Philip What else said Pete Kate Am I to speak for you to the father for Kate Philip s voice seemed to come up from the bottom depths of his throat Are you thinking hard of the job Phil There was a moment s silence The blood had rushed to Philip s face which was full of strange matter but the darkness concealed it I didn t say that he faltered Pete mistook Philip s hesitation for a silent commentary on his own unworthiness I know I m only a sort of a waistrel he said but Phil the way I m loving that girl it s shocking I can never take rest for thinking of her No I m not sleeping at night nor working reg lar in the day neither Everything is telling of her and everything is shouting her name It s Kate in the sea and Kate in the river and the trees and the gorse Kate Kate Kate it s Kate constant and I can t stand much more of it I m loving the girl scandalous that s the truth Phil Pete paused but Philip gave no sign It s hard to praise me that s sarten sure said Pete but I ve known her since she was a little small thing in pinafores and I was a slip of a big boy and went into trousers and we played Blondin in the glen together Still Philip did not speak He was gripping the stable wall with his trembling fingers and struggling for composure Pete scraped the paving stones at his feet and mumbled again in a voice that was near to breaking Spake for me Phil It s you to do it You ve the way of saying things and making them out to look something It would be clane ruined in a jiffy if I did it for myself Spake for me boy now won t you now Still Philip was silent He was doing his best to swallow a lump in his throat His heart had begun to know itself In the light of Pete s confession he had read his own secret To give the girl up was one thing it was another to plead for her for Pete But Pete s trouble touched him The lump at his throat went down and the fingers on the wall slacked away I ll do it he said only his voice was like a sob Then he tried to go off hastily that he might hide the emotion that came over him like a flood that had broken its dam But Pete gripped him by the shoulder and peered into his face in the dark You will though said Pete with a little shout of joy then it s as good as done God bless you old fellow Philip began to roll about Tut it s nothing he said with a stout heart and then he laughed a laugh with a cry in it He could have said no more without breaking down but just then a flash of light fell on them from the house and a hushed voice cried Pete It s herself whispered Pete She s coming She s here Philip turned and saw Kate in the doorway of the dairy the sweet young figure framed like a silhouette by the light behind I m going said Philip and he edged up to the house as the girl stepped out Pete followed him a step or two in approaching Kate Whist man he whispered Tell the old geezer I ll be going to chapel reglar early tides and late shifts and Sunday school constant And whist tell him I m larning myself to play on the harmonia Then Philip slithered softly through the dairy door and shut it after him leaving Kate and Pete together VII The kitchen of The Manx Fairy was now savoury with the odour of herrings roasting in their own brine and musical with the crackling and frizzling of the oil as it dropped into the fire It s a long way back to Ballure missus Cregeen said Philip popping his head in at the door jamb May I stay to a bite of supper Aw stay and welcome said Caesar putting down the big book and Nancy Joe said the same dropping her high pitched voice perceptibly and Grannie said also Right welcome sir if you ll not be thinking mane to take pot luck with us Potatoes and herrings mister Christian just a Manxman s supper Lift the pot off the slowrie Nancy Well and isn t he a Manxman himself mother said Caesar Of course I am mister Cregeen said Philip laughing noisily If I m not who should be eh And Manxman or no Manxman what for should he turn up his nose at herrings same as these said Nancy Joe She was dishing up a bowlful Where ll he get the like of them Not in England over I ll go bail Indeed no Nancy said Philip still laughing needlessly And if they had them there the poor useless creatures would be lost to cook them Deed would they Nancy said Grannie She was rolling the potatoes into a heap on to the bare table And we ve much to be thankful for with potatoes and herrings three times a day but we shouldn t be thinking proud of our selves for that Ask the gentleman to draw up mother said Caesar Draw up sir draw up Here s your bowl of butter milk A knife and fork Nancy We re no people for knife and fork to a herring sir And a plate for mister Christian woman a gentleman usually likes a plate Now ate sir ate and welcome but where s your friend though Pete oh he s not far off Saying this Philip interrupted his laughter to distribute sage winks between Nancy Joe and Grannie Caesar looked around with a potato half peeled in his fingers And the girl where s Kate he asked She s not far off neither said Philip still winking vigorously But don t trouble about them mister Cregeen They ll want no supper They re feeding on sweeter things than herrings even Saying this he swallowed a gulp with another laugh Caesar lifted his head with a pinch of his herring between finger and thumb half way to his open mouth Were you spaking sir he said At that Philip laughed immoderately It was a relief to drown with laughter the riot going on within Aw dear what s agate of the boy thought Grannie Is it a dog bite that s working on him thought Nancy Speaking cried Philip of course I m speaking I ve come in to do it mister Cregeen I ve come in to speak for Pete He s fond of your daughter Caesar and wants your good will to marry her Lord a massy cried Nancy Joe Dear heart alive muttered Grannie Peter Quilliam said Caesar did you say Peter I did mister Cregeen Peter Quilliam said Philip stoutly my friend Pete a rough fellow perhaps and without much education but the best hearted lad in the island Come now Caesar say the word sir and make the young people happy He almost foundered over that last word but Caesar kept him up with a searching look Why I picked him out of the streets as you might say said Caesar So you did mister Cregeen so you did I always thought you were a discerning man Caesar What do you say Grannie It s Caesar for knowing a deserving lad when he sees one eh He gave another round of his cunning winks and Grannie replied Aw well it s nothing against either of them anyway Caesar was gitting as straight as a crowbar and as grim as a gannet And when he left me he gave me imperence and disrespeck But the lad meant no harm father said Grannie and hadn t you told him to take to the road Let every bird hatch its own eggs mother it ll become you better said Caesar Yes sir the lip of Satan and the imperence of sin Pete cried Philip in a tone of incredulity why he hasn t a thought about you that isn t out of the Prayer book Caesar snorted No Then maybe that s where he s going for his curses No curses at all said Nancy Joe from the side of the table but a right good lad though and you ve never had another that s been a patch on him Caesar screwed round to her and said severely Where there s geese there s dirt and where there s women there s talking Then turning back to Philip he said in a tone of mock deference And may I presume sir a little question being a thing like that s general understood what s his fortune Philip fell back in his chair Fortune Well I didn t think that you now No said Caesar We re not children of Israel in the wilderness getting manna dropped from heaven twice a day If it s only potatoes and herrings itself we re wanting it three times you see Do what he would to crush it Philip could not help feeling a sense of relief Fate was interfering the girl was not for Pete For the first moment since he returned to the kitchen he breathed freely and fully But then came the prick of conscience he had come to plead for Pete and he must be loyal he must not yield he must exhaust all his resources of argument and persuasion The wild idea occurred to him to take Caesar by force of the Bible But think what the old book says mister Cregeen take no thought for the morrow That s what Johnny Niplightly said mister Christian when he lit my kiln overnight and burnt my oats before morning But consider the lilies I have considered them sir but I m foiling still and mother has to spin And isn t Pete able to toil too said Philip boldly Nobody better in the island there s not a lazy bone in his body and he ll earn his living anywhere What is his living sir said Caesar Philip halted for an answer and then said Well he s only with me in the boat at present mister Cregeen And what s he getting His meat and drink and a bit of pence eh And you ll be selling up some day it s like and going away to England over and then where is he Let the girl marry a mother naked man at once But you re wanting help yourself father said Grannie Yes you are though and time for chapel too and aisement in your old days Give the lad my mill as well as my daughter is that it eh said Caesar No I m not such a goose as yonder either I could get heirs sir heirs bless ye fifty acres and better not to spake of the bas es But I can do without them The Lord s blest me with enough I m not for daubing grease on the tail of the fat pig Just so Caesar said Philip just so you can afford to take a poor man for your son in law and there s Pete I d be badly in want of a bird though to give a groat for an owl said Caesar The lad means well anyway said Grannie and he was that good to his mother poor thing it was wonderful I knew the woman said Caesar I broke a sod of her grave myself A brand plucked from the burning but not a straight walker in this life And what is the lad himself A monument of sin without a name A bastard what else And that s not the port I m sailing for Down to this point Philip had been torn by conflicting feelings He was no match for Caesar in worldly logic or at fencing with texts of Scripture The devil had been whispering at his ear Let it alone you d better But his time had come at length to conquer both himself and Caesar Rising to his feet at Caesar s last word he cried in a voice of wrath What You call yourself a Christian man and punish the child for the sin of the parent No name indeed Let me tell you mister Caesar Cregeen it s possible to have one name in heaven that s worse than none at all on earth and that s the name of a hypocrite So saying he threw back his chair and was making for the door when Caesar rose and said softly Come into the bar and have something Then looking back at Philip s plate he forced a laugh and said But you ve turned over your herring sir that s bad luck And putting a hand on Philip s shoulder he added in a lower tone No disrespeck to you sir and no harm to the lad but take my word for it mister Christian if there s an amble in the mare it ll be in the colt Philip went off without another word The moon was rising and whitening as he stepped from the door Outside the porch a figure flitted past him in the uncertain shadows with a merry trill of mischievous laughter He found Pete in the road puffing and blowing as before but from a different cause The living devil s in the girl for sartin said Pete I can t get my answer out of her either way He had been chasing her for his answer and she had escaped him through a gate But what luck with the ould man Phil Then Phil told him of the failure of his mission told him plainly and fully but tenderly softening the hard sayings but revealing the whole truth As he did so he was conscious that he was not feeling like one who brings bad news He knew that his mouth in the darkness was screwed up into an ugly smile and do what he would he could not make it straight and sorrowful The happy laughter died off Pete s lips and he listened at first in silence and afterwards with low growls When Phil showed him how his poverty was his calamity he said Ay ay I m only a wooden spoon man When Phil told him how Caesar had ripped up their old dead quarrel he muttered I m on the ebby tide Phil that s it And when Phil hinted at what Caesar had said of his mother and of the impediment of his own birth a growl came up from the very depths of him and he scraped the stones under his feet and said He shall repent it yet yes shall he Come don t take it so much to heart it s miserable to bring you such bad news said Phil but he knew the sickly smile was on his lips still and he hated himself for the sound of his own voice Pete found no hollow ring in it God bless you Phil he said you ve done the best for me I know that My pocket s as low as my heart and it isn t fair to the girl or I shouldn t be asking the ould man s lave anyway He stood a moment in silence crunching the wooden laths of the garden fence like matchwood in his fingers and then said with sudden resolution I know what I ll do What s that said Philip I ll go abroad I ll go to Kimberley Never Yes will I though and quick too You heard what the men were saying in the evening there s Manx ones going by the boat in the morning Well I ll go with them And you talk of being low in your pocket said Phil Why it will take all you ve got man And more too said Pete but you ll lend me the lave of the passage money That s getting into debt but no matter When a man falls into the water he needn t mind the rain I ll make good money out yonder A light had appeared at the window of an upper room and Pete shook his clenched fist at it and cried Good bye Master Cregeen I ll put worlds between us You were my master once but nobody made you my master for ever neither you nor no man All this time Philip knew that hell was in his heart The hand that had let him loose when his anger got the better of him with Caesar was clutching at him again Some evil voice at his ear was whispering Let him go lend him the money Come on Pete he faltered and don t talk nonsense But Pete heard nothing He had taken a few steps forward as far as to the stable yard and was watching the light in the house It was moving from window to window of the dark wall She s taking the father s candle he muttered She s there he said softly No she has gone She s coming back though He lifted the stocking cap from his head and fumbled it in his hands God bless her he murmured He sank to his knees on the ground And take care of her while I m away The moon had come up in her whiteness behind and all was quiet and solemn around Philip fell back and turned away his face VIII When Caesar came in after seeing Philip to the door he said Not a word of this to the girl You that are women are like pigs we ve got to pull the way we don t want you On that Kate herself came in blushing a good deal and fussing about with great vigour Are you talking of the piggies father she said artfully How tiresome they are to be sure They came out into the yard when the moon rose and I had such work to get them back Caesar snorted a little and gave the signal for bed Fairies indeed he said in a tone of vast contempt going to the corner to wind the clock Just wakeness of faith he said over the clank of the chain as the weights rose and no trust in God neither he added and then the clock struck ten Grannie had lit two candles one for herself and her husband the other for Nancy Joe Nancy had slyly filled three earthenware crocks with water from the well and had set them on the table mumbling something about the kettle and the morning And Caesar himself pretending not to see anything and muttering dark words about waste went from the clock to the hearth and raked out the hot ashes to a flat surface on which you might have laid a girdle for baking cakes Good night Nancy called Grannie from half way up the stairs and Caesar with his head down followed grumbling Nancy went off next and then Kate was left alone She had to put out the lamp and wait for her father s candle When the lamp was gone the girl was in the dark save for the dim light of the smouldering fire She began to tremble and to laugh in a whisper Her eyes danced in the red glow of the dying turf She slipped off her shoes and went to a closet in the wall There she picked an apple out of a barrel and brought it to the fire and roasted it Then down on her knees before the hearth she took took two pinches of the apple and swallowed them After that and a little shudder she rose again and turned about to go to bed backwards slowly tremblingly with measured steps feeling her way past the furniture having a shock when she touched anything and laughing to herself nervously when she remembered what it was At the door of her father s room and Grannie s she called with a quaver in her voice and a sleepy grunt came out to her She reached one hand through the door which was ajar and took the burning candle Then she blew out the light with a trembling puff that had to be twice repeated and made for her own bedroom still going backwards It was a sweet little chamber over the dairy smelling of new milk and ripe apples and very dainty in dimity and muslin Two tiny windows looked out from it one on to the stable yard and the other on to the orchard The late moon came through the orchard window over the heads of the dwarf trees and the little white place was lit up from the floor to the sloping thatch Kate went backwards as far as to the bed and sat down on it She fancied she heard a step in the yard but the yard window was at her back and she would not look behind She listened but heard nothing more except a see sawing noise from the stable where the mare was running her rope in the manger ring Nothing but this and the cheep cheep of a mouse that was gnawing the wood somewhere in the floor Will he come she asked herself She rose and loosened her gown and as it fell to her feet she laughed Which will it be I wonder which she whispered The moonlight had crept up to the foot of the bed and now lay on it like a broad blue sword speckled as with rust by the patchwork counterpane She freed her hair from its red ribbon and it fell in a shower about her face All around her seemed hushed and awful She shuddered again and with a back ward hand drew down the sheets Then she took a long deep breath like a sigh that is half a smile and lay down to sleep IX Somewhere towards the dawn in the vague shadow land between a dream and the awakening Kate thought she was startled by a handful of rice thrown at her carriage on her marriage morning The rattle came again and then she knew it was from gravel dashed at her bedroom window As she recognised the sound a voice came as through a cavern crying Kate She was fully awake by this time Then it s to be Pete she thought It s bound to be Pete it s like she told herself It s himself outside anyway It was Pete indeed He was standing in the thin darkness under the window calling the girl s name out of the back of his throat and whistling to her in a sort of whisper Presently he heard a movement inside the room and he said over his shoulder She s coming There was the click of a latch and the slithering of a sash and then out through the little dark frame came a head like a picture with a face all laughter crowned by a cataract of streaming black hair and rounded off at the throat by a shadowy hint of the white frills of a night dress Kate said Pete again She pretended to have come to the window merely to look out and like a true woman she made a little start at the sound of his voice and a little cry of dismay at the idea that he was so close beneath and had taken her unawares Then she peered down into the gloom and said in a tone of wondrous surprise It must be Pete surely And so it is Kate said Pete and he couldn t take rest without spaking to you once again Ah she said looking back and covering her eyes and thinking of Black Tom and the fairies But suddenly the mischief of her sex came dancing into her blood and she could not help but plague the lad Have you lost your way Pete she asked with an air of innocence Not my way but myself woman said Pete Lost yourself Have the lad s wits gone moon raking I wonder Are you witched then Pete she inquired with vast solemnity Aw witched enough Kate Poor fellow sighed Kate Did she strike you unknown and sudden Unknown it was Kirry and sudden too Listen though Aw dear aw dear Was it old missus Cowley of the Curragh Did she turn into a hare Is it bitten you ve been Pete Aw yes bitten enough But Kate Then it was a dog it s like Is it flying from the water you are Pete No but flying to the water woman Kate I say Is it burning they re doing for it Burning and freezing both Will you hear me though I m going away hundreds and thousands of miles away Then from the window came a tone of great awe uttered with face turned upward as if to the last remaining star Poor boy Poor boy it s bitten he is for sure Then it s yourself that s bitten me Kirry There was a little crow of gaiety Me Am I the witch You called me a fairy in the road this evening A fairy you are girl and a witch too but listen now You said I was an angel though at the cowhouse gable and an angel doesn t bite Then she barked like a dog and laughed a shrill laugh like a witch and barked again But Pete could bear no more Go on then go on with your capers Go on he cried in a voice of reproach It s not a heart that s at you at all girl but only a stone You see a man going away from the island From the island Kate gasped Middling down in the mouth too and plagued out of his life between the ruck of you continued Pete but God forgive you all you can t help it Did you say you were going out of the island Pete Coorse I did but what s the odds Africa Kimberley the Lord knows where Kimberley Not Kimberley Pete Kimberley or Timbuctoo what s it matter to the like of you A man s coming up in the morning to bid you good bye before an early sailing and you re thinking of nothing but your capers and divilments It s you to know what a girl s thinking isn t it mister Pete And why are you flying in my face for a word Flying I m not flying It s driven I am Driven Pete Driven away by them that s thinking I m not fit for you Well that s true enough but they shan t be telling me twice They Who are they Pete What s the odds Flinging my mother at me too poor little mother And putting the bastard on me it s like A respectable man s girl isn t going begging that she need marry a lad without a name There was a sudden ejaculation from the window sash Who dared to say that No matter Whoever they are you can tell them if it s me they mean that name or no name when I want to marry I ll marry the man I like If I thought that now Kitty As for you mister Pete that s so ready with your cross words you can go to your Kimberley Yes go and welcome and what s more what s more But the voice of anger in the half light overhead broke down suddenly into an inarticulate gurgle Why what s this said Pete in a flurry You re not crying though Kate Whatever am I saying to you Kitty woman Here here bash me on the head for a blockhead and an omathaun And Pete was clambering up the wall by the side of the dairy window Get down then whispered Kate Her wrath was gone in a moment and Pete being nearer to her now could see tears of laughter dancing in her eyes Get down Pete or I ll shut the window I will yes I will And to show how much she was in earnest in getting out of his reach she shut up the higher sash and opened the lower one Darling cried Pete Hush What s that Kate whispered and drew back on her knees Is the door of the pig sty open again said Pete Kate drew a breath of relief It s only somebody snoring she said The ould man said Pete That s all serene A good ould sheepdog that snaps more than he bites but he s best when he s sleeping more safer anyway What s the good of going away Pete said Kate You d have to make a fortune to satisfy father Others have done it Kitty why shouldn t I Manx ones too silver kings and diamond kings and the Lord knows what No fear of me When I come back it s a queen you ll be woman my queen anyway with pigs and cattle and a girl to wash and do for you So that s how you d bribe a poor girl is it But you d have to turn religious or father would never consent When I come home again Kitty I ll be that religious you never seen I ll be just rolling in it You ll hear me spaking like the Book of Genesis and Abraham and his sons and his cousins I ll be coming up at night making love to you at the cowhouse door like the Acts of the Apostles Well that will be some sort of courting anyway But who says I ll be wanting it Who says I m willing for you to go away at all with the notion that I must be bound to marry you when you come back I do said Pete stoutly Oh indeed sir Listen I ll be working like a nigger out yonder and making my pile and banking it up and never seeing nothing but the goold and the girls My goodness What do you say Aw never fear I m a one woman man Kate but loving one is giving me eyes for all And you ll be waiting for me constant and never giving a skute of your little eye to them drapers and druggists from Ramsey Not one of them Not Jamesie Corrin even he s a nice boy is Jamesie That dandy divil with the collar Hould your capers woman Nor young Ballawhaine Ross Christian you know Ross Christian be well no but honour bright you ll be saying Peter s coming I must be thrue So I ve got my orders sir eh It s all settled then is it Hadn t you better fix the wedding day and take out the banns now that your hand is in I have got nothing to do with it seemingly Nobody asks me Whist woman cried Pete Don t you hear it A cuckoo was passing over the house and calling It s over the thatch Kate Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo Three times Bravo Three times is a good Amen Omen is it Have it as you like love The stars had paled out by this time and the dawn was coming up like a grey vapour from the sea Ugh the air feels late I must be going in said Kate Only a bit of a draught from the mountains it s not morning yet said Pete A bird called from out of the mist somewhat far away It is though That s the throstle up the glen said Kate Another bird answered from the eaves of the house And what s that said Pete Was it yourself Kitty How straight your voice is like the throstle s She hung her head at the sweet praise but answered tartly How people will be talking A dead white light came sweeping over the front of the house and the trees and the hedges all quiet until then began to shudder Kate shuddered too and drew the frills closer about her throat I m going Pete she whispered Not yet It s only a taste of the salt from the sea said Pete The moon s not out many minutes Why you goose it s been gone these two hours This isn t Jupiter where it s moonlight always Always moonlight in Jubiter is it said Pete My goodness What coorting there must be there A cock crowed from under the hen roost the dog barked indoors and the mare began to stamp in her stall When do you sail Pete First tide seven o clock Time to be off then Good bye Hould hard a word first Not a word I m going back to bed See there s the sun coming up over the mountains Only a touch of red on the tip of ould Cronky s nose Listen Just to keep them dandy divils from plaguing you I ll tell Phil to have an eye on you while I m away mister Christian Call him Philip Kate He s as free as free No pride at all Let him take care of you till I come back I m shutting the window Pete Wait Something else Bend down so the ould man won t hear I can t reach what is it Your hand then I ll tell it to your hand She hesitated a moment and then dropped her hand over the window sill and he clutched at it and kissed it and pushed back the white sleeve and ran up the arm with his lips as far as he could climb Another my girl take your time one more half a one then She drew her arm back until her hand got up to his hand and then she said What s this The mole on your finger still Pete You called me a witch now see me charm it away Listen Ping ping prash Cur yn cadley jiargan ass my chass She was uttering the Manx charm in a mock solemn ululation when a bough snapped in the orchard and she cried What s that It s Philip He s waiting under the apple tree said Pete My goodness me said Kate and down went the window sash A moment later it rose again and there was the beautiful young face in its frame as before but with the rosy light of the dawn on it Has he been there all the while she whispered What matter It s only Phil Good bye Good luck and then the window went down for good Time to go said Philip still in his tall silk hat and his knickerbockers He had been standing alone among the dead brown fern the withering gorse and the hanging brambles gripping the apple tree and swallowing the cry that was bubbling up to his throat but forcing himself to look upon Pete s happiness which was his own calamity though it was tearing his heart out and he could hardly bear it The birds were singing by this time and Pete going back sang and whistled with the best of them X In the mists of morning Grannie had awakened in her bed with the turfy scraas of the thatch just visible above her and the window blind like a hazy moon floating on the wall at her side And fixing her nightcap she had sighed and said I can t close my eyes for dreaming that the poor lad has come to his end untimeously Caesar yawned and asked What lad Young Pete of course said Grannie Caesar umpht and grunted We were poor ourselves when we began father Grannie felt the glare of the old man s eye on her in the darkness Deed we were but people forget things We had to borrow to buy our big overshot wheel we had though And when ould Parson Harrison sent us the first boll of oats we couldn t grind it for want of Caesar tugged at the counterpane and said Will you lie quiet woman and let a hard working man sleep Then don t be the young man s destruction Caesar Caesar made a contemptuous snort and pulled the bedclothes about his head Aw deed father but the girl might do worse A fine strapping lad And dear heart the cheerful face at him It s taking joy to look at like drawing water from a well And the laugh at the boy too that joyful it s as good to hear in the morning as six pigs at a lit Then marry the lad yourself woman and have done with it cried Caesar and so saying he kicked out his leg turned over to the wall and began to snore with great vigour XI The tide was up in Ramsey Harbour and rolling heavily on the shore before a fresh sea breeze with a cold taste of the salt in it A steamer lying by the quay was getting up steam trucks were running on her gangways the clanking crane over her hold was working and there was much shouting of name and ordering and protesting and general tumult On the after deck stood the emigrants for Kimberley the Quarks from Glen Rushen and some of the young Gills from Castletown stalwart lads bearing themselves bravely in the midst of a circle of their friends who talked and laughed to make them forget they were on the point of going Pete and Phil came up the quay and were received by a shout of incredulity from Quayle the harbour master What are you going too mister Philip Philip answered him No and passed on to the ship Pete was still in his stocking cap and Wellington boots but he had a monkey jacket over his blue guernsey Except for a parcel in a red print handkerchief this was all his kit and luggage He felt a little lost amid all the bustle and looked helpless and unhappy The busy preparations on land and shipboard had another effect on Philip He sniffed the breeze off the bay and laughed and said The sea s calling me Pete I ve half a mind to go with you Pete answered with a watery smile His high spirits were failing him at last Five years were a long time to be away if one built all one s hopes on coming back So many things might happen so many chances might befall Pete had no heart for laughter Philip had small mind for it either after the first rush of the salt in his blood was over He felt at some moments as if hell itself were inside of him What troubled him most was that he could not for the life of him be sorry that Pete was leaving the island Once or twice since they left Sulby he had been startled by the thought that he hated Pete He knew that his lip curled down hard at sight of Pete s solemn face But Pete never suspected this and the innocent tenderness of the rough fellow was every moment beating it down with blows that cut like ice and burnt like fire They were standing by the forecastle head and talking above the loud throbbing of the funnel Good bye Phil you ve been wonderful good to me better nor anybody in the world I ve not been much of a chum for the like of you either you that s college bred and ought to be the first gentry in the island if everybody had his own But you shan t be ashamed for me neither no you shan t so help me God I won t be long away Phil maybe five years maybe less and when I come back you ll be the first Manxman living No But you will though you will I m telling you No nonsense at all man Lave it to me to know Philip s frosty blue eyes began to melt And if I come back rich I ll be your ould friend again as much as a common man may and if I come back poor and disappointed and done for I ll not claim you to disgrace you and if I never come back at all I ll be saying to myself in my dark hour somewhere He ll spake up for you at home boy he ll not forget you Philip could hear no more for the puffing of the steam and the clanking of the chains Chut the talk a man will put out when he s thinking of ould times gone by The first bell rang on the bridge and the harbour master shouted All ashore there Phil there s one turn more I ll ask of you and if it s the last it s the biggest What is it There s Kate you know Keep an eye on the girl while I m away Take a slieu round now and then and put a sight on her She ll not give a skute at the heirs the ould man s telling of but them young drapers and druggists they ll plague the life out of the girl Bate them off Phil They re not worth a fudge with their fists But don t use no violence Just duck the dandy divils in the harbour that ll do No harm shall come to her while you are away Swear to it Phil Your word s your bond I know that but give me your hand and swear to it it ll be more surer Philip gave his hand and his oath and then tried to turn away for he knew that his face was reddening Wait There s another while your hand s in Phil Swear that nothing and nobody shall ever come between us two You know nothing ever will But swear to it Phil There s bad tongues going and it ll make me more aisier Whatever they do whatever they say friends and brothers to the last Philip felt a buzzing in his head and he was so dizzy that he could hardly stand but he took the second oath also Then the bell rang again and there was a great hubbub Gangways were drawn up ropes were let go the captain called to the shore from the bridge and the blustering harbour master called to the bridge from the shore Go and stand on the end of the pier Phil just aback of the lighthouse and I ll put myself at the stern I want a friend s face to be the last thing I see when I m going away from the old home Philip could bear no more The hate in his heart was mastered It was under his feet His flushed face was wet The throbbing of the funnels ceased and all that could be heard was the running of the tide in the harbour and the wash of the waves on the shore Across the sea the sun came up boldly like a guest expected and down its dancing water path the steamer moved away Over the land old Bar rule rose up like a sea king with hoar frost on his forehead and the smoke began to lift from the chimneys of the town at his feet Good bye little island good bye I ll not forget you I m getting kicked out of you but you ve been a good ould mother to me and God help me I ll come back to you yet So long little Mona s long I m laving you but I m a Manxman still Pete had meant to take off his stocking cap as they passed the lighthouse and to dash the tears from his eyes like a man But all that Philip could see from the end of the pier was a figure huddled up at the stern on a coil of rope PART II BOY AND GIRL I Auntie Nan had grown uneasy because Philip was not yet started in life During the spell of his partnership with Pete she had protested and he had coaxed she had scolded and he had laughed But when Pete was gone she remembered her old device and began to play on Philip through the memory of his father One day the air was full of the sea freshness of a beautiful Manx November Philip sniffed it from the porch after breakfast and then gathered up his tackle for cod The boat again Philip said Auntie Nan Then promise me to be back for tea Philip gave his promise and kept it When he returned after his day s fishing the old lady was waiting for him in the little blue room which she called her own The sweet place was more than usually dainty and comfortable that day A bright fire was burning and everything seemed to be arranged so carefully and nattily The table was laid with cups and saucers the kettle was singing on the jockey bar and Auntie Nan herself in a cap of black lace and a dress of russet silk with flounces was fluttering about with an odour of lavender and the light gaiety of a bird Why what s the meaning of this said Philip And the sweet old thing answered half nervously half jokingly You don t know What a child it is to be sure So you don t remember what day it is What day The fifth of Nov oh my birthday I had clean forgotten it Auntie Yes and you are one and twenty for tea time That s why I asked you to be home She poured out the tea settled herself with her feet on the fender allowed the cat to establish itself on her skirt and then with a nervous smile and a slight depression of the heart she began on her task How the years roll on Philip It s twenty years since I gave you my first birthday present I wasn t here when you were born dear Grandfather had forbidden me Poor grandfather But how I longed to come and wash and dress and nurse my boy s boy and call myself an auntie aloud Oh dear me the day I first saw you Shall I ever forget it Grandfather and I were at Cowley the draper s when a beautiful young person stepped in with a baby A little too gay poor thing and that was how I knew her My mother Yes dear and grandfather was standing with his back to the street I grow hot to this day when I remember but she didn t seem afraid She nodded and smiled and lifted the muslin veil from the baby s face and said Who s he like Miss Christian It was wonderful You were asleep and it was the same for all the world as if your father had slept back to be a baby I was trembling fit to drop and couldn t answer and then your mother saw grandfather and before I could stop her she had touched him on the shoulder He stood with his bad ear towards us and his sight was failing too but seeing the form of a lady beside him he swept round and bowed low and smiled and raised his hat as his way was with all women Then your mother held the baby up and said quite gaily Is it one of the Ballures he is Dempster or one of the Ballawhaines Dear heart when I think of it Grandfather straightened himself up turned about and was out on the street in an instant Poor father said Philip Auntie Nan s eyes brightened I was going to tell you of your first birthday dearest Grandfather had gone then poor grandfather and I had knitted you a little soft cap of white wool with a tassel and a pink bow Your mother s father was living still captain n Billy as they called him and when I put the cap on your little head he cried out A sailor every inch of him And sure enough though I had never thought it a sailor s cap it was And captain n Billy put you on his knee and looked at you sideways and slapped his thigh and blew a cloud of smoke from his long pipe and cried again This boy is for a sailor I m telling you You fell asleep in the old man s arms and I carried you to your cot upstairs Your father followed me into the bedroom and your mother was there already dusting the big shells on the mantelpiece Poor Tom I see him yet He dropped his long white hand over the cot rail pushed back the little cap and the yellow curls from your forehead and said proudly Ah no this head wasn t built for a sailor He meant no harm but Oh dear Oh dear your mother heard him and thought he was belittling her and hers These qualities she cried and slashed the duster and flounced out of the room and one of the shells fell with a clank into the fender Your father turned his face to the window I could have cried for shame that he should be ashamed before me But looking out on the sea the bay was very loud that day I remember he said in his deep voice that was like a mellow bell and trembled ratherly It s not for nothing Nannie that the child has the forehead of Napoleon Only let God spare him and he ll be something some day when his father with his broken heart and his broken brain is dead and gone and the daisies cover him Auntie Nan carried her point That night Philip laid up his boat for the winter and next morning he set his face towards Ballawhaine with the object of enlisting Uncle Peter s help in starting upon the profession of the law Auntie Nan went with him She had urged him to the step by the twofold plea that the Ballawhaine was his only male relative of mature years and that he had lately sent his own son Ross to study for the bar in England Both were nervous and uncertain on the way down Auntie Nan talked incessantly from under her poke bonnet thinking to keep up Philip s courage But when they came to the big gate and looked up at the turrets through the trees her memory went back with deep tenderness to the days when the house had been her home and she began to cry in silence Philip himself was not unmoved This had been the birthplace and birthright of his father The English footman in buff and scarlet ushered them into the drawing room with the formality proper to strangers To their surprise they found Ross there He was sitting at the piano strumming a music hall ditty As the door opened be shuffled to his feet shook hands distantly with Auntie Nan and nodded his head to Philip The young man was by this time a sapling well fed from the old tree Taller than his father by many inches broader heavier and larger in all ways with the slow eyes of a seal and something of a seal s face as well But with his father s sprawling legs and his father s levity and irony of manner and of voice a Manxman disguised out of all recognition of race and apeing the fashionable follies of the hour in London Auntie Nan settled her umbrella smoothed her gloves and her white front hair and inquired meekly if he was well Not very fit he drawled shouldn t be here if I were But father worried my life out until I came back to recruit Perhaps said Auntie Nan looking simple and sympathetic perhaps you ve been longing for home It must be a great trial to a young man to live in London for the first time That s where a young woman has the advantage she needn t leave home at all events Then your lodgings perhaps they are not in the best part either I used to have chambers in an Inn of Court Auntie Nan looked concerned I don t think I should like Philip to live long at an inn she said But now I m in rooms in the Hay market Auntie Nan looked relieved That must be better she said Noisy in the mornings perhaps but your evenings will be quiet for study I should think Precisely said Boss with a snigger touching the piano again and Philip sitting near the door felt the palm of his hand itch for the whole breadth of his cousin s cheek Uncle Peter came in hurriedly with short nervous steps His hair as well as his eyebrows was now white his eye was hollow his cheeks were thin his mouth was restless and he had lost some of his upper teeth he coughed frequently he was shabbily dressed and had the look of a dying man Ah it s you Anne and Philip too Good morning Philip Give the piano a rest Ross that s a good lad Well Miss Christian well Philip came of age yesterday Peter said Auntie Nan in a timid voice Indeed said the Ballawhaine then Ross is twenty next month A little more than a year and a month between them He scrutinised the old lady s face for a moment without speaking and then said Well He would like to go to London to study for the bar faltered Auntie Nan Why not the church at home The church would have been my own choice Peter but his father The Ballawhaine crossed his leg over his knee His father was always a man of a high stomach ma am he said Then facing towards Philip Your idea would be to return to the island Yes said Philip Practice as an advocate and push your way to insular preferment My father seemed to wish it sir said Philip The Ballawhaine turned back to Auntie Nan Well Miss Christian Auntie Nan fumbled the handle of her umbrella and began We were thinking Peter you see we know so little now if his father had been living The Ballawhaine coughed scratched with his nail on his cheek and said You wish me to put him with a barrister in chambers is that it With a nervous smile and a little laugh of relief Auntie Nan signified assent You are aware that a step like that costs money How much have you got to spend on it I m afraid Peter You thought I might find the expenses eh It s so good of you to see it in the right way Peter The Ballawhaine made a wry face Listen he said dryly Ross has just gone to study for the English bar Yes said Auntie Nan eagerly and it was partly that Indeed said the Ballawhaine raising his eyebrows I calculate that his course in London will cost me one thing with another more than a thousand pounds Auntie Nan lifted her gloved hands in amazement That sum I am prepared to spend in order that my son as an English barrister may have a better chance Do you know we were thinking of that ourselves Peter said Auntie Nan A better chance the Ballawhaine continued of the few places open in the island than if he were brought up at the Manx bar only which would cost me less than half as much Oh but the money will come back to you both for Ross and Philip said Auntie Nan The Ballawhaine coughed impatiently You don t read me he said irritably These places are few and Manx advocates are as thick as flies in a glue pot For every office there must be fifty applicants but training counts for something and influence for something and family for something Auntie Nan began to be penetrated as by a chill These said the Ballawhaine I bring to bear for Ross that he may distance all competitors Do you read me now Read you Peter said Auntie Nan The Ballawhaine fixed his hollow eye upon her and said What do you ask me to do You come here and ask me to provide prepare and equip a rival to my own son Auntie Nan had grasped his meaning at last But gracious me Peter she said Philip is your own nephew your own brother s son The Ballawhaine rubbed the side of his nose with his lean forefinger and said Near is my shirt but nearer is my skin Auntie Nan fixed her timid eyes upon him and they grew brave in their gathering indignation His father is dead and he is poor and friendless she said We ve had differences on that subject before mistress he answered And yet you begrudge him the little that would start him in life My own has earlier claim ma am Saving your presence sir let me tell you that every penny of the money you are spending on Ross would have been Philip s this day if things had gone different The Ballawhaine bit his lip Must I for my sins be compelled to put an end to this interview He rose to go to the door Philip rose also Do you mean it said Auntie Nan Would you dare to turn me out of the house Come Auntie what s the use said Philip The Ballawhaine was drumming on the edge of the open door You are right young man he said a woman s hysteria is of no use That will do sir said Philip in a firm voice The Ballawhaine put his hand familiarly on Philip s shoulder Try Bishop Wilson s theological college my friend its cheap and Take your hand from him Peter Christian cried Auntie Nan Her eyes flashed her cheeks were aflame her little gloved hands were clenched You made war between his father and your father and when I would have made peace you prevented me Your father is dead and your brother is dead and both died in hate that might have died in love only for the lies you told and the deceit you practised But they have gone where the mask falls from all faces and they have met before this eye to eye and hand to hand Yes and they are looking down on you now Peter Christian and they know you at last for what you are and always have been a deceiver and a thief By an involuntary impulse the Ballawhaine turned his eyes upward to the ceiling while she spoke as if he had expected to see the ghosts of his father and his brother threatening him Is the woman mad at all he cried and the timid old lady lifted out of herself by the flame of her anger blazed at him again with a tongue of fire You have done wrong Peter Christian much wrong you ve done wrong all your days and whatever your motive God will find it out and on that secret place he will bring your punishment If it was only greed you ve got your wages but no good will they bring to you for another will spend them and you will see them wasted like water from the ragged rock And if it was hate as well you will live till it comes back on your own head like burning coal I know it I feel it she cried sweeping into the hall and sorry I am to say it before your own son who ought to honour and respect his father but can t no he can t and never will or else he has a heart to match your own in wickedness and no bowels of compassion at him either Come Auntie come said Philip putting his arm about the old lady s waist But she swerved round again to where the Ballawhaine came slinking behind him Turn me out of the house will you she cried The place where I lived fifteen years and as mistress too until your evil deeds made you master Many a good cry I ve had that it s only a woman I am and can do nothing on my own head But I would rather be a woman that hasn t a roof to cover her than a man that can t warm to his own flesh and blood Don t think I begrudge you your house Peter Christian though it was my old home and I love it for all I m shown no respect in it I would have you to know sir that it isn t our houses we live in after all but our hearts our hearts Peter Christian do you hear me our hearts and yours is full of darkness and dirt and always will be always will be Come come Auntie come cried Philip again and the sweet old thing too gentle to hurt a fly turned on him also with the fury of a wild cat Go along yourself with your come and come and come Say less and do more With that final outburst she swept down the steps and along the path leaving Philip three paces behind and the Ballawhaine with a terrified look under the stuffed cormorant in the fanlight above the open door The fiery mood lasted her half way home and then broke down in a torrent of tears Oh dear oh dear she cried I ve been too hasty After all he is your only relative What shall I do now Oh what shall I do now Philip was walking steadily half a step behind and he had never once spoken since they left Ballawhaine Pack my bag to night Auntie said he with the voice of a man I shall start for Douglas by the coach to morrow morning He sought out the best known of the Manx advocates a college friend of his father s and said to him I ve sixty pounds a year sir from my mother s father and my aunt has enough of her own to live on Can I afford to pay your premium The lawyer looked at him attentively for a moment and answered No you can t and Philip s face began to fall But I ll take you the five years for nothing mister Christian the wise man added and if you suit me I ll give you wages after two II Philip did not forget the task wherewith Pete had charged him It is a familiar duty in the Isle of Man and he who discharges it is known by a familiar name They call him the Dooiney Molla literally the man praiser and his primary function is that of an informal unmercenary purely friendly and philanthropic matchmaker introduced by the young man to persuade the parents of the young woman that he is a splendid fellow with substantial possessions or magnificent prospects and entirely fit to marry her But he has a secondary function less frequent though scarcely less familiar and it is that of lover by proxy or intended husband by deputy with duties of moral guardianship over the girl while the man himself is off at the herrings or away at the mackerel or abroad on wider voyages This second task having gone through the first with dubious success Philip discharged with conscientious zeal The effects were peculiar Their earliest manifestations were as was most proper on Philip and Kate themselves Philip grew to be grave and wondrous solemn for assuming the tone of guardian lifted his manners above all levity Kate became suddenly very quiet and meek very watchful and modest soft of voice and most apt to blush The girl who had hectored it over Pete and played little mistress over everybody else grew to be like a dove under the eye of Philip A kind of awe fell on her whenever he was near She found it sweet to listen to his words of wisdom when he discoursed and sweeter still to obey his will when he gave commands The little wistful head was always turning in his direction his voice was like joy bells in her ears his parting how under his lifted hat remained with her as a dream until the following day She hardly knew what great change had been wrought in her and her people at home were puzzled Is it not very well you are Kirry woman said Grannie Well enough mother why not said Kate Is it the toothache that s plaguing you No Then maybe it s the new hat in the window at Miss Clu cas s Hould your tongue woman whispered Caesar behind the back of his hand It s the Spirit that s working on the girl Give it lave mother give it lave Give it fiddlesticks said Nancy Joe Give it brimstone and treacle and a cupful of wormwood and camomile When Philip and Kate were together their talk was all of Pete It was Pete likes this and Pete hates that and Pete always says so and so That was their way of keeping up the recollection of Pete s existence and the uses they put poor Pete to were many and peculiar One night The Manx Fairy was merry and noisy with a Scaltha a Christmas supper given by the captain of a fishing boat to the crew that he meant to engage for the season Wives sweethearts and friends were there and the customs and superstitions of the hour were honoured Isn t it the funniest thing in the world Philip giggled Kate from the back of the door and a moment afterwards she was standing alone with him in the lobby looking demurely down at his boots I suppose I ought to apologise Why so For calling you that Pete calls me Philip Why shouldn t you The furtive eyes rose to the buttons of his waistcoat Well no there can t be much harm in calling you what Pete calls you can there But then Well He calls me Kate Do you think he would like me to do so I m sure he would Shall we then I wonder Just for Pete s sake Just Kate Philip They didn t know what they felt It was something exquisite something delicious so sweet so tender they could only laugh as if some one had tickled them Of course we need not do it except when we are quite by ourselves said Kate Oh no of course not only when we are quite alone said Philip Thus they threw dust into each other s eyes and walked hand in hand on the edge of a precipice The last day of the old year after Pete s departure found Philip attending to his duty Are you going to put the new year in anywhere Philip said Kate from the door of the porch I should be the first foot here only I m no use as a qualtagh said Philip Why not I m a fair man and would bring you no luck you know Ah There was silence for a moment and then Kate cried I know Yes Come for Pete he s dark enough anyway Philip was much impressed That s a good idea he said gravely Being qualtagh for Pete is a good idea His first New Year from home too poor fellow Exactly said Kate Shall I then I ll expect you at the very stroke of twelve Philip was going off And Philip Yes Then a low voice so soft so sweet so merry came from the doorway into the dark I ll be standing at the door of the dairy Philip began to feel alarm and resolved to take for the future a lighter view of his duties He would visit The Manx Fairy less frequently As soon as the Christmas holidays were over he would devote himself to his studies and come back to Sulby no more for half a year But the Manx Christmas is long It begins on the twenty fourth of December and only ends for good on the sixth of January In the country places which still preserve the old traditions the culminating day is Twelfth Day It is then that they cut off the fiddler s head and play valentines which they call the Goggans The girls set a row of mugs on the hearth in front of the fire put something into each of them as a symbol of a trade and troop out to the stairs Then the boys change the order of the mugs and the girls come back blindfold one by one to select their goggans According to the goggans they lay hands on so will be the trades of their husbands At this game played at The Manx Fairy on the last night of Philip s holiday Csesar being abroad on an evangelising errand Kate was expected to draw water but she drew a quill A pen A pen cried the boys Who says the girl is to marry a sailor The ship isn t built that s to drown her husband Good night all said Philip Good night mister Christian good night sir said the boys Kate slipped after him to the door Going so early Philip I ve to be back at Douglas to morrow morning said Philip I suppose we shan t see you very soon No I must set to work in earnest now A fortnight a month may be Yes and six months I intend to do nothing else for half a year That s a long time isn t it Philip Not so long as I ve wasted Wasted So you call it wasted Of course it s nothing to me but there s your aunt A man can t always be dangling about women said Philip Kate began to laugh What are you laughing at I m so glad I m a girl said Kate Well so am I said Philip Are you It came at his face like a flash of lightning and Philip stammered I mean that is you know what about Pete Oh is that all Well good night if you must go Shall I bring you the lantern No need Starlight is it You can see your way to the gate quite plainly Very well if you don t want showing Good night The last words in an injured tone were half lost behind the closing door But the heart of a girl is a dark forest and Kate had determined that work or no work so long a spell as six months Philip should not be away III One morning in the late spring there came to Douglas a startling and most appalling piece of news Ross Christian was constantly seen at The Manx Fairy On the evening of that day Philip reappeared at Sulby He had come down in high wrath inventing righteous speeches by the way on plighted troths and broken pledges Ross was there in lacquered boots light kid gloves frock coat and pepper and salt trousers leaning with elbow on the counter that he might talk to Kate who was serving Philip had never before seen her at that task and his indignation was extreme He was more than ever sure that Grannie was a simpleton and Caesar a brazen hypocrite Kate nodded gaily to him as he entered and then continued her conversation with Ross There was a look in her eyes that was new to him and it caused him to change his purpose He would not be indignant he would be cynical he would be nasty he would wait his opportunity and put in with some cutting remark So at Caesar s invitation and Grannie s welcome he pushed through the bar room to the kitchen exchanged salutations and then sat down to watch and to listen The conversation beyond the glass partition was eager and enthusiastic Ross was fluent and Kate was vivacious My friend Monty Yes who is Monty He s the centre of the Fancy The Fancy Ornaments of the Ring you know Come now surely you know the Ring my dear His rooms in saint James s Street are full of them every night All sorts you know featherweights and heavy weights and greyhounds And the faces My goodness you should see them Such worn out old images Knowledge boxes all awry mouths crooked and noses that have had the upper cut But good men all good to take their gruel you know Monty will have nothing else about him He was Tom Spring s packer Never heard of Tom Spring Tom of Bedford the incorruptible you know only he fought cross that day Monty lost a thousand and Tom keeps a public in Holborn now with pictures of the Fancy round the walls Then Kate with a laugh said something which Philip did not catch because Caesar was rustling the newspaper he was reading Ladies come said Ross Girls at Monty s suppers Rather what should you think Cleopatra but you ought to be there I must be getting off myself very soon There s a supper coming off next week at Handsome Honey s Who s Honey Proprietor of a night house in the Haymarket Night house You come and see my dear Caesar dropped the newspaper and looked across at Philip The gaze was long and embarrassing and for want of better conversation Philip asked Caesar if he was thinking Aw thinking thinking and thinking again sir said Caesar Then drawing his chair nearer to Philip s he added in a half whisper I m getting a bit of a skute into something though See yonder They re calling his father a miser The man s racking his tenants and starving his land But I believe enough the young brass lagh a weed is choking the ould grain Caesar as he spoke tipped his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of Ross and seeing this Ross interrupted his conversation with Kate to address himself to her father So you ve been reading the paper mister Cregeen Aw reading and reading said Caesar grumpily Then in another tone You re home again from London sir Great doings yonder they re telling me Battles sir great battles Ross elevated his eyebrows Have you heard of them then he asked Aw heard enough said Caesar meetings and conferences and conventions and I don t know what Oh oh I see said Ross with a look at Kate They re doing without hell in England now a days that s a quare thing sir Conditional immorality they re calling it the singlerest thing I know Taking hell away drops the tailboard out of a man s religion eh The time for closing came and Philip had waited in vain Only one cut had come his way and that had not been his own As he rose to go Kate had said We didn t expect to see you again for six months mister Christian So it seems said Philip and Kate laughed a little and that was all the work of his evening and the whole result of his errand Caesar was waiting for him in the porch His face was white and it twitched visibly It was plain to see that the natural man was fighting in Caesar mister Christian sir said he are you the gentleman that came here to speak to me for Peter Quilliam I am said Philip Then do you remember the ould Manx saying Perhaps the last dog may be catching the hare Leave it to me mister Cregeen said Philip through his teeth Half a minute afterwards he was swinging down the dark road homewards by the side of Ross who was drawling along with his cold voice So you ve started on your light weight handicap Philip Father was monstrous unreasonable that day Seemed to think I was coming back here to put my shoulder out for your high bailiffships and bum bailiffships and heaven knows what You re welcome to the lot for me Philip That girl s wonderful though It s positively miraculous too she s the living picture of a girl of my friend Montague s Eyes hair that nervous movement of the mouth everything Old man looked glum enough though Poor little woman I suppose she s past praying for The old hypocrite will hold her like a dove in the claws of a buzzard hawk till she throws herself away on some Manx omathaun It s the way with half these pretty creatures they re wasted Philip s blood was boiling Do you call it being wasted when a good girl is married to an honest man he asked I do because a girl like this can never marry the right man The man who is worthy of her cannot marry her and the man who marries her isn t worthy of her It s like this Philip She s young she s pretty perhaps beautiful has manners and taste and some refinement The man of her own class is clumsy and ignorant and stupid and poor She doesn t want him and the man she does want the man she s fit for daren t marry her it would be social suicide And so said Philip bitterly to save the man above from social suicide the girl beneath must choose moral death is that it Ross laughed Do you know I thought old Jeremiah was at you in the corner there Philip But look at it straight Here s a girl like that Two things are open to her two only Say she marries your Manx fellow what follows A thatched cottage three fields back from the mountain road two rooms a cowhouse a crock a dresser a press a form a three legged stool an armchair and a clock with a dirty face hanging on a nail in the wall Milking weeding digging ninepence a day and a can of buttermilk with a lump of butter thrown in Potatoes herrings and barley bonnag Year one a baby a boy year two another baby a girl year three twins year four barefooted children squalling dirty house man grumbling woman distracted measles hooping cough a journey at the tail of a cart to the bottom of the valley and the awful words I am the Hush man said Philip They were passing Lezayre churchyard When they had left it behind he added with a grim curl of the lip which was lost in the darkness Well that s one side What s the other Life said Ross Short and sweet perhaps Everything she wants everything she can wish for five years four years three years what matter And then Every one for himself and God for us all my boy She s as happy as the day while it lasts lifts her head like a rosebud in the sun Then drops it I suppose like a rose leaf in the mud Ross laughed again Yes it s a fact old Jeremiah has been at you Philip Poor little Kitty Keep the girl s name out of it if you please Ross gave a long whistle I was only saying the poor little woman It s damnable and I ll have no more of it There s no duty on speech I hope in your precious Isle of Man There is though said Philip a duty of decency and honour and to name that girl foolish as she is in the same breath with your women But here listen to me Best tell you now so there may be no mistake and no excuse Miss Cregeen is to be married to a friend of mine I needn t say who he is he comes close enough to you at all events When he s at home he s able to take care of his own affairs but while he s abroad I ve got to see that no harm comes to his promised wife I mean to do it too Do you understand me Ross I mean to do it Good night They were at the gate of Ballawhaine by this time and Ross went through it giggling IV The following evening found Philip at The Manx Fairy again Ross was there as usual and he was laughing and talking in a low tone with Kate This made Philip squirm on his chair but Kate s behaviour tortured him Her enjoyment of the man s jests was almost uproarious She was signalling to him and peering up at him gaily Her conduct disgusted Philip It seemed to him an aggravation of her offence that as often as he caught the look of her face there was a roguish twinkle in the eye on his side and a deliberate cast in his direction This open disregard of the sanctity of a pledged word this barefaced indifference to the presence of him who stood to represent it was positively indecent This was what women were Deceit was bred in their bones It added to Philip s gathering wrath that Caesar who sat in shirt sleeves making up his milling accounts from slates ciphered with crosses and triangles and circles and half circles was lifting his eyes from time to time to look first at them and then at him with an expression of contempt At a burst of fresh laughter and a shot of the bright eyes Philip surged up to his feet thrust himself between Ross and Kate turned his back on him and his face to her and said in a peremptory voice Come into the parlour instantly I have something to say to you Oh indeed said Kate But she came looking mischievous and yet demure with her head down but her eyes peering under their long upper lashes Why don t you send this fellow about his business said Philip Kate looked up in blank surprise What fellow she said What fellow said Philip why this one that is shillyshallying with you night after night You can never mean your own cousin Philip said Kate More s the pity if he is my cousin but he s no fit company for you I m sure the gentleman is polite enough So s the devil himself He can behave and keep his temper anyway Then it s the only thing he can keep He can t keep his character or his credit or his honor and you should not encourage him Kate s under lip began to show the inner half Who says I encourage him I do What right have you Haven t I seen you with my own eyes Kate grew defiant Well and what if you have Then you are a jade and a coquette The word hissed out like steam from a kettle Kate saw it coming and took it full in the face She felt an impulse to scream with laughter so she seized her opportunity and cried Philip s temper began to ebb That man would be a poor bargain Kate if he were twenty times the heir of Ballawhaine Can t you gather from his conversation what his life and companions are Of course it s nothing to me Kate No it s nothing to you whimpered Kate from behind both hands I ve no right Of course not you ve no right said Kate and she stole a look sideways Only Philip did not see the glance that came from the corner of Kate s eye When a girl forgets a manly fellow who happens to be abroad for the first rascal that comes along with his dirty lands Down went the hands with an impatient fling What are his lands to me Then it s my duty as a friend Duty indeed Just what every old busybody says Philip gripped her wrist Listen to me If you don t send this man packing You are hurting me Let go my arm Philip flung it aside and said What do I care Then why do you call me a coquette Do as you like So I will Philip Philip Phil He s gone It was twenty miles by coach and rail from Douglas to Sulby but Philip was back at The Manx Fairy the next evening also He found a saddle horse linked to the gate post and Ross inside the house with a riding whip in his hand beating the leg of his riding breeches When Philip appeared Kate began to look alarmed and Ross to look ugly Caesar who was taking his tea in the ingle was having an unpleasant passage with Grannie in side breaths by the fire Bad bad a notorious bad liver and dirty with the tongue said Caesar Chut father said Grannie The young man s civil enough and girls will be girls What s a word or a look or a laugh when you re young and have a face that s fit for anything Better her face should be pitted with smallpox than bring her to the pit of hell said Caesar All flesh is grass the grass withereth the flower fadeth Nancy Joe came from the dairy at that moment Gracious me I did you see that now she said I wonder at Kitty But it s the way of the men smiling and smiling and maning nothing Hm They mane a dale growled Caesar Ross had recovered from his uneasiness at Philip s entrance and was engaged in some narration whereof the only words that reached the kitchen were I know and I know repeated frequently You seem to know a dale sir shouted Caesar do you know what it is to be saved There was silence for a moment and then Ross polishing his massive signet ring on his corduroy waistcoat said Is that the old gentleman s complaint I wonder My husband is a local preacher and always strong for salvation said Grannie by way of peace Is that all said Ross I thought perhaps he had taken more wine than the sacrament You re my cross woman muttered Caesar but no cross no crown Lave women s matters alone father it ll become you better said Grannie Laugh as you like Mistress Cregeen there s One above there s One above Ross had resumed his conversation with Kate who was looking frightened And listening with all his ears Philip caught the substance of what was said I m due back by this time There s the supper at Handsome Honey s not to speak of the everlasting examinations But somehow I can t tear myself away Why not Can t you guess No Not a notion I would go to morrow Kitty a word in your ear I believe in my heart that man is for kissing her said Caesar If he does then by he s done it Hould sir Caesar had risen to his feet and in a moment the house was in an uproar Ross lifted his head like a cock Were you speaking to me mister he asked I was and don t demane yourself like that again said Caesar Like what said Ross Paying coort to a girl that isn t fit for you Ross lifted his hat Do you mean this young lady No young lady at all sir but the daughter of a plain respectable man that isn t going to see her fooled Your hat to your head sir You ll be wanting it for the road Father cried Kate in a voice of fear Caesar turned his rough shoulder and said Go to your room ma am and keep it for a week You may go said Ross I ll spare the old simpleton for your sake Kate You ll spare me sir cried Caesar I ve seen the day but thank the Lord for restraining grace Spare me If you had said as much five and twenty years ago sir your head would have gone ringing against the wall I ll spare you no more then said Ross Take that and that Amid screams from the women two sounding blows fell on Caesar s face At the next instant Philip was standing between the two men Come this way he said addressing Ross If I like Ross answered This way I tell you said Philip Ross snapped his fingers As you please he said and then followed Philip out of the house Kate had run upstairs in terror but five minutes afterwards she was on the road with a face full of distress and a shawl over head and shoulders At the bridge she met Kelly the postman Which way have they gone she panted the young Ballawhaine and Philip Christian I saw them heading down to the Curragh said Kelly and Kate in the shawl flew like a bird over the ground in that direction V The two young men went on without a word Philip walked with long strides three paces in front with head thrown back pallid face and contracted features mouth firmly shut arms stiff by his side and difficult and audible breathing Ross slouched behind with an air of elaborate carelessness his horse beside him the reins over its head and round his arm the riding whip under his other arm pit and both his hands deep in the breeches pockets There was no road the way they went but only a cart track interrupted here and there by a gate and bordered by square turf pits half full of water The days were long and the light was not yet failing Beyond the gorse the willows the reeds the rushes and the sally bushes of the flat land the sun was setting over a streak of gold on the sea They had left behind them the smell of burning turf of crackling sticks of fish and of the cowhouse and were come into the atmosphere of flowering gorse and damp scraa soil and brine Far enough aren t we shouted Ross but Philip pushed on He drew up at last in an open space where the gorse had been burnt away and its black remains desolated the surface and killed the odours of life There was not a house near not a landmark in sight except a windmill on the sea s verge and the ugly tower of a church like the funnel of a steamship between sea and sky We re alone at last he said hoarsely We are said Ross interrupting the whistling of a tune and now that you ve got me here perhaps you ll be good enough to tell me what we ve come for Philip made no more answer than to strip himself of his coat and waistcoat You re never going to make a serious business of this stupid affair said Ross leaning against the horse and slapping the sole of one foot with the whip Take off your coat said Philip in a thick voice Can I help it if a pretty girl began Ross Will you strip cried Philip Ross laughed Ah now I remember our talk of the other night But you don t mean to say he said flipping at the flies at the horse s head that because the little woman is forgetting the curmudgeon that s abroad Philip strode up to him with clenched hands and quivering lips and said Will you fight Ross laughed again but the blood was in his face and he said tauntingly I wouldn t distress myself man Daresay I ll be done with the girl before the fellow You re a scoundrel cried Philip and if you won t stand up to me Ross flung away his whip If I must I must he said and then threw the horse s reins round the charred arm of a half destroyed gorse tree A minute afterwards the young men stood face to face Stop said Ross let me tell you first it s only fair Since I went up to London I ve learnt a thing or two I ve stood up before men that can strip a picture I ve been opposite talent and I can peck a bit but I ve never heard that you can stop a blow Are you ready cried Philip As you will You shall have one round you ll want no more The young men looked badly matched Ross in riding breeches and shirt with red bullet head and sprawling feet arms like an oak and veins like willow boughs Philip in shirt and knickerbockers with long fair hair quivering face and delicate figure It was strength and some skill against nerve alone Like a rush of wind Philip came on striking right and left and was driven back by a left hand body blow There you ve got it said Ross smiling benignly Didn t I tell you That s old Bristol Bull to begin with Philip rushed on again and came back with a smashing blow that cut his nether lip You ve got a second said Ross Have you had enough Philip did not hear but sprang fiercely at Ross once more The next instant he was on the ground Then Ross took on a manner of utter contempt I can t keep on flipping at you all night Mock me when you ve beaten me said Philip and he was on his feet again somewhat blown but fresh as to spirit and doggedly resolute Toe the scratch then said Ross I must say you re good at your gruel Philip flung himself on his man a third time and fell more heavily than before under a flush hit that seemed to bury itself in his chest I can t go on fighting a man that s as good for nothing as my old grandmother said Ross But his contempt was abating he was growing uneasy Philip was before him as fierce as ever Fight your equal he cried I ll fight you growled Philip You re not fit Give it up And look the dark is falling There s enough daylight yet Come on Nobody is here to shame you Come on I say Philip did not wait but sprang on his man like a tiger Ross met his blow dodged feinted they gripped swinging to and fro there was a struggle and Philip fell again with a dull thud against the ground Will you stop now said Ross No no no cried Philip leaping to his feet I ll eat you up I m a glutton I can tell you But his voice trembled and Philip blind with passion laughed You ll be hurt said Ross What of that said Philip You ll be killed I m willing Ross tried to laugh mockingly but the hoarse gurgle choked in his throat He began to tremble This man doesn t know when he s mauled he muttered and after a loud curse he stood up afresh with a craven and shifty look His blows fell like scorching missiles but Philip took them like a rock scoured with shingle raining blood like water but standing firm What s the use cried Ross drop it I ll drop myself first said Philip If you won t give it up I will said Ross You shan t said Philip Take your victory if you like I won t Say you ve licked me I ll do it first said Philip Ross laughed long and riotously but he was trembling like a whipped cur With a blob of foam on his lips he came up collecting all his strength and struck Philip a blow on the forehead that fell with the sound of a hammer on a coffin Are you done he snuffled No by God cried Philip black as ink with the burnt gorse from the ground except where the blood ran red on him This man means to kill me mumbled Ross He looked round shiftily and said I mean no harm by the girl You re a liar cried Philip With a glance of deep malignity Ross closed with Philip again It was now a struggle of right with wrong as well as nerve with strength The sun had set under the sea the sally bushes were shivering in the twilight a flight of rooks were screaming overhead Blows were no more heard Ross gripped Philip in a venomous embrace and dragged him on to one knee Philip rose Ross doubled round his waist pushing him backward and fell heavily on his breast shouting with the growl of a beast You ll fight me will you Get up get up Philip did not rise and Ross began dragging and lunging at him with brutal ferocity when suddenly where he bent double a blow fell on his ear from behind another and another a hand gripped his shirt collar and choked him and a voice cried Let go you brute let go let go Ross dropped Philip and swung himself round to return the attack It was the girl Oh it s you is it he panted She was like a fury You brute you beast you toad she cried and then threw herself over Philip He was unconscious She lifted his head on to her lap and lost to all shame to all caution to all thought but one thought she kissed him on the cheek on the lips on the eyes on the forehead crying Philip oh Philip Philip Ross was shuddering beside them Let me look at him he faltered but Kate fired back with a glance like an arrow and said screaming like a sea gull If you touch him again I ll strangle you Ross caught a glimpse of Philip s face and he was terrified Going to a turf pit he dipped both hands in the dub and brought some water Take this he said for Heaven s sake let me bathe his head He dashed the water on the pallid forehead and then withdrew his eyes while the girl coaxed Philip back to consciousness with fresh kisses and pleading words Is he breathing Feel his heart Any pulsation Oh God said Ross it wasn t my fault He looked round with wild eyes he meditated flight Is he better yet What s it to you you coward said Kate with a burning glance She went on with her work Come then dear come come now Philip opened his eyes in a vacant stare and rose on his elbow Then Kate fell back from him immediately and began to cry quietly being all woman now and her moral courage gone again in an instant But the moral courage of mister Ross came back as quickly He began to sneer and to laugh lightly picked up his riding whip and strode over to his horse Are you hurt asked Kate in a low tone Is it Kate said Philip At the sound of his voice in that low whisper Kate s tears came streaming down I hope youll forgive me she said I should have taken your warning She wiped his face with the loose sleeve of her dress and then he struggled to his feet Lean on me Philip No no I can walk Do take my arm Oh no Kate I m strong enough Just to please me Well very well Ross looked on with jealous rage His horse frightened by the fight had twirled round and round till the reins were twisted into a knot about the gorse stump and as he liberated the beast he flogged it back till it flew around him Then he vaulted to the saddle tugged at the curb and the horse reared Down he cried with an oath and lashed brutally at the horse s head Meantime Kate going past him with Philip on her arm was saying softly Are you feeling better Philip And Ross looking on in sulky meditation sent a harsh laugh out of his hot throat and said Oh you can make your mind easy about him if your other man fights for you like that you ll do Thought you d have three of them did you Or perhaps you only wanted me for your decoy Why don t you kiss him now when he can know it But he s a beauty to take care of you for somebody else Fighting for the other one eh Stuff and humbug Take him home and the curse of Judas on the brace of you So saying he burst into wild derisive laughter flogged his horse on the ears and the nose shouted Down you brute down and shot off at a gallop across the open Curragh Philip and Kate stood where he had left them till he had disappeared in the mist rising off the marshy land and the hud of his horse s hoofs could be no more heard Their heads were down and though their arms were locked their faces were turned half aside There was silence for some time The girl s eyelids quivered her look was anxious and helpless Then Philip said Let us go home and they began to walk together Not another word did they speak Neither looked into the other s eyes Their entwined arms slackened a little in a passionless asundering yet both felt that they must hold tight or they would fall It was almost as if Ross s parting taunt had uncovered their hearts to each other and revealed to themselves their secret They were like other children of the garden of Eden driven out and stripped naked At the bridge they met Caesar Grannie Nancy Joe and half the inhabitants of Sulby abroad with lanterns in search of them They re here cried Caesar You ve chastised him then You d bait his head off I ll go bail And I believe enough you ll be forgiven sir Yonder blow was almost bitterer than flesh can bear Before my days of grace but praise the Lord for His restraining hand the very minute my anger was up He crippled me in the hip with rheumatics But what s this holding the lantern over his head there s blood on your face sir A scratch it s nothing said Philip It s the women that s in every mischief said Caesar Lord bless me aren t the women as good as the men said Nancy H m said Caesar We re told that man was made a little lower than the angels but about women we re just left to our own conclusions Scripture has nothing to do with Ross Christian father said Grannie The Lord forbid it said Caesar What can you get from a cat but his skin And doesn t the man come from Christian Ballawhaine If it comes to that though haven t we all come from Adam said Grannie Yes and from Eve too more s the pity said Caesar VI For some time thereafter Philip went no more to Sulby He had a sufficient excuse His profession made demand of all his energies When he was not at work in Douglas he was expected to be at home with his aunt at Ballure But neither absence nor the lapse of years served to lift him out of the reach of temptation He had one besetting provocation to remembrance one duty which forbade him to forget Kate his pledge to Pete his office as Dooiney Molla Had he not vowed to keep guard over the girl He must do it The trust was a sacred one Philip found a way out of his difficulty The post was an impersonal and incorruptible go between so he wrote frequently Sometimes he had news to send for to avoid the espionage of Caesar intelligence of Pete came through him occasionally he had love letters to enclose now and then he had presents to pass on When such necessity did not arise he found it agreeable to keep up the current of correspondence At Christmas he sent Christmas cards on Midsummer Day a bunch of moss roses and even on saint Valentine s Day a valentine All this was in discharge of his duty and everything he did was done in the name of Pete He persuaded himself that he sank his own self absolutely Having denied his eyes the very sight of the girl s face he stood erect in the belief that he was a true and loyal friend Kate was less afraid and less ashamed She took the presents from Pete and wore them for Philip In her secret heart she thought no shame of this The years gave her a larger flow of life and made out of the bewitching girl a splendid woman brought up to the full estate of maidenly beauty This change wrought by time on her bodily form caused the past to seem to her a very long way off Something had occurred that made her a different being She was like the elder sister of that laughing girl who had known Pete To think of that little sister as having a kind of control over her was impossible Kate never did think of it Nevertheless she held her tongue Her people were taken in by the episode of Ross Christian According to their view Kate loved the man and still longed for him and that was why she never talked of Pete Philip was disgusted with her unfaithfulness to his friend and that was the reason of his absence She never talked of Philip either but they on their part talked of him perpetually and fed her secret passion with his praises Thus for three years these two were like two prisoners in neighbouring cells very close and yet very far apart able to hear each other s voices yet never to see each other s faces yearning to come together and to touch but unable to do so because of the wall that stood between Since the fight Caesar had removed her from all duties of the inn and one day in the spring she was in the gable house peeling rushes to make tallow candles when Kelly the postman passed by the porch where Nancy Joe was cleaning the candle irons Heard the newses Nancy said Kelly mister Philip Christian is let off two years time and called to the bar Nancy looked grave I m sure the young gentleman is that quiet and studdy she said What are they doing on him Only making him a full advocate woman said Kelly You don t say said Nancy He passed his examination before the Govenar s man yesterday Aw there now I took the letter to Ballure this evening It s like you would mister Kelly That s the boy for you I m always saying it Deed I am though but there s ones here that won t have it at all at all Miss Kate you mane We know the raison He s lumps in her porridge woman Good day to you Nancy Yes it s doing a nice day enough mister Kelly said Nancy and the postman passed on Kate came gliding out with a brush in her hand What was the postman saying That mister Philip Christian has been passing for an advocate said Nancy deliberately Kate s eyes glistened and her lips quivered with delight but she only said with an air of indifference Was that all his news then All D ye say all said Nancy digging away at the candle irons Listen to the girl And him that good to her while her promist man s away Kate shelled her rush and said with a sigh and a sly look I m afraid you think a deal too much of him Nancy Then I ll be making mends said Nancy for some that s thinking a dale too little I m quite at a loss to know what you see in him said Kate Now you don t say said Nancy with scorching irony Then banging her irons she added I m not much of a woman for a man myself They re only poor helpless creatures anyway and I don t approve of them But if I was for putting up with one of the sort he wouldn t have legs and arms like a dolly and a face like curds and whey and coat and trousers that loud you can hear them coming up the street With this parting shot at Ross Christian Nancy flung into the house thinking she had given Kate a dressing that she would never forget Kate was radiant Such abuse was honey on her lips such scoldings were joy bells in her ears She took silent delight in provoking these attacks They served her turn both ways bringing her delicious joy at the praise of Philip and at the same time preserving her secret VII Latter that day Caesar came in from the mill with the startling intelligence that Philip was riding up on the highroad Goodness mercy cried Nancy and she fled away to wash her face Grannie with a turn of the hand settled her cap and smoothed her grey hair under it Kate herself had disappeared like a flash of light but as Philip dismounted at the gate looking taller and older and paler and more serious but raising his cap from his fair head and smiling a smile like sunshine she was coming leisurely out of the porch with a bewitching hat over her wavy black hair and a hand basket over her arm Then there was a little start of surprise and recognition a short catch of quick breath and nervous salutations I m going round to the nests she said I suppose you ll step in to see mother Time enough for that said Philip May I help you with the eggs first Besides I ve something to tell you Is it that you re admitted said Kate That s nothing said Philip Only the A B C you know Getting ready to begin so to speak They walked round to the stackyard and he tied up his horse and gave it hay Then while they poked about for eggs on hands and knees among the straw under the stacks and between the bushes she said she hoped he would have success and he answered that success was more than a hope to him now it was a sort of superstition She did not understand this but looked up at him from all fours with brightening eyes and said What a glorious thing it is to be a man Is it said Philip And yet I remember somebody who said she wasn t sorry to be a girl Did I said Kate But that was long ago And I remember somebody else who pretended he was glad I was That was long ago too said Philip and both laughed nervously What strange things girls are and boys said Kate with a matronly sigh burying her face in a nest where a hen was clucking and two downy chicks were peeping from her wing They went through to the orchard where the trees were breaking into eager blossoms I ve another letter for you from Pete said Philip So said Kate Here it is said Philip Won t you read it said Kate But it s yours surely a girl doesn t want anybody else Ah but you re different though you know everything and besides read it aloud Philip With her basket of eggs on one arm and the other hand on the outstretched arm of an apple tree she waited while he read Dearest Kitty How s yourself darling and how s Philip and how s Grannie I m getting on tremendous They re calling me Captain now captain n Pete Sort of overseer at the Diamond Mines outside Kimberley Regular gentleman s life and no mistake Nothing to do but sit under a monstrous big umbrella with a paper in your fist like a chairman while twenty Kaffirs do the work Just a bit of a tussle now and then to keep you from dropping off When a Kaffir turns up a diamond you grab it and mark it on the time sheet against his name They ve got their own outlandish ones but we always christen them ourselves Sixpence Seven Waistcoats Shoulder of Mutton Twopenny Trotter anything you like When a Kaffir strikes a diamond he gets a commission and so does his overseer I m afraid I m going to be getting terrible rich soon Tell the old man I ll be buying that har monia yet They are a knowing lot though and if they can get up a dust to smuggle a stone when you re not looking they will Then they sell it to the blackleg Boers and you ve got to raise your voice like an advocate to get it back somehow But the Boers can t do no harm to you with their fists at all it s playing They re a dirty lot wonderful straight like some of the lazy Manx ones especially Black Tom When they see us down at the river washing they say What dirty people the English must be if they have to wash themselves three times a day we only do it once a week When a Kaffir steals a stone we usually court martial him but I don t hold with it as the floggers on the compound can t be trusted so I always lick my own niggers being more kinder and if anybody does anything against me they lynch him Kate made a little patient sigh and turned away her head while Philip in a halting voice went on Darling Kitty I am longing mortal for a sight of your sweet face When the night comes and I ll be lying in the huts boards on the ground and good canvas and everything comfortable says I to the boys Shut your faces men and let a poor chap sleep but they never twig the darkness of my meaning I ll only be wanting a bit of quiet for thinking of with the stars atwinkling down She s looking at that one Shine on my angel Really Kate faltered Philip I can t Give it to me then said Kate She was tugging with her trembling hand at the arm of the apple tree and the white blossom was raining over her from the rowels of the thin boughs overhead like silver fish falling from the herring net Taking the letter she glanced over the close darlin Kirry how is the mackral this saison and is the millin doing middling and I wonder is the hens all layin and is the grace gone out of the mares leg yet and how is the owl man and is he still playin hang with the texes Theer is a big chap heer that is strait like him he hath swallowed the owl Book and cant help bring it up agen but dear Kirry no more at present i axpect to be Home sune bogh to see u all tho I dont no azactly With luv your luving swateart peat When she had finished the letter she turned it over in her fingers and gave another patient little sigh You didn t read it as it was spelled Philip she said What odds if the spelling is uncertain when the love is as sure as that said Philip Did he write it himself think you said Kate He signed it anyway and no doubt indited it too but perhaps one of the Gills boys held the pen She coloured a little slipped the letter down her dress into her pocket and looked ashamed VIII This shame at Pete s letter tormented Philip and he stayed away again His absence stimulated Kate and made Philip himself ashamed She was vexed with him that he did not see that all this matter of Pete was foolishness It was absurd to think of a girl marrying a man whom she had known when he was a boy But Philip was trying to keep the bond sacred and so she made her terms with it She used Pete as a link to hold Philip After the lapse of some months in which Philip had not been seen at Sulby she wrote him a letter It was to say how anxious she had been at the length of time since she had last heard from Pete and to ask if he had any news to relieve her fears The poor little lie was written in a trembling hand which shook honestly enough but from the torment of other feelings Philip answered the letter in person Something had been speaking to him day and night like the humming of a top finding him pretexts on which to go but now he had to make excuses for staying so long away It was evening Kate was milking and he went out to her in the cowhouse We began to think we were to see no more of you she said over the rattle of the milk in the pail I ve I ve been ill said Philip The rattle died to a thin hiss Very ill she asked Well no not seriously he answered I never once thought of that she said Something ought to have told me I ve been reproaching you too Philip felt shame of his subterfuge but yet more ashamed of the truth so he leaned against the door and watched in silence The smell of hay floated down from the loft and the odour of the cow s breath came in gusts as she turned her face about Kate sat on the milking stool close by the ewer and her head on which she wore a sun bonnet she leaned against the cow s side No news of Pete then No she said No said Philip Kate dug her head deeper in the cow and muttered Dear Pete So simple so natural He is said Philip So good hearted too Yes And such a manly fellow any girl might like him said Kate Indeed yes said Philip There was silence again and two pigs which had been snoring on the manure heap outside began to snort their way home Kate turned her head so that the crown of the sun bonnet was toward Phillip and said Oh dear Can there be anything so terrible as marrying somebody you don t care for Nothing so bad said Philip The mouth of the sun bonnet came round Yes there s one thing worse Philip No Not having married somebody you do said Kate and the milk rattled like hail In the straw behind Kate there was a tailless Manx cat with three tailed kittens and Philip began to play with them Being back to back with Kate he could keep his countenance This old Horney is terrible for switching said Kate over her shoulder Don t you think you could hold her tail That brought them face to face again It s so sweet to have some one to talk to about Pete said Kate Yes I don t know how I could bear his long absence but for that Are you longing so much Kate Oh no not longing not to say longing Only you can t think what it is to be have you never been yourself Philip What Hold it tight in love No Well said Philip speaking at the crown of the sun bonnet Ha ha well not properly perhaps I don t I can hardly say Kate There You ve let it go after all and she s covered me with the milk But I m finished anyway Kate was suddenly radiant She kissed Horney and hugged her calf in the adjoining stall and as they crossed the haggard Philip carrying the pail she scattered great handfuls of oats to a cock and his two hens as they cackled their way to roost You ll be sure to come again soon Philip eh It s so sweet to have some one to remind me of but Pete s name choked her now Not that I m likely to forget him now is that likely But it s such a weary time to be left alone and a girl gets longing Did I now Give me the milk then Did I say I wasn t Well you can t expect a girl to be always reasonable Good bye Kate Yes you had better go now good bye Philip went away in pain yet in delight with a delicious thrill and a sense of stifling hypocrisy He had felt like a fool Kate must have thought him one But better she should think him a fool than a traitor It was all his fault Only for him the girl would have been walled round by her love for Pete He would come no more IX Philip held to his resolution for three months and grew thin and pale Then another letter came from Pete a letter for himself and he wondered what to do with it To send it by post pretending to be ill again would be hypocrisy he could not support He took it The family were all at home Nancy had just finished a noisy churning and Kate was in the dairy weighing the butter into pounds and stamping it Philip read the letter in a loud voice to the old people in the kitchen and the soft thumping and watery swishing ceased in the damp place adjoining Pete was in high feather He had made a mortal lot of money lately and was for coming home quickly Couldn t say exactly when for some rascally blackleg Boers who had been corrupting his Kaffirs and slipped up country with a pile of stones had first to be followed and caught The job wouldn t take long though and they might expect to see him back within a twelvemonth with enough in his pocket to drive away the devil and the coroner anyway Bould fellow said Caesar Aw deed on Pete said Grannie Now if it wasn t for that Ross said Nancy Philip went into the dairy where Kate was now skimming the cream of the last night s milking He was sorry there was nothing but a message for her this time Had she answered Pete s former letters No she had not I must be writing soon I suppose she said blowing the yellow surface But I wish puff I could have something to tell him puff puff about you About me Kate Something sweet I mean puff puff puff She shot a sly look upward Aren t you sure yet Can t say still Not properly No Philip pretended not to understand Kate s laugh echoed in the empty cream tins How you want people to say things No really began Philip I ve always heard that the girls of Douglas are so beautiful You must see so many now Oh it would be delicious to write a long story to Pete Where you met in church naturally What she s like fair of course And and all about it you know That s a story you will never tell to Pete Kate said Philip No never said Kate quite as light and this being just what she wished to hear she added mournfully Don t say that though You can t think what pleasure you are denying me and yourself too Take some poor girl to your heart Philip You don t know how happy it will make you Are you so happy then Kate Kate laughed merrily Why what do you think Dear old Pete how happy he should be said Philip Kate began to hate the very name of Pete She grew angry with Philip also Why couldn t he guess Concealment was eating her heart out The next time she saw Philip he passed her in the market place on the market day as she stood by the tipped up gig selling her butter There was a chatter of girls all round as he bowed and went on This vexed her and she sold out at a penny a pound less got the horse from the Saddle and drove home early On the way to Sulby she overtook Philip and drew up He was walking to Kirk Michael to visit the old Deemster who was ill Would he not take a lift He hesitated half declined and then got into the gig As she settled herself comfortably after this change he trod on the edge of her dress At that he drew quickly away as if he had trodden on her foot She laughed but she was vexed and when he got down at The Manx Fairy saying he might call on his way back in the evening she had no doubt Grannie would be glad to see him The girls of the market place were standing by the mill pond work done and arms crossed under their aprons twittering like the pairing birds about them in the trees when Philip returned home by Sulby He saw Kate coming down the glen road driving two heifers with a cushag for switch and flashing its gold at them in the horizontal gleams of sunset She had recovered her good humour and was swinging along singing merry snatches as she came all life all girlish blood and beauty She pretended not to see him until they were abreast and the heifers were going into the yard Then she said I ve written and told him What said Philip That you say you are a confirmed old bachelor That I say so Yes and that I say you are so distant with a girl that I don t believe you have a heart at all You don t No and that he couldn t have left anybody better to look after me all these years because you haven t eyes or ears or a thought for any living creature except himself You ve never written that to Pete said Philip Haven t I though said Kate and she tripped off on tiptoe He tripped after her She ran into the yard He ran also She opened the gate of the orchard slipped through and made for the door of the dairy and there he caught her by the waist Never you rogue Say no say no he panted No she whispered turning up her lips for a kiss X Grannie saw nothing of Philip that night He went home tingling with pleasure and yet overwhelmed with shame Sometimes he told himself that he was no better than a Judas and sometimes that Pete might never come back The second thought rose oftenest It crossed his mind like a ghostly gleam He half wished to believe it When he counted up the odds against Pete s return his pulse beat quick Then he hated himself He was in torment But under his distracted heart there was a little chick of frightened joy like a young cuckoo hatched in a wagtail s nest After many days in which no further news had come from Pete Kate received this brief letter from Philip I am coming to see you this evening Have something of grave importance to tell you It was afternoon and Kate ran upstairs hurried on her best frock and came down to help Nancy to gather apples in the orchard Black Tom was there new thatching the back of the house and Caesar was making sugganes straw rope for him with a twister There was a soft feel of autumn in the air pigeons were cooing in the ledges of the mill house gable and everything was luminous and tranquil Kate had climbed to the fork of a tree and was throwing apples into Nancy s apron when the orchard gate clicked and she uttered a little cry of joy unawares as Philip entered To cover this she pretended to be falling and he ran to help her Oh it s nothing she said I thought the bough was breaking So it s you Then in a clear voice Is your apron full Nancy Yes Bring another basket then the white one with the handles Did you come Laxey way by the coach Bode over eh Nancy do you really think we ll have sugar enough for all these Keswicks Good evenin mister Christian sir said Caesar And Black Tom from the ladder on the roof nodded his wide straw brim Thatching afresh mister Cregeen Covering it up sir covering it up May the Lord cover our sins up likewise or how shall we cover ourselves from His avenging wrath How vexing said Kate from the tree Half of them get bruised and will be good for nothing but preserving They drop at the first touch so ripe you see May we all be ripe for the great gathering and good for preserving too said Caesar Look at that big one now knotted like a blacksmith s muscles but it ll go rotten as fast as the least lil one of the lot It s taiching us a lesson sir that we all do fall big mountains as aisy as lil cocks This world is changeable Philip was not listening but looking up at Kate with a face of half frightened tenderness Do you know she said I was afraid you must be ill again your apron Nancy that was foolish wasn t it No I have been well enough said Philip Kate looked at him Is it somebody else she said I got your letter Can I help said Philip What is it I m sure there s something said Kate Set your foot here he said Let me down I feel giddy Slowly then Hold by this one Give me your hand Their fingers touched and communicated fire Why don t you tell me she said with a passionate tightening of his hand It s bad news isn t it Are you going away Somebody who went away will never come back he answered Is it Pete Poor Pete is gone said Philip Her throat fluttered Gone He is dead said Philip She tottered but drew herself up quickly Stop she said Let me make sure Is there no mistake Is it true Too true I can bear the truth now but afterwards to night tomorrow in the morning it might kill me if Pete is dead Kate he died at Kimberley Philip She burst into a wild fit of hysterical weeping and buried her face his his breast He put his arms about her thinking to soothe her There be brave Hold yourself firm It s a terrible blow I was too sudden My poor girl My brave girl She clung to him like a terrified child the tears came from under her eyelids tightly closed the flood gates of four years reserve went down in a moment and she kissed him on the lips And throbbing with bliss and a blessed relief from four years hypocrisy and treason he kissed her back and they smiled through their tears Poor Pete Poor Pete Poor Pete XI At the sound of Kate s crying Caesar had thrown away the twister and come close to listen and Black Tom had dropped from the thatch Nancy ran back with the basket and Grannie came hurrying from the house Caesar lifted both hands solemnly Now you that are women control yourselves said he and listen while I spake Peter Quilliam s dead in Kimberley Goodness mercy cried Grannie Lord alive cried Nancy And the two women went indoors threw their aprons over their heads and rocked themselves in their seats Aw boy veen boy veen Kate came tottering in ghostly white and the women fell to comforting her thereby making more tumult with their soothing moans than Kate with her crying Chut Put a good face on it woman said Black Tom A whippa of a girl like you will be getting another soon and singing Hail Smiling Morn with the best Shame on you man Are you as drunk as Mackillya cried Nancy Your own grandson too Never another for Kate anyway wept Grannie Aw boy veen aw boy veen Maybe he had another himself who knows said Black Tom Out of sight out of mind and these sailor lads have a rag on lots of bushes Kate was helped to her room upstairs Philip sat down in the kitchen the news spread like a curragh fire and the barroom was full in five minutes In the midst of all stood Caesar solemn and expansive He turned his herring yonder night when he left goodbye to the four of us he said My father did the same the night he was lost running rum for Whitehaven and I ve never seen a man do it and live It s forgot at you father wept Grannie It was mister Philip that turned it Aw boy veen boy veen How could that be mother said Caesar mister Philip isn t dead But Grannie heard no more She was busy with the consolations of half a dozen women who were gathered around her I dreamt it the night he sailed I heard a cry most terrible I did Father says I what s that It was the same as if I had seen the poor boy coming to his end un timeously And I didn t get a wink on the night Well he has gone to the rest that remaineth said Caesar The grass perisheth and the worm devoureth and well all be in heaven with him soon God forbid father don t talk of such dreadful things said Grannie napping her apron Do you say his mother ma am Is she in life No but under the sod I don t know the years Information of the lungs poor thing I ve known him since I was a slip of a boy said one It was whip top time no it was peg top time I saw him the morning he sailed said another I was standing so mister Christian saw him last moaned Grannie and the people in the bar room peered through at Philip with awe I felt like a father for the lad myself said Caesar he was always my white headed boy and I stuck to him with life He desarved it too Maybe his birth was a bit mischancy but what s the ould saying Don t tell me what I was tell me what I am And Pete was that civil with the tongue a civiller young man never was Black Tom tsht and spat Why you were shouting out of mercy at the lad and knocking him about like putty He wouldn t get lave to live with you and that s why he went away You re bad to forget Thomas I ve always noticed it said Caesar You ll be putting the bell about and praiching his funeral eh Caesar said somebody Deed yes man Sabbath first said Caesar That s impossible father said Grannie How s the girl to have her black ready Sunday week then or Sunday fortnight or the Sunday after the Melliah harvest home said Caesar the crops are waiting for saving but a dead man is past it Oh I ll be faithful I ll give it them straight it s a time for spaking like a dying man to dying men I ll take a tex that ll be a lesson and a warning Ho every one that thirsteth Black Tom tsht and spat again I wouldn t Caesar they ll think you re going to trate them he muttered Philip was asked for particulars and he brought out a letter Jonaique Jelly John the Clerk and Johnny the Constable had come in by this time Read it Jonaique said Caesar A clane pipe first said Black Tom Aren t you smook ing on it Caesar And isn t there a croppa of rum anywhere No Not so much as a plate of crackers and a drop of tay going Is it to be a totaller s funeral then This is no time for feasting to the refreshment of our carnal bodies said Caesar severely It s a time for praise and prayer I ll pud up a word or dwo said the Constable meekly Masther Niplightly said Caesar don t be too ready to show your gift It s vanity I ll engage in prayer myself And Caesar offered praise for all departed in faith and fear Caesar is nod a man of a liberal spirit bud he is powerful in prayer dough whispered the Constable He isn t a prodigal son if that s what you mane said Black Tom Never seen him shouting after anybody with a pint anyway Now for the letter Jonaique said Caesar It was from one of the Gills boys who had sailed with Pete and hitherto served as his letter writer Respected Sir read Jonaique with pain and sorrow I write these few lines to tell you of poor Peter Quilliam Aw boy veen boy veen broke in Grannie Knowing you were his friend in the old island and the one he talked of mostly except the girl Boy ve Hush woman He made good money out here at the diamond mines Never a yellow sovereign he sent to me then said Black Tom nor the full of your fist of ha pence either What s the use of getting grand childers Caesar waved his hand Go on Jonaique It s bad when the deceitfulness of riches is getting the better of a man Where was I Oh good money Yet he was never for taking joy in it More money more cares muttered Caesar But talking and talking and scheming for ever for coming home Ah home is a full cup moaned Grannie It was a show the way that lad was fond of it Give me a plate of mate bolstered with cabbage and what do I care for their buns and sarves Grannie says he Aw boy veen boy bogh What does the nightingale care for a golden cage when he can get a twig said Caesar Is the boy s chest home yet asked John the Clerk There s something about it here said Jonaique if people would only let a man get on It s mine said Black Tom We ll think of that by and bye said Caesar waving his hand to Jonaique He had packed his chest for going when four blacklegs who had been hanging round the compound tempting and plaguing the Kaffirs made off with a bag of stones Desperate gang too so nobody was running to be sent after them But poor Peter being always a bit bull necked was up to the office in a jiffy and Might he go And off in chase in the everin with the twenty Kaffirs of his own company to help him not much of a lot neither and suspected of dealing diamonds with the blacklegs times but Peter always swore their love for him was getting thicker and stronger every day like sour cream The captain s love has been their theme and shall be till they die said Peter He drank up the Word like a thirsty land the rain said Caesar Peter Quilliam and I had mortal joy of each other Good bye father says he and he was shaking me by the hand ter ble But go on Jonaique That was four months ago and a fortnight since eight of his Kaffirs came back Aw dear Well well Lord a massy Hush They overtook the blacklegs far up country and Peter tackled them But they had Winchester repeaters and Peter s boys didn t know the muzzle of a gun from the neck of a gin bottle So the big man of the gang cocked his piece at Peter and shouted at him like a high bailiff You d better go back the way you came Not immajetly said Peter and stretched him Then there was smoke like a smithy on hooping day and To your heels boys shouted Peter And if the boys couldn t equal Peter with their hands they could bate him with their toes and the last they heard of him he was racing behind them with the shots of the blacklegs behind him and shouting mortal Oh oh All up I m done Home and tell boys Oh oh Rejoice not against me O mine enemy When I fall I shall arise Selah said Caesar Amid the tumult of moans which followed the reading Philip sitting with head on his hand by the ingle grew hot and cold with the thought that after all there was no actual certainty that Pete was dead Nobody had seen him die nobody had buried him the story of the returned Kaffirs might be a lie to cover their desertion of Pete their betrayal of him or their secret league with the thieving Boers At one awful moment Philip asked himself how he had ever believed the letter Perhaps he had wanted to believe it Nancy Joe touched him on the shoulder Kate is waiting for a word with you alone sir she said and Philip crossed the kitchen into the little parlour beyond chill with china and bowls of sea eggs and stuffed sea birds He s feeling it bad said Nancy Never been the same since Pete went to the Cape said Caesar I don t know for sure what good lads are going to it for moaned Grannie And calling it Good Hope of all names Died of a bullet in his head too aw dear aw dear Discussion of the brain it s like And look at them black heads too as naked as my hand I ll go bail I hate the nasty dirts Caesar may talk of one flesh and brethren and all to that but for my part I m not used of black brothers and as for black angels in heaven it s ridiculous When you re all done talking I ll finish the letter said Jonaique They can t help it mister Jelly the women can t help it said Caesar Respected Sir I must now close but we are strapping up the chest of the deceased just as he left it and sending it to catch the steamer the Johannesburg leaving Cape Town Wednesday fortnight Hm Johannesburg I ll meet her at the quay it s my duty to meet her said Caesar And I ll board her in the bay shouted Black Tom Thomas Quilliam said Caesar it s borne in on my spirit that the devil of greed is let loose on you Caesar Cregeen don t make a nose of wax of me bawled Tom and don t think because you re praiching a bit that religion is going to die with you Your head s swelling tre menjous and you won t be able to sleep soon without somebody to tickle your feet You ll be forgiving sins next and taking money for absolution and these ones will be making a pope of you and paying you pence Pope Caesar the publican in his chapel hat and white choker But that chiss is mine and if there s law in the land I ll have it With that Black Tom swept out of the house and Caesar wiped his eyes No use smoothing a thistle mister Cregeen said Jonaique soothingly I ve a conscience void of offence said Caesar I can only follow the spirit s leading But when Belial He was interrupted by a most mournful cry of Look here Aw look then look Nancy was coming out of the back kitchen with something between the tips of her fingers It was a pair of old shoes covered with dirt and cobwebs These were his wearing boots she said and she put them on the counter Dear heart yes the very ones said Grannie Poor boy they d move a heart of stone to see them Something to remember him by anyway Many a mile his feet walked in them but they re resting now in Abraham s bosom Then Caesar s voice rose loud over the doleful tones around the counter Vital Spark of Heavenly Flame raise it mister Niplightly Pity we haven t Peter and his fiddle here he played with life I can d sing to day having a cold bud I ll whisle id said the Constable Pitch it in altoes then said Caesar I m a bit of a base myself but not near so base as Peter Meanwhile a little drama of serious interest was going on upstairs There sat Kate before the looking glass with flushed cheeks and quivering mouth The low drone of many voices came to her through the floor Then a dull silence and one voice and Nancy Joe coming and going between the kitchen and bedroom What are they doing now Nancy said Kate First one s praying and then another s praying said Nancy Lord a massy thinks I it ll be my turn next and what ll I say Where s mister Christian Gone into the parlour I whispered him you wanted him alone You never said that Nancy said Kate at Nancy s reflection in the glass Well it popped out said Nancy Kate went down with a look of softened sorrow and Philip without lifting his eyes began bemoaning Pete They would never know his like so simple so true so brave never never He was fighting against his shame at first seeing the girl after that kiss which seemed to him now like treason at the mouth of a grave But with the magic of a woman s art Kate consoled him He had one great comfort he had been a loyal friend such fidelity such constancy such affection forgetting the difference of place of education everything Philip looked up at last and there was the lovely face with its beaming eyes He turned to go and she said softly How we shall miss you Why so said Philip We can t expect to see you so often now now that you ve not the same reason for coming I ll be here on Sunday said Philip Then you don t intend to desert us yet not just yet Philip Never said Philip Well good night Not that way not by the porch Good night As Philip went down the road in the darkness he heard the words of the hymn that was being sung inside Thy glory why didst Thou enshrine In such a clod of earth as mine And wrap Thee in my clay XII At that moment day was breaking over the plains of the Transvaal The bare Veldt was opening out as the darkness receded depth on depth like the surface of an unbroken sea Not a bush not a path only a few log houses at long distances and wooden beacons like gibbets to define the Boer farms No sound in the transparent air no cloud in the unveiling sky just the night creeping off in silence as if in fear of awakening the sleeping morning Across the soulless immensity a covered waggon toiled along with four horses rattling their link chains and a lad sideways on the shaft dangling his legs twiddling the rope reins and whistling Inside the waggon under a little window with its bit of muslin curtain a man lay in the agony of a bullet wound in his side and an old Boer and a woman stood beside him He was lying hard on the place of his pain and rambling in delirium See boys Don t you see them See what my lad said the Boer simply and he looked through the waggon window There s the head gear of the mines Look the iron roofs are glittering And yonder s the mine tailings We ll be back in a jiffy A taste of the whip boys and away Untouched by visions the old Boer could see nothing What does he see wife think you What can he see stupid with his face in the pillow like that With the rushing of blood in his ears the sick man called out again Listen Don t you hear it That s the noise of the batteries Whip up and away Away and he tore at the fringe of the blanket covering him with his unconscious fingers Poor boy he s eager to get to the coast But will he live to cover another morgen think you God knows Jan God only knows And the Veldt was very wide and the sea and its ships were far away and over the weary stretch of grass and rock and sand there was nothing on the horizon between desolate land and dominating sky but a waste looking like a chaos of purple and green where no bird ever sang and no man ever lived and God Himself was not XIII She loves me She loves me She loves me The words sang in Philip s ears like a sweet tune half the way back to Ballure Then he began to pluck at the brambles by the wayside to wound his hand by snatching at the gorse and to despise himself for being glad when he should have been in grief Still he was sure of it there was no making any less of it She loved him he was free to love her there need be no hypocrisy and no self denial so he wiped the blood from his fingers and crept into the blue room of Auntie Nan The old lady in a dainty cap with flying streamers was sitting by the fireside spinning She had heard the news of Pete as Philip passed through to Sulby and was now wondering if it was not her duty to acquaint Uncle Peter The sweet and natty old gentlewoman brought up in the odour of gentility was thinking on the lines of poor Bridget Black Tom when dying under the bare scraas that a man s son was his son in spite of law or devil She decided against telling the Ballawhaine by remembering an incident in the life of his father It was about Philip s father too so Philip stretched his legs from the sofa towards the hearth and listened to the old Auntie s voice over the whirr of her wheel with another voice a younger voice an unheard voice breaking in at the back of his ears when the wheel stopped and a sweet undersong inside of him always saying Be sensible there is no disloyalty Pete is dead Poor Pete Poor old Pete Though he had cast your father off Philip for threatening to make your mother his wife he never believed there was a parson on the island would dare to marry them against his wish No really No and when Uncle Peter came in at dinner time a week after and said It s all over he said No sir no and threw down his spoon in the plate and the hot broth splashed on my hand I remember But Peter said It s past praying for sir and then grandfather cried No I tell you no But I tell you yes sir said Peter Maughold Church yesterday morning before service Then grandfather lost himself and called Peter Liar and cried that your father couldn t do it And besides he s my own son after all and would not said grandfather But I could see that he believed what Uncle Peter had told him and when Peter began to cry he said Forgive me my boy I m your father for all and I ve a right to your forgiveness All the same he wouldn t be satisfied until he had seen the register and I had to go with him to the church Poor old grandfather The vicar in those days was a little dotty man named Kissack and it was the joy of his life to be always crushing and stifling somebody because somebody was always depriving him of his rights or something I remember him the Cockatoo His favourite text was Jesus said then follow Me only the people declared he always wanted to go first Shocking Philip It was evening when we drove up to Maughold and the little parson was by the Cross ordering somebody with a cane I am told you married my son yesterday is it true said grandfather Quite true said the vicar By banns or special license grandfather asked License of course the vicar answered Curt enough any way Show me the register said grandfather and his face twitched and his voice was thick Can t you believe me said the vicar The register said grandfather Then the vicar turned the key in the church door and strutted up the aisle humming something I tried to keep grandfather back even then What s the use I said for I knew he was only fighting against belief But hat in hand he followed to the Communion rail and there the vicar laid the open book before him Oh Philip shall I ever forget it How it all comes back the little dim church the smell of damp and of velvet under the holland covers of the pulpit and the empty place echoing And grandfather fixed his glasses and leaned over the register but he could see nothing only blurr blurr blurr You look at it child he said over his shoulder But I daren t face it so he rubbed his glasses and leaned over the book again Oh dear he was like one who looks down the list of the slain for the name he prays he may not find But the name was there too surely Thomas Wilson Christian to Mona Crellin signed Wm Crellin and something Kissack Philip s breath came hot and fast The little vicar was swinging his cane to and fro on the other side of the rail and smiling and grandfather raised his eyes to him and said Do you know what you ve done sir You ve robbed me of my first born son and ruined him Nonsense sir said the vicar Your son was of age and his wife had the sanction of her father Was I to go round by Ballawhaine for permission to do my duty as a clergyman Duty cried grandfather When a young man marries he marries for heaven or for hell Your duty as a clergyman he cried till his voice rang in the roof If a son of yours had his hand at his throat would you call it my duty as Deemster to hand him a knife Silence sir said the vicar Remember where you stand or Deemster though you are you shall repent it Arrest me for brawling will you cried grandfather and he snatched the cane out of the vicar s hand and struck him across the breast Arrest me now he said and then tottered and stumbled out of the church by my arm and the doors of the empty pews Philip went to bed that night with burning brow and throbbing throat He had made a startling discovery He was standing where his father had stood before him he was doing what his father had done he was in danger of his father s fate Where was his head that he had never thought of this before It was hard it was terrible Now that he was free to love the girl he realised what it meant to love her Nevertheless he was young and he rebelled he fought he would not deliberate The girl conquered in his heart that night and he lay down to sleep But next morning he told himself with a shudder that it was lucky he had gone no farther One step more and all the evil of his father s life might have been repeated in his own There had been nothing said nothing done He would go to Sulby no more XIV That mood lasted until mid day and then a scout of the line of love began to creep into his heart in disguise He reminded himself that he had promised to go on Sunday and that it would be unseemly to break off the acquaintance too suddenly lest the simple folks should think he had borne with them throughout four years merely for the sake of Pete But after Sunday he would take a new turn He found Kate dressed as she had never been before Instead of the loose red bodice and the sun bonnet the apron and the kilted petticoat she wore a close fitting dark green frock with a lace collar The change was simple but it made all the difference She was not more beautiful but she was more like a lady It was Sunday evening and the Fairy was closed Csesar and Grannie were at the preaching house Nancy Joe was cooking crowdie for supper and Kate and Philip talked The girl was quieter than Philip had ever known her more modest more apt to blush and with the old audacity of word and look quite gone They talked of success in life and she said How I should like to fight my way in the world as you are doing But a woman can do nothing to raise herself Isn t it hard Whatever the place where she was born in she must remain there all her days She can see her brothers rise and her friends perhaps but she must remain below Isn t it a pity It isn t that she wants to be rich or great No not that only she doesn t want to be left behind by the people she likes She must be though and just because she s a woman I m sure it s so in the Isle of Man anyway Isn t it cruel But aren t you forgetting something said Philip Yes If a woman can t rise of herself because the doors of life are locked to her it is always possible for a man to raise her Some one who loves her you mean and so lifts her to his own level and takes her up with him as he goes up Why not said Philip Kate s eyes beamed like sunshine That is lovely she said in a low voice Do you know I never thought of that before If it were my case I should like that best of all Side by side with him and he doing all Oh that is beautiful And she gazed up with a timid joy at the inventive being who had thought of this as at something supernatural Caesar and Grannie came back both in fearful outbursts of Sunday clothes Nevertheless Caesar s eyes after the first salutation with Philip fixed themselves on Kate s unfamliar costume Such worldly attire he muttered following the girl round the kitchen and blowing up his black gloves This caring for the miserable body that will one day be lowered into the grave What does the Book say put my tall hat on the clane laff Nancy Let it not be the outward adorning of putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart But sakes alive father said Grannie loosening a bonnet like a diver s helmet if it comes to that what is Jeremiah saying Can a maid forget her ornaments It s like she can if she hasn t any to remember said Caesar But maybe the prophet Jeremiah didn t know the mothers that s in now Chut man Girls are like birds and the breed comes out in the feathers said Grannie Where s she getting it then Not from me at all said Caesar Deed no man laughed Grannie considering the smart she is and the rasonable good looking Hould your tongue woman it ll become you better said Caesar Philip rose to go You re time enough yet sir cried Caesar I was for telling you of a job Some of the fishermen of Ramsey had been over on Saturday Their season was a failure and they were loud in their protests against the trawlers who were destroying the spawn Caesar had suggested a conference at his house on the following Saturday of Ramsey men and Peel men and recommended Philip as an advocate to advise with them as to the best means to put a stop to the enemies of the herring Philip promised to be there and then went home to Auntie Nan He told himself on the way that Kate was completely above her surroundings and capable of becoming as absolute a lady as ever lived on the island without a sign of her origin in look or speech except perhaps the rising inflexion in her voice which made the talk of the true Manxwoman the sweetest thing in the world to listen to Auntie Nan was sitting by the lamp reading her chapter before going to bed Auntie said Philip don t you think the tragedy in the life of father was accidental Due I mean to the particular characters of grandfather and poor mother Now if the one had been less proud less exclusive or the other more capable of rising with her husband The tragedy was deeper than that dear let me tell you a story said Auntie Nan laying down her book Three days after your father left Ballawhaine old Maggie the housemaid came to my side at supper and whispered that some one was wanting me in the garden It was Thomas Oh dear it was terrible to see him there that ought to have been the heir of everything standing like a stranger in the dark beyond the kitchen door Poor father said Philip Whist girl come out of the light he whispered There s a purse with twenty pounds odd in my desk upstairs get it Nan here s the key I knew what he wanted the money for but I couldn t help it I got him the purse and put ten pounds more of my own in it Must you do it I said I must he answered Your father says everybody will despise you for this marriage I said Better they should than I should despise myself said he But he calls it moral suicide I said That s not so bad as moral murder he replied He knows the island I urged and so do you Tom and so do I and nobody can hold up his head in a little place like this after a marriage like that All the worse for the place said he if it stains a man s honour for acting honourably Father was an upright man interrupted Philip There s no question about it my father was a gentleman She must be a sweet good girl and worthy of you or you wouldn t marry her said I to father but are you sure that you will be happy and make her happy We shall have each other and it is our own affair said father Precisely said Philip But if there is a difference between you now I said will it be less when you are the great man we hope to see you some day A man is not always thinking of success he answered My father was a great man already Auntie burst out Philip He was shaken and I was ashamed but I could not help it I went on Has the marriage gone too far I asked It has never been mentioned between us said he Your father is old and can t live long I pleaded He wants me to behave like a scoundrel he answered Why that if the girl has no right to you yet I said and he was silent Then I crept up and looked in at the window See I whispered he s in the library We ll take him by surprise Come It was not to be There was a smell of tobacco on the air and the thud of a step on the grass Who s that I said Who should it be cried father but the same spy again I ll shake the life out of him yet as a terrier would a rat No use girl he shouted hoarsely facing towards the darkness they re driving me to destruction Hush I said and covered his mouth with my hands and his breath was hot like fire But it was useless He was married three days afterwards Philip resolved to see Kate no more He must go to Sulby on Saturday to meet the fishermen but that would be a business visit he need not prolong it into a friendly one All the week through he felt as if his heart would break but he resolved to conquer his feelings He pitied himself somewhat and that helped him to rise above his error XV On Saturday night he was early at Sulby The bat room was thronged with fishermen in guernseys sea boots and sou westers They were all on their feet together twisting about like great congers on the quay drinking a little and smoking a great deal thumping the table and all talking at once How ve you done Billy Enough to keep away the divil and the coroner and that s about all Where s Tom Dug Gone to Austrilla Is Jimmy over to day He s away to Cleveland Gough bless me every Manx boy seems to be going foreign That s where we ll all be after long and last if we don t stop these southside trawlers Philip went in and was received with goodwill and rough courtesy but no man abated a jot of his freedom of action or liberty of speech and the thumping and shouting were as loud as before Appeal to the Receiver General Chut an ould woman with a face winking at you like a roast potato Will we go to the Bishop then A whitewashed Methodist with a soul the size of a dried pea The Governor is the proper person said Philip above the hubbub and he is to visit Peel Castle next Saturday afternoon about the restorations Let every Manx fisherman who thinks the trawl boats are enemies of the fish be there that day Then lay your complaint before the man whose duty it is to inquire into all such grievances and if you want a spokesman I m ready to speak for you Bravo That s the ticket Then the meeting was at an end the men went on with stories of the week s fishing stories of smugglers stories of the Swaddlers the Wesleyans stories of the totalers teetotallers and Philip made for the door When he got there he began to reflect that being in the house he ought to leave good night with Caesar and Grannie Hardly decent not to do so No use hurting people s feelings Might as well be civil Cost nothing anyway Thus an overpowering compulsion in the disguise of courtesy drew him again into Kate s company but to morrow he would take a new turn Proud to see you mister Philip said Caesar The water s playing in the kettle make mister Philip a cup of tay Nancy said Grannie Caesar was sitting back to the partition pretending to read out of a big Bible on his knees but listening with both ears and open mouth to the profane stories being told in the bar room Kate was not in the kitchen but an open book face downwards lay on the chair by the turf closet What s this said Philip A French exercise book Whoever can it belong to here Aw Kirry of coorse said Grannie and sticking that close to it of an everin that you haven t a chance to put a word on her Vanity sir vanity all vanity said Caesar and again he listened hard Philip s eyes began to blink Teaching herself French is she Has she been doing it long Grannie Long enough sir three years or better since poor Pete went away maybe and at the books for ever grammars and tex books and I don t know what Caesar with his ear at the glass made an impatient gesture for silence but Grannie continued I don t know what for people should be larning themselves foreign languages at all For my part there isn t one of them bates the Manx itself for plainness And aren t we reading when the Lord wanted to bring confusion on Noah and his disobedient sons and grandsons at going up the Tower of Babel he made them spake different tongues Good thing too snapped Caesar if every poor man was bound to carry his wife up with him Philip s eyes were streaming and unobserved he put the lesson book to his lips He had guessed its secret The girl was making herself worthy of him God bless her Kate came downstairs in the dark dress and white collar of Sunday night She saw Philip putting down the book lowered her head and blushed took up the volume and smuggled it out of sight Then Caesar s curiosity conquered his propriety and he ventured into the bar room Grannie came and went between the counter and the fishermen Nancy clicked about from dairy to door and Kate and Philip were left alone You were wrong the other night she said I have been thinking it over and you were quite quite wrong So If a man marries a woman beneath him he stoops to her and to stoop to her is to pity her and to pity her is to be ashamed of her and to be ashamed of her would kill her So you are wrong Yes said Philip Yes said Kate but do you know what it ought to be The woman ought to marry beneath herself and the man above himself then as much as the woman descends the man rises and so don t you see She faltered and stopped and Philip said Aren t you talking nonsense Kate Indeed sir Kate pretended to be angry at the rebuff and pouted her lips but her eyes were beaming There is neither above nor below where there is real liking said Philip If you like any one and she is necessary to your life that is the sign of your natural equality It is God s sign and all the rest is only man s book keeping You mean said Kate trying to keep a grave mouth you mean that if a woman belongs to some one she can like and some one belongs to her that is being equal and everything else is nothing Eh Why not said Philip It was music to her but she wagged her head solemnly and said I m sure you re wrong Philip I am though Yes indeed I am But it s no use arguing Not against you Only The glorious choir of love birds in her bosom were singing so loud that she could say no more and the irresistible one had his way After a while she stuffed something into the fire What s that said Philip Oh nothing she answered brightly It was the French exercise book XVI Philip went home rebelling against his father s fate It was accidental it was inevitable only in the Isle of Man But perdition to the place where a man could not marry the woman he loved if she chanced to be born in the manger instead of the stable loft Perdition to the land where a man could not live unless he was a skunk or a cur Thank God the world was wide That night he said to Auntie Nan Auntie why didn t father go away when he found the tide setting so strongly against him He always meant to but he never could said Auntie Nan A woman isn t like a man ready to pitch her tent here to day and there to morrow We re more like cats dear and cling to the places we re used to if they re only ruins of tumbling stones Your mother wasn t happy in the Isle of Man but she wouldn t leave it Your father wouldn t go without her and then there was the child He was here for weal or woe for life or death When he married his wife he made the chain that bound him to the island as to a rock It wouldn t be like that with Kate thought Philip But did Auntie know anything Had somebody told her Was she warning him On Sunday night on the way home from church she talked of his father again He came to see at last that it wasn t altogether his own affair either she said It was the night he died Your mother had been unwell and father had sent for me It was a dark night and late very late and they brought me down the hill from Lewaige Cottage with a lantern Father was sinking but he would get out of bed We were alone together then he and I except for you and you were asleep in your cot by the window He made straight for it and struggled down on his knees at its side by help of the curtains Listen he said trying to whisper though he could not for his poor throat was making noises You were catching your breath as if sobbing in your sleep Poor little boy he s dreaming said I let me turn him on his side It s not that said father he went to sleep in trouble I remember it Auntie said Philip Perhaps he had been trying to tell me something My boy my son forgive me I have sinned against you he said and he tried to reach over the cot rail and put his lips to your forehead but his poor head shook like palsy and bobbed down into your little face I remember you rubbed your nose with your little fist but you did not waken Then I helped him back to bed and the table with the medicine glasses jingled by the trembling of his other hand It s dark all all dark Nannie he said sure some angel will bring me light and I was so simple I thought he meant the lamp for it was dying down and I lit a candle Philip went about his work that week as if the spirit of his father were hovering over him warning him when awake in words of love and pleading crying to him in his sleep in tones of anger and command Stand back you are at the edge of the precipice Nevertheless his soul rose in rebellion against this league as of the past and the dead It was founded in vanity in the desire for glory and success Only let a man renounce the world and all that the world can give and he can be true to himself to his heart s impulse to his honour and to his love He would deliberate no longer He despised himself for deliberating If was the world against Kate let the world go to perdition XVII On Saturday afternoon he was at Peel It was a beautiful day the sun was shining and the bay was blue and flat and quiet The tide was down the harbour was empty of water but full of smacks with hanging sails and hammocks of nets and lines of mollags bladders up to the mast heads A flight of seagulls were fishing in the mud and swirling through the brown wings of the boats and crying A flag floated over the ruins of the castle the church bells were ringing and the harbour masters were abroad in best blue and gold buttons On the tilting ground of the castle the fishermen had gathered sixteen hundred strong There were trawlers among them Manx Irish and English prowling through the crowd and scooping up the odds and ends of gossip as their boats on the bottom scraped up the little fish Occasionally they were observed by the herring fishers and then there were high words and free fights Taking a creep round from Port le Murrey are you Dan Thought I d put a sight on Peel to day Bad for your complexion though might turn it red I m thinking Strek me with blood will you I d just like you to strek me begough I d put a Union Jack on your face as big as a griddle The Governor came an elderly man with a formidable air an aquiline nose and cheeks pitted with small pox Philip introduced the fishermen and told their grievance Trawling destroyed immature fish and so contributed to the failure of the fisheries They asked for power to stop it in the bays of the island and within three miles of the coast Then draft me a bill with that object mister Christian said the Governor and the meeting ended with cheers for His Excellency shouts for Philip and mutterings of contempt from the trawlers Didn t think there was a man on the island could spake like it But hasn t your fancy man been rubbing his back agen the college I d take lil tacks home if I was yourself Dan Drink much more and it ll be two feet deep inside of you Philip was hurrying away under the crumbling portcullis when a deputation of the fishermen approached him What are we owing you mister Christian asked their spokesman Nothing answered Philip We thank you sir and you ll be hearing from us again Meanwhile a word if you plaze sir What is it men said Philip When a young man can spake like yonder it s a gift sir and he s houlding it in trust for something The ould island s wanting a big man ter ble bad and it hasn t seen the like since the days of your own grandfather Good everin and thank you good everin With that the rough fellows dismissed him at the ferry steps and he hastened to the market place where he had left his horse On putting up he had seen Caesar s gig tipped up in the stable yard It was now gone and without asking questions he mounted and made towards Ramsey He took the old road by the cliffs and as he cantered and galloped he hummed and whistled and sang and slashed the trees to keep himself from thinking At the crest of the hill he sighted the gig in front and at Port Lady he came up with it Kate was driving and Caesar was nodding and dozing You ve been having a great day mister Christian said Caesar Wish I could say the same for myself but the heart of man is decaitful sir and desperately wicked I m not one to clap people in the castle and keep them from sea for debts of drink and they re taking a mane advantage Not a penny did I get to day sir and many a yellow sovereign owing to me If I was like some now there s that Tom Raby Glen Meay He saw Dan the Spy coming from the total meeting last night Taken the pledge Dan says he Yes I have says Dan I m plazed to hear it says he come in and I ll give you a good glass of rum for it And Dan took the rum for taking the pledge and there he was as drunk as Mackilley in the castle this morning Philip listened as he rode and a half melancholy half mocking expression played on his face He was thinking of his grandfather old Iron Christian brought into relation with his mother s father captain Billy Ballure of the dainty gentility of Auntie Nan and the unctuous vulgarity of the father of Kate Caesar grumbled himself to sleep at last and then Philip was alone with the girl and riding on her side of the gig She was quiet at first but a joyous smile lit up her face I was in the castle too she said with a look of pride The sun went down over the waters behind them and cast their brown shadows on the road in front the twilight deepened the night came down the moon rose in their faces and the stars appeared They could hear the tramp of the horses hoofs the roll of the gig wheels the wash and boom of the sea on their left and the cry Of the sea fowl somewhere beneath The lovelinese and warmth of the autumn night stole over Kate and she began to keep up a flow of merry chatter I can tell all the sounds of the fields in the darkness By the moonlight No but with my eyes shut if you like Now try me She closed her eyes and went on Do you hear that that patter like soft rain That s oats nearly ripe for harvest Do you hear that then that pit a pat like sheep going by on the street That s wheat just ready And there that whiss whiss whiss That s barley She opened her eyes Don t you think I m very clever Philip felt an impulse to lean over the wheel and put his arms about the girl s neck Take care she cried merrily your horse is shying He gazed at her face lit up in the white moonlight How bright and happy you seem Kate he said with a shiver and then he laid one hand on the gig rail Her eyelids quivered her mouth twitched and she answered gaily Why not Aren t you You ought to be you know How glorious to succeed It means so much new things to see new houses to visit new pleasures new friends Her joyous tones broke down in a nervous laugh at that last word and he replied in a faltering voice That may be true of the big world over yonder Kate but it isn t so in a little island like ours To succeed here is like going up the tower of Castle Rushen with some one locking the doors on the stone steps behind you At every storey the room becomes less until at the top you have only space to stand alone Then if you should ever come down again there s but one way for you over the battlements with a crash She looked up at him with startled eyes and his own were large and full of trouble They were going through Kirk Michael by the house of the Deemster who was ill and both drew rein and went slowly Some acacias in the garden slashed their broadswords in the night air and a windmill behind stood out against the moon like a gigantic bat The black shadow of the horses stepped beside them Are you feeling lonely to night Philip I m feeling Yes I m feeling as if the dead and the living the living and the dead oh Kate Kate I don t know what I m feeling She put her hand caressingly on the top of his hand Never mind dear she said softly I ll stand by you You shan t be alone XVIII It was midday then on the tropic seas and the horizon was closing in with clouds as of blood and vapours of stifling heat A steamship was rolling in a heavy swell under winds that were as hot as gusts from an open furnace Under its decks a man lay in an atmosphere of fever and the sickening odour of bandages and stale air Above the throb of the engines and the rattle of the rudder chain he heard a step going by his open door and he called in a feeble voice that was cheerful and almost merry but yet the voice of a homesick boy How many days from home engineer Not more than twenty now Put on steam mate put it on Wish I could be skipping below and stoking up for you like mad As the ship rolled the green reflection of the water and the red light of the sky shot alternately through the porthole and lit up the berth like firelight flashing in a dead house Ask the boys if they ll carry me on deck sir just for a breath of fresh air The sailors came and carried him You can do anything for a chap like that The big sun was straight overhead weighing down on their shoulders and there was no shelter anywhere for the shadows were under foot Slip out the sails lads and let s fly along Wish I could tumble up the rigging myself and look out from the yards same as a gull but I m only an ould parrot chained down to my stick They left him and he gazed out on the circle of water and the vapour shaking over it like a veil The palpitating air was making the circle smaller every minute but the world seem cruelly large for all that He was looking beyond the visible things he was listening deeper than the wash of the waves he was dreaming dreaming Apparitions were floating in the heat clouds over him Home Its voices whispered at his ear its face peered into his eyes But the hot winds came up and danced round him the air the sea the sky the whole world the utter universe seemed afire his eyes rolled upwards to his brow he almost choked and fainted Carry him below poor fellow He s got a good heart to think he ll ever see home again He ll never see it Half way down the companion ladder he opened his eyes with a look of despair Would God let him die after all XIX Kate began to feel that Philip was slipping away from her He loved her she was sure of that but something was dragging them apart Her great enemy was Philip s success This was rapid and constant She wanted to rejoice in it she struggled to feel glad and happy and even proud But that was impossible It was ungenerous it was mean but she could not help it she resented every fresh mark of Philip s advancement The world that was carrying Philip up was carrying him away She would be left far below It would be presumptuous to lift her eyes to him Visions came to her of Philip in other scenes than her scenes among ladies in drawing rooms beautiful educated clever able to talk of many things beyond her knowledge Then she looked at herself and felt vexed with her hands made coarse by the work of the farm at her father and felt ashamed of the moleskin clothes he wore in the mill at her home and flushed deep at the thought of the bar room It was small and pitiful she knew that and she shuddered under the sense of being a meaner hearted girl than she had ever thought If she could do something of herself to counteract the difference made by Philip s success if she could raise herself a little she would be content to keep behind to let him go first to see him forge ahead of her and of everybody being only in sight and within reach But she could do nothing except writhe and rebel against the network of female custom or tear herself in the thorny thicket of female morals Harvest had begun half the crop of Glenmooar had been saved a third was in stook and then a wet day had come and stopped all work in the fields On this wet day in the preaching room of the mill amid forms and desks with the cranch of the stones from below the wash of the wheel from outside and the rush of the uncrushed corn from above Caesar sat rolling sugganes for the stackyard with Kate working the twister and going backward before him and half his neighbours sheltering from the rain and looking on Thought I d have a sight up and tell you said Kelly the postman What s the news mister Kelly said Caesar The ould Dempster s dying said Kelly You don t say said everybody Well as good as dying at ten minutes wanting eight o clock this morning said the postman The drink s been too heavy for the man said John the clerk Wine is a serpent and strong drink a mocker said Caesar Who ll be the new Dempster mister Niplightly said Jonaique Hm snuffled the constable easing his helmet dat s a serious matter mister Jelly We ll dake our time well dake our time Chut There s only one man for it said Caesar Perhaps yes perhaps no said the constable Do you mane the young Ballawhaine mister Cregeen said the postman Do I mane fiddlesticks said Caesar Well the man s father is at the Govenar reg lar they re telling me said Kelly and Ross is this and Ross is that Every dog praises his own tail said Caesar I m not denying it the man isn t fit he has sold himself to the devil that s a fact No he hasn t said Caesar the devil gets the like for nothing But he s a Christian for all and the Christians have been Dempsters time out of time Is he the only Christian that s in then eh said Caesar Go on Kate twist away Is it mister Philip Aw I m saying nothing against mister Philip said the postman You wouldn t get lave in this house anyway said Caesar Aw a right gentleman and no pride at all said the postman As free and free with a poor man and no making aisy either I ve nothing agen him myself No but a bit young for a Dempster isn t he Just a taste young as the man said eh Older than the young Ballawhaine anyway said John the clerk Aw make him Dempster then I m raising no objection said mister Kelly Go on girl Does that twister want oiling Feed it woman feed it said Caesar His father should have been Dempster before him said John the clerk Would have been too only he went crooked when he married on yonder woman She s through though and what more natural The rope stopped again and Kate s voice hard and thick came from the farther end of it His mother being dead eh It was the mother that done for the father anyway said the clerk Consequently said Kate he is to praise God that his mother is gone That girl wants a doctor muttered Jonaique The man couldn t drag the woman up after him began the clerk It s always the way Just that said Kate with bitter irony Of coorse I m not for saying it was the woman s fault entirely Don t apologise for her said Kate She s gone and forgotten and that being so her son has now a chance of being Deemster So he has shouted Caesar and not second Dempster only but first Dempster itself in time and go on with the twister Kate laughed loudly and cried Why don t you keep it up when your hand s in First Deemster Christian and then Sir Philip Christian and then Lord Christian and then But you re talking nonsense and you re a pack of tattlers There s no thought of making Philip Christian a Deemster and no hope of it and no chance of it and I trust there never will be So saying she flung the twister on the floor and rushed out of the mill sobbing hysterically doctor Clucas is wonderful for females and young girls said Jonaique It s that Ross again muttered Caesar And he ll have her yet said Kelly the postman I d see her dead first said Caesar It would be the jaws of hell and the mouth of Satan That she who loved Philip to distraction should be the first to abuse and defame him was agony near to madness for Kate knew where she stood It was not merely that Philip s success was separating them not merely that the conventions of life its usages its manners and its customs were putting worlds between them The pathos of the girl s position was no accidental thing It was a deeper older matter it was the same to day as it had been yesterday and would be to morrow it began in the garden of Eden and would go on till the last woman died it was the natural inferiority of woman in relation to man She had the same passions as Philip and was moved by the same love But she was not free Philip alone was free She had to wait on Philip s will on Philip s word She saw Philip slipping away from her but she could not snatch at him before he was gone she could not speak first she could not say I love you stay with me She was a woman only a woman How wretched to be a woman How cruel But ah the dear delicious thought It came stealing up into her heart when the red riot was nearly killing her What a glorious thing it was to be a woman after all What a powerful thing What a lovely and beloved thing To rule the king being the slave was sweeter than to be the king himself That was woman s place It was where heaven itself had put her from the beginning until now What weapons had it given her Beauty Charm Love The joy of it To be the weak and overcome the strong To be nothing in the battle of life and yet conqueror of all the world Kate vowed that come what would Philip should never leave her XX On the day when the last of the harvest is saved in the Isle of Man the farmer gives a supper to his farm people and to the neighbours who have helped him to cut and house it This supper attended by simple and beautiful ceremonies is called the Melliah The parson may be asked to it and if there is a friend of position and free manners he also is invited Caesar s Melliah fell within a week of the rope making in the mill and partly to punish Kate partly to honour himself he asked Philip to be present He ll come thought Kate with secret joy I m sure he ll come and in this certainty when the day of Melliah came she went up to her room to dress for it She was to win Philip that day or lose him for ever It was to be her trial day she knew that She was to fight as for her life and gain or lose everything It was to be a battle royal between all the conventions of life all the network of female custom all the inferiority of a woman s position as God himself had suffered it to be and one poor girl She began to cry but struggling with her sadness she dashed the tears from her glistening eyes What was there to cry about Philip wanted to love her and he should he must It was a glorious day and not yet more than two o clock Nancy had washed up the dinner things the fire irons were polished the boots and spare whips were put up on the lath the old hats like lines of heads on a city gate were hung round the kitchen walls the hearthrug was down the turf was piled up on the fire the kettle was singing from the slowrie and the whole house was taking its afternoon nap Kate s bedroom looked over the orchard and across the stackyard up the glen She could see the barley stack growing in the haggard the laden cart coming down the glen road with the driver three decks up over the mare now half smothered and looking suddenly little like a snail under the gigantic load and beyond the long meadow and the Bishop s bridge the busy fields dotted with the yellow stooks and their black shadows like a castle s studded doors When she had thrown off her blue black dress to wash her arms and shoulders and neck were bare She caught sight of herself in the glass and laughed with delight The years had brought her a fuller flow of life She was beautiful and she knew it And Philip knew it too but he should know it to day as he had never known it before She folded her arms in their roundness over her bosom in its fulness and walked up and down the little room over the sheep skin rugs under the turfy scraas glowing in the joy of blooming health and conscious loveliness Then she began to dress She took from a drawer two pairs of stockings one black and the other red and weighed their merits with moral gravity which The red had it and then came the turn of the boots There was a grand new pair with countless buttons two toecaps like two flowers and an upward curve like the arm of a glove She tried them on bent back and forward but relinquished them with a sigh in favour of plain shoes cut under the ankles and tied with tape Her hair was a graver matter Its tangled curls had never satisfied her She tried all means to bring them into subjection but the roll on top was ridiculous and the roll behind was formal She attempted long waves over the temples It was impossible With a lash comb she dragged her hair back to its natural lawlessness and when it fell on her forehead and over her ears and around her white neck in little knowing rings that came and went and peeped out and slid back like kittens at hide and seek she laughed and was content From a recess covered by a shawl running on a string she took down her bodice It was a pink blouse loose over the breast like hills of red sand on the shore and loose too over the arms but tight at the wrist When she put it on it lit up her head like a gleam from the sunset and her eyes danced with delight The skirt was a print with a faint pink flower the sash was a band of cotton of the colour of the bodice and then came the solemn problems of the throat It was round and full and soft and like a tower She would have loved to leave it bare but dared not Out of a drawer under the looking glass she took a string of pearls They were a present from Kimberley and they hung over her fingers a moment and then slipped back A white silk handkerchief with a watermark was chosen instead She tied it in a sailor s knot with the ends flying loose and the triangular corner lying down her back Last of all she took out of a box a broad white straw hat like an oyster shell with a silver grey ribbon and a sweeping ostrich feather She looked at it a moment blew on it plucked at its ribbon lifted it over her head held it at poise there dropped it gently on to her hair stood back from the glass to see it and finally tore it off and sent it skimming on to the bed The substitute was her everyday sun bonnet which had been lying on the floor by the press It was also of pale pink with spots on its print like little shells on a big scallop When she had tossed it over her black curls leaving the strings to fall on her bosom she could not help but laugh aloud After all she was dressed exactly the same as on other days of life except Sunday only smarter perhaps and fresher maybe The sun bonnet was right though and she began to play with it It was so full of play it lent itself to so many moods It could speak it could say anything She poked it to a point as girls do when the sun is hot by closing its mouth over the tip of her nose leaving only a slumberous dark cave visible through which her black eyes gleamed and her eyelashes shone She tied the strings under her chin and tipped the bonnet back on to her neck as girls will when the breeze is cool leaving her hair uncovered her mouth twitching merrily and her head like a nymph head in an aureole She took it off and tossed it on her arm the strings still knotted swinging it like a basket then wafting it like a fan and walking as she did so to and fro in the room the floor creaking her print frock crinkling and she herself laughing with the thrill of passion vibrating and of imagined things to come Then she went downstairs with a firm and buoyant step her fresh lithe figure aglow with young blood and bounding health At the gate of the haggard she met Nancy Joe coming out of the washhouse Lord save us alive exclaimed Nancy If I ever wanted to be a man until this day Kate kissed and hugged her then fled away to the Melliah field XXI Philip in Douglas had received the following communication from Government House His Excellency will be obliged to mister Philip Christian if he will not leave the island for the present without acquainting him of his destination The message was a simple one it said little and involved and foreshadowed nothing but it threw Philip into a condition of great excitement To relieve his restlessness by giving way to it he went out to walk It was the end of the tourist season and the Ben my Chree was leaving the harbour Newsboys burrowing among the crowds on the pier to sell a Manx evening paper were crying Illness of the Deemster serious reports Philip s hair seemed to rise from his head The two things came together in his mind With an effort to smudge out the connection he turned back to his lodgings looking at everything that his eyes fell on in the rattling streets speaking to everybody he knew but seeing nothing and hearing nobody The beast of life had laid its claws on him Back in his rooms he took out of his pocket a packet which Auntie Nan had put in his hand when he was leaving Ramsey It was a bundle of his father s old letters to his sister cousin written from London in the days when he was studying law and life was like the opening dawn The ink is yellow now said Auntie Nan it was black then and the hand that wrote them is cold But the blood runs red in them yet Read them Philip she said with a meaning look and then he was sure she knew of Sulby Philip read his father s letters until it was far into the night and he had gone through every line of them They were as bright as sunshine as free as air easy playful forcible full of picture but above all egotistical proud with the pride of intellectuality and vain with the certainty of success It was this egotism that fascinated Philip He sniffed it up as a colt sniffs the sharp wind There was no need to make allowances for it The castles which his father had been building in the air were only as hovels to the golden palaces which his son s eager spirit was that night picturing Philip devoured the letters It was almost as if he had written them himself in some other state of being The message from Government House lay on a table at his right and sometimes he put his open hand over it as he sat close under the lamp on a table at his left and read on Heard old Broom in the House last night and today I lunched with him at Tabley s They call him an orator and the king of conversationalists He speaks like a pump and talks like a bottle running water No conviction no sincerity no appeal Civil enough to me though and when he heard that father was a Deemster he told me the title meant Doomster and then asked me if I knew the meaning of House of Keys and said it had its origin in the ancient Irish custom of locking the muniment chests with twenty four keys whereof each counsellor kept one When he had left us Tabley asked if he wasn t a wonderful man and if he didn t know something of everything and I said Yes except the things of which I knew a little and of them he knew nothing My pen runs runs But Nannie my little Nannie if this is what London calls a great man I ll kick the ball like a toy before me yet So you are wondering where I am living in man sion or attic Behold me then in Brick Court Temple second floor Goldsmith wrote the Vicar on the third but I ve not got up to that yet His rooms were those immediately above me I seem to see him coming down past my door in that wonderful plum coloured coat And sitting here at night I think of him the sudden fear the solitary death then these stairs thronged with his pensioners the mighty Burke pushing through Reynolds with his ear trumpet and big blinking Sam and last of all the unknown grave God knows where by the chapel wall Poor little Oliver They say it was a women that was in at the end No more of the like now no more debts no more vain talk like poor Poll the light s out all still and dark How s my little Nannie Does she still keep a menagerie for sick dogs and lost cats And how s the parson gull with the broken wing and does he still strut like Parson Kis sack in his surplice I was at Westminster Hall yesterday It was the great trial of Mitchell M P who forged his father s will Stevens defended bad bad bad smirking all the while with small facetiae But Denman s summing up oh oh such insight such acuteness It was wonderful I had a seat in the gallery The grand old hall was a thrilling scene the dense throng the upturned faces the counsel the judges the officers of court and then the windows the statues the echo of history that made every stone and rafter live Oh Nan Nan listen to me If I live I ll sit on the bench there some day I will so help me God When Philip had finished his father s letters he was on the heights and poor Kate was left far below out of reach and out of sight Hitherto his ambitions had been little more than the pale shadow of his father s hopes but now they were his own realities XXII Next morning the letter came from Caesar inviting him to the Melliah and then he thought of Kate more tenderly She would suffer she would cry it would make his heart bleed to see her but must he for a few tears put by the aims of a lifetime If only Pete had been alive If only Pete were yet to come home He grew hot and ashamed when he remembered the time so lately past when the prayer of his secret heart would have been different It was so easy now to hate himself for such evil impulses Philip decided to go to the Melliah It would give him the chance he wanted of breaking off the friendship finally More than friendship there had never been except secretly and that could not count He knew he was deceiving himself he felt an uneasy sense of loss of honour and a sharp pang of tender love as often as Kate s face rose up before him On the day of the Melliah he set off early riding by way of saint John s that he might inquire at Kirk Michael about the Deemster He found the great man s house a desolate place The gate was padlocked and he had to clamber over it the acacias slashed above him going down the path and the fallen leaves encumbered his feet At the door which was shut he rang and before it was opened to him an old woman put her untidy head out of a little window at the side It s scandalous the doings that s here sir she whispered The Dempster s gone into sterics with the drink and the lil farmer fellow Billiam Cowley is over and giving him as much as he wants and driving everybody away Can I speak to him said Philip Billiam It isn t fit He ll blackguard you mortal and the Dempster himself is past it Just sitting with the brandy and drinking and drinking and ateing nothing but that dirt brought up on the Curragh shouting for beefstakes morning and night and having his dinner laid on a beautiful new white sheet as clane as a bed From the ambush of a screen before an open door Philip looked into the room where the Deemster was killing himself The window shutters were up to keep out the daylight candles were burning in the necks of bottles on the mantelpiece a fire smouldered in a grate littered with paper and ashes a coarse featured man was eating ravenously at the table a chop bone in his fingers and veins like cords moving on his low forehead and the Deemster himself judge of his island since the death of Iron Christian was propped up in a chair with a smoking glass on a stool beside him and a monkey perched on his shoulder Turn them out neck and crop Dempster the women are all for robbing a man said the fellow and a husky eaten out voice replied to him with a grunt and a laugh H m That s only what you re doing yourself then you rascal and if I d let the right one in long ago you wouldn t be here now nor I neither would I Jacko The tail of the monkey flapped on the Deemster s breast and Philip crept away with a shiver The sun was shining brightly outside the house and the air was fresh and sweet Remounting his horse which was neighing and stamping at the gate Philip rode hard to bring back a sense of warmth At the Fairy he alighted and put up and saw Grannie who was laying tables in the mill I m busy as Trap s wife she said and if you were the Govenar itself you wouldn t get lave to spake to me now Put a sight on himself on the field yonder the second meadow past the Bishop s bridge and come back with the boys to supper Philip found the Melliah field Two score workers men women and children a cart and a pair of horses were scattered over it Where the corn had been cut the day before the stubble had been woven overnight into a white carpet of cobwebs which neither sun nor step of man had yet dispelled There were the smell of the straw the cawing of the rooks in the glen the hissing to the breeze of the barley still standing the swish of the scythe and the gling of the sickle the bending and rising of the shearers the swaying of the binders dragging the sheaves the gluck of the wheels of the cart the merry head of a child peeping out of a stook like a young bird out of the broken egg and a girl in scarlet whom Philip recognised standing at the farthest hedge and waving the corn band with which she was tieing to some one below Philip vaulted into the field and was instantly seized by every woman working in it except Kate tied up with the straw ropes and only liberated on paying the toll of an intruder But I ve come to work he protested and Caesar who was plotting the last rigs of the harvest paired him with Kate and gave him a sickle He s a David he ll smite down his thousands said Caesar Then cocking his eye up the field the Ballabeg for leader he cried he s a plate ribbed man And let ould Maggie take the butt along with him Jemmy the Red for the after rig and Robbie to follow Mollie with the cart Now ding dong boys bend your backs and down with it Kate had not looked up when Philip came into the field but she had seen him come and she gave a little start when he took his place in his shirt sleeves beside her He used some conventional phrases which she scarcely answered and then nothing was heard but the sounds of the sickle and the corn She worked steadily for some time and he looked up at her at intervals with her round bare arms and supple waist and firm set foot and tight red stocking Two butterflies tumbling in the air played around her sun bonnet and a lady clock settled on her wrist Time was called for rest as Nancy Joe came through the gate bringing a basket with bottles and a can The belly s a malefactor that forgets former kindness said Caesar ate and drink Then the men formed a group about the ale the older women drank tea the children making bands were given butter milk and the younger women with babes went cooing and clucking to the hedge where the little ones lay nuzzled up and unattended some asleep in shawls some awake on their backs and grabbing at the wondrous forests of marguerites towering up beside them and all crying with one voice at sight of the breast which the mothers were as glad to give as they to take The rooks cawed in the glen there was a hot hum of bees and a company of starlings passed overhead glittering in the sunlight like the scales of a herring They re taiching us a lesson said Caesar They re going together over the sea but there s someones on earth would sooner go to heaven itself solitary and take joy if they found themselves all alone and the cock of the walk there Kate and Philip stood and talked where they had been shearing quietly simply without apparent interest and meanwhile the workers discussed them First the men He works his siggle like a man though A stout boy anyway give him practice and he d shear many a man in bed Then the women She s looking as bright as a pewter pot and she s all so pretty as the Govenar s daughter too Got a good heart though Only last week she had word of Pete and look at the scarlet perricut Finally both men and women Lave her alone mother it s that Ross that s wasting the woman Well if I was a man I d know my tack Wouldn t trust It comes with Caesar anyway the Lord prospers him she ll have her pickings Nothing bates religion in this world It s like going to the shop with an ould Manx shilling you get your pen orth of taffy and twelve pence out Lend s a hand with the jough then boy None left Aw Caesar s wonderful religious but there s never much lavings of ale with him Caesar was striding through the stooks past Philip and Kate Will it thrash well mister Cregeen said Philip Eight bolls to the acre maybe but no straw to spake of sir said Caesar Now boys let the weft rest on the last end finish your work The workers fell to again and the sickle of the leader sang round his head as he hacked and blew and sent off his breath in spits until the green grass springing up behind him left only a triangular corner of yellow corn Fore rig and the after rig took a tussle together and presently nothing was standing of all the harvest of Glenmooar but one small shaft of ears a yard wide or less Then the leaders stopped and all the shearers of the field came up and cast down their sickles into the soil in a close circle making a sheaf of crescent moons Now for the Melliah said Caesar Who s to be Queen There was a cry for Kate and she sailed forward buoyantly fresh still warm with her work and looking like the afterglow from the sunset in the lengthening shadows from the west Strike them from their legs Kirry cried Nancy Joe and Kate drew up one of the sickles swept her left arm over the standing corn and at a single stroke of her right brought the last ears to the ground Then there was a great shout Hurrah for the Mel liah It rang through the glen and echoed in the mountains Grannie heard it in the valley and said to herself Caesar s Melliah s took Well we ve gathered the ripe corn praise His name said Caesar but what shall be done at the great gathering for unripe Christians Kate lifted her last sheaf and tied it about with a piece of blue ribbon and Philip plucked the cushag the ragwort from the hedge and gave it her to put in the band This being done the Queen of the Melliah stepped back feeling Philip s eyes following her while the oldest woman shearer came forward I ve a crown piece here that s being lying in my pocket long enough Joney said Caesar with an expansive air and he gave the woman her accustomed dole She was a timid shrinking creature having a face walled with wrinkles and wearing a short blue petticoat showing heavy dull boots like a man s and thick black stockings Then the young fellows went racing over the field vaulting the stooks stretching a straw rope for the girls to jump over heightening and tightening it to trip them up and slacking and twirling it to make them skip And the girls were falling with a laugh and leaping up again and flying off like the dust tearing their frocks and dropping their sun bonnets as if the barley grains they had been reaping had got into their blood In the midst of this maddening frolic while Caesar and the others were kneeling behind the barley stack Kate snatched Philip s hat from his head and shot like a gleam into the depths of the glen Philip dragged up his coat by one of its arms and fled after her XXIII Sulby Glen is winding soft rich sweet and exquisitely beautiful A thin thread of blue water laughing babbling brawling whooping leaping gliding and stealing down from the mountains great boulders worn smooth and ploughed hollow by the wash of ages wet moss and lichen on the channel walls deep cool dubbs tiny reefs little cascades of boiling foam lines of trees like sentinels on either side making the light dim through the overshadowing leafage gaunt trunks torn up by winds and thrown across the stream with their heads to the feet of their fellows the golden fuschia here the green trammon there now and again a poor old tholthan a roofless house with grass growing on its kitchen floor and over all the sun peering down with a hundred eyes into the dark and slumberous gloom and the breeze singing somewhere up in the tree tops to the voice of the river below Kate had run out on the stem of one of the fallen trees and there Philip found her over the middle of the stream laughing dancing waving his hat in one hand and making sweeping bows to her reflection in the water below Come back he cried You terrible girl you ll fall Sit down there don t torment me sit down After a curtsey to him she turned her attention to her skirts wound them about her ankles sat on the trunk and dangled her shapely feet half an inch over the surface of the stream Then Philip had time to observe that the other end of the tree did not reach the opposite bank but dipped short into the water So he barricaded his end by sitting on it and said triumphantly My hat if you please Kate looked and gave a little cry of alarm and then a chuckle and then she said You thought you d caught me didn t you You can t though and she dropped on to a boulder from which she might have skipped ashore I can t can t I said Philip and he twisted a smaller boulder on his side so that Kate was surrounded by water and cut off from the bank My hat now madam he said with majestic despotism ten She would not deliver it so he pretended to leave her where she was Good bye then good evening he cried over the laughter of the stream and turned away a step bareheaded A moment later his confidence was dashed When he turned his head back Kate had whipped off her shoes and stockings and was ramming the one inside the other What are you doing cried Philip Catch this and this she said flinging the shoes across to him Then clapping his straw hat on the crown of her sun bonnet she tucked up her skirts with both hands and waded ashore What a clever boy you are You thought you d caught me again didn t you she said I ve caught your shoes anyway said Philip and until you give me my hat I ll stick to them She was on the shingle but in her bare feet and could not make a step My shoes please she pleaded My hat first he answered Take it No you must give it me Never I ll sit here all night first said Kate I m willing said Philip They were sitting thus the one bare headed the other with bare feet and on the same stone as if seats in the glen were scarce when there came the sound of a hymn from the field they had left and then it was agreed by way of mutual penalty that Kate should put on Philip s hat on condition that Philip should be required to put on Kate s shoes At the next moment Philip suddenly sobered was reproaching himself fiercely What was he doing He had come to tell Kate that he should come no more and this was how he had begun Yesterday he was in Douglas reading his father s letters and here he was to day forgetting himself his aims in life his duties his obligations everything Philip he thought you are as weak as water Give up your plans you are not fit for them abandon your hopes they are too high for you How solemn we are all at once said Kate The hymn a most doleful strain dragged out to death on every note was still coming from the Melliah field and she added slyly shyly with a mixture of boldness and nervousness Do you think this world is so very bad then Well aw no he faltered and looking up he met her eye and they both laughed It s all nonsense isn t it she said and they began to walk down the glen But where are we going Oh we ll come out this way just as well The scutch grass the long rat tail and the golden cushag were swishing against his riding breeches and her print dress I must tell her now he thought In the narrow places she went first and he followed with a lagging step trying to begin Better prepare her he thought But he could think of no commonplace leading up to what he wished to say Presently through a tangle of wild fuchsia there was a smell of burning turf in the air and the sound of milking into a pail and then a voice came up surprisingly as from the ground saying Aisy on the thatch Miss Cregeen ma am It was old Joney the shearer milking her goat and Kate had stepped on to the roof of her house without knowing it for the little place was low and opened from the water s edge and leaned against the bank Philip made some conventional inquiries and she answered that she had been thirty years there and had one son living with her and he was an imbecile There was once a flock at me and I was as young as you are then miss and all as happy but they re laving me one by one except this one and he isn t wise poor boy Philip tried to steel his heart It is cruel he thought it will hurt her but what must be must be She began to sing and went carolling down the glen keeping two paces in front of him He followed like an assassin meditating the moment to strike He is going to say something she thought and then she sang louder Kate he called huskily But she only clapped her hands and cried in a voice of delight The echo Here s the echo Let s shout to it Her kindling features banished his purpose for the time and he delivered himself to her play Then she called up the gill Ec ho Ec ho and listened but there was no response and she said It won t answer to its own name What shall I call Oh anything said Philip Phil ip Phil ip she called and then said pettishly No Philip won t hear me either She laughed He s always so stupid though and perhaps he s asleep More this way said Philip Try now You try Philip took up the call Kate he shouted and back came the answer Ate Kate y Ate y Ah how quick Katey s a good girl Hark how she answers you said Kate They walked a few steps and Kate called again Philip There was no answer Philip is stubborn he won t have anything to do with me said Kate Then Philip called a second time Katey And back came the echo as before Well that s too bad Katey is yes she s actually following you Philip s courage oozed out of him Not yet he thought Traa dy liooar time enough After supper when everybody is going Outside the mill in the half light of candles within and darkness without It will sound so ordinary then Good bye Haven t you heard the news Auntie Nan is reconciled at last to leaving Ballure and joining me in Douglas That s it so simple so commonplace The light was now coming between the trees on the closing west in long swords of sunset red They could hear the jolting of the laden cart on its way down the glen The birds were fairly rioting overhead and all sorts of joyous sounds filled the air Underfoot there were long ferns and gorse which caught at her crinkling dress sometimes and then he liberated her and they laughed A trailing bough of deadly nightshade was hanging from the broken head of an old ash stump whose wasted feet were overgrown by two scarlet tipped toadstools and she plucked a long tendril of it and wound it about her head tipping her sun bonnet back and letting the red berries droop over her dark hair to her face Then she began to sing O were I monarch o the globe Wi thee to reign wi thee to reign Radiant gleams shot out of her black pupils and flashes of love like lightning passed from her eye to his Then he tried to moralise Ah he said out of the gravity of his wisdom if one could only go on for ever like this living from minute to minute But that s the difference between a man and a woman A woman lives in the world of her own heart If she has interests they centre there But a man has his interests outside his affections He is compelled to deny himself to let the sweetest things go by Kate began to laugh and Philip ended by laughing too Look she cried only look On the top of the bank above them a goat was skirmishing He was a ridiculous fellow sometimes cropping with saucy jerks then kicking up his heels as if an invisible imp had pinched him then wagging his rump and laughing in his nostrils As I was saying said Philip a man has to put by the pleasures of life Now here s myself for example I am bound do you know by a kind of duty a sort of vow made to the dead I might say I m sure he s going to say something thought Kate The voice of his heart was speaking louder and quicker than his halting tongue She saw that a blow was coming and looked about for the means to ward it off The fairy s dubb she cried suddenly and darted from his side to the water s edge It was a little round pool black as ink lying quiet and apparently motionless under a noisy place where the waters swirled and churned over black moss and the stream ran into the dark Philip had no choice but to follow her Cut me a willow Your penknife Quick sir quick Not that old branch a sapling There that s it Now you shall hear me tell my own fortune An ordeal is it said Philip Hush Be quiet still or little Phonodoree wont listen Hush now hush With solemn airs but a certain sparkle in her eyes she went down on her knees by the pool stretched her round arm over the water passed the willow bough slowly across its surface and recited her incantation Willow bough willow bough which of the four Sink circle or swim or come floating ashore Which is the fortune you keep for my life Old maid or young mistress or widow or wife With the last word she flung the willow bough on to the pool and sat back on her heels to watch it as it moved slowly with the motion of the water Bravo cried Philip Be quiet It s swimming No it s coming ashore It s wife Kate No it s widow No it s Do be serious Oh dear it s going yes it s going round Not that either No it has yes it has oh Sunk said Philip laughing and clapping his hands You re doomed to be an old maid Kate Phonodoree says so Cruel Brownie I m vexed that I bothered with him said Kate dropping her lip Then nodding to her reflection in the water where the willow bough had disappeared she said Poor little Katey He might have given you something else Anything but that dear eh What laughed Philip crying Because Phonodoree never Kate leapt up with averted face What nonsense you are talking she said There are tears in your eyes though said Philip No wonder either You re so ridiculous And if I m meant for an old maid you re meant for an old bachelor and quite right too Oh it is is it Yes indeed You ve got no more heart than a mushroom for you re all head and legs and you re going to be just as bald some day I am am I mistress If I were you Philip I should hire myself out for a scarecrow and then having nothing under your clothes wouldn t so much matter It wouldn t wouldn t it said Philip She was shying off at a half circle he was beating round her But you re nearly as old as Methuselah already and what you ll be when you re a man Lookout She made him an arch curtsey and leapt round a tree and cried from the other side I know A squeaking old croaker with the usual old song Deed yes friends this world is a vale of sin and misery The men s the misery and the women s the sin You rogue you cried Philip He made after her and she fled still speaking What do you think a girl wants with a Oh Oh Oo Her tirade ended suddenly She had plunged into a bed of the prickly gorse and was feeling in twenty places at once what it was to wear low shoes and thin stockings With a Samson eh cried Philip striding on in his riding breeches and lifting the captured creature in his arms Why to carry her you torment to carry her through the gorse like this Ah she said turning her face over his shoulder and tickling his neck with her breath Her hair caught in a tree and fell in a dark shower over his breast He set her on her feet they took hands and went carolling down the glen together The brightest jewel in my crown Wad be my queen wad be my queen The daylight lingered as if loth to leave them There was the fluttering of wings overhead and sometimes the last piping of birds The wind wandered away and left their voices sovereign of all the air Then there came a distant shout the cheer of the farm people on reaching home with the Melliah It awakened Philip as from a fit of intoxication This is madness he thought What am I doing He is going to speak now she told herself Her gaiety shaded off into melancholy and her melancholy burst into wild gaiety again The night had come down the moon had risen the stars had appeared She crept closer to Philip s side and began to tell him the story of a witch They were near to the house the witch had lived in There it was that roofless cottage that tholthan under the deep trees like a dungeon Have you never heard of her Philip No The one they called the Deemster s lady What Deemster said Philip This one Deemster Mylrea who is said to be dying He is dying he is killing himself I saw him to day said Philip Well she was the blacksmith s daughter and he left her and she went mad and cursed him and said she was his wife though they hadn t been to church and he should never marry anybody else Then her father turned her out and she came up here all alone and there was a baby and they were saying she killed it and everybody was afraid of her And all the time her boy was making himself a great great man until he got to be Deemster But he never married never though times and times people were putting this lady on him and then that but when they told the witch she only laughed and said Let him he ll get lave enough At last she was old and going on two sticks and like to die any day and then he crept out of his big house unknown to any one and stole up here to the woman s cottage And when she saw the old man she said So you ve come at last boy but you ve been keeping me long bogh you ve been keeping me long And then she died Wasn t that strange Her dark eyes looked up at him and her mouth quivered Was it witchcraft then said Philip Oh no it was only because he was her husband That was the hold she had of him He was tempted away by a big house and a big name but he had to come back to her And it s the same with a woman Once a girl is the wife of somebody she must cling to him and if she is ever false she must return Something compels her That s if she s really his wife really truly How beautiful isn t it Isn t it beautiful Do you think that Kate Do you think a man like a woman would cling the closer He couldn t help himself Philip Philip tried to say it was only a girl s morality but her confidence shamed him She slipped her moist fingers into his hand again They were close by the deserted tholthan and she was creeping nearer and nearer to his side A bat swirled above their heads and she made a faint cry Then a cat shot from under a gooseberry bush and she gave a little scream She was breathing irregularly He could smell the perfume of her fallen hair He was in agony of pain and delight His heart was leaping in his bosom his eyes were burning She s right he thought Love is best It is everything It is the crown of life Shall I give it up for the Dead Sea fruit of worldly success Think of the Deemster Wifeless childless living solitary dying alone unregretled unmourned What is the wickedness you are plotting Your father is dead you can do him neither good nor harm This girl is alive She loves you Love her Let the canting hypocrites prate as they will She had disengaged her hand and was creeping away from him in the half darkness treading softly and going off like a gleam Kate he called He heard her laughter he heard the drowsy hum of the gill he could smell the warm odour of the gorse bushes But this is madness he thought This is the fever of an hour Yield now and I am ruined for life The girl has come between me and my aims my vows my work everything She has tempted me and I am as weak as water Kate She did not answer Come here this moment Kate I have something to say to you Bite she said coming back and holding an apple to his lips She had plucked it in the overgrown garden Listen I m leaving Ramsey for good don t intend to practise in the northern courts any longer settling in Douglas best work lies there you see worst of it is we shan t meet again soon not very soon you know not for years perhaps He began by stammering and went on stuttering blurting out his words and trembling at the sound of his own voice Philip you must not go she cried I m sorry Kate very sorry Shall always remember so tenderly not to say fondly the happy boy and girl days together Philip Philip you must not go you cannot go you shall not go He could see her bosom heaving under her loose red bodice She took hold of his arm and dragged at it Won t you spare me Will you shame me to death Must I tell you If you won t speak I will You cannot leave me Philip because because what do I care because I love you Don t say that Kate I love you Philip I love you I love you Would to God I had never been born But I will show you how sweet it is to be alive Take me take me I am yours Her upturned face seemed to flash He staggered like one seized with giddiness It was a thing of terror to behold her Still he struggled Though apart we shall remember each other Kate I don t want to remember I want to have you with me Our hearts will always be together Come to me then Philip come to me The purest part of our hearts our souls But I want you Will you drive a girl to shame herself again I want you Philip I want your eyes that I may see them every day and your hair that I may feel it with my hands and your lips can I help it yes and your lips that I may kiss and kiss them Kate Kate Turn your eyes away Don t look at me like that She was fighting for her life It was to be now or never If you won t come to me I ll go to you she cried and then she sprang upon him and all grew confused the berries of the nightshade whipped his forehead and the moon and the stars went out My love My darling My girl You won t go now she sobbed God forgive me I cannot Kiss me I feel your heart beating You are mine mine mine Say you won t go now God forgive us both Kiss me again Philip Don t despise me that I love you better than myself She was weeping she was laughing her heart was throbbing up to her throat At the next moment she had broken from his embrace and was gone Kate Kate Her voice came from the tholthan Philip When a good woman falls from honour is it merely that she is a victim of momentary intoxication of stress of passion of the fever of instinct No It is mainly that she is a slave of the sweetest tenderest most spiritual and pathetic of all human fallacies the fallacy that by giving herself to the man she loves she attaches him to herself for ever This is the real betrayer of nearly all good women that are betrayed It lies at the root of tens of thousands of the cases that make up the merciless story of man s sin and woman s weakness Alas it is only the woman who clings the closer The impulse of the man is to draw apart He must conquer it or she is lost Such is the old cruel difference and inequality of man and woman as nature made them the old trick the old tragedy XXIV Old Mannanin the magician according to his wont had surrounded his island with mist that day and in the helpless void of things unrevealed a steamship bound for Liverpool came with engines slacked some points north of her course blowing her fog horn over the breathless sea with that unearthly yell which must surely be the sound whereby the devil summons his legions out of chaos Presently something dropping through the dense air settled for a moment on the damp rope of the companion ladder and one of the passengers recognised it My gough It s a bird a sparrow he cried At the same moment there was a rustle of wind the mist lifted and a great round shoulder rose through the white gauze as if it had been the ghost of a mountain That s the Isle of Man the passenger shouted and there was a cry of incredulity It s the Calf I m telling you boys Lave it to me to know And instantly the engines were reversed The passenger a stalwart fellow with a look as of pallor under a tawny tan walked the deck in a fever of excitement sometimes shouting in a cracked voice sometimes laughing huskily and at last breaking down in a hoarse gurgle like a sob Can t you put me ashore captain n Sorry I can t sir we ve lost time already There was a dog with him a little misshappen ugly creature and he lifted it up in his arms and hugged it and called it by blusterous swear names with noises of inarticulate affection Then he went down to his berth in the second cabin and opened a little box of letters and took them out one by one and leaned up to the port to read them He had read them before and he knew them by heart but he traced the lines with his broad forefinger and spelled the words one by one And as he did so he laughed aloud and then cried to himself and then laughed once more She is well and happy and looking lovely and if she does not write don t think she is forgetting you God bless her And God bless him too God bless them both He went up on deck again for he could not rest in one place long There was a breeze now and he filled his lungs and blew and blew The island was dying down over the sea in a pale light of silver grey An engineman and a stoker were leaning over the bulwark to cool themselves Happy enough now sir eh Happy as a sand boy mate only mortal hungry Tiffin you say Aw the heart has its hunger same as anything else and mine has been on short commons these five years and better See that island there lying like a salmon gull atop of the water Looks as if she might dip under it doesn t she That s my home my native land as the man says and only three weeks ago I wasn t looking to see the thundering ould thing again but God is good you see and I am middling fit for all I m a Manxman myself mate and I ve got a lil Manx woman that s waiting for me yonder It s only an ould shirt I m bringing her to patch as the saying is but she ll be that joyful you never seen It s bad to take a woman by surprise though these nervous creatures sterics you see I ll send her a tally graph from the Stage My sakes the joy she ll be taking of that boy too He ll be getting sixpence for himself and a drink of butter milk It s always the way of these poor lil things can t stand no good news at all people coming home and the like not much worth these women crying reglar can t help it Well you see they re tender hearteder than us and when anybody s been five years Be gough we re making way though The island s going under for sure Or is it my eyes that isn t so clear since my bit of a bullet wound Aw God is good tremen jous The breaking voice stopped suddenly and the engine men turned about but the passenger was stumbling down the cabin stairs If ever a man came back from the dead it s that one said both men together PART III MAN AND WOMAN I Philip was vanquished and he knew it but he was not daunted he was not distressed To have resisted the self abandonment of Kate s love would have been monstrous Therefore he had done no wrong and there was nothing to be ashamed of But when he reached Ballure he did not dash into Auntie Nan s room according to his wont though a light was burning there and he could hear the plop and click of thread and needle he crept upstairs to his own and sat down to write a letter It was the first of his love letters I shall count the days the hours and the minutes until we meet again my darling and I shall be constantly asking what time it is And seeing we must be so much apart let us contrive a means of being together nevertheless Listen I whisper the secret in your ear To morrow night and every night eat your supper at eight o clock exactly I will do the same and so we shall be supping in each other s company my little wife though twenty miles divide us If any body asks me to supper I will refuse in order that I may sup with you I am promised to a friend I ll say and then I ll sit down in my rooms alone but you will be with me Tingling with delight he wrote this letter to Kate though less than an hour parted from her and went out to post it He was going upstairs again steadily on tiptoe his head half aside and his face over his shoulder when Auntie Nan s voice came from the blue room Philip He returned with a sheepish look and a sense never felt before of being naked so to speak But Auntie Nan did not look at him She was working a lamb on a sampler and she reached over the frame to take something out of a drawer and hand it to him It was a medallion of a young child a boy with long fair curls like a girl s and a face like sunshine Was it father Auntie Yes a French painter who came ashore with Thurlot painted it for grandfather Philip laid it on the table He was more than ever sure that Auntie Nan had heard something Such were her tender ways of warning him He could not be vexed I m sleepy to night Auntie and you look tired too You ve been waiting up for me again Now you really must not Besides it limits one s freedom That s nothing Philip You said you would come home after calling on the poor Deemster and so He s in a bad way Auntie Drink delirium such a wreck Well good night Did you read the letters dear Oh yes Father s letters Yes I read them Good night Aren t they beautiful Haven t they the very breath of ambition and enthusiasm But poor father How soon the brightness melted away He never repined though Oh no never Indeed he used to laugh and joke at our dreams and our castles in the air You must do it all yourself Nannie you shall have all the cakes and ale Yes when he was a dying man he would joke like that But sometimes he would grow serious and then he would say Give little Philip some for all He ll deserve it more than me Oh God he would say let me think to myself when I m there you ve missed the good things of life but your son has got them you are here but he is on the heights lie still thou poor aspiring heart lie still in your grave and rest Philip felt like a bird struggling in the meshes of a net My father was a poet Auntie trying to be a man of the world That was the real mischief in his life if you think of it Auntie Nan looked up with her needle at poise above the sampler and said in a nervous voice The real mischief of your father s life Philip was love what they call love But love is not that Love is peace and virtue and right living and that is only madness and frenzy and when people wake up from it they wake up as from a nightmare Men talk of it as a holy thing it is unholy Books are written in praise of it I would have such books burnt When anybody falls to it he is like a blind man who has lost his guide tottering straight to the precipice Women fall to it too Yes good women as well as good men I have seen them tempted Philip was certain of it now Some one had been prying upon him at Sulby He was angry and his anger spent itself on Auntie Nan in a torrent of words You are wrong Aunt Anne quite wrong Love is the one lovely thing in life It is beauty it is poetry Call it passion if you will what would the world be like without it A place where every human heart would be an island standing alone a place without children without joy without merriment without laughter No no Heaven has given us love and we are wrong when we try to put it away We cannot put it away and when we make the attempt we are punished for our pride and arrogance It ought to be enough for us to let heaven decide whether we are to be great men or little men and to decide for ourselves whether we are to be good men and happy men And the greatest happiness of life is love Heaven would have to work a miracle to enable us to live without it But Heaven does not work such a miracle because the greatest miracle of heaven is love itself The needle hand of Auntie Nan was trembling above her sampler and her lips were twitching You are a young man yet Philip she faltered but I am an old lady now dear and I have seen the fruits of the intoxication you call passion Oh have I not have I not It wrecks lives ruins prospects breaks up homes sets father against son and brother against brother Philip would give her no chance He was tramping across the room and he burst out with You are wrong again Auntie You are always wrong in these matters because you are always thinking from the particular to the general you are always thinking of my father What you have been calling my father s fall was really his fate He deserved it If he had been fit for the high destiny he aspired to if he had been fit to be a judge he would not have fallen That he did fall is proof enough that he was not fit God did not intend it My father s aspirations were not the call of a stern vocation they were mere poetic ambition If he had ever by great ill fortune lived to be made Deemster he would have found himself out and the island would have found him out and you yourself would have found him out and all the world would have been undeceived As a poet he might have been a great man but as a Deemster he must have been a mockery a hypocrite an impostor and a sham Auntie Nan rose to her feet with a look of fright on her sweet old face and something dropped with a clank on to the floor Oh Philip Philip if I thought you could ever repeat the error But Philip gave her no time to finish Tossing his disordered hair from his forehead he swung out of the room Being alone he began to collect himself Was it in sober fact he who had spoken like that Of his father too To Auntie Nan as well He saw how it was he had been speaking of his father but he had been thinking of himself he had been struggling to justify himself to reconcile strengthen and fortify himself But in doing so he had been breaking an idol a life long idol his own idol and Auntie Nan s He stumbled downstairs in a rush of remorse and burst again into the room crying in a broken voice Auntie Auntie But the room was empty the lamp was turned down the sampler was pushed aside Something crunched under his foot and he stooped and picked it up It was the medallion and it was cracked across The accident terrified him His skin seemed to creep He felt as if he had trodden on his father s face Putting the broken picture into his pocket he turned about like a guilty man and crept silently to bed in the darkness But the morning brought him solace for the pains of the night it brought him a letter from Kate The Melliah is over at long long last and I am allowed to be alone with my thoughts They sang Keerie fu Snaighty after you left and The King can only love his wife And I can do the sa a me And I can do the same But there is really nothing to tell you for nothing happened of the slightest consequence Good night I am going to bed after I have posted this letter at the bridge Two hours hence you will appear to me in sleep unless I lie that long awake to think of you I generally do Good bye my dear lord and master You will let me know what you think best to be done Your difficulties alarm me terribly You see dear we two are about to do something so much out of the common Good night I lift my head that you may give me another kiss on the eyes and here are two for yours Then there were empty brackets which Kate had put her lips to expecting Philip to do the same II Philip was going into his chambers in Douglas that morning when he came upon a messenger from Government House in stately intercourse with his servant His Excellency begged him to step up to Onchan immediately and to remain for lunch The Governor s carriage was at the door and Philip got into it He was not excited he remembered his agitation at the Governor s former message and smiled On leaving his own rooms he had not forgotten to order supper for eight o clock precisely He found the Governor polite and expansive as usual He was sitting in a room hung round with ponderous portraits of former Governors most of them in frills and ruffles and one vast picture of King George You will have heard he said that our northern Deemster is dead Is he so said Philip I saw him at one o clock yesterday He died at two said the Governor Poor man poor man said Philip That was all Not a tremble of the eyelid not a quiver of the lip You are aware that the office is a Crown appointment said the Governor Applications are made you know to the Home Office but it is probable that my advice may be asked by the Secretary in his selection I may perhaps be of use to a candidate Philip gave no sign and the Governor shifted his leg and continued with a smile Certainly that appears to be the impression of your brother advocates mister Christian they are about me already like wasps at a glue pot I will not question but you ll soon be one of them Philip made a gesture of protestation and the Governor waved his hand and smiled again Oh I shan t blame you young men are ambitious It is natural that they should wish to advance themselves in life In your case too if I may say so there is the further spur of a desire to recover the position your family once held and lately lost through the mistake or misfortune of your father Philip bowed gravely but said nothing That no doubt said the Governor would be a fact in your favour The great fact against you would be that you are still so young Let me see is it eight and twenty Twenty six said Philip No more Only six and twenty And then successful as your career has been thus far perhaps I should say distinguished or even brilliant you are still unsettled in life Philip asked if his Excellency meant that he was still unmarried And if I do the Governor replied with pretended severity and if I do don t smile too broadly young man You ought to know by this time that the personal equation counts for something in this old fashioned island of yours Now the late Deemster was an example which it would be perilous to repeat If it were repeated I know who would hear of the blunder every day of his life and it wouldn t be the Home Secretary either Deemster Mylrea was called upon to punish the crimes of drink and he was himself a drunkard to try the offences of sensuality and he was himself a sensualist Philip could not help it he gave a little crack of laughter To be sure said the Governor hastily you are in no danger of his excesses but you will not be a safe candidate to recommend until you have placed yourself to all appearances out of the reach of them Beware of these Christians said the great Derby to his son and pardon me if I revive the warning to a Christian himself The colour came strong into Philip s face Even at that moment he felt angry at so coarse a version of his father s fault You mean said he that we are apt to marry unwisely I do that said the Governor There s no telling said Philip with a faint crack of his fingers and the Governor frowned a little the pock marks seemed to spread Of course all this is outside my duty mister Christian I needn t tell you that but I feel an interest in you and I ve done you some services already though naturally a young man will think he has done everything for himself Ah he said rising from his seat at the sound of a gong luncheon is ready Let us join the ladies Then with one hand on Philip s shoulder familiarly only a word more mister Christian Send in your application immediately and take the advice of an old fiddler marry as soon afterwards as may be But with your prospects it would be a sin not to walk carefully If she s English so much the better but if she s Manx take care Philip lunched with the Governor s wife who told him she remembered his grandfather also with his unmarried daughter who said she had heard him speak for the fishermen at Peel An official At home the last of the summer was to be held in the garden that afternoon and Philip was invited to remain He did so and thereby witnessed the assaults of the wasps at the glue pot They buzzed about the Governor they buzzed about his wife they buzzed about his dog and about a tame deer which took grapes from the hands of the guests An elderly gentleman sitting alone in a carriage drove up to the lawn It was Peter Christian Ballawhaine looking feebler whiter and more splay footed than before Philip stepped up to his uncle and offered his arm to alight by But the Ballawhaine brushed it aside and pushed through to the Governor to whom he talked incessantly for some minutes of his son Ross saying he had sent for him and would like to present him to his Excellency If Philip lacked enjoyment of the scene if his face lacked heart and happiness it was not the fault of his host Will you not take Lady So and so to have tea the Governor would say and presently Philip found himself in a circle of official wifedom whose husbands had been made Knights by the Queen and themselves made Ladies by God knows whom The talk was of the late Deemster Such a life It s a mercy he lasted so long A pity you mean my dear not to be hard on him either Poor thing He ought to have married Such a man wants a wife to look after him Don t you think so mister Christian Why said a white haired dame have you never heard of his great romance Ah tell us of that Who was the lady The lady there was a pause the white haired dame coughed smiled closed her little ferret eyes dropped her voice and said with mock gravity The lady was the blacksmith s daughter dearest And then there was a merry trill of laughter Philip felt sick bowed to his hosts and left As he was going off his uncle intercepted him holding out both hands How s this Philip You never come to Ballawhaine now I see Oh I see Too busy with the women to remember an old man They re all talking of you Putting the comather on them eh I know I know don t tell me III 
2740-162051-0000	train-other-500	Philip s way home lay through the town but he made a circuit of the country
none	none	 across Onchan 
2740-162051-0001	train-other-500	so heartsick was he so utterly choked with bitter feelings He felt as if all the angels and devils together must be making a mock at him The thing he had worked for through five heavy years the end he had aimed at
2740-162051-0002	train-other-500	the goal he had fought for was his already his for the stretching out of his hand Yet now that it was his he could not have it Oh the mockery of his fate Oh the irony of his life
2740-162051-0003	train-other-500	It was shrieking it was frantic Then his bolder spirit seemed to say What is all this childish fuming about Fortune comes to you with both hands full Be bold and you may have both the wish of your soul
2740-162051-0004	train-other-500	and the desire of your heart both the Deemster ship and Kate It was impossible to believe that If he married Kate the Governor would not recommend him as Deemster
2740-162051-0005	train-other-500	Had he not admitted that he stood in some fear of the public opinion of the island And was it not conceivable that besides the unselfish interest which the Governor had shown in him there was even a personal one that would operate more powerfully
2740-162051-0006	train-other-500	than fear of the old fashioned Manx conventions to prevent any recommendation of the husband of the wrong woman At one moment a vague memory rose before Philip as he crossed the fields of the lunch at Government House
2740-162051-0007	train-other-500	of the Governor s wife and daughter of their courtesy and boundless graciousness At the next moment he had drawn up sharply with pangs of self contempt hating himself loathing himself swearing at himself for a mean souled ingrate
2740-162051-0008	train-other-500	as he kicked up the grass and the turf beneath it But the idea had taken root He could not help it the Governor s interest went for nothing in his reckoning What a fool you are Philip something seemed to whisper out of the darkest corner of his conscience
2740-162051-0009	train-other-500	take the Deemstership first and marry Kate afterwards But it was impossible to think of that either Say it could be done by any arts of cunning or duplicity what then
2740-162051-0010	train-other-500	Then there were the high walls of custom and prejudice to surmount Philip remembered the garden party and saw that they could never be surmounted The Deemster who slapped the conventions in the face would suffer for it
2740-162051-0011	train-other-500	He would be taboo to half the life of the island in public an official in private a recluse An icy picture rose before his mind s eye of the woman who would be his wife in her relations with the ladies he had just left
2740-162051-0012	train-other-500	She might be their superior in education certainly in all true manners and in natural grace and beauty in sweetness and charm their mistress beyond a dream of comparison But they would never forget that she was the daughter of a country innkeeper
2740-162051-0013	train-other-500	and every little cobble in the rickety pyramid even from the daughter of the innkeeper in the town would look down on her as from a throne He could see them leaving their cards at his door and driving hurriedly off They must do that much
2740-162051-0014	train-other-500	It was the bitter pill which the Deemster s doings made them swallow Then he could see his wife sitting alone a miserable woman despised envied isolated shut off from her own class by her marriage with the Deemster
2740-162051-0015	train-other-500	and from his class by the Deemster s marriage with her Again he could see himself too powerful to offend too dangerous to ignore going out on his duties without cheer and returning to his wife without company
2740-162051-0016	train-other-500	Finally he remembered his father and his mother and he could not help but picture himself sitting at home with Kate five years after their marriage when the first happiness of each other s society had faded had staled
2740-162051-0017	train-other-500	had turned to the wretchedness of starvation in its state of siege Or perhaps going out for walks with her just themselves always themselves only they two together this evening last evening and to morrow evening
2740-162051-0018	train-other-500	through the streets crowded by visitors down the harbour where the fishermen congregate across the bridge and over the head between sea and sky people bowing to them respectfully rigidly freezingly people nudging and whispering and looking their way
2740-162051-0019	train-other-500	Oh God what end could come of such an abject life but that beginning by being unhappy they should descend to being bad as well What a fuss you are making of things said the voice again but more loudly
2740-162051-0020	train-other-500	This hubbub only means that you can t have your cake and eat it Very well take Kate and let the Deemstership go to perdition There was not much comfort in that counsel for it made no reckoning with the certainty that if marriage with Kate would prevent him from being Deemster
2740-162051-0021	train-other-500	it would prevent him from being anything in the Isle of Man As it had happened with his father so it would happen with him there would be no standing ground in the island for the man who had deliberately put himself outside the pale
2740-162051-0022	train-other-500	Don t worry me with silly efforts to draw a line so straight If you can t have Kate and the Deemstership together and if you can t have Kate without the Deemstership there is only one thing left the Deemstership without Kate
2740-162051-0023	train-other-500	You must take the office and forego the girl It is your duty your necessity This was how Philip put it to himself at length and the daylight had gone by that time and he was walking in the dark
2740-162051-0024	train-other-500	But the voice which had been pleading on his side now protested on hers Don t prate of duty and necessity You mean self love and self interest Man be honest Because this woman is an obstacle in your career
2740-162051-0025	train-other-500	you would sacrifice her It is boundless pitiless selfishness Suppose you abandon her dare you think of her without shame She loves you she trusts you and she has given you proof of her love and trust Hold your tongue
none	none	 Don t dare to whisper that nobody knows it but you and heir 
2740-162051-0026	train-other-500	that you will be silent that she will have no temptation to speak She loves you She has given you all God bless her Affectionate pity swept down the selfish man in him As the lights of the town appeared on his path
2740-162051-0027	train-other-500	he was saying to himself boldly Since either way there is trouble I ll do as I said last night I ll leave Heaven to decide whether I m to be a great man or a little man and decide for myself whether I m to be a true man or a happy man
2740-162051-0028	train-other-500	I ll take my heart in my hand and go right forward In this temper he returned to his chambers The rooms fronted to Athol Street but backed on to the churchyard of saint George s They were quiet and not overlooked
2740-162051-0029	train-other-500	His lamp was lit The servant was laying the cloth Lay covers for two Jemmy said Philip Then he began to hum something Presently in feeling for his keys his fingers touched an unfamiliar substance in his pocket
2740-162051-0030	train-other-500	He remembered what it was It was the cracked medallion of his father He could not bear to look at it Unlocking a chest he buried it at the bottom under a pile of winter clothing This recalled a possession yet more painful
2740-162051-0031	train-other-500	and going to a desk he drew out the packet of his father s letters and proceeded to hide them away with the medallion As he did so his hand trembled his limbs shook he felt giddy and he thought the voice that had tormented him with conflicting taunts was ringing in his ears again
2740-162051-0032	train-other-500	Bury him deep Bury your father out of all sight and all remembrance Bury his love of you his hopes of you his expectations and dreams of you Bury and forget him for ever Philip hesitated a moment
2740-162051-0033	train-other-500	and then banged down the lid of the chest and relocked it as his servant returned to the room The man was a solemn dignified and reticent person who had been groom to the late Bishop His gravity he had acquired from his horses
2740-162051-0034	train-other-500	his dignity from his master but his reticence he had created for himself being a thing beyond nature in creature or man His proper name was Cottier he had always been known as Jemy Lord
2740-162051-0035	train-other-500	Company not arrived sir he said Wait or serve What is the time said Philip Struck eight but clock two minutes soon
none	none	 Serve the supper at once said Philip 
2740-162051-0036	train-other-500	When the dishes had been brought in and the man dismissed Philip taking his place at the table drew from his button hole a flower which he had picked out of his water bowl at lunch
2740-162051-0037	train-other-500	and first putting it to his lips he tossed it on to the empty place before the chair which had been drawn up opposite Then he sat down to eat He ate little and do what he would he could not keep his mind from wandering
2740-162051-0038	train-other-500	He thought of his aunt and how hurt she had been the previous night of his uncle and how he had snubbed and then slavered over him of the Governor and how strange the interest he had shown in him
2740-162051-0039	train-other-500	and finally he thought of Pete and how lately he was dead and how soon forgotten In the midst of these memories all sad and some bitter suddenly he remembered again that he was supping with Kate Then he struggled to be bright and even a little gay
2740-162051-0040	train-other-500	He knew that she would be taking her supper at Sulby at that moment thinking of him and making believe that he was with her So he tried to think that she was with him sitting in the chair opposite looking across the table between the white cloth and the blue lamp shade
2740-162051-0041	train-other-500	out of her beaming eyes with her rings of dark hair dancing on her forehead and her ripe mouth twitching merrily Then the air of the room seemed to be filled with a sweet presence He could have fancied there was a perfume of lace and dainty things
2740-162051-0042	train-other-500	Sweetheart He laughed he hardly knew if it was himself that had spoken It was dear delicious fooling But his eyes fell on the chest wherein he had buried the letters and the medallion and his mind wandered again
2740-162051-0043	train-other-500	He thought of his father of his grandfather of his lost inheritance and how nearly he had reclaimed the better part of it and then once more of Pete crying aloud at last in the coil of his trouble Oh if Pete had only lived
2740-162051-0044	train-other-500	His voice startled and his words horrified him To wipe out both in the first moment of recovered consciousness he filled his glass to the brim and lifted it up rising at the same time looking across the table
2740-162051-0045	train-other-500	and saying in a soft whisper Your health darling your health The bell rang from the street door and he stood listening with the wine glass in his hand When he knew anything more
2740-162051-0046	train-other-500	a voice at his elbow was saying out of a palpitating gloom The gentleman can t come seemingly he has sent a telegram It was Jem y Lord holding a telegram in his hand
none	none	 Philip tore open the envelope and read Coming home by Ramsey boat to morrow well and hearty tell Kirry Peat IV Somewhere in the dead and vacant dawn Philip went to bed worn out by a night long perambulation of the dark streets He slept a heavy sleep of four deep hours with oppressive dreams of common things swelling to enormous size about him When Jem y Lord took the tea to his master s bedroom in the morning the tray was almost banged out of his hands by the clashing back of the door after he had pushed it open with his knee The window was half up and a cold sea breeze was blowing into the room yet the grate and hearth showed that a fire had been kindled in the night and his master was still sleeping Jem set down his tray lifted a decanter that stood on the table held it to the light snorted like an old horse nodded to himself knowingly and closed the window Philip awoke with the noise and looked around in a bewildered way He was feeling vaguely that something had happened when the man said The horse will be round soon sir What horse said Philip The horse you ride sir said Jem and with an indulgent smile he added the one I ordered from Shimmen s when I posted the letter What letter The letter you gave me to post before I went to bed All was jumbled and confused in Philip s mind He was obliged to make an effort to remember Just then the newsboys went shouting down the street beyond the churchyard Special edition Death of the Deemster Then everything came back He had written to Kate asking her to meet him at Port Mooar at two o clock that day It was then and in that lonesome place that he had decided to break the news to her He must tell all he had determined upon his course Without appetite he ate his breakfast As he did so he heard voices from a stable yard in the street He lifted his head and looked out mechanically A four wheeled dogcart was coming down the archway behind a mettlesome young horse with silver mounted harness The man driving it was a gorgeous person in a light Melton overcoat One of his spatted feet was on the break and he had a big cigar between his teeth It was Ross Christian The last time Philip had seen the man he had fought him for the honour of Kate It was like whips and scorpions to think of that now Ashamed abased degraded in his own eyes he turned away his head V In the middle of the night following the Melliah Kate turning in bed kissed her hand because it had held the hand of Philip When she awoke in the morning she felt a great happiness Opening her eyes and half raising herself in bed she looked around There were the pink curtains hanging like a tent above her there were the scraas of the thatched roof with the cracking whitewash snipping down on the counterpane there were the press and the wash hand table the sheep skin on the floor and the sun coming through the orchard window But everything was transfigured everything beautiful everything mysterious She was like one who had gone to sleep on the sea with only the unattainable horizon round about and awakened in harbour in a strange land that was warm and lovely and full of sunshine She closed her eyes again so that nothing might disturb the contemplation of the mystery She folded her round arms as a pillow behind her head her limbs dropped back of their own weight and her mouth broke into a happy smile Oh miracle of miracles The whole world was changed She heard the clatter of pattens in the room below it was Nancy churning in the dairy She heard shouts from beyond the orchard it was her father stacking in the haggard she heard her mother talking in the bar and the mill wheel swishing in the pond It seemed almost wonderful that the machinery of ordinary life could be working away the same as ever Could she be the same herself She reached over for a hand glass to look at her face As she took it off the table it slipped from the tips of her fingers and falling face downwards it broke She had a momentary pang at that accident as at a bad omen but just then Nancy came up with a letter It was the letter which Philip had written at Ballure When she was alone again she read it Then she put it in her bosom It seemed to be haunted by the odour of the gorse the odour of the glen of the tholthan of Philip and of all delights A faint ghost of shame came to frighten her Had she sinned against her sex Was it disgraceful that she had wooed and not waited to be won With all his love of her would Philip be ashamed of her also Her face grew hot She knew that she was blushing and she covered up her head as if her lover were there to see Such fears did not last long Her joy was too bold to be afraid of tangible things So overwhelming was her happiness that her only fear was lest she might awake at some moment and find that she was asleep now and everything had been a dream That was Friday and towards noon word came from Kirk Michael that the Deemster had died on the afternoon of the day before Then they ought to put Philip Christian in his place she said promptly I m sure no one deserves it better They had been talking in low tones in the kitchen with their backs to her but faced about with looks of astonishment Sakes alive Kirry cried Nancy is it yourself it was What were you saying a week ago Well do you expect a girl to be saying the one thing always laughed Kate Aw no said Caesar A woman s opinions isn t usually as stiff as the tail of a fighting Tom cat They re more coming and going of a rule Next day Saturday she received Philip s second letter the letter written at Douglas after the supper and the arrival of Pete s telegram It was written crosswise in a hasty hand on a half sheet of note paper and was like a postscript without signature or superscription Most urgent Must see you immediately Meet me at Port Mooar at two o clock to morrow We can talk there without interruption Be brave my dear There are serious matters to discuss and arrange The message was curt and even cold but it brought her no disquiet Marriage That was the only vision it conjured up The death of the Deemster had hastened things that was the meaning of the urgency Port Mooar was near to Ballure that was why she had to go so far They would have to face gossip perhaps backbiting perhaps even abuse that was the reason she had to be brave Why and how the Deemster s death should affect her marriage with Philip was a matter she did not puzzle out She had vague memories of girls marrying in delightful haste and sailing away with their husbands and being gone before you had time to think they were to go But this new fact of her life was only a part of the great mystery and was not to be explained by everyday ideas and occurrences Kate ran up to dress and came down like a bud bursting into flower She had dressed more carefully than ever Philip had great expectations he must not be disappointed Making the excuse of shopping she was setting off towards Ramsey when her father shouted from the stable that he was for driving the same way The mare was harnessed to the gig and they got up together Caesar had made inquiries and calculations He had learned that the Johannesburg from Cape Town arrived in Liverpool the day before and he concluded that Pete s effects would come by the Peveril the weekly steamer to Ramsay on Saturday morning The Peveril left Liverpool at eight she would be due at three Caesar meant to be on the quay at two It s my duty as a parent Kate said he What more natural but there s something for yourself It s my duty as a pastor too for there s Manx ones going that s in danger of the devil of covetousness and it s doing the Lord s work to put them out of the reach of temptation You may exhort with them till you re black in the face but it s throwing good money in the mud Just chuck No ring at all no way responsive Kate was silent and Caesar added familiarly Of course it s my right too for when a man s birth is that way there s no heirship by blood and possession is nine points of the law That s so Kate You needn t be looking so hard It s truth enough girl I ve had advocate s opinion Kate had looked but had not listened The matter of her father s talk was too trivial it s interest was too remote As they drove she kept glancing seaward and asking what time it was Aw time enough yet woman said Caesar No need to be unaisy at all She ll not be round the Head for an hour anyway Will you come along with me to the quay then No Well better not maybe At the door of a draper s she got down from the gig and told her father not to wait for her on going home Caesar moistened his forefinger and held it in the air a moment Then don t be late said he there s weather coming A few minutes afterwards she was walking rapidly up Ballure Passing Ballure House she found herself treading softly It was like holy ground She did not look across she gave no sign there was only a tremor of the eyelids a quiver of the mouth and a tightening of the hand that held her purse as with head down she passed on Going by the water trough she saw the bullet head of Black Tom looking seaward over the hedge through a telescope encased in torn and faded cloth Though the man was repugnant to her she saluted him cheerfully Fine day mister Quilliam It was doing a fine day ma am but the bees is coming home said Tom He glowered at her as at a scout of the enemy but she did not mind that She was very happy The sun was still shining On reaching the top of the brow she began to skip and run where the road descends by Folieu Thus with a light heart and a light step thinking ill of no one in love with all the world she went hurrying to her doom The sea below lay very calm and blue Nothing was to be seen on the water but a line of black smoke from the funnel of a steamship which had not yet risen above the horizon VI Philip put up his horse at the Hibernian a mile farther on the high road and the tongue of the landlady Mistress Looney went like a mill race while he ate his dinner She had known three generations of his family and was full of stories of his grandfather of his father and of himself in his childhood Full of facetiae too about his looks which were rasonable promising and about the girls of Douglas who were neither good nor middling She was also full of sage counsel advising marriage with a warm girl having nice things at her nice lands and pigs and things as a ready way to square the bobbery of thirty years ago at Ballawhaine Philip left his plate half full and rose from the table to go down to Port Mooar But boy veen you ve destroyed nothing cried the landlady And then coaxingly as if he had been a child You ll be ateing bits for me now come come No more at all Aw it s failing you are mister Philip Going for a walk is it Take your topcoat then for the clover is closing He took the road that Pete had haunted as a boy on returning home from school in the days when Kate lived at Cornaa going through the network of paths by the mill and over the brow by Ballajora The new miller was pulling down the thatched cottage in which Kate had been born to put up a slate house They had built a porch for shelter to the chapel and carved the figure of a slaughtered lamb on a stone in the gable Another lamb a living lamb was being killed by the butcher of Ballajora as Philip went by the shambles The helpless creature with its inverted head swung downwards from the block looked at him with its piteous eyes and gave forth that distressful cry which is the last wild appeal of the stricken animal when it sees death near and has ceased to fight for life The air was quiet and the sea was calm but across the Channel a leaden sky seemed to hover over the English mountains though they were still light and apparently in sunshine As Philip reached Port Mooar a cart was coming out of it with a load of sea wrack for the land and a lobster fisher on the beach was shipping his gear for sea Quiet day said Philip in passing I m not much liking the look of it though said the fisherman Mortal thick surf coming up for the wind that s in But he slipped his boat pulled up sail and rode away Philip looked at his watch and then walked down the beach Coming to a cave he entered it The sea wrack was banked up in the darkness behind and between two stones at the mouth there were the remains of a recent fire Suddenly he remembered the cave It was the cave of the Carasdhoo men He eould hear the voice of Pete in its rumbling depths he could hear and see himself Shall we save the women Pete we always do Aw yes the women and the boys The tenderness of that memory was too much for Philip He came out of the cave and walked back over the shore She will come by the church he thought and he climbed the cliffs to look out A line of fir trees grew there a comb of little misshapen ghoul like things stunted by the winds that swept over the seas in winter In a fork of one of these a bird s nest of last year was still hanging but it was now empty songless joyless and dead She s here he told himself and he drew his breath noisily A white figure had turned the road by the sundial and was coming on with the step of a greyhound The black clouds above the English mountains were heeling down on the land There was a storm on the other coast though the sky over the island was still fine The steamship had risen above the horizon and was heading towards the bay VII She met him on the hill slope with a cry of joy and kissed him It came into his mind to draw away but he could not and he kissed her back Then she linked her arm in his and they turned down the beach I m glad you ve come he began Did you ever dream I wouldn t she said Her face was a smile her voice was an eager whisper I have something to say to you Kate it is something serious Is it so she said So very serious She was laughing and blushing together Didn t she know what he was going to say Didn t she guess what this serious something must be To prolong the delicious suspense before hearing it she pretended to be absorbed in the things about her She looked aside at the sea and up at the banks and down at the little dubbs of salt water as she skipped across them crying out at sight of the sea holly the anemone and the sea mouse shining like fire but still holding to Philip s arm and bounding and throbbing on it You must be quiet dear and listen he said Oh I ll be good so very good she said But look only look at the white horses out yonder far out beyond the steamer Davy s putting on the coppers for the parson eh She caught the grave expression of Philip s face and drew herself up with pretended severity saying Be quiet Katey Behave yourself Philip wants to talk to you seriously very seriously Then leaning forward with head aside to look up into his face she said Well sir why don t you begin Perhaps you think I ll cry out I won t I promise you I won t But she grew uneasy at the settled gravity of his face and the joy gradually died off her own When Philip spoke his voice was like a cracked echo of itself You remember what you said Kate when I brought you that last letter from Kimberley that if next morning you found it was a mistake Is it a mistake she asked Becalm Kate I am quite calm dear I remember I said it would kill me But I was very foolish I should not say so now Is Pete alive She spoke without a tremor and he answered in a husky whisper Yes Then in a breaking voice he said We were very foolish Kate jumping so hastily to a conclusion was very foolish it was worse than foolish it was wicked I half doubted the letter at the time but God forgive me I wanted to believe it and so I am glad Pete is living she said quietly He was aghast at her calmness The irregular lines in his face showed the disordered state of his soul but she walked by his side without the quiver of an eyelid or a tinge of colour more than usual Had she understood Look he said and he drew Pete s telegram from his pocket and gave it to her She opened it easily and he watched her while she read it prepared for a cry and ready to put his arms about her if she fell But there was not a movement save the motion of her fingers not a sound except the crinking of the thin paper He turned his head away The sun was shining there was a steely light on the firs and here and there a white breaker was rising like a sea bird out of the blue surface of the sea Well she said Kate you astonish me said Philip This comes on us like a thundercloud and you seem not to realise it She put her arms about his neck and the paper rustled on his shoulder My darling she said do you love me still You know I love you but Then there is no thundercloud in heaven for me now she said The simple grandeur of the girl s love shamed him Its trust its confidence its indifference to all the evil chance of life if only he loved her still this had been beyond him But he disengaged her arms and said We must not live in a fool s paradise Kate You promised yourself to Pete But Philip she said that was when I was a child It was only a half promise then and I didn t know what I was doing I didn t know what love was All that came later dearest much later you know when To Pete it is the same thing Kate said Philip He is coming home to claim you She stopped him by getting in front of him and saying with face down smoothing his sleeve as she spoke You are a man Philip and you cannot understand How can you and how can I tell you When a girl is not a woman but only a child she is a different person She can t love anybody then not really not to say love and the promises she makes can t count It was not I that promised myself to Pete if I did promise It was my little sister the little sister that was me long long ago but is now gone put to sleep inside me somewhere Is that very foolish darling But think of Pete said Philip think of him going away for love of you living five years abroad toiling slaving saving encountering privations perhaps perils and all for you all for love of you Then think of him coming home with his heart full of you buoyed up with the hope of you thirsting starving and yearning for you and finding you lost to him dead to him worse than dead it will kill him Kate She was unmoved by the picture I am very sorry but I do not love him she said quietly I am sorry what else can a girl be when she does not love a young man He left me to take care of you too and you see you see by the telegram he is coming home with faith in my loyalty How can I tell him that I have broken my trust How can I meet him and explain I know Philip Say we heard he was dead and No it would be too wretched It s only three weeks since the letter came and it would not be true Kate it would revolt me She lifted her eyes in a fond look of shame faced love and said again I know then lay the blame on me Philip What do I care Say it was all my fault and I made you love me I shan t care for anybody s talk And it s true isn t it Partly true eh If I talked to Pete of temptation I should despise myself said Philip and then she threw her head up and said proudly Very well tell the truth itself the simple truth Philip Say we tried to be faithful and loyal and all that and could not because we loved each other and there was no help for it If I tell him the truth I shall die of shame said Philip Oh there is no way out of this miserable tangle Whether I cover myself with deceit or strip myself of evasion I shall stain my soul for ever I shall become a base man and year by year sink lower and lower in the mire of lies and deceit She listened with her eyes fixed on his quivering face and her eyelids fluttered and her fond looks began to be afraid Say that we married he continued we should never forget that you had broken your promise and I my trust That memory would haunt us as long as we lived We should never know one moment s happiness or one moment s peace Pete would be a broken hearted man perhaps a wreck perhaps who knows dead of his own hand He would be the ghost between us always And do you think I should be afraid of that she said Indeed no If you were with me Philip and loved me still I should not care for all the spirits of heaven itself Her face was as pale as death now but her great eyes were shining Our love would fail us Kate said Philip The sense of our guilt would kill it How could we go on loving each other with a thing like that about us all day and all night sitting at our table listening to our talk standing by our bed Oh merciful God The terror of his vision mastered him and he covered his face with both hands She drew them down again and held them in a tight lock in her fingers But the stony light of his eyes was more fearful to look upon and she said in a troubled voice Do you mean Philip that we could not marry now He did not answer and she repeated the question looking up into his face like a criminal waiting for his sentence her head bent forward and her mouth open We cannot he muttered God help us we dare not he said and then he tried to show her again how their marriage was impossible now that Pete had come without treason and shame and misery But his words frayed off into silence He caught the look of her eyes and it was like the piteous look of the lamb under the hands of the butcher Is that what you came to tell me she asked His reply died in his throat She divined rather than heard it Her doom had fallen on her but she did not cry out She did not yet realise in all its fulness what had happened It was like a bullet wound in battle first a sense of air almost of relief then a pang and then overwhelming agony They had been walking again but she slid in front of him as she had done before Her arms crept up his breast with a caressing touch and linked themselves behind his neck This is only a jest dearest she said some test of my love perhaps You wished to make sure of me quite quite sure now that Pete is alive and coming home But you see I want only one to love me only one dear Come now confess Don t be afraid to say you have been playing with me I shan t be angry with you Come speak to me He could not utter a word and she let her arms fall from his neck and they walked on side by side both staring out to sea The English mountains were black by this time A tempest was raging on the other shore though the air on this side was as soft as human breath Presently she stopped her feet scraped the gravel and she exclaimed in a husky tone I know what it is It is not Pete I am in your way That s it You can t get on with me about you I am not fit for you The distance between us is too great He struggled to deny it but he could not It was part of the truth He knew too well how near to being the whole truth it was Pete had come at the last moment to cover up his conscience but Kate was stripping it naked and showing him the skeleton It s all very well for you she cried but where am I Why didn t you leave me alone Why did you encourage me Yes indeed encourage me Didn t you say though a woman couldn t raise herself in life a man could lift her up if he only loved her And didn t you tell me there was neither below nor above where there was true liking and that if a woman belonged to some one and some one belonged to her it was God s sign that they were equal and everything else was nothing pride was nothing and position was nothing and the whole world was nothing But now I know different The world is between us It always has been between us and you can never belong to me You will go on and rise up and I will be left behind Then she broke into frightful laughter Oh I have been a fool How I dreamt of being happy I knew I was only a poor ignorant thing but I saw myself lifted up by the one I loved And now I am to be left alone Oh it is awful Why did you deceive me Yes deceive me Isn t that deceiving me You deceived me when you led me to think that you loved me more than all the world You don t I It is the world itself you love and Pete is only your excuse As she spoke she clutched at his arms his hands his breast and at her own throat as if something was strangling her He did not answer her reproaches for he knew well what they were They were the bitter cry of her great love her great misery and her great jealousy of the world the merciless and mysterious power that was luring him away After awhile his silence touched her and she came up to him full of remorse and said No no Philip you have nothing to reproach yourself with You did not deceive me at all I deceived myself It was my own fault I led you on I know that And yet I ve been saying these cruel things You ll forgive me though will you not A girl can t help it sometimes Philip Are you crying You are not crying are you Kiss me Philip and forgive me You can do that can t you She asked like a child with her face up and her lips apart He was about to yield and was reaching forward to touch her forehead when suddenly the child became the woman and she leapt upon his breast and held him fervently her blood surging her bosom exulting her eyes flaming and her passionate voice crying Philip you are mine No I will not release you I don t care about your plans you shall give them up I don t care about your trust you shall break it I don t care about Pete coming let him come The world can do without you I cannot You are mine Philip and I am yours and nobody else s and never will be You must come back to me sooner or later if you go away I know it I feel it it s in my heart But I ll never let you go I can t I can t Haven t I a right to you Yes I have a right Don t you remember Can you ever forget My husband The last word came muffled from his breast where she had buried her head in the convulsions of her trembling at the moment when her modesty went down in the fierce battle with a higher pain But the plea which seemed to give her the right to cling the closer made the man to draw apart It was the old deep tragedy of human love the ancient inequality in the bond of man and woman What she had thought her conquest had been her vanquishment He could not help it her last word had killed everything Oh God he groaned that is the worst of all Philip she cried what do you mean I mean that neither can I marry you nor can you marry Pete You would carry to him your love of me and bit by bit he would find it out and it would kill him It would kill you too for you have called me your husband and you could never never never forget it I don t want to marry Pete she said If I m not to marry you I don t want to marry any one But do you mean that I must not marry at all that I never can now that The word failed her and his answer came thick and indistinct Yes And you Philip What about yourself As there is no other man for you Kate he said so there is no other woman for me We must go through the world alone Is this my punishment It is the punishment of both Kate the punishment of both alike Kate stopped her breathing Her clenched hands slackened away from his neck and she stepped back from him shuddering with remorse and despair and shame She saw herself now for the first time a fallen woman Never before had her sin touched her soul It was at that moment she fell They had come up to the cave by this time and she sat on the stone at the mouth of it in a great outburst of weeping It tore his heart to hear her The voice of her weeping was like the distressful cry of the slaughtered lamb He had to wrestle with himself not to take her in his arms and comfort her The fit of tears spent itself at length and after a time she drew a great breath and was quiet Then she lifted her face and the last gleam of the autumn sun smote her colourless lips and swollen eyes When she spoke again it was like one speaking in her sleep or under the spell of somebody who had magnetised her It is wrong of me to think so much of myself as if that were everything I ought to feel sorry for you too You must be driven to it or you could never be so cruel With his face to the sea he mumbled something about Pete and she caught up the name and said Yes and Pete too As you think it would be wrong to Pete I will not hold to you Oh it will be wrong to me as well But I will not give you the pain of turning a deaf ear to my troubles any more She was struggling with a pitiless hope that perhaps she might regain him after all If I give him up she thought he will love me for it and then with a sad ring in her voice she said You will go on and be a great man now for you ll not have me to hold you back For pity s sake say no more of that he said but she paid no heed I used to think it a wonderful thing to be loved by a great man I don t now It is terrible If I could only have you to myself If you could only be nothing to anybody else You would be everything to me and what should I care then Between torture and love he had almost broken down at that but he gripped his breast and turned half aside for his eyes were streaming She came up to him and touched with the tips of her fingers the hand that hung by his side and said in a voice like a child s Fancy this is the end of everything and when we part now we are to meet no more Not the same way at all not as we have met You will be like anybody else to me and I will be like anybody else to you Miss Cregeen that will be my name and you will be mister Christian When you see me you ll say to yourself Yes poor thing long ago when she was a girl I made her love me Nobody ever loved me like that And fancy when you pass me in the street you will not even look my way You won t will you No no it will be better not Goodbye Her simple tenderness almost stifled him He had to hold his under lip with his teeth to keep back the cry that was bursting from his tongue At last he could bear it no longer and he broke out Would to God we had never loved each other Would to God we had never met But she answered with the same childish sweetness Don t say that Philip We have had some happy hours together I would rather be parted from you like this though it is so hard so cruel than never to have met you at all Isn t it something for me to think of that the truest cleverest noblest man in all the world has loved me Good bye Good bye His heart bled his heart cried but he uttered no sound They were side by side She let his hand slip from the tips of her fingers and drew silently away At three paces apart she paused but he gave no sign She climbed the low brow of the hill slowly very slowly trying to command her throat which was fluttering and looking back through her tears as she went Philip heard the shingle slip under her feet while she toiled up the cliff and when she reached the top the soft thud on the turf seemed to beat on his heart She stood there a moment against the sky waiting for a sound from the shore a cry a word the lifting of a hand a sob a sigh her own name Kate and she was ready to fly back even then wounded and humiliated as she was a poor torn bird that had been struggling in the lime But no he was silent and motionless and she disappeared behind the hill He saw her go and all the light of heaven went with her VIII It was so far back home so much farther than it had been to come The course is short and easy going out to sea when the tide is with you and the water is smooth and the sun is shining but long and hard coming back to harbour when the waves have risen and the sky is low and the wind is on your bow So far so very far She thought everybody looked at her and knew her for what she was a broken forsaken fallen woman And she was so tired too she wondered if her limbs would carry her When Philip was left alone the sky seemed to be lying on his shoulders The English mountains were grey and ghostly now and the storm which had spent itself on the other coast seemed to hang over the island There were breakers where the long dead sea had been and the petrel outside was scudding close to the white curves and uttering its dismal note So heavy and confused had the storm and wreck of the last hour left him that he did not at first observe by the backward tail of smoke that the steamer had passed round the Head and that the cart he had met at the mouth of the port had come back empty to the cave for another load of sea wrack The lobster fisher too had beached his boat near by and was shouting through the hollow air wherein every noise seemed to echo with a sepulchral quake The block was going whistling at the mast head We ll have a squall I was thinking so in I came That night Philip dreamt a dream He was sitting on a dais with a wooden canopy above him the English coat of arms behind and a great book in front his hands shook as he turned the leaves he felt his leg hang heavily people bowed low to him and dropped their voices in his presence he was the Deemster and he was old A young woman stood in the dock dripping water from her hair and she had covered her face with her hands In the witness box a young man was standing and his head was down The man had delivered the woman to dishonour she had attempted her life in her shame and her despair And looking on the man the Deemster thought he spoke in a stern voice saying Witness I am compelled to punish her but oh to heaven that I could punish you in her place What have you to say for yourself I have nothing to say for myself the young man answered and he lifted his head and the old Deemster saw his face Then Philip awoke with a smothered scream for the young man s face had been his own IX When Caesar got to the quay he looked about with watchful eyes as if fearing he might find somebody there before him The coast was clear and he gave a grunt of relief After fixing the horse cloth and settling the mare in a nose bag he began to walk up and down the fore part of the harbour still keeping an eager look out As time went on he grew comfortable exchanged salutations with the harbour master and even whistled a little to while away the time Quiet day mister Quayle Quiet enough yet mister Cregeen but what s it saying The greater the calm the nearer the south wind By the time that Caesar from the end of the pier saw the smoke of the steamer coming round Kirk Maughold Head he was in a spiritual almost a mournful mood He was feeling how melancholy was the task of going to meet the few possessions the clothes and such like which were all that remained of a dear friend departed It was the duty of somebody though and Caesar drew a long breath of resignation The steamer came up to the quay and there was much bustle and confusion Caesar waited with one hand on the mare s neck until the worst of it was over Then he went aboard and said in a solemn voice to the sailor at the foot of the gangway Anything here the property of mister Peter Quilliam That s his luggage said the sailor pointing to a leather trunk of moderate size among similar trunks at the mouth of the hatchway H m said Caesar eyeing it sideways and thinking how small it was Then reflecting that perhaps valuable papers were all it was thought worth while to send home he added cheerfully I ll take it with me Somewhat to Caesar s surprise the sailor raised no difficulties but just as he was regarding the trunk with that faith which is the substance of things hoped for a big ugly hand laid hold of it and began to rock it about like a pebble It was Black Tom smoking with perspiration Aisy man aisy said Caesar with lofty dignity I ve the gig on the quay And I ve a stiff cart on the market said Black Tom I m wanting no assistance said Caesar you needn t trouble yourself Don t mention it Caesar said Black Tom and he turned the trunk on end and bent his back to lift it But Caesar put a heavy hand on top and said Gough bless me man but I am sorry for thee Mammon hath entered into thy heart Tom He have just popped out of thine then said Black Tom swirling the trunk on one of its corners But Caesar held on and said I don t know in the world why you should let the devil of covetousness get the better of you I don t mane to let go the chiss said Black Tom and in another minute he had it on his shoulder Now I believe in my heart said Caesar I would be forgiven a little violence and he took the trunk by both hands to bring it down again Let go the chiss or I ll strek thee into the harbour bawled Black Tom under his load The Philistines be upon thee Samson cried Caesar and with that there was a struggle In the midst of the uproar while the men were shouting into each other s faces and the trunk was rocking between them shoulder high a sunburnt man with a thick beard and a formidable voice a stalwart fellow in a pilot jacket and wide brimmed hat came hurrying up the cabin stairs and a dog came running behind him A moment later he had parted the two men and the trunk was lying at his feet Black Tom fell back a step lifted his straw hat scratched his bald crown and muttered in a voice of awe Holy sailor Caesar s face was livid and his eyes went up toward his forehead Lord have mercy upon me he mumbled have mercy on my soul O Lord Don t be afraid said the stranger I m a living man and not a ghost The man himself said Black Tom Peter Quilliam alive and hearty said Caesar I am said Pete And now what s the bobbery between the pair of you Shuperintending the beaching of my trunk eh But having recovered from his terror at the idea that Pete was a spirit Caesar began to take him to task for being a living man How s this said he Answer me young man I ve praiched your funeral You ll have to do it again mister Cregeen for I m not gone yet said Pete No but worth ten dead men still said Black Tom And my goodness boy the smart and stout you re looking anyway Been thatching a bit on the chin eh Foreign parts has made a man of you Peter The straight you re like the family too You ll be coming up to the trough with me the ould home you know I ll be whipping the chiss ashore in a jiffy only Caesar s that eager to help it s wonderful No you ll not then Pete was shaking his head as he went up the gangway and seeing this Caesar said severely Lave the gentleman alone mister Quilliam He knows his own business best So do you mister Collecting Box said Black Tom But your head s as empty as a mollag and as full of wind as well It s a regular ould human mollag you are anyway floating other people s nets and taking all that s coming to them They were ashore by this time one of the quay porters was putting the trunk into the gig and Caesar was removing the horse cloth and the nose bag Get up mister Peter and don t listen to him said Caesar If my industry and integrity have been blessed with increase under Providence Lave Providence out of it you grasping ould Ebenezer Zachariah Amen bawled Black Tom You ve been flying in the face of Providence all your life Tom said Caesar taking his seat beside Pete You haven t though you miser said Black Tom you d sell your soul for sixpence and you d raffle your ugly ould body if you could get anybody to take tickets Go home Thomas said Caesar twiddling the reins go home and try for the future to be a better man But that was too much for Black Tom Better man is it Come down on the quay and up with your fiss and I ll show you which of us is the better man A moment later Caesar and Pete were rattling over the cobbles of the market place with the dog racing behind Pete was full of questions And how s yourself mister Cregeen I m in sir I m in sir praise the Lord And Grannie Like myself sir not getting a dale younger but caring little for spiritual things though Going west is she poor ould angel There ought to be a good piece of daylight at her yet for all And and Nancy Joe A happy sinner still said Caesar I suppose sir you d be making good money out yonder now We were hearing the like anyway Money said Pete Well yes Enough to keep off the divil and the coroner But how s how s There now For life eh said Caesar Yes for life but that s nothing said Pete how s Wonderful cried Caesar five years too Boy veen the light was nearly took out of my eyes when I saw you But Kate How s Kate How s the girl herself said Pete nervously Smart uncommon said Caesar God bless her cried Pete with a shout that was heard across the street We ll pick her up at Crellin s it s like said Caesar What Crellin s round the corner Crellin the draper s I Woa Let me down The mare s tired father and Pete was over the wheel at a bound He came out of the shop saying Kate had left word that her father was not to wait for her she would perhaps be home before him Amid a crowd of the mob beg children of the streets to whom he showered coppers to be scrambled for Pete got up again to Caesar s side and they set off for Sulby The wind had risen suddenly and was hooting down the narrow streets coming up from the harbour And Philip How s Philip shouted Pete mister Christian Well and hearty and doing wonders sir I knew it cried Pete with a resounding laugh Going like a flood and sweeping everything before him said Caesar The rising day with him is it said Pete I always said he d be the first man in the island and he s not going to deceave me neither The young man s been over putting a sight on us times and times he was up at my Melliah only a week come Wednesday said Caesar Man alive cried Pete him and me are same as brothers Then it wasn t true what they were writing in the letter sir that your black boys left you for dead They did that bad luck to them said Pete but I was thinking it no sin to disappoint them though Well well lying began with the world and with the world it will end said Caesar As they passed Ballywhaine Pete shouted into Caesar s ear above the wind that was roaring in the trees and scattering the ripening leaves in clouds And how s Dross That wastrel Aw tearing away tearing away said Caesar Floating on the top of the tide is he shouted Pete Maybe so but the devil is fishing where yonder fellow s swimming answered Caesar And the ould man the Ballawhaine still above the sod bawled Pete behind his hand Yes but failing failing failing shouted Caesar The world s getting too heavy for the man Debts here and debts there and debts everywhere Not much water in the harbour then eh cried Pete No but down on the rocks already if it s only myself that knows it shouted Caesar When they had turned the Sulby Bridge and come in sight of The Manx Fairy Pete s excitement grew wild and he leaped up from his seat and shouted above the wind like a man possessed My gough the very place You ve been thatching though yes you have The street Holy sailor there it is Brownie at you still Her heifer is it Get up Molly A taste of the whip ll do the mare no harm sir My sakes here s ould Flora hobbling out to meet us Got the rheumatics has she Set me down Caesar Here we are man Lord alive the smell of the cowhouse That warm and damp it s grand What don t you know me Flo Got your temper still if you ve lost your teeth My sakes the haggard The same spot again It s turf they re burning inside And my gracious that s herrings roasting in their brine Where s Grannie though Let s put a sight in Caesar Well well aw well aw well Thus Pete came home laughing shouting bawling and bellowing above the tumult of the wind which had risen by this time to the strength of a gale Mother cried Caesar going in at the porch gentleman here from foreign parts to put a word on you I never had nobody there belonging to me began Grannie No then nobody said Caesar One that was going to be maybe if he d lived poor boy Grannie shouted Pete and he burst into the bar room Goodness me cried Grannie it s his own voice anyway It s himself shouted Pete and the old soul was in his arms in an instant Aw dear Aw dear she panted Pete it is for sure Let me sit down though Did you think it was his ghost then mother said Caesar with an indulgent air Deed no said Grannie The lad wouldn t come back to plague nobody thinks I Still and for all the uprisement of Peter it bates everything said Caesar It s a sort of a resurrection I thought I d have a sight up to the packet for his chiss poor fellow and behould ye who should I meet in the two eyes but the man himself Aw dear It s wonderful I it s terrible I m silly with the joy said Grannie It was lies in the letter the Manx ones were writing said Caesar Letters and writings are all lies said Grannie As long as I live I ll take no more of them and if that Kelly the postman comes here again I ll take the bellows to him So you thought I was gone for good Grannie said Pete Well I thought so too Will I die I says to myself times and times but I bethought me at last there wasn t no sense in a good man like me laving his bones out on the bare Veldt yonder so you see I spread my wings and came home again It s the Lord s doings it s marvellous in our eyes said Caesar and Grannie who had recovered herself and was bustling about cried Let me have a right look at him then Goodness me the whisker And as soft as Manx carding from the mill too I like him best when he takes off his hat Well I m proud to see you boy Deed but I wouldn t have known you though Who s the gentleman in the gig with father thinks I And I d have said it was the Dempster himself if he hadn t been dead and in his coffin That ll do that ll do roared Pete That s Grannie putting the fun on me It s no use talking but I can t keep quiet no I can t cried Grannie and with that she whipped up a bowl from the kitchen dresser and fell furiously to peeling the potatoes that were there for supper But where s Kate said Pete Aw yes where is she Kate Kate called Grannie leaning her head toward the stairs and Nancy Joe who had been standing silent until now said Didn t she go to Ramsey with the gig woman Aw the foolish I am Of course she did said Grannie but why hasn t she come back with father She left word at Crellin s not to wait said Caesar She ll be gone to Miss Clucas s to try on said Nancy Wouldn t trust now said Grannie She s having two new dresses done Pete Aw girls are ter ble Well can you blame them either She shall have two and twenty if she likes God bless her said Pete Goodness me said Nancy is the man for buying frocks for a Mormon But you ll be empty boy Put the crow down and the griddle on Nancy said Grannie We ll have

clever Of course he s been steady abroad steady as a gun But Kate said Pete tramping the sanded floor is she changed at all Aw she s a woman now boy said Grannie Bless my soul said Pete She was looking a bit white and narvous one while there but she s sprung out of it fresh and bright same as the ling on the mountains Well that s the way with young women I know said Pete Just the break of the morning with the darlings But she s the best looking girl on the island now Pete said Nancy Joe I ll go bail on it cried Pete Big and fine and rosy and fit for anything Bless my heart You should have seen her at the Melliah it was a trate God bless me Sun bonnet and pink frock and tight red stockings and straight as a standard rase Hould your tongue woman shouted Pete I ll see herself first and I m dying to do it Caesar came back with the gorse Nancy fed the fire and Grannie stirred the oatmeal and water And while the cakes were baking Pete tramped the kitchen and examined everything and recognised old friends with a roar Bless me the same place still There s the clock on the shelf with the scratch on its face and the big finger broke at the joint and the lath and the peck and the whip you ve had it new corded though Sakes how the boy remembers cried Grannie And the white rumpy the cat had leapt on to the dresser out of the reach of Pete s dog and from that elevation was eyeing him steadfastly and the slowrie and the kettle and the poker my gracious the very poker Now did you ever cried Grannie with amazement And yes no it is though I ll swear it before the Dempster that s said Pete picking up a three legged stool that s the very stool she was sitting on herself in the fire seat in front of the turf closet Let me sit there now for the sake of ould times gone by He put the stool in the fireplace and sat on it shouting as he did so between a laugh and a cry Aw Grannie bogh Grannie bogh to think there s been half the world between us since I was sitting here before And Grannie herself breaking down said Wouldn t you like the tongs boy Give the boy the tongs woman just to say he s at home Pete plucked the tongs out of Nancy s hands and began feeding the fire with the gorse Aw Grannie have I ever been away he cried laughing and his wet eyes gleaming Nancy Joe have you no nose at all cried Grannie The cake s burning to a cinder Let it burn mother shouted Pete It s the way she was doing herself when she was young and forgetting Shillings a piece for all that s wasted Aw the smell of it s sweet So saying he piled the gorse on the fire ramming it under the griddle and choking it behind the crow And while the oatcake crackled and sparched and went black he sniffed up the burning odour and laughed and cried in the midst of the smoke that went swirling up the chimney And meanwhile Grannie herself with the tears rolling down her cheeks was flapping her apron before her face and saying He ll make me die of laughing he will though yes he will But behind the apron she was blubbering to Nancy It s coming home woman that s it it s just coming home again poor boy By this time word of Pete s return had gone round Sulby and the bar room was soon thronged with men and women who looked through the glass partition into the kitchen at the bronzed and bearded man who sat smoking by the fire with his dog curled up at his feet There ll be a wedding soon said one The girl s in luck said another Success to the fine girl she always was and lucky they kept her from the poor toot that was beating about on her port bow The young Ballawhaine eh Who else Presently the dog went out to them and in default of its master became a centre of excited interest It was an old creature with a settled look of age and a gravity of expression that seemed to say he had got over the follies of youth and was now reserved and determined to keep the peace His back was curved in as if a cart wheel had gone over his spine he had gigantic ears a stump of a tail a coat thin and prickly like the bristles of a pig but white and spotted with brown Lord save us a queer dog though what s his breed at all said one and then a resounding voice came from the kitchen doorway saying A sort of a Manxman crossed with a bat Got no tail to speak of but there s plenty of ears at him A handy sort of a dog only a bit spoiled in his childhood Not fit for much company anyway and no more notion of dacent behaviour than my ould shoe Down Dempster down It was Pete He was greeted with loud welcomes and soon filled the room all round with the steaming odour of spirits and water You ve the Manx tongue at you still mister Quilliam said Jonaique and you re calling the dog Dempster what s that for at all For sake of the ould island mister Jelly and for the straight he s like Dempster Mylrea when he s a bit crooked said Pete The old man s dead sir said John the Clerk You don t say said Pete Yes though the sun went down on him a Wednesday The drink sir the drink I ve been cutting a sod of his grave to day And who s to be Dempster now asked Pete Who are they putting in for it Well said John the Clerk they re talking and talking and some s saying this one and others that one but the most is saying your ould friend Philip Christian I knew it I always said it shouted Pete best man in the island bar none Oh he ll not deceave me The wind was roaring in the chimney and the light was beginning to fail Pete became restless and walked to and fro peering out at intervals by the window that looked on to the road At this there was some pushing and nudging and indulgent whispering It s the girl Aw be aisy with the like Five years apart be aisy The meadow s white with the gulls sitting together like parrots what s that a sign of father said Pete Just a slant of rain maybe and a puff of wind said Caesar But said Pete looking up at the sky the long cat tail was going off at a slant awhile ago and now the thick skate yonder is hanging mortal low Take your time sir said Caesar No need to send round the Cross Vustha fiery cross yet The girl will be home immadiently It ll be dark at her though said Pete The company tried to draw him into conversation about the ways of life in the countries he had visited but he answered absently and jerkily and kept going to the door Suppose there ll be Dempsters enough where you re coming from said Jonaique Sort of Dempsters yes Called one of them Ould Necessity because it knows no law He rigged up the statute books atop of his stool for a high sate and when he wanted them he couldn t find them high or low Not the first judge that s sat on the law though It s coming Caesar d ye hear it That s the rain on the street Aisy man aisy man said Caesar New dresses isn t rigged up in no time There ll be chapels now eh Chapels and conferences and proper religious instruction Divil a chapel sir only a rickety barn belonging to some ones they re calling the Sky Pilots to Wanted the ould miser that runs it to build them a new tabernacle but he wouldn t part till a lump of plaster fell on his bald head at a love feast and then he planked down a hundred pound and they all shouted Hit him again Lord you might D ye hear that then That s the water coming down from the gill I can t stand no more of it Grannie Grannie was at the door struggling to hold it against the wind while she looked out into the gathering darkness Deed but I m getting afraid of it myself she said and dear heart knows where Kirry can be at this time of night I m off to find her said Pete and catching up his hat and whistling to the dog in a moment he was gone X The door was hard to close behind him for it was now blowing a gale from the north east Caesar slipped through the dairy to see if the outbuildings were safe and came back with a satisfied look The stable and cow house were barred the barns were shut up the mill wheel was on the brake the kiln fire was burning gently and all was snug and tight Grannie was wringing her hands as he returned crying Kate Oh Kate and he reproved her for want of trust in Providence People were now coming in rapidly with terrible stories of damage done by the storm It was reported that the Chicken Rock Lighthouse was blown down that the tide had risen to twenty five feet in Ramsey and torn up the streets and that a Peel fisherman had been struck by his mainsail into the sea and drowned More came into the house at every minute and among them were all the lonesome and helpless ones within a radius of a mile Blind Jane who charmed blood but could not charm the wind Shemiah the prophet with beard down to his waist and a staff up to his shoulder and old Juan Vessy who lived on the houses in the way of a tramp The people who had been there already were afraid to go out and Grannie still wringing her hands and crying Kate Kate called everybody into the kitchen to gather about the fire There they bemoaned their boys on the sea told stories of former storms and quarrelled about the years of wrecks and the sources of the winds that caused them The gale increased to fearful violence and sometimes the wind sounded like sheets flapping against the walls sometimes like the deep boom of the waves that roll on themselves in mid ocean and never know a shore It began to groan in the chimney as if it were a wild beast struggling to escape and then the smoke came down in whorls and filled the kitchen They had to put out the fire to keep themselves from suffocation and to sit back from the fireplace to protect themselves from cold The door of the porch flew open and they barricaded it with long handled brushes the windows rattled in their frames and they blocked them up with the tops of the tables In spite of all efforts to shut out the wind the house was like a basket and it quaked like a ship at sea I never heard the like on the water itself and I m used of the sea too said one The others groaned and mumbled prayers Kelly the Thief who had come in unopposed by Grannie was on his knees in one corner with his face to the wall calling on the Lord to remember that he had seen things in letters stamps and such but had never touched them John the Clerk was saying that he had to bury the Deemster Jonaique the barber that he had been sent for to cut the Bishop and Claudius Kewley the farmer that he had three fields of barley still uncut and a stack of oats unthatched Oh Lord cried Claudius let me not die till I ve got nothing to do Caesar stood like a strong man amidst their moans and groans their bowings of the head and clappings of the hands and when he heard the farmer his look was severe Cloddy said he how do you dare to doubt the providence of God Aisy to talk mister Cregeen the farmer whined but you ve got your own harvest saved and then Caesar had no resource but to punish the man in prayer The Lord had sent His storm to reprove some that were making too sure of His mercies but there was grace in the gale only they wouldn t be patient and trust to God s providence there was milk in the breast only the wayward child wouldn t take time to find the teat Lord lead them to true stillness In the midst of Caesar s prayer there was a sudden roar outside and he leapt abruptly to his feet with a look of vexation I believe in my heart that s the mill wheel broken loose said he and if it is the corn on the kiln will be going like a whirlingig Trust in God s providence Caesar cried the farmer So I will said Caesar catching up his hat but I ll put out my kiln fire first When Pete stepped out of the porch he felt himself smitten as by an invisible wing and he gasped like a fish with too much air A quick pain in the side at that moment reminded him of his bullet wound but his heels had heart in them and he set off to run The night had fallen but a green rent was torn in the leaden sky and through this the full moon appeared When he got to Ramsey the tide was up to the old cross slates were flying like kites and the harbour sounded like a battlefield with its thunderous roar of rigging He made for the dressmaker s and heard that Kate had not been there for six hours At the draper s he learned that at two o clock in the afternoon she had been seen going up Ballure The sound rocket was fired as he pushed through the town A schooner riding to an anchor in the bay was flying her ensign for help The sea was terrific a slaty grey streaked with white foam like quartz veins but the men who had been idling on the quay when the water was calm were now struggling chafing and fighting to go out on it for the blood of the old Vikings was in them Going by the water trough Pete called on Black Tom who was civil and conciliatory until he heard his errand then growled with disappointment but nevertheless answered his question Yes he had seen the young woman She went up early in the everin and left him good day Giving this grateful news Black Tom could not deny himself a word of bitterness to poison the pleasure And when you are finding her said he you ll be doing well to take her in tow for I m thinking there s some that s for throwing her a rope Who d ye mane said Pete I lave it with you said Black Tom and Pete pulled the door after him On the breast of the hill there was the meeting of two roads one of them leading up to the Hibernian the other going down to Port Mooar To resolve the difficulty of choice Pete inquired at a cottage standing some paces beyond and as Kate had not been seen to pass up the higher road he determined to take the lower one But he gathered no tidings by the way for Billy by the mill knew nothing and the woman by the sundial had gone to bed At length he dipped into Port Mooar and came to a little cottage like a child s Noah s ark with its tiny porch and red light inside looking out on the white breakers that were racing along the beach It was the cottage of the lobster fisher Pete inquired if he had seen Kate He answered no he had seen nobody that day but mister Christian Which of the Christians mister Philip Christian The news carried only one message to Pete s mind It seemed to explain something which had begun to perplex him why Philip had not met him at the quay and why Kate had not heard of his coming Clearly Philip was at present at Ballure He had not yet received the telegram addressed to Douglas Pete turned back Surely Kate had called somewhere She would be at home by this time He tried to run but the wind was now in his face It was veering northwards every minute and rising to the force of a hurricane He tied his handkerchief over his head and under his chin to hold on his hat His hair whipped his ears like rods Sometimes he was swept into the hedge often he was brought to his knees Still he toiled along through sheets of spray that glistened with the colours of a rainbow and ran over the ground like driven rain His eyes smarted and the taste on his lips was salt The moon was now riding at the full through a wild flecked sky and Pete could clearly see as he returned towards the bay a crowd of human figures on the cliffs above Port Lewaige Quaking with undefined fears he pushed on until he had joined them The schooner abandoned by her crew had parted her cable and was rolling like a blinded porpoise towards the rocks She fell on them with the groan of a living creature and the instant her head was down the white lions of the sea leapt over her with a howl the water swirled through her bulwarks and filled her hatches her rudder was unshipped her sails were torn from their gaskets and the floating home wherein men had sailed and sung and slept and laughed and jested was a broken wreck in the heavy wallowings of the waves Kate had not returned when Pete got back to Sulby but the excitement of her absence was eclipsed for the time by the turmoil of Caesar s trouble Standing in the dark on the top of the midden he was shouting to the dairy door in a voice of thunder which went off at the end of his beard like the puling of a cat The mill wheel was going same as a whirlingig was there nobody to hould the brake The stable roof was stripped and the mare was tearing herself to pieces in a roaring pit of hell was there never a shoulder for the door The cow house thatch was flapping like a sail was there nothing in the world but a woman Nancy Joe to help a man to throw a ladder and a stone over it Only when Caesar had been pacified was there silence to speak of Kate I picked up news of her coming back by Claughbane said Pete and traced her as near home as the Ginger She can t be far away Where is she Those who were cool enough fell to conjecture Grannie had no resource but groans Nancy was moaning by her side The rest were full of their own troubles Blind Jane was bewailing her affliction You can all see she cried but I m not knowing the harm that s coming on me Hush woman hush said Pete we re all same as yourself half our lives we re all blind at night In the midst of the tumult a knock came to the door and Pete made a plunge towards the porch Wait cried Caesar Nobody else comes here to night except the girl herself Another wind like the last and we ll have the roof off the house too Then he called to the new comer with his face to the porch door and the answer came back to him in a wail like the wind itself Who s there It was Joney from the glen We re like herrings in a barrel we can t let you in She wasn t wanting to come in But her roof was going stripping and half her house was felled and she couldn t get her son the idiot boy to leave his bed He would perish he would die he was all the family she had left to her wouldn t the master come and save him Impossible shouted Caesar We ve our own missing this fearful night Joney and the Lord will protect His children Was it Kate She had seen her in the glen Let me get at that door said Pete But the house will come down cried Caesar Let it come said Pete Pete shut the door of the bar room and then the wind was heard to swirl through the porch When did you see her Joney and where said the voice of Pete and the voice of Joney answered him Goings by my own house at the start of the storm this everin I ll come with you go on said Pete and Grannie shouted across the bar Take Caesar s topcoat over your monkey jacket I ve sail enough already for a wind like this mother cried the voice of Pete and then the swirling sound in the porch went off with a long drawn whirr and Caesar came back alone to the kitchen Pete s wound ached again but he pressed his hand on the place of it and struggled up the glen dragging Joney behind him They came to her house at last One half of the thatch lay over the other half the rafters were bare like the ribs of the wreck the oat cake peck was rattling on the lath the meal barrel in the corner was stripped of its lid and the meal was whirling into the air like a waterspout the dresser was stripped the broken crockery lay on the uncovered floor and the iron slowrie hanging over the place of the fire was swinging and striking against the wall and ringing like a knell And in the midst of this scene of desolation the idiot boy was placidly sleeping on his naked bed and over it the moon was scudding through a tattered sky The night wore on and the company in the kitchen listened long and sometimes heard sounds as of voices crying in the wind but Pete did not return Then they fell to groaning again to praying aloud without fear and to confessing their undiscovered sins without shame I m searched terrible I can see through me cried Kelly the postman Some were chiefly troubled lest death should fall on them while they were in a public house I keep none cried Caesar But you wouldn t let us open the door whined the farmer If the door had been wide enough for a Bishop not a soul would have stirred For the first time within anyone s recollection Nancy Joe was on her knees O Lord she prayed Thou knowest well I don t often bother Thee But save Kate Lord oh save and prasarve my little Kirry It s twenty years and better since I asked anything of Thee before and if Thou wilt only take away this wind I ll promise not to say another prayer for twenty years more Say it in Manx woman moaned Grannie I always say my prayers in Manx as well and the Lord can listen to the one He knows best There s prayer as well as praise in singing cried Caesar and they began to sing all down on their knees their eyes tightly closed and their hands clasped before their faces They sang of heaven and its peaceful plains its blue lakes and sunny skies its golden cities and emerald gates its temples and its tabernacles where congregations ne er break up and Sabbaths never end It was some comfort to drown with the wild discord of their own voices the fearful noises of the tempest When they finished the hymn they began on it again keeping it up without a break sweeping the dying note of the last word into the rising pitch of the first one In the midst of their singing they thought a fiercer gust than ever was beating on the door and to smother the fear of it they sang yet louder The gust came a second time and Caesar cried Again brothers and away they went with another wild whoop through the hymn It came a third time and Caesar cried Once more beloved and they raced madly through the hymn again Then the door burst open as before a tremendous kick and Pete fierce and wild eyed and green with the drift of the salt foam caked thick on his face stepped over the threshold with the unconscious body of Kate in his arms and the idiot boy peering over his shoulder Thank the Lord for an answer to prayer cried Caesar Where did you find her In the tholthan up the glen said Pete Up in the witch s tholthan XI On the second morning afterwards the air was quiet and full of the odour of seaweed the sky was round as the inside of a shell and pale pink like the shadow of flame the water was smooth and silent the hills had lost the memory of the storm and land and sea lay like a sleeping child In this broad and steady morning Kate came back to consciousness She had slid out of delirium into sleep as a boat slides out of the open sea into harbour and when she awoke there was a voice in her ears that seemed to be calling to her from the quay It was a familiar voice and yet it was unfamiliar it was like the voice of a friend heard for the first time after a voyage It seemed to come from a long way off and yet to be knocking at the very door of her heart She kept her eyes closed for a moment and listened then she opened them and looked again The light was clouded and yet dazzling as if glazed muslin were shaking before her eyes Grannie was sitting by her bedside knitting in silence Why are you sitting there mother she asked Grannie dropped her needles and caught at her apron Dear heart alive the child s herself again she said Has anything happened said Kate What time is it Monday morning bogh thank the Lord for all His mercies cried Grannie The familiar voice came again It came from the direction of the stairs Who s that said Kate whispering fearfully Pete himself Kirry Aw well Aw dear Pete cried Kate in terror Aw no woman but a living man come back again No fear of him bogh Not dead at all but worth twenty dead men yet and he brought you safe out of the storm The storm Yes the storm woman There warn such a storm on the island I don t know the years He found you in the tholthan up the glen Lost your way in the wind it s like and no wonder But let me call father Father father Chut the man s as deaf as little Tom Hommy Father called Grannie bustling about at the stair head in a half demented way There was some commotion below and the voice on the stairs was saying This way No sir That way if you plaze D ye hear him Kirry cried Grannie putting her head back into the room That s the man himself Sitting on the bottom step same as an ould bulldog and keeping watch that nobody bothers you The good naturedst bulldog breathing though and he hasn t had a wink on the night Saved your life darling He did yes he did praise God At mention of the tholthan Kate had remembered everything She dropped back on the pillow and cried in a voice of pain Why couldn t he leave me to die Grannie chuckled knowingly at that and wiped her eyes with the corner of her apron The bogh is herself for sure When they re wishing themselves dead they re always mending father But I ll go down instead Lie still bogh lie still The voice of Grannie went muffled down the stairs with many Aw dears aw dears and then crackled from below through the floor and the unceiled joists saying sharply but with a tremor too Nancy Joe why aren t you taking a cup of something upstairs woman Goodness me Mistress Cregeen is it true for all said Nancy Why of course it s true Do you think a poor child is going fasting for ever What s that shouted the familiar voice again Was it herself you were spaking to in the dairy loft Grannie Who else man said Grannie and then there was a general tumult Aw the joy Aw the delight Gough bless me Grannie I was thinking she was for spaking no more Out of the way cried Nancy as if pushing past somebody to whip the kettle on to the fire These men creatures have no more rising in their hearts than bread without balm You re balm enough yourself Nancy for a quiet husband But lend me a hould of the bellows there I ll blow up like blazes Caesar came into the house on the top of this commotion grumbling as he stepped over the porch The wind has taken half the stacks of my haggard mother No matter sir shouted Pete The best of your Melliah is saved upstairs Is she herself said Caesar Praise His name And over the furious puffing and panting and quacking of the bellows and the cracking and roaring of the fire the voice of Pete came in gusts through the floor crying I ll go mad with the joy I will yes I will and nobody shall stop me neither The house which seemed to have been holding its breath since the storm now broke into a ripple of laughter It began in the kitchen it ran up the stairs it crept through the chinks in the floor it went over the roof But Kate lay on her pillow and moaned and turned her face to the wall Presently Nancy Joe appeared in the bedroom making herself tidy at the doorway with a turn of the hand over her hair Mercy on me she cried clapping her hands at the first sight of Kate s face who was the born blockhead that said the girl s wedding was as like to be in the churchyard as in the church That s me said a deep voice from the middle of the stairs and then Nancy clashed the door back and poured Pete into Kate in a broadside It was Pete that done it though she said You can t expect much sense of the like but still and for all he saved your life Kitty doctor Mylechreest says so If the girl had been lying out another hour says he And my goodness the fond of you that man is it s wonderful Twisting and turning all day yesterday on the bottom step yonder same as a live conger on the quay but looking as soft about the eyes as if he d been a week out of the water And now my sakes now D ye hear him Kirry He s fit to burst the bellows No use though he s a shocking fine young fellow he s all that But just listen There was a fissing sound from below and a sense of burning What do I always say You can never trust a man to have sense enough to take it off That s the kettle on the boil Nancy went flopping downstairs where with furious words she rated Pete who laughed immoderately Caesar came next He had taken off his boots and was walking lightly in his stockings but Kate felt his approach by his asthmatic breathing As he stepped in at the door he cried in the high pitch of the preacher Praise the Lord O my soul and all that is within me praise His holy name Then he fell to the praise of Pete as well He brought you out of the jaws of death and the mouth of Satan It was a sign Katherine and we can t do better than follow the Spirit s leading He saved your life woman and that s giving him the right to have and to hould it Well I ve only one child in this life but if it s the Lord s will I m willing He was always my white headed boy and he has made his independent fortune in a matter of five years time The church bell began to toll and Kate started up and listened Only the Dempster s funeral Kitty said Caesar They were for burying him to morrow but men that drink don t keep They ll be putting him in the family vault at Lezayre with his father the staunch ould Rechabite Many a good cow has a bad calf you see and that s bad news for a man s children but many a good calf is from a bad cow and that s good news for the man himself It s been the way with Peter anyway for the Lord has delivered him and prospered him and I m hearing on the best authority he has five thousand golden sovereigns sent home to mister Dumbell s bank at Douglas Grannie came up with a basin of beef tea and Caesar was hustled out of the room Come now bogh take a spoonful and I ll lave you to yourself said Grannie Yes leave me to myself said Kate sipping wearily and then Grannie went off with the basin in her hand Has she taken it said some one below Look at that if you plaze said Grannie in a jubilant tone and Kate knew that the empty basin was being shown around Kate lay back on the pillow listened to the tolling of the bell and shuddered She thought it a ghostly thing that the first voice she had heard on coming as from another world had been the voice of Pete and the first name dinned into her ears had been Pete s name The procession of the Deemster s funeral passed the house and she closed her eyes and seemed to see it the coffin on the open cart the men on horseback riding beside it and then the horses tied up to posts and gates about the churchyard and the crowd of men of all conditions at the grave side In her mind s eye Kate was searching through that crowd for somebody Was he there Had he heard what had happened to her She fell into a doze and was awakened by a horse s step on the road and the voices of two men talking as they came nearer Man alive the joy I m taking to see you The tallygraph Coorse not Knew I d find you at the funeral though It was Pete But I meant to come over after it It was Philip and Kate s heart stood still The voices were smothered for a moment as the buzzing is when the bees enter the hive and then began with as sharper ring from the rooms below How s she now missus Cregeen said the voice of Philip Better sir much better answered Grannie No return of the unconsciousness Aw no said Grannie Was she Kate thought the voice faltered was she delirious Not rambling at all replied Grannie Thank God said Philip and Kate felt a long breath of relief go through the air I didn t hear of it until this morning said Philip The postman told me at breakfast time and I called on doctor Mylechreest coming out If I had known I didn t sleep much last night anyway but if I had ever imagined You re right good to the girl sir said Grannie and then Kate listening intently caught a quavering sound of protestation Deed you are though and always have been said Grannie and I m saying it before Pete here that ought to know and doesn t Don t I though came in the other voice the resounding voice the voice full of laughter and tears together But I do that Grannie same as if I d been here and seen it Lave it to me to know Phil Christian I ve summered and wintered the man haven t I He s timber that doesn t start mother blow high blow low Kate heard another broken sound as of painful protest and then with a sickening sense she covered up her head that she might hear no more XII She was weak and over wrought and she fell asleep as she lay covered While she slept a babel of meaningless voices kept clashing in her ears and her own voice haunted her perpetually When she awoke it was broad morning again and the house was full of the smell of boiling stock fish By that she knew it was another day and the hour of early breakfast She heard the click of cups and saucers on the kitchen table the step of her father coming in from the mill and then the heartsome voice of Pete talking of the changes in the island since he went away New houses promenades iron piers breakwaters lakes towers wonderful I extraordinary tre menjous But the boys w here s the Manx boys at all said Pete Gone like a flight of birds to Austrillya and Cleveland and the Cape and I don t know where Not a Manx house now that hasn t one of the boys foreign And the houses themselves where s the ould houses and the crofts Felled all felled or boarded up And the boats where s the boats Lying rotting at the top of the harbour Grannie s step came into the kitchen and Pete s loud voice drooped to a whisper How s herself this morning mother Sleeping quiet and nice when I came downstairs said Grannie Will I be seeing her myself to day think you asked Pete I don t know in the world but I ll ask answered Grannie You re an angel Grannie said Pete a reg lar ould archangel Kate shuddered with a new fear It was clear that in the eyes of her people the old relations with Pete were to stand Everybody expected her to marry Pete everybody seemed anxious to push the marriage on Grannie came up with her breakfast pulled aside the blind and opened the window Nancy will tidy the room a taste she said coaxingly and then I shouldn t wonder if you ll be sending for Pete Kate raised a cry of alarm Aw no harm when a girl s poorly said Grannie and her promist man for all Kate tried to protest and explain but courage failed her She only said Not yet mother I m not fit to see him yet Say no more about it Not to day at all to morrow maybe said Grannie and Kate clutched at the word and answered eagerly Yes tomorrow mother to morrow maybe Before noon Philip had come again Kate heard his horse s step on the road trotting hard from the direction of Peel He drew up at the porch but did not alight and Grannie went out to him I ll not come in to day missus Cregeen he said Does she continue to improve As nice as nice sir said Grannie Kate crept out of bed stole to the window hid behind the curtains and listened intently What a mercy all goes well he said Kate could hear the heaving of his breath Is Pete about No but gone to Ramsey sir said Grannie It s like you ll meet him if you are going on to Ballure I must be getting back to business said Philip and the horse swirled across the road Did you ride from Douglas on purpose then said Grannie and Philip answered with an audible effort I was anxious What an escape she has had I could scarcely sleep last night for thinking of it Kate put her hand to her throat to keep back the cry that was bubbling up and her mother s voice came thick and deep The Lord s blessing Master Philip she began but the horse s feet stamped out everything as it leapt to a gallop in going off Kate listened where she knelt until the last beat of the hoofs had died away in the distance and then she crept back to bed and covered up her head in the clothes as before but with a storm of other feelings He loves me she told herself with a thrill of the heart He loves me he loves me still And he will never never never see me married to anybody else She felt an immense relief now and suddenly found strength to think of facing Pete It even occurred to her to send for him at once as a first step towards removing the impression that the old relations were to remain She would be quiet she would be cold she would show by her manner that Pete was impossible she would break the news gently Pete came like the light at Nancy s summons Kate heard him on the stairs whispering with Nancy and breathing heavily Nancy was hectoring it over him and pulling him about to make him presentable Here whispered Nancy take the redyng comb and lash your hair out it s all through others And listen you ve got to be quiet Promise me you ll be quiet She s wake and low and nervous so no kissing D ye hear me now no kissing Aw kissing makes no noise to spake of woman whispered Pete and then he was in the room Kate saw him come a towering dark figure between her and the door He did not speak at first but slid down to the chair at the foot of the bed modestly meekly reverently as if he had entered a sanctuary His hand rested on his knee and she noticed that the wrist was hairy and tattooed with the three legs of Man Is it you Pete she asked and then he said in a low tone almost in a whisper as if speaking to himself in a hush of awe It s her own voice again I ve heard it in my drames these five years He looked helplessly about him for a moment fixed his watery eyes on Nancy as if he wanted to burst into sobs but dare not for fear of the noise then turned on his chair and seemed on the point of taking to flight But just at that instant his dog which had followed him into the room planted its forelegs on the counterpane and looked impudently into Kate s face Down Dempster down cried Pete and after that the ice being broken by the sound of his voice Pete was his own man once more Is that your dog Pete said Kate Aw no Kate but I m his man said Pete He does what he likes with me anyway Caught me out in Kimber ley and fetched me home Is he old Old d ye say He s one of the lost ten tribes of dogs and behaves as if he d got to inherit the earth She felt Pete s big black eyes shining on her My gracious Kitty what a woman you re growing though he said Am I so much changed she asked Changed is it he cried Gough bless me heart the nice little thing you were when we used to play fishermen together down at Cornaa Harbour d ye remember The ould kipper box rolling on a block for a boat at sea do you mind it Yourself houlding a bit of a broken broomstick in the rope handle for a mast and me working the potato dibber on the ground first port and then starboard for rudder and wind and oar and tide Mortal dirty weather this cap n Aw yes woman big sea extraordinary d ye mind it Kirry Kate tried to laugh a little and to say what a long time ago it was since then But Pete being started laughed uproariously slapped his knee and rattled on Up at the mill too d ye remember that now Yourself with the top of a barrel for a flower basket holding it kimbo at your lil hip and shouting Violets Swate violets Fresh violets He mocked her silvery treble in his lusty baritone and roared with laughter And then me woman d ye mind me me with the pig stye gate atop of my head for a fish board yelling Mackerel Fine ladies fresh ladies and bellies as big as bishops Mack er el Aw Kirry Kirry Aw the dear ould times gone by Aw the changes the changes Did I know you then Are you asking me did I know you when I found you in the glen Did I know I was alive Kitty Did I know the wind was howling Did I know my head was going round like a compass and my heart thumping a hundred and twenty pound to the square inch Did I kiss you and kiss you while you were lying there useless and lift you up and hitch your poor limp arms around my neck and carry you out of the dirty ould tholthan that was going to be the death of you the first job I was doing on the island too coming back to it Lord save us Kitty what have I done Kate had dropped back on the pillow and was sobbing as if her heart would break and seeing this Nancy fell on Pete with loud reproaches took the man by the shoulders and his dog by the neck and pushed both out of the room Out of it cried Nancy Didn t I tell you to be quiet You great blethering omathaun you shall come no more Abashed ashamed humiliated and quiet enough now Pete went slowly down the stairs XIII Late that night Kate heard Caesar and her mother talking together as they were going to bed Caesar was saying I got him on the track of a good house and he went off to Ramsey this morning to put a sight on it Dear heart alive father Grannie answered Pete isn t home till a week come Saturday The young man is warm on the wedding said Caesar and he has money and store is no sore But the girl s not fit for it deed she isn t said Grannie If she s wake said Caesar shell be no worse for saying I will and when she s said it she ll have time enough to get better Kate trembled with fear The matter of her marriage with Pete was going on without her A sort of supernatural power seemed to be pushing it along Nobody asked if she wished it nobody questioned that she did so It was taken for granted that the old relations would stand As soon as she could go about she would be expected to marry Pete Pete himself would expect it because he believed he had her promise her mother would expect it because she had always thought of it as a thing understood her father would expect it because Pete s prosperity had given him a new view of Pete s piety and pedigree and Nancy Joe would expect it too if only because she was still haunted by her old bugbear the dark shadow of Ross Christian There was only one way to break down these expectations and that was to speak out But how was a girl to speak What was she to say Kate pretended to be ill Three days longer she lay like a hunted wolf in its hole keeping her bed from sheer dread of the consequences of leaving it The fourth day was Sunday It was morning and the church bells were ringing Caesar had shouted from his bedroom for some one to tie his bow then for some one to button his black gloves He had gone off at length with the footsteps of the people stepping round to chapel The first hymn had been started and its doleful notes were trailing through the mill walls Kate was propped up in bed and the window of her room was open Over the droning of the hymn she caught the sound of a horse s hoofs on the road They stopped at a little distance and then came on again with the same two voices as before Pete was talking with great eagerness Plenty of house aw plenty plenty he was saying Elm Cottage they re calling it the slate one with the ould fir tree behind the Coort House and by the lane to Claughbane Dry as a bone and clane as a gull s wing You could lie with your back to the wall and ate off the floor Taps inside and water as white as gin I ve been buying the cabin of the Mona s Isle for a summer house in the garden Got a figurehead for the porch too and I ll have an anchor for the gate before I m done Aw I m bound to have everything nice for her There was a short silence in which nothing was heard but the step of the horse and then Philip said in a faltering voice But isn t this being rather in a hurry Pete Short coorting s the best coorting and ours has been long enough anyway said Pete They had drawn up at the porch and Pete s laugh came in at the window But think how weak she is said Philip She hasn t even left her bed yet has she Well yes of coorse sartenly said Pete in a steadier voice if the girl isn t fit It s so sudden you see said Philip Has she has she consented Not to say consented began Pete and Philip took him up and said quickly eagerly hotly She can t I m sure she can t There was silence again broken only by the horse s impatient pawing and then Philip said more calmly Let doctor Mylechreest see her first at all events I m not a man for skinning the meadow to the sod no said Pete in a doleful tone but Kate heard no more She was trembling with a new thought It was only a shadowy suggestion as yet and at first she tried to beat it back But it came again it forced itself upon her it mastered her she could not resist it The way to break the fate that was pursuing her was to make Philip speak out The way to stop the marriage with Pete was to compel Philip to marry her He thought she would never consent to marry Pete what if he were given to understand that she had consented That was the way to gain the victory over Philip the way to punish him He would not blame her he would lay the blame at the door of chance of fate of her people He would think they were forcing this marriage upon her the mother out of love of Pete the father out of love of Pete s money and Nancy out of fear of Ross Christian He would know that she could not struggle because she could not speak He would believe she was yielding against her will in spite of her love in the teeth of their intention He would think of her as a victim as a martyr as a sacrifice It was a deceit a small deceit it looked so harmless too so innocent almost humorous half ridiculous and she was a woman and she could not put it away Love love love It would be her excuse and her forgiveness She had appealed to Philip himself and in vain Now she would pretend to go on with her old relations It was so little to do and the effects were so certain In jealousy and in terror Philip would step out of himself and claim her She had craft all hungry things have craft She had inklings of ambition a certain love of luxury and desire to be a lady To get Philip was to get everything Love would be satisfied ambition fulfilled the aims of refinement reached Why not risk the great stake Nancy came to tidy the room and Kate said Where s Pete all this time I wonder Sitting in the fire seat this half hour said Nancy I don t know in the world what s come over the man He s rocking and moaning there like a cow licking a dead calf Would he like to come up think you Don t ask the man twice if you want him to say no said Nancy Blushing and stammering and trying to straighten his black curls Pete came at Nancy s call Kate had few qualms The wound she had received from Philip had left her conscienceless towards Pete Yet she turned her head a little sideways as she welcomed him Are you better then Kirry said Pete timidly I m nearly as well as ever she answered You are though said Pete Then you ll be down soon it s like eh I hope so Pete quite soon And fit for anything now yes Oh yes fit for anything Pete laughed from his heart like a boy I ll take a slieu round to Ballure and tell Philip immadiently Philip said Kate with a look of inquiry He was saying this morning you wouldn t be equal to it Kirry Equal to what Pete Getting going having that s to say well you know putting a sight on the parson himself one of these days that s the fact And to cover his confusion Pete laughed till the scraas of the roof began to snip There was a moment s pause and then Kate said with a cough and a stammer and her head aside Is that so very tiring Pete Pete leapt from his chair and laughed again like a man demented D ye say so Kitty The word then darling the word in my ear as soft as soft He was leaning over the bed but Kate drew away from him and Nancy pulled him back saying Get off with you you goosey gander What for should you bother a poor girl to know if sugar s sweet and if she s willing to change a sweetheart for a husband It was done One act nay half an act a word nay no word at all but only silence The daring venture was afoot Grannie came up with Kate s dinner that day kissed her on both cheeks felt them hot wagged her head wisely and whispered I know you needn t tell me XIV The last hymn was sung Caesar came home from chapel changed back from his best to his work day clothes and then there was talking and laughing in the kitchen amid the jingling of plates and the vigorous rattling of knives and forks Phil must be my best man said Pete He ll be back to Douglas now but I ll get you to write me a line Caesar and ask him Do you hold with long engagements Pete said Grannie A week said Pete with the air of a judge not much less anyway not of a rule you know You goose cried Nancy it must be three Sundays for the banns Then John the Clerk shall get them going this evening said Pete Nancy had the pull of me there Grannie Not being in the habit of getting married I clane forgot about the banns John the Clerk came in the afternoon and there was some lusty disputation We must have bridesmaids and wedding cakes Pete it s only proper said Nancy Aw yes and tobacco and rum and everything respectable said Pete And the parson mind it s the parson now said Grannie none of their nasty high bailiffs I don t know in the world how a dacent woman can rest in her bed Aw the parson of coorse and the parson s wife maybe said Pete I think I can manage it for you for to morrow fortnight said John the Clerk impressively and there was some clapping of hands quickly suppressed by Caesar with mutterings of Popery clane Popery sir Can t a person commit matrimony without a parson bothering a man Then Caesar squared his elbows across the table and wrote the letter to Philip Pete never stood sponsor for anything so pious Respected and Honoured Sir I write first to thee that it hath been borne in on my mind strong to believe the Lord hath spoken to marry on Katherine Cregeen only beloved daughter of Caesar Cregeen a respectable man and a local preacher in whose house I tarry being free to use all his means of grace Wedding to morrow fortnight at Kirk Christ Lezayre eleven o clock forenoon and the Lord make it profitable to my soul With love and reverence thy servant and I trust the Lord s Peter Quilliam Having written this Caesar read it aloud with proper elevation of pitch Grannie wiped her eyes and Pete said Indited beautiful sir only you haven t asked him My pen s getting crosslegs said Caesar but that ll do for an N B N B Will you come for my best man Then there was more talk and more laughter You re a lucky fellow Pete said Pete himself My sailor you are though She s as sweet as clover with the bumbees humming over it and as warm as a gorse bush when the summer s gone And then affection being infectious beyond all maladies known to mortals Nancy Joe was heard to say I believe in my heart I must be having a man myself before long or I ll be losing the notion D ye hear that boys shouted Pete Don t all spake at once Too late I ve lost it said Nancy and there was yet more laughter To put an end to this frivolity Caesar raised a hymn and they sang it together with cheerful voices Then Caesar prayed appropriately John the Clerk improvised responses and Pete went out and sat on the bottom step in the lobby and smoked up the stairs so that Kate in the bedroom should not feel too lonely XV Meanwhile Kate overwhelmed with shame humiliation self reproach horror of herself and dread of everything lay with cheeks ablaze and her head buried in the bedclothes She had no longer any need to pretend to be sick she was now sick in reality Fate had threatened her She had challenged it They were gambling together The stake was her love her life her doom By the next day she had worked herself into a nervous fever doctor Mylechreest came to see her unbidden of the family He was one of those tall bashful men who in their eagerness to be gone seem always to have urgent business somewhere else After a single glance at her and a few muttered syllables he went off hurriedly as if some one were waiting for him round the corner But on going downstairs he met Caesar who asked him how he found her Feverish very keep her in bed he answered As for this marriage it must be put off She s exciting herself and I won t answer for the consequences The thing has fallen too suddenly To tell you the truth this way mister Cregeen I am afraid of a malady of the brain Tut tut doctor said Caesar Very well if you know better Good day But let the wedding wait Traa dy liooar time enough mister Cregeen A right good Manx maxim for once Put it off put it off It s not my putting off doctor What can you do with a man that s wanting to be married You can t bridle a horse with pincers But when the doctor was gone Caesar said to Grannie Cut out the bridesmaids and the wedding cakes and the fiddles and the foolery and let the girl be married immadiently Dear heart alive father what s all the hurry said Grannie And Lord bless my soul what s all the fuss said Caesar First one objecting this then another objecting that as if everybody was intarmined to stop the thing It s going on I m telling you d ye hear me There s many a slip but no matter What s written with the pen can t be cut out with the axe so lave it alone the lot of you Kate was in an ecstasy of exultation The doctor had been sent by Philip It was Philip who was trying to stop the marriage He would never be able to bear it he would claim her soon It might be to day it might be to morrow it might be the next day The odds were with her Fate was being worsted Thus she clung to her blind faith that Philip would intervene That was Monday and on Tuesday morning Philip came again He was very quiet but the heart has ears and Kate heard him Pete s letter had reached him and she could see his white face After a few words of commonplace conversation he drew Pete out of the house What had he got to say Was he thinking that Pete must be stopped at all hazards Was he about to make a clean breast of it Was he going to tell all Impossible He could not he dared not it was her secret Pete came back to the house alone looking serious and even sad Kate heard him exchange a few words with her father as they passed through the lobby to the kitchen Caesar was saying Stand on your own head sir that s my advice to you In the intensity of her torment she could not rest She sent for Pete What about Philip she said Is he coming What has he been telling you Bad news Kate very bad said Pete There was a fearful silence for a moment It was like the awful hush at the instant when the tide turns and you feel as if something has happened to the world Then Kate hardened her face and said What is it He s ill and wants to go away in a week He can t come to the wedding said Pete Is that all said Kate Her heart leapt for joy She could not help it she laughed She saw through Philip s excuse It was only his subterfuge he thought Pete would not marry without him Aw but you never seen the like though Kirry said Pete he was that white and wake and narvous Work and worry that s the size of it There s nothing done in this world without paying the price of it and that s as true as gospel The sea s calling me Pete says he and then he laughed but it was the same as if a ghost itself was grinning In the selfishness of her enfeebled spirit Kate still rejoiced Philip was suffering It was another assurance that he would come to her relief When does he go she asked On Tuesday answered Pete Isn t there a way of getting a Bishop s license to marry in a week said Kate But will you though said Pete with a shout of joy Ask Philip first No use changing if Philip can t come He shall he must I won t take No You may kiss me now said Kate and Pete plucked her up into his arms and kissed her She was heart dead to him yet from the wound that Philip had dealt her but at the touch of his lips a feeling of horror seemed to cramp all her limbs With a shudder she crept down in the bed and hid her face hating herself loathing herself wishing herself dead He stood a moment by her side crying like a big boy in his great happiness I don t know in the world what she sees in me to be so fond of me but that s the way with the women always God bless them She did not lift her face and he stepped quietly to the door Half way through he turned about and raised one arm over his head God s rest and God s peace be with you and may the man that gets you keep a clane heart and a clane hand and be fit for the good woman he s won for his wife At the next minute he went tearing down the stairs and the kitchen rang with his laughter XVI Fate scored one Kate had been telling herself that Philip was tired of her that he did not love her any longer that having taken all he could take he desired to be done with her that he was trying to forget her and that she was a drag upon him when suddenly she remembered the tholthan and bethought herself for the first time of a possible contingency Why had she not thought of it before Why had he never thought of it If it should come to pass The prospect did not appal her it did not overwhelm her with confusion or oppress her with shame it did not threaten to fall like a thunderbolt the thought of it came down like an angel s whisper She was not afraid It was only an idea only a possibility only a dream of consequences but at one bound it brought her so much nearer to Philip It gave her a right to him How dare he make her suffer so She would not permit him to leave her He was her husband and he must cling to her come what would Across the void that had divided them a mysterious power drew them together She was he and he was she and they were one for who knows who could say perhaps Nature herself had willed it Thus the first effect of the new thought upon Kate was frenzied exultation She had only one thing to do now She had only to go to Philip as Bathsheba went to David True she could not say what Bathsheba said She had no certainty but her case was no less strong Have you never thought of what may possibly occur This is what she would say now to Philip And Philip would say to her Dearest I have never thought of that Where was my head that I never reflected Then in spite of his plans in spite of his pledge to Pete in spite of the world in spite of himself yea in spite of his own soul if it stood between them he would cling to her she was sure of it she could swear to it he could not resist He will believe whatever I tell him she thought and she would say Come to me Philip I am frightened In the torture of her palpitating heart she would have rejoiced at that moment if she could have been sure that she was in the position of what the world calls a shameful woman With that for her claim she could see herself going to Philip and telling him her head on his breast whispering sweetly the great secret the wondrous news And then the joy the rapture the long kiss of love Mine mine mine he is mine at last That could not be quite so she was not so happy as Bathsheba she was not sure but her right was the same for all that Oh it was joyful it was delicious The little cunning arts of her sex the small deceits in which she had disguised herself fell away from her now She said to herself I will stop the nonsense about the marriage with Pete It was mean it was foolish it was miserable trifling it was wicked it was a waste of life above all it was doing a great great wrong to her love of Philip How could she ever have thought of it Next morning she was up and was dressing when Grannie came into the room with a cup of tea I feel so much better she said that I think I ll go to Douglas by the coach today mother Do bogh said Grannie cheerfully and Pete shall go with you Oh no I must be quite alone mother Aw aw A lil errand maybe Shopping is it Presents eh Take your tay then And Grannie rolled the blind saying A beautiful morning you ll have for it too I can see the spire as plain as plain Then turning about Did you hear the bells this morning Kitty Why what bells mammy said Kate through a mouthful of bread and butter The bells for Christian Killip Her old sweetheart took her to church at last He wouldn t get rest at your father till he did and her baby two years for Christmas But what d ye think now Robbie left her at the church door and he s off by the Ramsey packet for England Aw dear he did though You can make me marry her said he but you can t make me live with her he said and he was away down the road like the dust I don t think I ll go to Douglas to day mother said Kate in a broken voice I m not so very well after all Aw the bogh said Grannie Making too sure of herself was she It s the way with them all when they re mending With cheerful protestations Grannie helped her back to bed and then went off with an anxious face to tell Caesar that she was more ill than ever She was ill indeed but her worst illness was of the heart If I go to him and tell him she thought he will marry me yes No fear that he will leave me at the church door or elsewhere He will stay with me We will be man and wife to the last The world will know nothing But I will know As long as I live I will remember that he only sacrificed himself to repair a fault That shall never be never never Caesar came up in great alarm He seemed to be living in hourly dread that some obstacle would arise at the last moment to stop the marriage Chut woman he said play fully Have a good heart Kitty The sun s not going down on you yet at all That night there were loud voices from the bar room The talk was of the marriage which had taken place in the morning and of its strange and painful sequel John the Clerk was saying But you d be hearing of the by child it s like Never a word said somebody Not heard of it though Fetching the child to the wedding to have the bad name taken off it no They were standing the lil bogh it s only three two is it Grannie only two well they were standing the lil thing under its mother s perricut while the sarvice was saying You don t say Aw truth enough sir It s the ould Manx way of legitimating The parsons are knowing nothing of it but I ve seen it times John s right said mister Jelly and I can tell you more it was just that the man went to church for Wouldn t trust said John the Clerk The woman wasn t getting much of a husband out of it anyway No said Pete he had not spoken before but the child was getting the name of its father though That s not mountains of thick porridge sir said somebody Bobbie s gone What s the good of a father if he s doing nothing to bring you up Ask your son if you ve got any of the sort said Pete some of you have Ask me I know middling well what it is to go through the world without a father s name to my back If your lad is like myself he s knowing it early and he s knowing it late He s knowing it when he s saying his bits of prayers atop of the bed in the gable loft God bless mother and grandmother maybe there s never no father in his little texes And he s knowing it when he s growing up to a lump of a lad and going for a trade and the beast of life is getting the grip of him Ten to one he comes to be a waistrel then and if it s a girl instead a hundred to nothing she turns out a well worse Only a notion is it Just a parzon s lie eh Having your father s name is nothing no That s what the man says But ask the child and shut your mouth for a fool There was a hush and a hum after that and Kate who had reached from the bed to open the door clutched it with a feverish grasp But Christian Killip is nothing but a trollop anyway sir said Caesar Every cat is black in the night father the girl s in trouble said Pete No no If I d done wrong by a woman and she was having a child by me I d marry her if she d take me though I d come to hate her like sin itself Grannie in the kitchen was wiping her eyes at these brave words but Kate in the bedroom was tossing in a delirium of wrath Never never never she thought Oh yes Philip would marry her if she imposed herself upon him if she hinted at a possible contingency He too was a brave man he also had a lofty soul he would not shrink But no not for the wealth of worlds Philip loved her and his love alone should bring him to her side No other compulsion should be put upon him neither the thought of her possible future position nor of the consequences to another It was the only justice the only safety the only happiness now or in the time to come He shall marry me for my sake she thought for my own sake my own sake only Thus in the wild disorder of her soul the tempest of conflicting passions her pride barred up the one great way XVII There was no help for it after all she must go on as she had begun with the old scheme the old chance the old gambling hazard Heart sick and ashamed waiting for Philip and listening to every step she kept her room two days longer Then Caesar came and rallied her Gough bless me but nobody will credit it he said The marriage for Monday and the bride in bed a Wednesday People will say it isn t coming off at all This alarmed her It partly explained why Philip did not come If he thought there was no danger of the marriage he would be in no hurry to intervene Next day Thursday she struggled up and dressed in a light wrapper feeling weak and nervous and looking pale and white like apple blossom nipped by frost Pete would have carried her downstairs but she would not have it They established her among a pile of cushions before a fire in the parlour with its bowl of sea birds eggs that had the faint unfamiliar smell its tables of old china that shook and rang slightly with every step and sound The kitchen was covered with the litter of dressmakers preparing for the wedding There were bodices to try on and decisions to give on points of style Kate agreed to everything In a weak and toneless voice she kept on telling them to do as they thought hest Only when she heard that Pete was to pay did she assert her will and that was to limit the dresses to one Sakes alive now Kirry cried Nancy that s what I call ruining a good husband the man was willing to buy frocks for a boarding school Pete came sat on a stool at her feet and told stories They were funny stories of his life abroad and now and again there came bursts of laughter from the kitchen where they were straining their necks to catch his words through the doors which they kept ajar But Kate hardly listened She showed signs of impatience sometimes and made quick glances around when the door opened as if expecting somebody On recovering herself at these moments she found Pete looking up at her with the big serious moist eyes of a dog He began to tell of the house he had taken to excuse himself for not consulting her and to describe the progress of the furnishing I ve put it all in the hands of Cannell Quayle Kitty he said and they re doing it beautiful Marble slabs bless you like a butcher s counter carpets as soft as daisies and looking glasses as tall as a man Kate had not heard him She was trying to remember all she knew of the courts of the island where they were held and on what days Have you seen Philip lately she asked Not since Monday said Pete He s in Douglas working like mad to be here on Monday God bless him What did he say when he heard we had changed the day Wanted to get out of it first I m sailing on Tuesday said he Did you tell him that I proposed it Trust me for not forgetting that at all Aw then says he there s no choice left he says Kate s pale face became paler the dark circles about her eyes grew yet more dark I think I ll go back to bed mother she said in the same toneless voice Pete helped her to the foot of the stairs The big moist eyes were looking at her constantly She found it hard to keep an equal countenance But will you be fit for it darling said Pete Why of course she ll be fit sir said Caesar What girl is ever more than middling the week before she s married Next day she persuaded her father to take her to Douglas She had little errands there that could not be done in Ramsey The morning was fine but cold Pete helped her up in the gig and they drove away If only she could see Philip if only Philip could see her he would know by the look of her face that the marriage was not of her making that compulsion of some sort was being put on her She spent four hours going from shop to shop lingering in the streets but seeing nothing of Philip Her step was slow and weary her features were pinched and starved but Caesar could scarcely get her out of the town At length the daylight began to fail and then she yielded to his importunities How short the days are now she said with a sigh as they ran into the country Yes they are a cock s stride shorter in September said Caesar but when a woman once gets shopping Midsummer day itself won t do she s wanting the land of the midnight sun Pete lifted her out of the gig in darkness at the door of the Fairy and his great arms being about her he carried her into the house and set her down in the fire seat She would have struggled to her feet if she had been able she felt something like repulsion at his touch but he looked at her with the mute eloquence of love and she was ashamed The house was full of gossips that night They talked of the marriage customs of old times One described the pay weddings where the hat went round and every guest gave something towards the cost of the breakfast and the expenses of beginning housekeeping rude forefather of the practice of the modern wedding present Another pictured the irregular marriages made in public houses in the days when the island had three breweries and thirty drinking shops to every thousand of its inhabitants The publican laid two sticks crosswise on the floor and said to the bride and bridegroom Hop over the sticks and lie crossed on the floor And you re man and wife for nevermore There was some laughter at this but Kate sat in the fire seat and sipped her tea in silence and Pete said quietly Nothing to laugh at though I remember a girl over Foxal way that was married to a man like that and then he went off to Kinsale and got kept for the herring riots d ye mind them She was a strapping girl though and when the man was gone the boys came bothering her first one and then another and good ones among them too And honour bright for all they were for taking her to the parzon about right But no Did they think she was for committing beggamy She was married to one man and wasn t that enough for a dacent girl anyway And so she wouldn t and she didn t and last of all her own boy came back and they lived together man and wife and what for shouldn t they This question from the man who was on the point of going to church was received with shouts of laughter through which the voice of Grannie rose in affectionate remonstrance saying Aw Pete it s ter ble to hear you bogh What s there ter ble about that Grannie said Pete Isn t it the Almighty and not the parzon that makes the marriage Aw boy veen boy veen cried Grannie you was used to be a good man but you have fell off very bad Kate was in a fever of eagerness She wanted to open her heart to Pete to beg him to spare her to tell him that it was impossible that they should ever marry Pete would see that Philip was her husband by every true law human and divine In this mood she lived through much of the following day Friday tossing and turning in bed for the exhaustion of the day in Douglas had confined her to her room again In the evening she came downstairs and was established in the fire seat as before There were four or five old women in the kitchen spinning yarn for a set of blankets which Grannie intended for a wedding present When the day s work was nearly done two or three old men the old husbands of the old women came to carry their wheels home again Then as the wheels whirred for the last of the twist Pete set the old crones to tell stories of old times Tell us of the days when you were young Anne said Pete to an ancient dame of eighty Her husband of eighty four sat sucking his pipe by her side Well said old Anne stretching her arms to the yarn I was as near going foreign same as yourself sir just as near now as makes no matter It was the very day I married this man and his brother was making a start for Austrillya Jemmy was my ould sweetheart only I had given him up because he was always stealing my pocket handkerchers But he came that morning and tapped at my window and Will you come Anne says he and I whipped on my perricut and stole out and down to the quay with him But my heart was losing me when I saw the white horses on the water and home I came and went to church with this one instead While old Anne told her story her old husband opened his mouth wider and wider until the pipe shank dropped out of his toothless gums on to his waistcoat Then he stretched his left arm and brought down his clenched hand with a bang on to her shoulder And have you been living with me better than sixty years said he and never telling me that before Pete tried to pacify his ancient jealousy but it was not to be appeased and he shouldered the wheel and hobbled off saying And I sent out two pound five to put a stone on the man s grave There was loud laughter when the old couple were gone but Pete said nevertheless A sacret s a sacret though and the ould lady had no right to tell it It was the dead man s sacret too and she s fouled the ould man s memory If a person s done wrong the best thing he can do next is to say darned little about it Kate rose and went off to bed Another door had been barred to her and she felt sick and faint XVIII The next day was Saturday Kate remembered that Philip came to Ballure on Saturdays She felt sure that he would come to Sulby also Let him only set eyes on her and he would divine the trouble that had taken the colour out of her cheeks Then he would speak to Pete and to her father he would deliver her he would take everything upon himself Thus all day long like a white eyed gambler who has staked his last she waited and listened and watched At breakfast she said to herself He will come this morning At dinner He will come this evening At supper He will come tonight But Philip did not come and she grew hysterical as well as restless She watched the clock the minutes passed with feet of lead but the hours with wings of fire She was now like a criminal looking for a reprieve Every time the clock warned to strike she felt one hour nearer her doom The strain was wearing her out She reproached Philip for leaving her to this cruel uncertainty and she suffered the pangs of one who tries at the same time to love and to hate Then she reproached herself with altering the date of the marriage and excused Philip on the grounds of her haste She felt like a witch who was burning by her own spell Hope was failing her and Will was breaking down as well Nevertheless she determined that the wedding should be postponed That was on Saturday night On Sunday morning she had gone one step farther The last pitiful shred of expectation that Philip would intervene seemed then to be lost and she had resolved that come what would she should not marry at all No need to appeal to Pete no necessity to betray the secret of Philip All she had to do was to say she would not go on with the wedding and no power on earth should compel her With this determination and a feeling of immense relief she went downstairs Caesar was coming in from the preaching room and Pete from the new house at Ramsey They sat down to dinner After dinner she would speak out Caesar sharpened the carving knife on the steel and said We ve taken the girl Christian Killip back to communion to day Poor thing said Grannie pity she was ever put out of it though Maybe so maybe no said Caesar Necessary anyway one scabby sheep infects the flock And has marriage daubed grace on the poor sheep s sore then Caesar said Pete She s Mistress Robbie Teare and a dacent woman sir said Caesar digging into the beef and that s all the truck a Christian church has got with it Kate did not eat her dinner that day and neither did she speak out as she had intended A supernatural power seemed to have come down at the last moment and barred up the one remaining pathway of escape She was in the track of the storm The tempest was ready to fall on her Where could she fly for shelter What her father had said of the girl had revealed her life to her in the light of her relation to Philip The thought of the possible contingency which she had foreseen with so much joy as so much power had awakened the consciousness of her moral position She was a fallen woman What else was she And if the contingency befell what would become of her In the intensity of her father s pietistic views the very shadow of shame would overwhelm his household overthrow his sect and uproot his religious pretensions Kate trembled at the possibility of such a disaster coming through her She saw herself being driven from house and home Where could she fly And though she fled away would she not still be the cause of sorrow and disgrace to all whom she left behind her mother her father Pete everybody If she could only tear out the past at least she could stop this marriage Or if she had been a man she could stop it for a man may sin and still look to the future with a firm face But she was a woman and a woman s acts may be her own but their consequences are beyond her Oh the misery of being a woman She asked herself what she could do and there was no answer She could not break the web of circumstances Her situation might be false it might be dishonourable but there was no escape from it There was no gleam of hope anywhere Late that night Sunday night they were sitting together in the kitchen Kate in the fire seat as usual Pete on the stool by the turf closet smoking up the chimney Caesar reading aloud Grannie listening and Nancy cooking the supper when the porch door burst open and somebody entered Kate rose to her feet with a startled cry of joy looked round eagerly and then sat down again covered with confusion It was the girl Christian Killip a pale weak frightened creature with the mouth and eyes of a hare Is mister Quilliam here she asked Here s the man himself Christian said Grannie What do you want with him Oh God bless you sir said the girl to Pete God bless you for ever and ever Then turning back to Grannie she explained in woman s fashion with many words that somebody unknown had sent her twenty pounds for the child by post the day before and she had only now guessed who it must be when John the Clerk had told her what Pete had said a week before Pete grunted and glimed smoked up the chimney and said That ll do ma am that ll do Don t believe all you hear John says more than his Amens anyway I m axing your pardon miss said the girl to Kate but I couldn t help coming I couldn t really no I couldn t and then she began to cry Where s that child said Pete heaving up to his feet with a ferocious look What you mane to say you ve left the lil thing alone asleep Go back to it then immajent Good night Good night sir and God bless you and when you re married to morrow God bless your wife as well That ll do that ll do said Pete backing her to the porch You desarve a good woman sir and may the Lord be good to you both Tut tut said Pete and he tut tutted her out of the house She smoothed her baby s hair more tenderly than ever that night and kissed it again and again Kate could scarcely breathe she could barely see Her pride and her will had broken down utterly This greathearted man loved her He would lay down his life if need be to save her To morrow he would marry her Here then was her rock of refuge this strong man by her side She could struggle against fate no longer It s invisible hand was pushing her on It s blind power was dragging her If Philip would not come to claim her she must marry Pete And Pete She meant no harm to Pete She had not yet thought of things from Pete s point of view He was like the camel bag in the desert to the terrified wayfarer when the sand cloud breaks oyer him He flies to it It shelters him But what of the camel itself with its head in the storm Until the storm is over he does not think of that XIX Meantime Philip himself was in the throes of his own agony At the news of Kate s illness he was overwhelmed with remorse and when he inquired if she had been delirious he was oppressed with a sense of meanness never felt before At his meeting with Pete he realised for the first time to what depths his duplicity had degraded him He had prided himself on being a man of honour and he was suddenly thrown out of the paths in which he could walk honourably When the first shock of Kate s disaster was over he remembered the interview with the Governor The Deemstership burnt in his mind with a growing fever of desire but he did not apply for it He did not even mention it to Auntie Nan She heard of his prospects from Peter Christian Balla whaine who first set foot in her house on this errand of congratulation The sweet old soul was wildly excited All the hopes of her life were about to be realised the visions and the dreams were coming true Philip was going to regain what his father had lost Had he made his application yet No He would though it was his duty But Philip could not apply for the Deemstership To sit down in cold blood and write to the Home Secretary while Kate was lying sick in bed would be too much like asking the devil s wages for sacrificing her Then came Pete with his talk of the wedding That did not really alarm him It was only the last revolution of the old wheel that had been set spinning before Pete went away Kate would not consent They had taken her consent for granted He felt easy calm and secure Next came his old master the college friend of his father now promoted to the position of Clerk of the Polls He was proud of his pupil and had learnt that Philip was first favourite with the Governor I always knew it he said I did ma am I did The first time I set eyes on him thinks I Here comes the makings of the best lawyer in the island and by he s not going to disappoint me either The good fellow was a noisy hearty robustious creature a bachelor and when talking of the late Deemster he said women were usually the chief obstacles in a man s career Then he begged Auntie Nan s pardon but the old lady showed no anger She agreed that it had been so in some cases Young men should be careful what stumbling blocks they set up in the way of their own progress Philip listened in silence and was conscious through all the unselfish counselling of a certain cynical bitterness Still he did not make application for the Deemstership Then came Caesar s letter announcing the marriage and even fixing a date for it This threw him into a fit of towering indignation He was certain of undue pressure They were forcing the girl It was his duty to stop the marriage But how There was one clear course but that course he could not take He could not go back on his settled determination that he must not should not marry the girl himself Only one thing was left to rely on Kate She would never consent Not being able to marry him she would marry no man She would do as he was doing she would suffer and stand alone By this time Philip s love which in spite of himself had grown cool since the Melliah and in his fierce battle with his worldly aims suddenly awakened to fresh violence at the approach of another man But his ambition fought with his love and he began to ask himself if it made any difference after all in this matter of Kate whether he took the Deemstership or left it Kate was recovering he had nothing to reproach himself with and it would be folly to sacrifice the ambition of a lifetime to the love of a woman who could never be his a woman he could never marry At that he wrote his letter to the Home Secretary It was a brilliant letter of its kind simple natural strong and judicious He had a calm assurance that nothing so good would leave the island yet he could not bring himself to post it Some quiverings of the old tenderness came back as he held it in his hand some visions of Kate with her twitching lips her passionate eyes some whisperings of their smothered love Then came Pete again with the decisive blow Kate had consented There was no longer any room for doubt His former indignation seemed almost comic his confidence absurd Kate was willing to marry Pete and after all what right had he to blame her What right had he to stop the marriage He had wronged the girl enough already A good man came and offered her his love She was going to take it How should he dare to stop her from marrying another being unable to marry her himself That night he posted his letter to the Home Secretary and calmed the gnawings of his love with dreams of ambition He would regain the place of his father he would revive the traditions of his grandfather the Christians should resume their ancient standing in the Isle of Man the last of their race should be a strong man and a just one No he would never marry he would live alone a quiet life a peaceful one slightly tinged with melancholy yet not altogether unhappy not without cheer Under all other emotions strengthening and supporting him was a secret bitterness towards Kate a certain contempt of her fickleness her lightness her shallow love her readiness to be off with the old love and on with the new There was a sort of pride in his own higher type of devotion his sterner passion Pete invited him to the wedding but he would not go he would invent some excuse Then came the change of the day to suit his supposed convenience and also Kate s own invitation Very well be it so Kate was defying him Her invitation was a challenge He would take it he would go to the wedding And if their eyes should meet he knew whose eyes must fall XX Early next day the sleeping morning was awakened by the sound of a horn It began somewhere in the village wandered down the glen crossed the bridge plodded over the fields and finally coiled round the house of the bride in thickening groans of discord This restless spirit in the grey light was meant as herald of the approaching wedding It came from the husky lungs of mister Jonaique Jelly Before daylight The Manx Fairy was already astir Somewhere in the early reaches of the dawn the house had its last dusting down at the hands of Nancy Joe Then Grannie finished on hearth and griddle the baking of her cakes After that some of the neighbours came and carried off to their own fires the beef mutton chickens and ducks intended for the day s dinner It was woman s work that was to the fore and all idle men were hustled out of the way Towards nine o clock breakfast was swallowed standing Then everybody began to think of dressing In this matter the men had to be finished off before the women could begin Already they were heard bellowing for help from unseen regions upstairs Grannie took Caesar in hand Pete was in charge of Nancy Joe It was found at the last moment that Pete had forgotten to provide himself with a white shirt He had nothing to be married in except the flannel one in which he came home from Africa This would never do It wasn t proper it wasn t respectable There was no choice but to borrow a shirt of Caesar s Caesar s shirt was of ancient pattern and Pete was shy of taking it Take it or you ll have none said Nancy and she pushed him back into his room When he emerged from it he walked with a stiff neck down the stairs in a collar that reached to his ears at either side and stood out at his cheeks like the wings of a white bat with two long sharp points on the level of his eyes which he seemed to be watching warily to avoid the stab of their ironed starch At the same moment Caesar appeared in duck trousers a flowered waistcoat a swallow tail coat and a tall hat of rough black beaver The kitchen was full of men and women by this time and groups of young fellows were gathered on the road outside some with horses saddled and bridled for the bride s race home after the ceremony others with guns ready loaded for firing as the procession appeared and others again with lines of print handkerchiefs which as substitutes for flags they were hanging from tree to tree At every moment the crowd became greater outside and the company inside more dense John the Clerk called on his way to church and whispered Pete that everything was ready and they were going to sing a beautiful psalm It isn t many a man s wedding I would be taking the same trouble with said John When you are coming down the alley give a sight up sir and you ll see me He s only a poor thing said mister Jelly in Pete s ear as John the Clerk went off No more music in the man than my ould sow Did you hear the horn this morning sir Never got up so early for a wedding before I ll be giving you the Black and the Grey going into the church Grannie came down in a gigantic bonnet like a half moon with her white cap visible beneath it and Nancy Joe appeared behind her be ribboned out of all recognition and taller by many inches for the turret of feathers and flowers on the head that was usually bare Then the church bells began to peal and Caesar made a prolonged A hm and said in a large way Has the carriage arrived It s coming over by the bridge now said somebody at the door and at the next moment a covered wagonette drew up at the porch All ready asked Caesar Stop sir said Pete and then turning to Nancy Joe Is it glad a man should be on his wedding day Nancy Why of coorse you goose What else she answered Well no man can be glad in a shirt like this said Pete I m going back to take it off Two minutes afterwards he reappeared in his flannel one under his suit of blue pilot looking simple and natural and a man every inch of him Now call the bride said Caesar XXI Kate had been kept awake during the dark hours with a sound in her ears that was like the measured ringing of far off bells When the daylight came she slept a troubled sleep and when she awoke she had a sense of stupefaction as if she had taken a drug and was not yet recovered from the effects of it Nancy came bouncing into her room and crying It s your wedding day Kitty She answered by repeating mechanically It s your wedding day Kitty There was an expression of serenity on her face she even smiled a little A sort of vague gaiety came over her such as comes to one who has watched long in agony and suspense by the bed of a sick person and the person is dead Nancy drew the little window curtain aside stooped down and looked out and said Happy the bride the sun shines on they re saying and look the sun is shining Oh but the sun is an old sly boots she answered They came up to dress her She kept stumbling against things and then laughing in a faint way The dress was the new one and when they had put it on they stood back from her and shouted with delight She took up the little broken hand glass to look at herself Her great eyes sparkled piteously The church bells began to ring her wedding peal She had to listen hard to hear it All sounds seemed to be very far away everything looked a long way off She was living in a sort of dead white dawn of thought and feeling At last they came to say the coach was ready and everything was waiting for the bride She repeated their message like a machine made a slow gesture and followed them downstairs When she got near to the bottom she looked around on the faces below as if expecting to see somebody Just then her father was saying mister Christian is to meet us at the church She smiled faintly and answered the people s greetings in an indistinct tone There was some indulgent whispering at sight of her pale face Pale but genteel said some one and then Nancy reached over and drew the bride s veil down over her face At the next minute she was outside the house standing at the back of the wagonette The coachman with his white rosette was holding the door open on one side and her father was elevating her hand on the other Am I to go then she asked in a helpless voice Well what do you think said Caesar Shall the man slip off and get married to himself think you There was laughter among the people standing round and she laughed also and stepped into the coach Her mother followed her crinkling in noisy old silk and Nancy Joe came next smelling of lavender and hair oil Then her father got in and then Pete with his great warm presence A salute of six guns was fired straight up by the coach windows The horses pranced Nancy screamed and Grannie started but Kate gave no sign People were closing round the coach door and shouting altogether as at a fair Good luck to you boy Good luck Good luck Pete was answering in a rolling voice that seemed to be lifting the low roof off and at the same time flinging money out in handfuls as the horses moved away They were going slowly down the road From somewhere in front came the sound of a clarionet It was playing the Black and the Grey Immediately behind there was the tramp of people walking with an even step and on either side the rustle of an irregular crowd The morning was warm and beautiful Here and there the last of the golden cushag glistened on the hedges with the first of the autumn gorse They passed two or three houses that had been made roofless by the recent storm and once or twice they came on a fallen tree trunk with its thin leaves yellowing on the fading grass Kate was floating vaguely through these sights and sounds It was all like a dream to her a waking dream in shadow land She knew where she was and where she was going Some glimmering of hope was left yet She was half expecting a miracle of some sort Philip would be at the church Something supernatural would occur They drew up sharply the glass of the windows rattled and the talk that had been going on in the carriage ceased Here we are cried Caesar there were voices outside and then the others inside stepped down She saw a hand held out to her and knew whose it was before her eyes had risen to the face Philip was there He was helping her to alight Am I to get down too she asked in a helpless way Caesar said something that made the people laugh again and then she smiled like faded sunshine and took the hand of Philip She held it a moment as if expecting him to say something but he only raised his hat His face was white as marble He will speak yet she thought Over the gateway to the churchyard there was an arch of flowers and evergreens with an inscription in coloured letters God bless the happy pair The sloping path going down as to a dell was strewn with gilvers and slips of fuchsia At the bottom stood the old church mantled in ivy like a rock of the sea covered by green moss Leaning on her father s arm she walked in at the porch The church was full of people As they passed under the gallery there was a twittering as of birds The Sunday school girls were up there looking down and talking eagerly Then the coughing and hemming ceased there was a sort of deep inspiration the church seemed to hold its breath for a moment After that there were broken exclamations and the coughing and hemming began again How pale Not fit poor thing Everybody was pitying her starved features Stand here said somebody in a soft voice Must I she said quite loudly All at once she was aware that she was alone before the communion rail with the parson old ruddy faced Parson Quiggin in his white surplice facing her Some one came and stood beside her It was Pete She did not look at him but she felt his warm presence again and was relieved It was like shelter from the eyes around After a moment she turned about Philip was one step behind Pete His head was bent Then the service began The voice of the parson muttered words in a low voice but she did not listen She found herself trying to spell out the Manx text printed over the chancel arch Bannet T eshyn Ta Cheet ayns Ennyn y Chearn Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord Suddenly the words the parson was speaking leapt into meaning and made her quiver is commended of Saint Paul to be honourable among all men and therefore not by any to be enterprised nor taken in hand unadvisedly lightly or wantonly She seemed to know that Philip s eyes were on her They were on the back of her head and the veil over her face began to shake The voice of the parson was going on again Therefore if any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together let him now speak or else hereafter for ever hold his peace She turned half around Her eyes fell on Philip His face was colourless almost fierce his forehead was deathly white She was sure that something was about to happen Now was the moment for the miracle It seemed to her as if the whole congregation were beginning to divine what tie there was between him and her She did not care for he would soon declare it He was going to do so now he had raised his head he was about to speak No there was no miracle Philip s eyes fell before her eyes and his head went down He was only digging at the red baize with one of his feet She felt tired so very tired and oh so cold The parson had gone on with his reading When she caught up with him he was saying as ye shall answer at the great day of judgment when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed that if either of you know any impediment why ye may not be lawfully joined together in matrimony ye do now confess it The parson paused He had always paused at that point The pause had no meaning for him but for Kate how much Impediment There was indeed an impediment Confess How could she ever confess The warning terrified her It seemed to have been made for her alone She had heard it before and thought nothing of it Now it seemed to scorch her very soul She began to tremble violently There was an indistinct murmur which she did not catch The parson seemed to be speaking to Pete love her comfort her honour and keep her so long as ye both shall live And then came Pete s voice full and strong from his great chest but far off and going by her ear like a voice in a shell I will After that the parson s words seemed to be falling on her face Wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband to live together after God s ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony Wilt thou obey him and serve him love honour and keep him in sickness and in health and forsaking all other keep thee unto him so long as ye both shall live Kate was far away She was spelling out the Manx text Bannet T eshyn Ta Cheet but the letters were dancing in and out of each other and yellow lights were darting from her eyes Suddenly she was aware that the parson s voice had stopped There was blank silence then an uneasy rustle and then somebody was saying something in a soft tone Eh she said aloud The parson s voice came now in a whisper at her breast Say I will Ah I she murmured I will That s all my dear Say it with me I will She framed her lips to speak but the words were half uttered by the parson The next thing she knew was that a stray hand was holding her hand She felt more safe now that her poor cold fingers lay in that big warm palm It was Pete and he was speaking again She did not so much hear him as feel his voice tingling through her veins I Peter Quilliam take thee Katherine Cregeen But it was all a vague murmur fraying off into nothing ending like a wave with a long upward plash of low sound The parson was speaking to her again softly gently caressingly almost as if she were a frightened child Don t be afraid my dear try to speak after me Take your time Then aloud I Katherine Cregeen Her throat gurgled she faltered but she spoke at length in the toneless voice of one who speaks in sleep I Katherine Cregeen Take thee Peter Quilliam The toneless voice broke take thee Peter Quilliam And then all came in a rush with some of the words distinctly repeated and some of them droned and dropped to my wedded husband to have and to hold have and to hold from this day forward till death do us part death do us part therefore I give thee my troth troth The last word fell like a broken echo and then there was a rustle in the church and much audible breathing Some of the school girls in the gallery were reaching over the pews with parted lips and dancing eyes Pete had taken her left hand and was putting the ring on her finger She was conscious of his warm breath and of the words With this ring I thee wed with my body I thee worship and with all my worldly goods I thee endow Amen Again she left her cold hand in Pete s warm hand He was stroking it on the outside with his other one It was all a dream She seemed to rally from it as she moved down the aisle Ghostly faces were smiling at her out of the air on either side and the choir in the gallery behind the school girls were singing the psalm with John the Clerk s husky voice drawling out the first word of each new verse as his companions were singing the last word of the preceding one Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine upon the walls of thine house Thy children like the olive branches round about thy table As it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be World without end A men They were all in the vestry now standing together in a group Her mother was wiping her eyes Pete was laughing and Nancy Joe was nudging him and saying in an audible whisper Kiss her man it s only respectable The parson was leaning over the table He spoke to Pete and then said A substantial mark too The lady s turn next The open book was before her and the pen was put into her hand When she laid it down the parson returned his spectacles to their sheath and a nervous voice which thrilled and frightened her said from behind Let me be the first to wish you happiness missus Quilliam It was Philip She turned towards him and their eyes met for a moment But she was only conscious of his prominent nose his clear cut chin his rapid smile like sunshine disappearing as before a cloud He said something else something about a new life and a new beginning but she could not gather its meaning her mind would not take it in At the next moment they were all in the open air XXII Philip had been in torment first the torment of an irresistible hatred of Kate He knew that this hatred was illogical that it was monstrous but it supported his pride it held him safe above self contempt in being present at the wedding When the carriage drew up at the church gate and he helped Kate to alight he thought she looked up at him as one who says You see things are not so bad after all And when she turned her face to him at the beginning of the service he thought it wore a look of fierce triumph of victory of disdain But as the ceremony proceeded and he observed her absent ness her vacancy her pathetic imbecility he began to be oppressed by an awful sense of her consciousness of error Was she taking this step out of pique Was she thinking to punish him forgetting the price she would have to pay Would she awake to morrow morning with her vexation and vanity gone face to face with a hideous future the worst and most terrible that is possible to any woman that of being married to one man and loving another Faugh Would his own vanity haunt him even there Shame shame He forced himself to do the duty of a best man In the vestry he approached the bride and muttered the conventional wishes His heart was devouring itself like a rapid fire and it was as much as he could do to look into her piteous eyes and speak Struggle as he might at that moment he could not put out of his heart a passionate tenderness This frightened him and straightway he resolved to see no more of Kate He must be fair to her he must be true to himself But walking behind her up the path strewn with flowers from the church door to the gate the gnawings of the worm of buried love came on him again and he felt like a man who was being dragged through the dirt XXIII Four saddle horses each with its rider seated and ready had been waiting at the churchyard gate pawing up the gravel The instant the bride and bridegroom came out of the church the horses set off for Caesar s house at a furious gallop Kate and Pete Caesar Grannie and Nancy with the addition of Philip and Parson Quiggin returned in the covered carriage At the turn of the road the way was blocked by a group of stalwart girls out of the last of the year s cornfields With the straw rope of the stackyard stretched across they demanded toll before the carriage would be allowed to pass Pete who sat by the door put his head out and inquired solemnly if the highway women would take their charge in silver or in kind half a crown apiece or a kiss all round They laughed and answered that they saw no objection to taking both Whereupon Pete whispering behind his hand that the mistress was looking tossed into the air a paper bag which rose like a cannon ball broke in the air like a shell and fell over their white sun bonnets like a shower At the door of The Manx Fairy the four riders were waiting with smoking horses The first to arrive had been rewarded already with a bottle of rum He had one other ancient privilege As the coach drove up to the door he stepped up to the bride with the wedding cake and broke it over her head Then there was a scramble for the pieces among the girls who gathered round her that they might take them to bed and dream of a day to come when they should themselves be as proud and happy The wedding breakfast a wedding dinner was laid in the loft of the mill the chapel of The Christians Caesar sat at the head of the table with Grannie on one side and Kate on the other Pete sat next to Kate and Philip next to Grannie The parson sat at the foot with Nancy Joe a lady of consequence receiving much consideration at his reverent right hand Jonaique Jelly sat midway down the table with a fine scorn on his features for John the Clerk sat opposite with a fiddle gripped between his knees The neighbours brought in the joints of beef and mutton the chickens and the ducks Caesar and the parson carved Black Tom who had been invited by way of truce served out the liquor from an eighteen gallon cask and sucked it up himself like the sole of an old shoe Then Caesar said grace and the company fell to Such noise such sport such chaff such laughter Everything was a jest every word had wit in it How are you doing John Haven t done as well for a month sir but what s it saying two hungry meals make the third a glutton How are you doing Tom No time to get a right mouthful for myself Caesar kept so busy with the drink Aw there ll be some with their top works hampered soon Got plenty Jonaique Plenty sir plenty Enough down here to victual a menagerie It ll be Sunday every day of the week with the man that s getting the lavings Take a taste of this beef before it goes mister Thomas Quilliam or do you prefer the mutton I m not partic lar mister Cregeen Ateing s nothing to me but filling a sack that s empty Grannie praised the wedding service it was lovely it was beautiful she didn t think the ould parzon could have made the like but Caesar criticised both church and clergy couldn t see what for the cross on the pulpit and the petticoat on the parson Popery sir clane Popery he whispered across Grannie to Philip Away went the shanks of mutton the breasts of birds and the slabs of beef and up came an apple pudding as round as a well fed salmon and as long as a twenty pound cod There was a shout of welcome None of your dynamite pudding that as green as grass and as sour as vinegar Kate was called on to make the first cut of the monster A faint colour had returned to her cheeks since she had come home She was talking a little and even laughing sometimes as if the weight on her heart was lightening every moment She rose at the call took with the hand nearest to the dish the knife that her father held out and plunged it into the pudding As she did so with all eyes upon her the wedding ring on her finger flashed in the light and was seen by everybody Look at that though cried Black Tom There s the wife for a husband if you plaze Ashamed of showing it is she Not she the bogh Then there was much giggling among the younger women and cries of Aw the poor girl Going to church has been making her left handed Time enough my beauties cried Pete and mind you re not struck that way yourselves one of these days Away went the dishes and the parson rose to return thanks Never heard that grace but once before Parson Quiggin said Pete and then lighting his pipe then it was a burial sarvice A burial sarvice A dozen voices echoed the words together and in a moment the table was quiet Yes though said Pete It was up at Johannesburg Two chums settled there and one married a girl Nice lil thing too some of the Boer girls you know but not much ballast at her at all The husband went up country for the Consolidated company and when he came back there was trouble Chum had been sweethearting the wife a bit Aw dear Aw well well Do The husband He went after the chum with a repeater and took him Bath chair sort of a chap no fight in him at all Mercy he cries I can t says the husband Forgive him this once says the wife It s only once a woman loses herself says the man Mercy mercy Say your prayers Mercy mercy mercy Too late and the husband shot him dead The woman dropped in a faint but the man said He didn t say his prayers though I must be doing it for him Then down he went on his knees by the body but the prayers were all forgot at him all but the bit of a grace so he said that instead Loud breathings on every side followed Pete s story and Caesar leaning over towards Philip whose face had grown ashy said Terrible sir terrible But still and for all right enough though eh What s it saying Better an enemy than a bad friend Philip answered absently his eyes were on the opposite side of the table There was a sudden rising of the people about Kate Water there shouted Pete It s a thundering blockhead I am for sure frightning the life out of people with stories fit for a funeral No no said Kate I m not faint Why should you think so Of coorse not bogh said Nancy who was behind her in a twinkling White is she Well what of it man It s only becoming on a girl s wedding day Take a lil sup though woman there there Kate drank the water with the glass jingling against her teeth and then began to laugh The parson s ruddy face rose at the end of the table Friends he said after that tragic story let us indulge in a little vanity Fill up your glasses to the brim and drink with me to the health of the happy couple We all know both of them We know the bride for a good daughter and a sweet girl one so naturally pure that nobody can ever say an evil word or think an evil thought when she is near We know the bridegroom for a real Manxman simple and rugged and true who says all he thinks and thinks all he says God has been very good to them Such virginal and transparent souls have much to be thankful for It is not for them to struggle with that worst enemy of man the enemy that is within the enemy of bad passions So we can wish them joy on their union with a full heart and a sure hope that whatever chance befall them on the ways of this world they will be happy and content Aw the beautiful advice said Grannie wiping her eyes Popery just Popery muttered Caesar What about original sin There was a chorus of applause Kate was still laughing Philip s head was down And now friends continued the parson Captain Quilliam has been a successful man abroad but he has had to come home to do the best piece of work he ever did A voice Do it yourself parzon It is true I ve never done it myself Vanity of vanities love is not for me It s been the Lord s will to put me here to do the marrying and leave my people to do the loving But there is a young man present who has all the world before him and everything this life can promise except one thing and that s the best thing of all a wife Kate s laughter grew boisterous This morning he helped his friend to marry a pure and beautiful maiden Now let me remind him of the text which says Go thou and do likewise The toast was drunk standing with shouts of Cap n Pete and amid much hammering on the table stamping on the floor and other thunderings of applause Cap n Pete rolled up to reply After a moment s pause in which he distributed sage winks and nods on every side he said I m not much for public spaking myself I made my best speech and my shortest in church this morning I will The parzon has has been telling my dooiney molla to do as I have done today He can t Begging pardon of the ladies there s only one woman on the island fit for him and I ve got her Kate s laughter grew shrill My wife At this word uttered with an air of life long familiarity twenty clay pipes lost their heads by collision with the table and Pete was interrupted by roars of laughter Gough bless me can t a married man mention his wife in company Well then Mistress Cap n Peter Quilliam This mouthful was the signal for another riotous interruption and a general call for more to drink Won t that do for you neither I m not going back on it though Whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder isn t that it Parzon Quiggin What s it you re saying no man but the Dempster Well the Dempster s here that is to be I ll clear him of that anyway Kate s laughter became explosive and uncontrollable Pete nodded sideways to fill up the gap in his eloquence and then went on But if my dooiney molla can t marry my wife there s one thing he can do for her he can make her house his home in Ramsey when he goes to Douglas for good and comes down here to the coorts once a fortnight Kate laughed more immoderately than ever but Philip with a look of alarm half rose from his seat and said across the table There s my aunt at Ballure Pete She ll be following after you said Pete There are hotels enough for travellers said Philip Too many by half and that s why I asked in public said Pete I know the brotherly feeling began Philip Is it a promise demanded Pete If I can t escape your kindness No you can t so there s an end of it It will kill me yet May you never die till it polishes you off At Philip s submission to Pete s will there was a general chorus of cheers through which Kate s shrill laughter rang like a scream Pete patted the back of her hand and continued And now young fellows there let an ould experienced married man give you a bit of advice he swore away all his worldly goods this morning so he hasn t much else to give I ve no belief in bachelors myself They re like a tub without a handle nothing to lay hould of them by Much nudging and whispering about the bottom of the table What s that down yonder The vicar you say Aw the vicar s a grand man but he s only a parzon you see mister Christian is it He s got too much work to do to be thinking about women We re living on the nineteenth century boys and it s middling hard feeding for some of us If the fishing s going to the dogs and the farming going to the deuce don t be tossing head over tip at the tail of the tourist If you ve got the pumping engine inside of you in plain English if you ve got the indomable character of the rael Manxman do as I done go foreign Then watch your opportunity What s Shake spar saying Pete paused What s that he s saying now Pete scratched his forehead Something about a flood anyway Pete stretched his hand out vigorously Lay hould of it at the flood says he that s the way to make your fortune Then Pete melted to sentiment glanced down at Kate s head and continued And when you come back to the ould island and there isn t no place like it you can marry the girl of your heart God bless her Work s black but money s white and love is as sweet on potatoes and herrings three times a day as on nothing for dinner and the same every night of the week for supper While you re away you ll be draming of her Is she faithful Is she thrue Coorse she is and waiting to take you the very minute you come home Kate was still laughing as if she could not stop Look out for the right sort boys Plenty of the like in yet If the young men of these days are more smart and more educated than their fathers the young women are more handsome and more virtuous than their mothers So ben my chree my hearties and enough in the locker to drive away the divil and the coroner Through the volley of cheers which followed Pete s speech came the voice of Black Tom thick with drink Drive off the crow at the wedding breakfast Everybody rose and looked A great crow black as night had come in at the open door of the mill calmly sedately as if by habit for the corn that usually lay there It manes divorce said Black Tom Scare it away cried some one It s the new wife must do it said another Where s Kate cried Nancy But Kate only looked and went on laughing as before The crow turned tail and took flight of itself at finding so eager an audience Then Pete said Whose houlding with such ould wife s wonders And Caesar answered Coorse not or fairies either I ve slept out all night on Cronk ny airy Lhaa before my days of grace I mane and I never seen no fairies It would be a fool of a fairy though that would let you see him Caesar said Black Tom At nine o clock Caesar s gig was at the door of The Manx Fairy to take the bride and bridegroom home They had sung Mylecharane and Keerie fu Snaighty and Hunting the Wren and The Win that Shook the Barley and then they had cleared away the tables and danced to the fiddle of John the Clerk and the clarionet of Jonaique Jelly Kate with wild eyes and flushed cheeks had taken part in everything but always fiercely violently almost tempestuously until people lost enjoyment of her heartiness in fear of her hysteria and Caesar whispered Pete to take her away and brought round the gig to hasten them Kate went up for her cloak and hat and in the interval between her departure and reappearance Grannie and Nancy Joe both glorified beings Nancy with her unaccustomed cap askew stood in the middle of a group of women who were deferring and inquiring and sympathising I don t know in the world how she has kept up so long said Grannie And dear heart knows how I m to keep up when she s gone said Nancy with her apron to her eyes Kate came down ready Everybody followed her into the road and all stood round the gig with flashes from the gig lamps on their faces while Pete swung her up into the seat lifting her bodily in his great arms You wouldn t drown yourself to night for an ould rusty nail eh captain n cried somebody with a laugh You go bail said Pete and he leapt up to Kate s side twiddled the reins cracked the whip and they drove away XXIV Philip had stood at the door of the porch struggling to command his soul and employing all his powers to look cheerful and even gay But as Kate had passed she had looked at him with an imploring look and then he had seemed to understand everything that she had made a mistake and that she knew it that her laughter had been bitterer than tears that some compulsion had been put upon her and that she was a wretched and miserable woman At the next moment she had gone by with an odour of lace and perfume and then a flood of tenderness of pity of mad jealousy had come upon him and it had been as much as he could do to restrain himself One instant he held himself in hand and at the next the wheels of the gig had begun to move the horse had started the women had trooped into the house again and there was nothing before him but the broad back of Caesar who was looking into the darkness after the vanishing gig lamps and breathing asthmatical breath Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife said Caesar You re time enough yet sir come in come in But the man was odious to Philip at that moment the house was odious the people and the talk inside were odious and he slipped away unobserved Too late From the torment of his own thoughts he could not escape his lost love his lost happiness his memories of the past his dreams of the future A voice it was his own voice seemed to be taunting him constantly You were not worthy of her You did not know her value She is gone and what have you got instead The Deemstership That was of no consequence now A name an idle name Love was the only thing worth having and it was lost Without it all the rest was nothing and he had flung it away He had been a monster he had been a fool The thought of his folly was insupportable the recollection of his selfishness was stifling the memory of his calculating deliberations was dragging him again in the dust Thus with a sense of crushing shame he plunged down the dark road trying not to think of the gig that had gone swinging along in front of him He would leave the island To morrow he would sail for England No matter if he lost the chance of promotion To morrow to morrow But to night How could he live through the hours until morning with the black thoughts which the darkness generated How could he sleep How lie awake What drug would bring forgetfulness Kate Pete To night Oh God oh God XXV Six strides of the horse into the darkness and Kate s hysteria was gone She had been lost to herself the whole day through and now she possessed herself again She grew quiet and silent and even solemn But Pete rattled on with cheerful talk about the day s doings At the doors of the houses on the road as they passed people were standing in the half light to wave them salutations and Pete sent back his answers in shouts and laughter Turning the bridge they saw a little group at the porch of the Ginger There s company waiting for us yonder said Pete giving the mare a touch of the whip Let us get on said Kate in a nervous whisper Aw let s be neighbourly you know said Pete It wouldn t be dacent to disappoint people at all We ll hawl up for a minute just and hoof up the time at a gallop Woa lass woa mare woa bogh As the gig drew up at the inn door a voice out of the porch cried Joy to you captain n and joy to your lady and long life and prosperity to you both and may the Lord give you children and health and happiness to rear them and may you see your children s children and may they call you blessed Glasses round missus Kelly shouted Pete Go on please said Kate in a fretful whisper and she tugged at Pete s sleeve The stars came out the moon gave a peep the late hay of the Curragh sent a sweet odour through the night Kate shuddered and Pete covered her shoulders with a rug Then he began to sing snatches He sang bits of all the songs that had been sung that night but kept coming back at intervals to an old Manx ditty which begins Little red bird of the black turf ground Where did you sleep last night Thus he sang like a great boy as he went rolling down the dark road and Kate sat by his side and trembled They came to the town rattled down the Parliament Street passed the Court house under the trees turned the sharp angle by the market place and drew up at Elm Cottage in the corner Home at last cried Pete and he leapt to the ground A dog began to bark inside the house D ye hear him said Pete That s the master in charge The porch door was opened and a comfortable looking woman in a widow s cap came out with a lighted candle shaded by her hand And this is your housekeeper missus Gorry said Pete Kate did not answer Her eyes had been fixed in a rigid stare on the hind quarters of the horse which were steaming in the light of the lamps Pete lifted her down as he had lifted her up Then missus Gorry took her by the hand and saying Mind the step ma am this way ma am led her through the gate and along the garden path and up to the porch The porch opened on a square hall furnished as a sitting room A fire was burning a lamp was lit the table was laid for supper and the place was warm and cosy There What d ye say to that cried Pete coming behind with the whip in his hand Kate looked around she did not speak her eyes began to fill Isn t it fit for a Dempster s lady said Pete sweeping the whip handle round the room like a showman Kate could bear no more She sank into a chair and burst into a fit of tears Pete s glowing face dropped in an instant Dear heart alive darling what is it he said My poor girl what s troubling you at all Tell me now tell me bogh tell me It s nothing Pete nothing Don t ask me said Kate But still she sobbed as if her heart would break Pete stood a moment by her side smoothing her arm with his hand Then he said with a crack and a quaver in his great voice It is hard for a girl I know that to lave father and mother and every one and everything that s been sweet and dear to her since she was a child and to come to the house of her husband and say The past has been very good to me but still and for all I m for trusting the future to you It s hard darling I know it s hard Oh leave me leave me cried Kate still weeping Pete brushed his sleeve across his eyes and said Take her upstairs missus Gorry while I m putting up the mare at the Saddle Then he whistled to the dog which had been watching him from the hearthrug and went out of the house The handle of the whip dragged after him along the floor missus Gorry full of trouble took Kate to her room Would she not eat her supper Then salts were good for headache should she bring a bottle from her box After many fruitless inquiries and nervous protestations the good soul bade Kate good night and left her Being alone Kate broke into yet wilder paroxysms of weeping The storm cloud which had been gathering had burst at last It seemed as if the whole weight of the day had been deferred until then The piled up hopes of weeks had waited for that hour to be cast down in the sight of her own eyes It was all over The fight with Fate was done and the frantic merriment with which she had kept down her sense of the place where the blind struggle had left her made the sick recoil more bitter She thought of Philip and her trouble began to moderate Somewhere out of the uncrushed part of her womanhood there came one flicker of womanly pride to comfort her She saw Philip at last from the point of revenge He loved her he would never cease to love her Do what he might to banish the thought of her she would be with him always the more surely with him the more reproachfully and unattainably because she would be the wife of another man If he could put her away from him in the daytime and in the presence of those worldly aims for which he had sacrificed her when night came he would be able to put her away no more He would never sleep but he would see her In every dream he would stretch out his arms to her but she would not be there and he would awake with sobs and in torment There was a real joy in this thought although it tore her heart so terribly She got strength from the cruel comforting and missus Gorry in the room below listening intently heard her crying cease With her face still shut in both her hands she was telling herself that she had nothing to reproach herself with that she could not have acted differently that she had not really made this marriage that she had only submitted to it being swept along by the pitiless tide which was her father and Pete and everybody She was telling herself too that after all she had done well Here she lay in close harbour from the fierce storm which had threatened her She was safe she was at peace The room lay still The night was very quiet within those walls Kate drew down her hands and looked about her The fire was burning gently and warming her foot on the sheepskin rug that lay in front of it A lamp burned low on a table behind her chair At one side there was a wardrobe of the shape of an old press but with a tall mirror in the door on the other side there was the bed with the pink curtains hanging like a tent The place had a strange look of familiarity It seemed as if she had known it all her life She rose to look around and then the inner sense leapt to the outer vision and she saw how it was The room was a reproduction of her own bedroom at home only newer and more luxurious It was almost as if some ghost of herself had been there while she slept as if her own hand had done everything in a dream of her girlhood wherein common things had become grand Kate s eyes began to fill afresh and she turned to take off her cloak As she did so she saw something on the dressing table with a label attached to it She took it up It was a little mirror a handglass like her own old one only framed in ivory and the writing on the label ran Insted of The one that is bruk with fond Luv to Kirry peat Her heart was now beating furiously A flood of feeling had rushed over her She dropped the glass as if it stung her fingers With both hands she covered her face Everything in the room seemed to be accusing her Hitherto she had thought only of Philip Now for the first time she thought of Pete She had wronged him deeply awfully beyond atonement or hope of forgiveness He loved her he had married her he had brought her to his home to this harbour of safety and she had deceived and betrayed him she had suffered herself to be married to him while still loving another man A sudden faintness seized her She grew dizzy and almost fell A more terrible memory had come behind The thought was like ravens flapping their black wings on her brain She felt her temples beating against her hands They seemed to be sucking the life out of her heart Just then the voice of Pete came beating up the echoes between the house and the chapel beyond the garden Little red bird of the black turf ground Where did you sleep last night She heard him open the garden gate clash it back come up the path with an eager step shut the door of the house and chain it on the inside Then she heard his deep voice speaking below Better now missus Gorry Aw better sir yes and quiet enough this ten minutes Give her time the bogh Be aisy with the like be aisy Presently she heard him send off missus Gorry for the night saying he should want no supper and should be going to bed soon Then the house became quiet and the smell of tobacco smoke came floating up the stairs Kate s hot breath on her hands grew damp against her face She felt herself swooning and she caught hold of the mantelpiece It cannot be she thought He must not come I will go down to him and say Pete forgive me I am really the wife of another Then she would tell him everything Yes she would confess all now Oh she would not be afraid His love was great He would do what she wished She made one step towards the door and was pulled up as by a curb Pete would say Do you mean that you have been using me as a cloak Do you ask me to live in this house side by side with you and let no one suspect that we are apart Then why did you not ask me yesterday Why do you ask me to day when it is too late to choose No she could not confess If confession had been difficult yesterday it was a thousand times more difficult to day and it would be a thousand thousand times more difficult tomorrow Kate caught up the cloak she had thrown aside She must go away Anywhere anywhere no matter where That was the one thing left to her the only escape from the wild tangle of dread and pain Pete was in the hall there must be a way out at the back she would find it She lowered the lamp and turned the handle of the door Then she saw a light moving on the landing and heard a soft step on the stairs It was Pete with a candle coming up in his stockinged feet He stopped midway as if he heard the click of the latch and then went noiselessly down again Kate closed the door She would not go If she left the house that night she would cover Pete with suspicion and disgrace The true secret would never be known the real offender would never suffer but the finger of scorn would be raised at the one man who had sheltered and shielded her and he would die of humiliation and blind self reproach This reflection restrained her for the moment and when the stress of it was spent she was mastered by a fear that was far more terrible For good or for all she was now married to Pete and he had the rights of a husband He had a right to come to her and he would come It was inevitable it had to be No boy or girl love now no wooing no dallying no denying but a grim reality of life a reality that comes to every woman who is married to a man She was married to Pete In the eye of the world in the eye of the law she was his and to fly from him was impossible She must remain God himself had willed it As for the shame of her former relation to Philip it was her own secret God alone knew of it and He would keep it safe It was the dark chamber of her heart which God only could unlock He would never unlock it until the Day of Judgment and then Philip would be standing by her side and she would cast it back upon him and say His not mine O God and the Great Judge of all would judge between them But she began to cry again like a child in the dark As she threw off her cloak a second time her dress crinkled and she looked down at it and remembered that it was her wedding dress Then she looked around at the room and remembered that it was her wedding chamber She remembered how she had dreamt of coming in her bridal dress to her bridal room proud afraid tingling with love blushing with joy whispering to herself This is for me and this and this He has given it for he loves me and I love him and he is mine and I am his and he is my love and my lord and he is coming to There was a gentle knocking at the door It made her flesh creep The knock came again It went shrieking through and through her Kirry whispered a voice from without She did not stir It s only Pete She neither spoke nor moved There was silence for a moment and then half nervously half jovially half in laughter half with emotion as if the heart outside was palpitating the voice came again I m coming in darling PART IV MAN AND WIFE I Next morning Kate said to herself My life must begin again from to day She had a secret that Pete did not share but she was not the first woman who had kept something from her husband When people had secrets which it would hurt others to reveal they ought to keep them close Honour demanded that she should be as firm as a rock in blotting Philip from her soul Remembering the promise which Pete had demanded of Philip at the wedding to make their house his home in Ramsey and seeing that Philip must come if only to save appearances she asked herself if she ought to prevent him But no She resolved to conquer the passion that made his presence a danger There was no safety in separation In her relation to Philip she was like the convict who is beginning his life again the only place where he can build up a sure career is precisely there where his crime is known Let Philip come she thought She made his room ready She was married It was her duty to be a good wife Pete loved her his love would make it easy They were sitting at breakfast in the hall parlour and she said I should like to be my own housekeeper Pete And right too said Pete Be your own woman darling not your woman s woman and have missus Gorry for your housemaid To turn her mind from evil thoughts she set to work immediately and busied herself with little duties little economies little cares little troubles But the virtues of housekeeping were just those for which she had not prepared herself Her first leg of mutton was roasted down to the proportions of a frizzled shank and her first pudding was baked to the colour and consistency of a badly burnt brick She did not mend rapidly as a cook but Pete ate of all that his faultless teeth could grind through and laid the blame on his appetite when his digestion failed She strove by other industries to keep alive a sense of her duty as a wife Buying rolls of paper at the paperhanger s she set about papering every closet in the house The patterns did not join and the paste did not adhere She initialled in worsted the new blankets sent by Grannie with a P and a Q and a K intertwined Than she overhauled the linen turned out every room twice a week painted every available wooden fixture with paint which would not dry because she had mixed it herself to save a sixpence a stone and forgotten the turpentine Pete held up his hands in admiration at all her failures She had thought it would be easy to be a good wife to a good husband It was hard hard for any one hardest of all for her There are the ruins of a happy woman in the bosom of every over indulged wife She could not keep to anything long but every night for a week she gave Pete lessons in reading writing and arithmetic His reading was laborious his spelling was eccentric his figuring he did on the tips of his heavy fingers and his writing he executed with his tongue in his cheek and his ponderous thumb down on the pen nib What letter is that Pete she said pointing with her knitting needle to the page of a book of poems before them Pete looked up in astonishment Is it me you re asking Kitty If you don t know I don t know That s a capital M Pete Is it now said Pete looking at the letter with a searching eye Goodness me the straight it s like the gate of the long meadow And that s a capital A Sakes alive the straight it s like the coupling of the cart house And that s a B Gough bless me d ye say so But the straight it s like the hoof of a bull though And M A B spells Mab Queen Mab said Kate going on with her knitting Pete looked up at her with eyes wide open I suppose now he said in a voice of pride I suppose you re knowing all the big spells yourself Kitty Not all Sometimes I have to look in the dictionary said Kate She showed him the book and explained its uses And is it taiching you to spell every word Kitty he asked Every ordinary word said Kate My gough said Pete touching the book with awe Next day he pored over the dictionary for an hour but when he raised his face it wore a look of scepticism and scorn This spelling book isn t taiching you nothing darling he said Isn t it Pete No nothing said Pete Here I ve been looking for an ordinary word a very ordinary word and it isn t in What word is it said Elate leaning over his shoulder Love said Pete See pointing his big forefinger that s where it ought to be and where is it But love begins lo said Kate and you re looking at lu Here it is love Pete gave a prolonged whistle then fell back in his chair looked slowly up and said So you must first know how the word begins is that it Kitty Why yes said Kate Then it s you that s taiching the spelling book darling so we ll put it back on the shelf For a fortnight Kate read and replied to Pete s correspondence It was plentiful and various Letters from heirs to lost fortunes offering shares in return for money to buy them out of Chancery from promoters of companies proposing dancing palaces to meet the needs of English visitors from parsons begging subscriptions to new organs from fashionable ladies asking Pete to open bazaars from preachers inviting him to anniversary tea meetings and saying Methodism was proud of him If anybody wanted money he kissed the Blarney Stone and applied to Pete Kate stood between him and the worst of the leeches The best of them he contrived to deal with himself secretly and surreptitiously Sometimes there came acknowledgments of charities of which Kate knew nothing Then he would shuffle them away and she would try not to see them If I stop him altogether I will spoil him she thought One day the post brought a large envelope with a great seal at the back of it and Kate drew out a parchment deed and began to read the indorsement Memorandum of loan to Caesar Cre That s nothing said Pete snatching the document and stuffing it into his jacket pocket Kate lifted her eyes with a look of pain and shame and humiliation and that was the end of her secretaryship II A month after their marriage a man came through the gate with the air of one who was doing a degrading thing The dog which had been spread out lazily in the sun before the porch leapt up and barked furiously Who s this coming up the path with his eyes all round him like a scallop said Pete Kate looked It s Ross Christian she said with a catch in her breathing Ross came up and Pete met him at the door His face was puffy and pale his speech was soft and lisping yet there lurked about the man an air of levity and irony Your dog doesn t easily make friends Peter he said He s like his master sir it s against the principles of his life said Pete Ross laughed a little Wants to be approached with consideration does he captain n You see he s lived such a long time in the world and seen such a dale said Pete Ross looked up sharply and said in another tone I ve just dropped in to congratulate you on your return home in safety and health and prosperity mister Quilliam You re welcome sir said Pete Pete led the way indoors Ross followed bowed distantly to Kate who was unpicking a dress and took a chair I must not conceal from you however that I have another object in fact a private matter said Ross glancing at Kate The dress rustled in Kate s fingers her scissors dropped on to the table and she rose to go Pete raised his hand My wife knows all my business he said Ross gave out another little chirp of laughter You ll remember what they say of a secret Captain too big for one right for two tight for three A man and his wife are one sir so that s two altogether said Pete Kate took up the scissors and went on with her work uneasily Ross twisted on his seat and said Well I feel I must tell you Peter Quilliam sir said Pete charging a pipe but Ross pretended not to hear Only natural perhaps for it in fact it s about our father Tongue with me tongue with thee thought Pete lighting up Five years ago he made me an allowance and sent me up to London to study law He believes I ve been called to the English bar and in view of this vacant Deemstership he wants me admitted to the Manx one Pete s pipe stopped in its puffing Well That s impossible said Ross Things haven t come with you eh To tell you the truth Captain on first going up I fell into extravagant company I thought my friends were rich men and I was never a niggard There was Monty the patron of the Fancy the scissors in Kate s hand clicked and stopped and Ross blurted out In fact I ve not been called and I ve never studied at all Ross squirmed in his chair glancing under his brows at Kate Pete leaned forward and puffed up the chimney without speaking You see I speak freely Peter something compels me Well if a man can t reveal his little failings to his own brother Peter Don t let s talk about brothers said Pete What am I to do for you Lend me enough to help me to do what our father thinks I ve done already said Ross and then he added hastily Oh I ll give you my note of hand for it They re telling me sir said Pete your notes of hand are as cheap as cowries Some one has belied me to you Captain But for our father s sake he has set his heart on this Deemstership there may still be time for it Yes said Pete striking his open hand on the table and better men to fill it Ross glanced at Kate and a smile that was half a sneer crossed his evil face How nice he said when the great friends of the wife are also the great friends of the husband Just so said Pete and then Ross laughed a little and the clicking of Kate s scissors stopped again As to you sir said Pete rising if it s no disrespect you re like the cormorant that chokes itself swallowing its fish head ways up The gills are sticking in your gizzard sir only touching Ross s shoulder with something between a pat and push you shouldn t be coming to your father s son to help you to ram it down As Ross went out Caesar came in That wastrel s been wanting something said Caesar The tide s down on him said Pete Always was and always will be He was born at low water and he ll die on the rocks Borrowing money eh said Caesar with a searching glance Trying to said Pete indifferently Then lend it sir said Caesar promptly He s not to trust but lend it on his heirship Or lend it the ould man at mortgage on Ballawhaine He s the besom of fire it ll come to you sir at the father s death and who has more right The shank of Pete s pipe came down from his mouth as he sat for some moments beating out the ash on the jockey bar Something in that though he said mechanically But there s another has first claim for all He d be having the place now if every one had his own I must be thinking of it I must be thinking of it III Philip had left the island on the morning after the marriage He had gone abroad and when they heard from him first he was at Cairo The voyage out had done him good the long steady nights going down the Mediterranean walking the deck alone the soft air the far off lights thought he was feeling better calmer anyway He hoped they were settled in their new home and well and happy Kate had to read the letter aloud It was like a throb of Philip s heart made faint feeble and hardly to be felt by the great distance Then she had to reply to it on behalf of Pete Tell him to be quick and come out of the land of Egypt and the house of bondage said Pete Say there s no manner of sense of a handsome young man living in a country where there isn t a pretty face to be seen on the sunny side of a blanket Write that Kirry joins with her love and best respects and she s busy whitewashing and he d better have no truck with Pharaoh s daughters The next time they heard from Philip he was at Rome He had suffered from sleeplessness but was not otherwise unwell Living in that city was like an existence after death all the real life was behind you But it was not unpleasant to walk under the big moon amid the wrecks of the past He congratulated missus Quilliam on her active occupation work was the same as suffering it was strength and power Kate had to read this letter also It was like a sob coming over the sea Give him a merry touch to keep up his pecker said Pete Tell him the Romans are ter ble jealous chaps and if he gets into a public house for a cup of tay he s to mind and not take the girls on his knee the Romans don t like it The last time they heard from Philip he was in London His old pain had given way he thought he was nearly well again but he had come through a sharp fire The Governor had been very good kept open the Deemstership by some means also surrounded him with London friends he was out every night Nevertheless an unseen force was drawing him home they might see him soon or it might be later he had been six months away but he felt that it had not been all waste and interruption he would return with a new sustaining power This letter could not be answered for it bore no address It came by the night mail with the same day s steamer from England Two hours later missus Gorry ran in from an errand to the town saying I believe in my heart I saw mister Philip Christian going by on the road When said Pete This minute she answered Chut woman said Pete the man s in London Look here s his letter running his forefinger along the headline London January twenty first that s yesterday See missus Gorry was perplexed But the next night she was out at the same hour on the same errand and came flying into the house with a scared look making the same announcement See for yourself then she cried he s going up the lane by the garden Nonsense it s browning you re ateing with your barley said Pete and then to Kate behind his hand he whispered Whisht It s sights she s seeing poor thing and no wonder with her husband laving her so lately But the third night also missus Gorry returned from a similar errand at the same hour with the same statement I m sure of it she panted She was now in terror An idea of the supernatural had taken hold of her The woman manes it said Pete and he began to cross question her How was mister Christian dressed She hadn t noticed that night but the first night he had worn a coat like an old Manx cape Which way was he going She couldn t be certain which way to night but the night before he had gone up the lane between the chapel and the garden Had she seen his face at all The first time she had seen it and it was very thin and pale Oh I wouldn t deceave you sir said missus Gorry and she fell to crying Gough bless me but this is mortal strange though said Pete What time was it exactly Jane asked Kate On the minute of ten every night answered missus Gorry Is there any difference in time now said Pete between the Isle of Man and London Kitty Nothing to speak of said Kate Pete scratched his head I must be putting a sight up on Black Tom A dirty old trouss God forgive me if he is my grandfather but he knows the Manx yarns about right If it had been Midsummer day now and Philip had been in bed somewhere it might have been his spirit coming home while he was sleeping to where his heart is they re telling of the like anyway Kate read the mystery after her own manner and on the following night at the approach of ten o clock she went into the parlour of the hall whence a window looked out on to the road The day had been dull and the night was misty A heavy white hand seemed to have come down on to the face of sea and land Everything lay still and dead and ghostly Kate was in the dark room trembling but not with fear Presently a form that was like a shadow passed under a lamp that glimmered opposite She could see only the outlines of a Spanish cape But she listened for the footsteps and she knew them They came on and paused came up and paused again and then they went past and deadened off and died in the dense night air Kate s eyes were red and swollen when she came back to supper She had promised herself enjoyment of Philip s sufferings There was no enjoyment but only a cry of yearning from the deep place where love calls to love She tried afresh to make the thought of Philip sink to the lowest depth of her being It was hard it was impossible Pete was for ever strengthening the recollection of him of his ways his look his voice his laugh What he said was only the echo of her own thoughts but it was pain and torment nevertheless She felt like crying Let me alone let me alone People in the town began to talk of missus Gorry s mysterious stories Philip will be forced to come now thought Kate and he came Kate was alone It was afternoon dinner was over the hearth was swept the fire was heaped up and the rug was down He entered the porch quietly tapped lightly at the door and stepped into the house He hoped she was well She answered mechanically He asked after Pete She replied vacantly that he had been gone since morning on some fishing business to Peel It was a commonplace conversation brief cold almost trivial He spoke softly and stood in the middle of the floor swinging his soft hat against his leg She was standing by the fire with one hand on the mantelpiece and her head half aside looking sideways towards his feet but she noticed that his eyes looked larger than before and that his voice though so soft had a deeper tone At first she did not remember to ask him to sit and when she thought of it she could not do so The poor little words would have been a formal recognition of all that had happened so terribly that she was mistress in that house and the wife of Pete IV They were standing so in a silence hard to break harder still to keep up when Pete himself came back like a rush of wind and welcomed Philip with both hands Sit boy sit he cried not that one this aisy one Mine Well if it s mine it s yours Not had dinner have you Neither have I Any cold mate left Kitty No Fry us a chop then darling Kate had recovered herself by this time and she went out on this errand While she was away Pete rattled on like a mill race asked about the travels laughed about the girls and roared about missus Gorry and her ghost of Philip Been buying a Nickey at Peel to day Phil he said good little boat a reg lar clipper Aw I m going to start on the herrings myself next sayson sir and what for shouldn t I Too many of the Manx ones are giving the fishing the goby There s life in the ould dog yet though Would be anyway if them rusty Kays would be doing anything for the industry They re building piers enough for the trippers but never a breakwater the size of a tooth brush for the fishermen That s reminding me Phil the boys are at me to get you to petition the Tynwald Court for better harbours They re losing many a pound by not getting out all weathers But if the child doesn t cry the mother will be giving it no breast So we mane to squall till they think in Douglas we ve got spavined wind or population of the heart or something The men are looking to you Phil That s the boy for us says they He s stood our friend before and he ll do it again they re saying Philip promised to draw up the petition and then missus Gorry came in and laid the cloth Kate meanwhile had been telling herself that she had not done well Where was the satisfaction she had promised herself on the night of her wedding day when she had seen Philip from the height of a great revenge if she allowed him to think that she also was suffering She must be bright she must be gay she must seem to be happy and in love with her husband She returned to the hall parlour with a smoking dish and a face all sunshine I m afraid they re not very good dear she said Chut said Pete we re not particular Phil and I have roughed it before to day She laughed merrily and under pretext of giving orders disappeared again But she had not belied the food she had set on the table The mutton was badly fed badly killed badly cut and above all badly cooked To eat it was an ordeal Philip tried hard not to let Pete see how he struggled Pete fought valiantly to conceal his own efforts The perspiration began to break out on their foreheads Pete stopped in the midst of some wild talk to glance up at Philip Philip tore away with knife and fork and answered vaguely Then Pete looked searchingly around rose on tiptoe went stealthily to the kitchen door came back caught up a piece of yellow paper from the sideboard whipped the chops into it from his own plate and then from Philip s and crammed them into his jacket pocket No good hurting anybody s feelings said he and then Kate reappeared smiling Finished already she said with an elevation of pitch Ha ha laughed Pete Two hungry men Kate You d rather keep us a week than a fortnight eh Kate stood over the empty dish with a look of surprise Pete winked furiously at Philip Philip s eyes wandered about the tablecloth She isn t knowing much about a hungry man s appetite is she Phil But said Kate but she stammered what s become of the bones Pete scratched his chin through his beard The bones Oh the bones Aw no we re not ateing the bones at all Then with a rush as his eyes kindled But the dog you see coorse we always give the bones to the dog Dempster s dead on bones Dempster was lying at the moment full length under the table snoring audibly missus Gorry cleared the cloth and Kate took up her sewing and turned towards the sideboard Has any one seen my pattern she asked Pattern said Pete diving into his jacket pocket D ye say pattern he muttered rummaging at his side Is this it and out came the yellow paper crumpled and greasy which had gone in with the chops Bless me the stupid a man is now I took it for a pipe light Kate s smile vanished and she fled out to hide her face Then Pete whispered to Philip Let s take a slieu round to the Plough They were leaving the house on that errand when Kate came back to the hall Just taking a lil walk Kirry said Pete They re telling me it s good wonderful after dinner for a wake digestion of the chest and he coughed repeatedly and smote his resounding breast Wait a moment and I ll go with you said Kate There was no help for it Kate s shopping took them in the direction of the Plough Old missus Beatty the innkeeper was at the door as they passed and when she saw Pete approaching on the inside of the three she said aloud meaning no mischief Your bread and cheese and porter are ready as usual captain n V The man was killing her To be his spoiled and adored wife knowing she was unworthy of his love and tenderness was not happiness it was grinding misery bringing death into her soul If he had blamed her for her incompetence if he had scolded her for making his home cheerless nay if he had beaten her she could have borne with life and taken her outward sufferings for her inward punishment She fell into fits of hysteria sat whole hours listless with her feet on the fender Pete s conduct exasperated her As time went on and developed the sweetness of Pete the man grew more and more distasteful to her and she broke into fits of shrewishness Pete hung his head and reproached himself She wasn t to mind if he said things he was only a rough fellow Then she burst into tears and asked him to forgive her and he was all cock a hoop in a moment like a dog that is coaxed after it has been beaten Her sufferings reached a climax she became conscious that she was about to become a mother This affected her with terrible fears She went back to that thought of a possible contingency which had torn her with conflicting feelings on the eve of her marriage It was impossible to be sure The idea might be no more than a morbid fancy born of her un happiness of her secret love for Philip of her secret repugnance for Pete the inadequate the uncouth the uncongenial but nevertheless it possessed her with the force of an overpowering conviction it grew upon her day by day it sat on her heart like a nightmare the child that was to be born to her was not the child of her husband VI In spite of Pete s invitations Philip came rarely He was full of excuses work fresh studies the Governor his aunt Pete said Coorse and Sartenly and Wouldn t trust until Philip began to be ashamed and one evening he came looking stronger than usual with a more sustaining cheerfulness and plumped into the house with the words I ve come at last To stay the night said Pete Well yes said Philip That s lucky and unlucky too for I m this minute for Peel with two of the boys to fetch round my Nickey by the night tide But youll stay and keep the wife company and I ll be back first tide in the morning You ll be obliged to him won t you Kate he cried pitching his voice over his shoulder and then in a whisper She s a bit down at whiles and what wonder and her so near but you ll see you ll see and he winked and nodded knowingly There was no harking back no sheering off on the score of modesty before Pete s large faith Kate looked as if she would cry Mercy mercy but when she saw the same appeal on Philip s face she was stung Pete went off and then Kate and Philip sat down to tea While tea lasted it was not hard to fill the silences with commonplaces After it was over she brought him a pipe and they lapsed into difficult pauses Philip puffed vigorously and tried to look happy Kate struggled not to let Philip see that she was ill at ease Every moment their imagination took a new turn He began to read a book and while they sat without speaking she thought it was hardly nice of him to treat her with indifference When he spoke she thought he was behaving with less politeness than before He went over to the piano and they sang a part song Oh who will o er the downs so free Their voices went well enough together but they broke down The more they tried to forget the past the more they remembered it He twiddled the backs of his fingertips over the keyboard she swung on one foot and held to the candle bracket while they talked of Pete That name seemed to fortify them against the scouts of passion Pete was their bulwark It was the old theme but played as a tragedy not as a comedy now It is delightful to see you settled in this beautiful home he said Isn t it beautiful she answered You ought to be very happy Why should I not be happy with a little laugh Why indeed A home like a nest and a husband that worships you She laughed again because she could not speak Speech was thin gauze laughter was rolling smoke so she laughed and laughed What a fine hearty creature he is said Philip Isn t he said Kate Education and intellect don t always go together Any wife might love such a husband said Kate So simple so natural so unsuspicious But that was coming to quarters too close so they fell back on silence The silence was awful the power of it was pitiless If they could have spoken the poorest commonplaces the spell might have dissolved Philip thought he would rise but he could not do so Kate tried to turn away but felt herself rooted to the spot With faces aside they remained some moments where they were as if a spirit had passed between them missus Gorry came in to lay the supper and then Kate recovered herself She got back her power of laughter and laughed at everything He was not deceived She loves me still said the voice of his heart He hated himself for the thought but it haunted him with a merciless persistence He remembered the evening of the wedding day and the imploring look she gave him on going away with Pete and he returned to the idea that she had been married under the compulsion of her father Caesar the avaricious hypocrite He told himself it would be easy to kindle a new fire on the warm hearth As she laughed and he looked into her beautiful eyes and caught the nervous twitch of her mouth he felt something of the old thrill the old passion the old unconditioned love of her who loved him in spite of all and merely because she must But no Had he spent six months abroad for nothing He would be strong he would be loyal If need be he would save this woman from herself At last Kate lit a candle and said I must show you to your room She talked cheerily going upstairs On the landing she opened the door of the room above the hall and went into it and drew down the blind She was still full of good spirits said perhaps he had no night shirt so she had left out one of Pete s hoped he would find it big enough and laughed again He took the candle from her at the threshold and kissed the hand that had held it She stood a moment quivering like a colt then she bounded away there was the clash of a door somewhere beyond and Kate was in her own room kneeling before the bed with her face buried in the counterpane to stifle the sobs that might break through the walls Under all her lightness in spite of all her laughter the old tormenting thought had been with her still Should she tell him Could he understand Would he believe If he realised the gravity of the awful position in which she was soon to be placed would he make an effort to extricate her And if he did not would not could not should not she hate him for ever after Then the old simple love the pure passion came hack upon her at the sight of his face at the touch of his hand at the sound of his voice Oh for what might have been what might have been Pete s Nickey came into harbour with the morning tide and the three breakfasted together As Kate moved heavily in front of the fire Pete crowed cooed and scattered wise winks round the table More milk mammy he whimpered and then he imitated all kinds of baby prattle After breakfast the men smoked and Kate took up her sewing She was occupying herself with the little labours so pretty so full of delicate humour and delicious joy which usually open a new avenue for a woman s tenderness Philip s eyes fell on her and she dropped below into her lap the tiny piece of white linen she was working on Pete saw this stole to the back of her chair reached over her shoulder snatched the white thing out of her fingers held it outstretched in his ponderous hands and roared like a smithy bellows It was a baby s shirt Never mind darling he coaxed as the colour leapt to Kate s face Philip must be a sort of a father to the boy some day a godfather anyway so he won t mind seeing his lil shiff We must be calling him Philip too What do you say Kirry Philip is it agreed VII As her time drew near the conviction deepened upon her that she could not be confined in her husband s house Being there at such a crisis was like living in a volcanic land One false step one passionate impulse and the very earth under her feet would split I must go home for awhile Pete she said Coorse you must said Pete Nobody like the ould angel when a girl s that way Pete took her back to her mother s in the gig driving very slowly and lifting her up and down as tenderly as if she had been a child She breathed freely when she left Elm Cottage but when she was settled in her own bedroom at The Manx Fairy she realised that she had only stepped from misery to misery So many memories lived like ghosts there memories of innocent slumbers and of gleeful awakenings amid the twittering of birds and the rattling of gravel The old familiar place the little room with the poor little window looking out on the orchard the poor little bed with its pink curtains like a tent the sweet old blankets the wash basin the press the blind with the same old pattern the sheepskin rug underfoot the whitewashed scraas overhead everything the same but O God how different Let me look at myself in the glass Nancy she said and Nancy gave her the handglass which had been cracked the morning after the Melliah She pushed it away peevishly What s the use of a thing like that she said Pete haunted the house day and night There was no bed for him there and he was supposed to go home to sleep But he wandered away in the darkness over the Curragh to the shore and in the grey of morning he was at the door again bringing the cold breath of the dawn into the house with the long whisper round the door ajar How s she going on now The women bundled him out bodily and then he hung about the roads like a dog disowned If he heard a sigh from the dairy loft he sat down against the gable and groaned Grannie tried to comfort him Don t be taking on so boy It ll be all joy soon said she and you ll be having the child to shew for it But Pete was bitter and rebellious Who s wanting the child anyway said he It s only herself I m wanting and she s laving me O Lord she s laving me God forgive me he muttered O good God forgive me he groaned It isn t fair though Lord knows it isn t fair he mumbled hoarsely At last Nancy Joe came out and took him in hand in earnest Look here Pete she said If you re wanting to kill the woman and middling quick too you ll go on the way you re going But if you don t you ll be taking to the road and you won t be coming back till you re wanted This settled Pete s restlessness The fishing had begun early that season and he went off for a night to the herrings Kate waited long and the women watched her with trembling It s a week or two early said one The weather s warm said another The boghee millish She s a bit soon said Grannie There was less of fear in Kate s own feelings Do women often die she asked The proportion is small said the doctor Half an hour afterwards she spoke again Does the child sometimes die Well I ve known it to happen but only when the mother has had a shock lost her husband for example She lay tossing on the bed wishing for her own death hoping for the death of the unborn child dreading its coming lest she should hate and loathe it At last came the child s first cry that cry out of silence that had never broken on the air before but was henceforth to be one of the world s voices for laughter and for weeping for joy and for sorrow to her who had borne it into life Then she called to them to show her the baby and when they did so bringing it up with soft cooings and foolish words she searched the little wrinkled face with a frightened look then put up her arms to shut out the sight and cried Take it away and turned to the wall Her vague fear was a certainty now the child was the child of her sin she was a bad woman Yet there is no shame no fear no horror but the pleading of a new born babe can drown its clamour The child cried again and the cruel battle of love and dread was won for motherhood The mother heart awoke and swelled She had got her baby at all events It was all she had for all she had suffered but it was enough and a dear and precious prize Are you sure it is well she asked Quite quite well Doesn t its little face look as if its mammy had been crying no Deed no said Grannie but as bonny a baby as ever was born The women were scurrying up and down giggling on the landings laughing on the stairs and saying hush at their own noises as they crept into the room In a fretful whimper the child was still crying and Grannie was telling it with many wags of the head and in a mighty stern voice that they were going to have none of its complaining now that it had come at last and Kate Herself with hands clasped together was saying in a soft murmur like a prayer God is very good and the doctor is good too God is good to give us doctors Lie quiet and I ll come back in an hour or two said doctor Mylechreest from half way through the door Dear heart alive what will the father say cried Grannie and then the whole place broke into that smile of surprise which comes to every house after the twin angels of Life and Death have brooded long over its roof tree and are gone at length before the face of a little child VIII When Pete came up to the quay in the raw sunshine of early morning John the Clerk mounted on a barrel was selling by auction the night s take of the boats I ve news for you mister Quilliam he cried as Pete s boat with half sail set dropped down the harbour Pete brought to leapt ashore and went up to where John at the end of the jetty surrounded by a crowd of buyers in little spring carts was taking bids for the fish One moment captain n he cried across his outstretched arm at the end whereof was a herring with gills still opening and closing Ten maise of this sort for the last lot well fed alive and kicking how much for them Five shillings Thank you and three Five and three It s in it yet boys only five and three and six thank you It ll do no harm at five and six six shillings All done at six and six All done at six and six Seven shillings shouted somebody with a voice like a foghorn They re Annie the Cadger s said John dropping to the ground And now captain n Quilliam we ll go and wet the youngster s head Pete went up to Sulby like an avalanche shouting his greetings to everybody on the way But when he got near to the Fairy he wiped his steaming forehead and held his panting breath and pretended not to have heard the news How s the poor girl now he said in a meek voice trying to look powerfully miserable and playing his part splendidly for thirty seconds Then the women made eyes at each other and looked wondrous knowing and nodded sideways at Pete and clucked and chuckled saying Look at him he doesn t know anything does he Coorse not woman these men creatures are no use for nothing Out of a man s way cried Pete with a roar and he made a rush for the stairs Nancy blocked him at the foot of them with both hands on his shoulders You ll be quiet then she whispered You were always a rasonable man Pete and she s wonderful wake promise you ll be quiet TO be like a mouse said Pete and he whipped off his long sea boots and crept on tiptoe into the room There she lay with the morning light on her and a face as white as the quilt that she was plucking with her long fingers Thank God for a living mother and a living child said Pete in a broken gurgle and then he drew down the bedclothes a very little and there too was the child on the pillow of her other arm Then do what he would to be quiet he could not help but make a shout He s there Yes he is He is though Joy Joy The women were down on him like a flock of geese Out of this sir if you can t behave better Excuse me ladies said Pete humbly I m not in the habit of babies A bit excited you see Mistress Nancy ma am Couldn t help putting a bull of a roar out not being used of the like Then turning back to the bed Aw Kitty the beauty it is though And the big As big as my fist already And the fat It s as fat as a bluebottle And the straight Well not so very straight neither but the complexion at him now Give him to me Kitty I give him to me the young rascal Let me have a hould of him anyway Him indeed Listen to the man said Nancy It s a girl Pete said Grannie lifting the child out of the bed A girl is it said Pete doubtfully Well he said with a wag of the head thank God for a girl Then with another and more resolute wag Yes thank God for a living mother and a living child if it is a girl and he stretched out his arms to take the baby Aisy now Pete aisy said Grannie holding it out to him Is it aisy broke they are Grannie said Pete A good spirit looked out of his great boyish face Come to your ould daddie you lil sandpiper Gough bless me Kitty the weight of him though This child s a quarter of a hundred if he s an ounce He is I ll go bail he is Look at him Guy heng Grannie did ye ever see the like now It s absolute perfection Kitty I couldn t have had a better one if I d chiced it Where s that Tom Hommy now The bleating little billygoat he was bragging outrageous about his new baby saying he wouldn t part with it for two of the best cows in his cow house This ll floor him I m thinking What s that you re saying Mistress Nancy ma am No good for nothing am I You were right Grannie It ll be all joy soon you were saying and haven t we the child to show for it I put on my stocking inside out on Monday ma am I m in luck says I and so I was Look at that now He s shaking his lil fist at his father He is though This child knows me Aw you re clever Nancy but no nonsense at all Mistress Nancy ma am Nothing will persuade me but this child knows me Do you hear the man said Nancy He and he and he and he It s a girl I m telling you a girl a girl a girl Well well a girl then a girl we ll make it said Pete with determined resignation He s deceaved said Grannie It was a boy he was wanting poor fellow But Pete scoffed at the idea A boy Never No no a girl for your life I m all for girls myself eh Kitty Always was and now I ve got two of them The child began to cry and Grannie took it back and rocked it face downwards across her knees Goodness me the voice at him said Pete It s a skipper he s born for a harbour master anyway The child slept and Grannie put it on the pillow turned lengthwise at Kate s side Quiet as a Jenny Wren now said Pete Look at the bogh smiling in his sleep Just like a baby mermaid on the egg of a dogfish But where s the ould man at all Has he seen it We must have it in the papers The Times Yes and the Tiser too The beloved wife of mister captain n Peter Quilliam of a boy a girl I mane Aw the wonder there ll be all the island over everybody getting to know Newspapers are like women ter ble bad for keeping sacrets What ll Philip say But haven t you a toothful of anything Grannie Gin for the ladies Nancy Goodness me the house is handy What time was it Wait don t tell me It was five o clock this morning wasn t it Yes Gough bless me I knew it High water to the very minute aw he ll rise in the world and die at the top of the tide How did I know when the child was born ma am As aisy as aisy We were lying adrift of Cronk ny Irrey Lhaa looking up for daylight by the fisherman s clock Only light enough to see the black of your nail ma am All at once I heard a baby s cry on the waters It s the nameless child of Earey Cushin sings out one of the boys Up with the clout says I And when we were hauling the nets and down on our knees saying a bit of a prayer as usual God bless my new born child says I and God bless my child s mother too I says and God love and protect them always and keep and presarve myself as well There was a low moaning from the bed Air Give me air Open the door Kate gasped The room is getting too hot for her said Grannie Come there s one too many of us here said Nancy Out of it and she swept Pete from the bedroom with her apron as if he had been a drove of ducks Pete glanced backward from the door and a cloak that was hanging on the inside of it brushed his face God bless her he said in a low tone God bless and reward her for going through this for me Then he touched the cloak with his lips and disappeared A moment later his curly black poll came stealing round the door jamb half way down like the head of a big boy Nancy in a whisper put the tongs over the cradle it s a pity to tempt the fairies And Grannie I wouldn t lave it alone to go out to the cow house the lil people are shocking bad for changing Kate with her face to the wall listened to him with an aching heart As Pete went down the doctor returned She s hardly so well said the doctor Better not let her nurse the child Bring it up by hand It will be best for both So it was arranged that Nancy should be made nurse and go to Elm Cottage and that missus Gorry should come in her place to Sulby Throughout four and twenty hours thereafter Kate tried her utmost to shut her heart to the child At the end of that time being left some minutes alone with the little one she was heard singing to it in a sweet low tone Nancy paused with the long brush in her hand in the kitchen and Granny stopped at her knitting in the bar That s something like now said Nancy Poor thing poor Kirry What wonder if she was a bit out of her head the bogh and her not well since her wedding They crept upstairs together at the unaccustomed sounds and found Pete whom they had missed outside the bedroom door half doubled up and holding his breath to listen Hush said he less with his tongue than with his mouth which he pursed out to represent the sound Then he whispered She s filling all the room with music Listen It s as good as fairy music in Glentrammon And it s the little fairy itself that s ticing it out of her Next day Philip came and nothing would serve for Pete but that he should go up to see the child It s only Phil he said through the doorway dragging Philip into Kate s room after him for the familiarity that a great joy permits breaks down conventions Kate did not look up and Philip tried to escape He s got good news for himself too said Pete They re to be making him Dempster a month to morrow Then Kate lifted her eyes to Philip s face and all the glory of success withered under her gaze He stumbled downstairs and hurried away There was the old persistent thought She loves me still but it was working now in the presence of the child with how great a difference When he looked at the little downy face a new feeling took possession of him Her child hers that might have been his also Had his bargain been worth having Was any promotion in the world to be set against one throb of Pete s simple joy one gleam of the auroral radiance that lights up a poor man s home when he is first a father one moment of divine partnership in the babe that is fresh from God Three weeks later Pete took his wife home in Caesar s gig Everything was the same as when he brought her save that within the shawls with which she was wrapped about the child now lay with its pink eyelids to the sky and its fiat white bottle against her breast It was a beautiful spring morning and the young sunlight was on the sallies of the Curragh and the gold of the roadside gorse Pete was as silly as a boy and he chirped and croaked all the way home like every bird and beast of heaven and earth When they got to Elm Cottage he lifted his wife down as tenderly as if she had been the babe she had in her arms He was strong and she was light and he half helped half carried her to the porch door Nancy was there to take the child out of her hands and as she did so Pete back at the horse s head cried That s the last bit of furniture the house was waiting for Nancy What s a house without a child Just a room without a clock Clock indeed said Nancy clocks are stopping but this one s for going like a mill Don t be tempting the Nightman Nancy cried Pete but he was full of childlike delight Kate stepped inside The fire burned in the hall parlour the fire irons shone like glass there were sprigs of fuchsia bud in the ornaments on the chimneypiece everything was warm and cheerful and homelike She sat down without taking off her hat Why can t I be quiet and happy she thought Why can t I make myself love him and forget But she was like one who traversed a desert under the sea a vast submerged Sahara Over her head was all her life with all her love and all her happiness and the things around her were only the ghostly shadows cast by them IX The more Kate realised that she was in the position of a bad woman the more she struggled to be a good one She flew to religion as a refuge There was no belief in her religion no faith no creed no mystical transports but only fear and shame and contrition It was fervent enough nevertheless On Sunday morning she went to The Christians on Sunday afternoon to church on Sunday evening to the Wesleyan chapel and on Wednesday night to the mission house of the Primitives Her catholicity did not please her father He looked into her quivering face and asked if she had broken any commandment in secret She turned pale and answered No Pete followed her wherever she went and seeing this some of the baser sort among the religious people began to follow him They abused each other badly in their efforts to lay hold of his money bags You ll never go over to yonder lot said one They re holding to election a soul destroying doctrine A respectable man can t join himself to Cowley s gang said another They re denying original sin and aren t a ha p orth better than infidels Pete took the measure of them all down to the watch pockets of their waistcoats You remind me said he when you re a gate on your doctrines of the Kaffirs out at Kimberley If one of them found an ould hat in the compound that some white man had thrown away they d light a camp fire after dark and hould a reg lar Tynwald Coort on it There they d be squatting round on their haunches with nothing to be seen of them but their eyes and their teeth and there d be as many questions as the Catechism Who found it says one Where did he find it says another If he hadn t found it who else would have found it That s how they d be going till two in the morning and the fire dead out and the lot of them squealing away same as monkeys in the dark And all about an ould hat with a hole in it not worth a ha penny piece Blasphemy they cried But still and for all you give to the widow and lend to the Lord you practise the religion you don t believe in Cap n Quilliam There s a pair of us then said Pete for you believe in the religion you don t practise But Caesar got Pete at last in spite of his scepticism The time came for the annual camp meeting Kate went off to it and Pete followed like a big dog at her heels The company assembled at Sulby Bridge and marched through the village to a revival chorus They stopped at a field of Caesar s in the glen it was last year s Melliah field and Caesar mounted a cart which had been left there to serve as a pulpit Then they sang again and breaking up into many companies went off into little circles that were like gorse rings on the mountains After that they reassembled to the strains of another chorus and gathered afresh about the cart for Caesar s sermon It dealt with the duty of sinless perfection There were evil men and happy sinners in the island these days who were telling them it was not good to be faultless in this life because virtue begot pride and pride was a deadly sin There were others who were saying that because a man must repent in order to be saved to repent he had to sin Doctrines of the devil don t listen to them Could a man in the household of faith live one second without committing sin Of course he could One minute Certainly One hour No doubt of it Then if a man could live one hour without sin he could live one day one week one month one year nay a whole lifetime In getting thus far Caesar had worked himself into a perspiration and he took off his coat hung it over the cartwheel and went on in his shirt sleeves Let them make no excuses for backsliders It was a trick of the devil to deal with you and forget to pay strap the price It was an old rule and a good one that if any were guilty of the sins of the flesh they should be openly punished in this world that their sins might not be counted against them in the day of the Lord Caesar threw off his waistcoat and finished with a passionate exhortation calling upon his hearers to deliver themselves of secret sins If oratory is to be judged of by its effects Caesar s sermon was a great oration It began amid the silence of his own followers and the tschts and pshaws of a little group of his enemies who lounged on the outside of the crowd to cast ridicule on the swaddler and the publican preacher But it ended amid loud exclamations of praise and supplications from all his hearers sighing and groaning and the bodily clutching of one another by the arm in paroxysms of fear and rapture When Caesar s voice died down like a wave of the sea somebody leapt up from the grass to pray And before the first prayer had ended a second was begun Meantime the penitents had begun to move inward through the throng and they fell weeping and moaning on their knees about the cart Kate was among them and when she took her place Pete still held by her side A strong shuddering passed over her shoulders and her wet eyes were on the grass Pete took her hand and feeling how it trembled his own eyes also filled Above their heads Caesar was towering with fiery eyes and face aflame In a momentary pause between two prayers he tossed his voice up in a hymn The people joined him at the second bar and then the wailing of the penitents was drowned in a general shout of the revival tune If some poor wandering child of Thine Have spurned to day the voice divine Now Lord the gracious work begin Let him no more lie down in sin Kate sobbed aloud poor vessel of human passions tossed about tormented by the fire that was consuming her As the penitents grew calmer they rose one by one to give their experience of Satan and salvation At length Caesar seized his opportunity and said And now Brother Quilliam will give us his experience Pete rose from Kate s side with tearful eyes amid a babel of jubilation most of it facetious Be of good cheer Peter be not afraid I ve not much to tell said Pete only a story of backsliding Before I earned enough to carry me up country I worked a month at Cape Town with the boats My master was a pious old Dutchman getting the name of Jan One Saturday night a big ship lost her anchor outside and on Sunday morning forty pounds was offered for finding it All the boatmen went out except Jan Six days shalt thou labour says he but the seventh is the Sabbath Pete s address was here punctuated by loud cries of thanksgiving All day long he was seeing the boats beating up the bay so to keep out of temptation he was going up to the bedroom and pulling the blind and getting down on his knees and wrastling like mad And something out of heaven was saying to him It s the Lord s day Jannie they ll not get a ha p orth Neither did they but when Jan s watch said twelve o clock midnight the pair of us were going off like rockets Well we hadn t been ten minutes on the water before our grapplings had hould of that anchor There were loud cries of Glory Jan was shouting The Lord has put us atop of it as straight as the lid of a taypot Great cries of Hallelujah But when we came ashore we found Jan s watch was twenty minutes fast and that was the end of the ould man s religion That day the word went round that both Pete and Kate had been converted Their names were entered in Class and they received their quarterly tickets X Next morning Kate set out to church for her churching Her household duties had lost their interest by this time and she left Nancy to cook the dinner Pete had volunteered to take charge of the child This he began to do by establishing himself with his pipe in an armchair by the cradle and looking steadfastly down into it until the little one awoke Then he rocked it rummaged his memory for a nursery song to quiet it and smoked and sang together A frog he would a wooing go Kitty alone Kitty alone Puff puff A wonderful likely sort of a beau Kitty alone and I Puff puff puff The sun was shining in at the doorway and a man s shadow fell across the cradle head It was Philip Pete put his mouth out into the form of an unspoken Hush and Philip sat down in silence while Pete went on with his smoke and his song But when her husband rat came home Kitty alone Kitty alone Pray who s been here since I ve been gone Kitty alone and I Puff Puff Pete had got to the middle of the verse about the worthy gentleman when the low whine in the cradle lengthened to a long breath and stopped Gone off at last God bless it said Pete And how s yourself Philip And how goes the petition With his head on his hand Philip was gazing absently into the fire and he did not hear How goes the petition said Pete It was that I came to speak of said Philip Sorry to say it has had no effect but a bad one It has only drawn attention to the fact that Manx fishermen pay no harbour dues And right too said Pete The harbours are our fathers harbours and were freed to us forty years ago Nevertheless said Philip the dues are to be demanded The Governor has issued an order Then we ll rise against it every fisherman in the island said Pete And when they re making you Dempster you ll back us up in the Tynwald Coort Take care Pete take care said Philip Then Kate came in from church and Pete welcomed her with a shout Philip rose and bowed in silence The marks of the prayers of the week were on her face but they had brought her no comfort She had been constantly promising herself consolation from religion but every fresh exercise of devotion had seemed to tear open the wound from which she bled to death She removed her cloak and stepped to the cradle The child was sleeping peacefully but she convinced herself that it must be unwell Her own hands were cold and moist and when she touched the child she thought its skin was clammy Presently her hands became hot and dry and when she touched the child again she thought its forehead was feverish I m sure she s ill she said Chut love said Pete no more ill than I am But to calm her fears he went off for the doctor The doctor was away in the country and was not likely to be back for hours Kate s fears increased Every time she looked at the child she applied to it the symptoms of her own condition My child is dying I m sure it is she cried Nonsense darling said Pete Only an hour ago it was looking up as imperent as a tomtit At last a new terror seized her and she cried My child is dying unbaptized Well we ll soon mend that love said Pete I ll be going off for the parson And he caught up his hat and went out He called on Parson Quiggin who promised to follow immediately Then he went on to Sulby to fetch Caesar and Grannie and some others having no fear for the child s life but some hope of banishing Kate s melancholy by the merriment of a christening feast Meanwhile Philip and Kate were alone with the little one save in the intervals of Nancy s coming and going between the hall and the kitchen She was restless and full of expectation starting at every sound and every step He could see that she had gone whole nights without sleep and was passing through an existence that was burning itself away Do what he would to explain her sufferings as the common results of childbirth he could not help resolving them in the old flattering solution She was paying the penalty of having married the wrong man And she was to blame Whatever the compulsion put upon her she ought to have withstood it There was no situation in life from which it was not possible to escape Had he not found a way out of a situation essentially the same Thus a certain high pride in his own conduct took possession of him even in the presence of Kate s pain But his tenderness fought with his self righteousness He looked at her piteous face and his strength almost ebbed away She looked up into his eyes and affectionate pity almost overwhelmed him Once or twice she seemed about to say something but she did not speak and he said little Yet it wanted all his resolution not to take her in his arms and comfort her not to mingle his tears with hers not to tell her of six months spent in vain in the effort to wipe her out of his heart not to whisper of cheerless days and of nights made desolate with the repetition of her name But no he would be stronger than that It was not yet too late to walk the path of honour He would stand no longer between husband and wife Pete came back bringing Grannie and Caesar The parson arrived soon after them Kate was sitting with the child in her lap and brooding over it like a bird above its nest The child was still sleeping the sleep of health and innocence but the mother s eyes were wild Bogh bogh said Grannie and she kissed her daughter Kate made no response Nancy Joe grew red about the eyelids and began to blow her nose Here s the prazon darling whispered Pete and Kate rose to her feet The company rose with her and stood in a half circle before the fire It was now between daylight and dark and the firelight flashed in their faces Are the godfather and godmothers present the parson asked mister Christian will stand godfather parzon and Nancy and Grannie will be godmothers Nancy took the child out of Kate s arms and the service for private baptism began with the tremendous words Dearly beloved forasmuch as all men are conceived and born in si The parson stopped Kate had staggered and almost fallen Pete put his arm around her to keep her up and then the service went on Presently the parson turned to Philip with a softening voice and an inclination of the head Dost thou in the name of this child renounce the devil and all his works the vain pomp and glory of the world with all covetous desires of the same and the carnal desires of the flesh so that thou wilt not follow nor be led by them And Philip answered in a firm low voice I renounce them all The parson took the child from Nancy Name this child Nancy looked at Kate but Kate who was breathing violently gave no sign Kate whispered Pete Kate of coorse Katherine said Nancy and in that name the child was baptized doctor Mylechreest came in as the service ended Grannie held little Katherine up to him and he controlled his face and looked at her There s not much amiss with the child he said I knew it shouted Pete But perhaps the mother is a little weak and nervous he added quietly Coorse she is the bogh cried Pete Let her see more company said the doctor She shall said Pete If that doesn t do send her away for awhile I will Fresh scenes fresh society out of the island by preference I m willing She ll come back another woman I ll put up with the same one said Pete and while the company laughed he flung open the door and cried Come in and half a dozen men who had been waiting outside trooped into the hall They entered with shy looks because of the presence of great people Now for a pull of jough Nancy cried Pete Not too much excitement either said the doctor and with that warning he departed The parson went with him Philip had slipped out first unawares to anybody Grannie carried little Katherine to the kitchen and bathed her before the fire Kate was propped up with pillows in the armchair in the corner Then Nancy brought the ale and Pete welcomed it with a shout Caesar looked alarmed and rose to go The drink s your own sir said Pete stop and taste it But Caesar couldn t stay it would scarcely be proper You don t christen your first granddaughter every day said Pete Enjoy yourself while you re alive sir you ll be a long time dead Caesar disappeared but the rest of the company took Pete s counsel and began to make themselves comfortable The last christening I was at was yesterday said John the Clerk It was Christian Killip s little one before she was married and it took the water same as any other child The last christening I was at was my own said Black Tom when I was made an in inheriter but I ve never inherited yet That s truth enough said an asthmatic voice from the backstairs Well the last christening I was at was at Kimberley said Pete and I was the parzon myself that day Yes though Parzon Pete And godfather and godmother as well and the baby was Peter Quilliam too Aw it was no laughing matter at all There s always a truck of women about a compound hanging on to the boys like burrs Dirty little trousses of a rule but human creatures for all One of them had a child by somebody and then she came to die and couldn t take rest because it hadn t been christened There wasn t a pazon for fifty miles anywhere and it was night time too and the woman was stretched by the camp fire and sinking What s to be done says the men I ll do it says I and I did One of the fellows got a breakfast can of water out of the river and I dipped my hand in it What s the name says I but the poor soul was too far gone for spaking So I gave the child my own name though I didn t know the mother from Noah s aunt and the big chaps standing round bareheaded began to blubber like babies I baptize thee Peter Quilliam in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost Amen Then the girl died happy and aisy and what for shouldn t she The words were the same and the water was the same and if the hand wasn t as clane as usual maybe Him that s above wouldn t bother about the diff rance Kate got up with a flush on her cheeks The room had become too close Pete helped her into the parlour where a bright fire was burning then propped and wrapped her up afresh and at her own entreaty returned to his guests The company had increased by this time and there were women and girls among them They went on to sing and to playt and at last to dance Kate heard them Through the closed door between the hall and the parlour their merriment came to her At intervals Pete put in his head brimming over with laughter and cried in a loud whisper Did you hear that Kate It s rich At length Philip came too with his hat in one hand and a cardboard box in the other The godfather s present to little Katherine he said Kate opened the lid and drew out a child s hood in scarlet plush You are very good she said vacantly Don t let us talk of goodness he answered and he turned to go Wait she faltered I have something to say to you Shut the door XI Philip turned pale What is it he asked She tried to speak but at first she could not Are you unhappy Kate he faltered Can t you see she answered He sat down by the fire and leaned his face on his hands Yes we have both suffered he said in a low tone Why did you let me marry him Philip raised his head How could I have hindered you How Do you ask me how She spoke with some bitterness but he answered quietly I tried Kate but I could do nothing You seemed determined Do what I would to prevent to delay to stop your marriage altogether the more you hastened and hurried it Then I thought to myself Well perhaps it is best She is trying to forget and forgive and begin again What right have I to stand in her way Haven t I wronged her enough already A good man offers her his love and she is taking it Let her do so if she can God help her I may suffer but I am nothing to her now Let me go my way She put her arms on the table and hid her face in them Oh I cannot bear it she said He rose to his feet slowly If it is my presence here that hurts you Kate I will go away It has been but a painful pleasure to come and I have been forced to take it You will acquit me of coming of my own choice Kate But I will not torment you I will go away and never come again She lifted her face and said in a passionate whisper Take me with you He shook his head That s impossible Kate You are married now Your husband loves you dearly He is a better man than I am a thousand thousand times Do you think I don t know what he is she cried throwing herself back That s why I can t live with him It s killing me I tell you I can t bear it she cried rising to her feet Love me Haven t I tried to make myself love him Haven t I tried to be a good wife I can t I can t He never speaks but he torments me Nothing can happen but it cuts me through and through I can t live in this house The walls are crushing me the ceiling is falling on me the air is stifling me I tell you I shall die if you do not take me out of it Take me Philip take me take me She caught him by the arm imploringly but he only dropped his head down between both hands saying in a deep thick voice Hush Kate hush I cannot and I will not You are mad to think of it Then she sank down into the chair again breathless and inert and sobbing deep low sobs The sound of dancing came from the hall with cries of Hooch and the voice of Pete shouting Hit the floor with heel and toe Till heaven help the boords below Yes I am mad or soon will be she said in a hard way I thought of that this morning when I crossed the river coming home from church It would soon be over there I thought No more trouble no more dreams no more waking in the night to hear the breathing of the one beside me and the voice out of the darkness crying Kate what are you saying interrupted Philip Oh you needn t think I m a bad woman because I ask you take me away from my husband If I were that I could brazen it out perhaps and live on here and pretend to forget many a woman does they say And I m not afraid that he will ever find me out either I have only to close my lips and he will never know But I shall know Philip Christian she said with a defiant look into his eyes as he raised them Her reproaches hurt him less than her piteous entreaties and in a moment she was sobbing again Oh what can God do but let me die I thought He would when the child came but He did not and then am I a wicked woman after all I prayed that He would take my innocent baby anyway But she dashed the tears away in anger at her weakness and said I m not a bad woman Philip Christian and that s why I won t live here any longer There is something you have never guessed and I have never told you but I must tell you now for I can keep my secret no longer He raised his head with a noise in his ears that was like the flapping of wings in the dark Your secret Kate How happy I was she said Perhaps I was to blame I loved you so and was so fearful of losing you Perhaps you thought of all that had passed between us as something that would go back and back as time went on and on But it has been coming the other way ever since Yes and as long as I live and as long as the child lives Her voice quivered like the string of a bow and stopped He rose to his feet The child Kate Did you say the child She did not answer at once and then she muttered with her head down Didn t I tell you there was something you had never guessed And is it that he said in a fearful whisper Yes You are sure You are not deceiving yourself This is not hysteria No You mean that the child Yes His questions had come in gasps like short breakers out of a rising sea her answers had fallen like the minute gun above it Then in the silence Pete s voice came through the wall He was singing a rough old ditty It was to Covent Gardens I chanced for to go To see some of the prettiest flowers which in the gardens grow Nancy came in with a scuttle of coals The lil one s asleep she said going down on her knees at the fire She had left the door ajar and Pete s song was rolling into the room The first was lovely Nancy so delicate and fair The other was a vargin and she did laurels wear Grannie bathed her and she s like a lil angel in the cot there said Nancy And Dear heart alive Grannie says I the straight she s like her father when she s sleeping Nancy brushed the hearth and went off As she closed the door Pete s voice ebbed out Philip s lips trembled his eyes wandered over the floor he grew very pale he tried to speak and could not All his self pride was overthrown in a moment The honour in which he had tried to stand erect as in a suit of armour was stripped away Unwittingly he had been laying up an account with Nature He had forgotten that a sin has consequences Nature did not forget She had kept her own reckoning He had struggled to believe that after all he was a moral man a free man but Nature was a sterner moralist she had chained him to the past she had held him to himself He was still by the fire with his head down Did you know this before you were married to Pete he asked without looking up Hadn t I wronged him enough without that she answered But did you think of it as something that might perhaps occur And if I did what then If you had told me Kate nothing and nobody should have come between us no he said in a decisive voice not Pete nor all the world And wasn t it your own duty to remember Was it for me to come to you and say Philip something may happen I am frightened Was this the compulsion that had driven her into marriage with the wrong man Was it all hysteria Could she be sure In any case she could not think this awful thought and continue to live with her husband You are right he said with his head still down You cannot live here any longer This life of deception must end Then you will take me away Philip I must God forgive me I must I thought it would be sin But that was long ago It will be punishment If I had known before and I have been coming here time and again looking on his happiness but if I had once dreamt and then only an hour ago the oath at its baptism O God Her tears were flowing again but a sort of serenity had fallen on her now Forgive me she whispered I tried to keep it to myself You could not keep it you ought never to have kept it so long the finger of God Himself ought to have burnt it out of you He spoke harshly and she felt pain but there was a secret joy as well I am ruining you Philip she said leaning over him We are both drifting to ruin Katherine he answered hoarsely He was an abandoned hulk with anchorage gone and no hand at the helm broken blind rolling to destruction I can offer you nothing Kate nothing but a hidden life a life in the dark If you come to me you will leave a husband who worships you for one to whom your life can never be joined You will exchange a life of respect by the side of a good man for a life of humiliation a life of shame How can it be otherwise now It is too late too late Don t think of that Philip If you love me there can be no humiliation and no shame for me in anything I love you dear I cannot help but love you Only love me a little Philip just a little dearest and I will never care no I will never never care whatever happens Her passionate devotion swept down all his scruples His throat thickened his eyes grew dim She put one arm tenderly on his shoulder I will follow you wherever you must go she said You are my real husband Philip and always have been We will love one another and that will make up for everything There is nothing I will not do to make you forget If you must go away far away no matter where I will go with you and the child as well and if we must be poor I ll work with you But he did not seem to hear her as he crouched with buried face by the fire And in the silence Pete s muffled voice came again through the wall singing his rugged ditty I m not engaged to any young man I solemnly do swear For I mane to be a vargin and still the laurels wear Unconsciously their hands touched and their fingers intertwined It will break his heart he muttered She only grasped his hand the closer and crouched beside him They were like two guilty souls at the altar steps listening to the cheerful bell that swings in the tower for the happy world outside The door opened with a bang and Pete rolled in heaving with laughter Did you think it was an earth wake Philip he shouted or a blackbird a bit tipsy eh Bless me man it s good of you though sitting up in the chimney there same as a good ould jackdaw keeping the poor wife company when her selfish ould husband is flirting his tail like a stonechat The company s going now Kitty Will they say good night to you No Have it as you like bogh You re looking tired anyway Dempster the boys are asking when the ceremony is coming off and will you come home to Ramsey that night But sakes alive man your eye is splashed with blood as bad as the egg of a robin In his suffering and degradation Philip felt as if he wished the earth to open and swallow him Bloodshot is it he said It s nothing The ceremony I m to take the oath to morrow at three o clock at the Special Council in Douglas Yes I ll come back to Ballure for the night Driving eh Yes Six o clock maybe Perhaps seven to eight That s all right Mortal inquisitive the boys are though It s in the breed of these Manx ones you know Laxey way now I ll drive by saint John s said Philip With a look of wondrous wisdom and a knowing wink at Kate across Philip s back Pete went out Then there was much talking in low tones in the hall and on the paths outside the house Philip understood what it meant He glanced back at the door leaned over to Kate and said in a whisper without looking into her eyes The carriage shall come at half past seven It will stand for a moment in the Parsonage Lane and then drive back to Douglas by way of Laxey His face was broken and ugly with shame and humiliation As she saw this she thought of her confession and it seemed odious to her now but there was an immense relief in the feeling that the crisis was over Pete was shouting at the porch Good night all Goodnight Good night came back in many voices Grannie came in muffled up to the throat However am I to get back to Sulby and your father gone these two hours she said Not him said Pete coming behind with one eye screwed up and a finger to his nose The ould man s been on the back stairs all night listening and watching wonderful His bark s tremenjous but his bite isn t worth mentioning And then a plaintive voice came from the hall saying Are you never coming home mother I m worn out waiting for you A little patch of youth had blossomed in Grannie since the baby came Good night Pete she cried from the gate and many happy returns of the christening day One was enough for yourself mother said Caesar and then his voice went rumbling down the street Philip had come out into the hall You re time enough yet said Pete A glass first No I ve sent over to the Mitre for your mare There she is that s her foot on the path I must be seeing you off anyway Where s that lantern at all They stepped out Pete held the light while Philip mounted and then he guided him under the deep shadow of the old tree to the road Fine night for a ride Phil Listen That s the churning of the nightjar going up to Ballure glen Well good night Good night and God bless you old fellow Kate inside heard the deadened sound of Philip s Goodnight the crunch of the mare s hoofs on the gravel and the clink of the bit in her teeth Then the porch door closed with a hollow vibration like that of a vault the chain rattled across it and Pete was back in the room What a night we ve had of it And now to bed XII Kate was up early the next morning but Pete was stirring before her As soon as he had heard the news of Philip s appointment he had organised a drum and brass band to honour the day of the ceremony The brass had been borrowed from Laxey but the drum had been bought by Pete Let s have a good sizable drum said he something with a voice in it not a bit of a toot going off with a pop like bladder wrack The parchment was three feet across the steel rings round it were like the hoops of a dog cart and the black drumsticks according to Pete were like the bullet heads of two niggers Jonaique Jelly played the clarionet and John the Widow played the trombone but the drum was the leading instrument Pete himself played it He pounded it boomed it thundered it While he did so his eyes blazed with rapture A big heroic soul spoke out of the drum for Pete With the strap over his shoulders he did not trouble much about the tune When the heart Leapt inside his breast down came the nigger heads on to the mighty protuberance in front of it and surely that was the end and aim of all music The band practised in the cabin which Pete had set up for a summer house in the middle of his garden They met at daybreak that morning for the last of their rehearsals And being up before their morning meal they were constrained to smoke and drink as well as play This they did out of a single pipe and a single pot which each took up from the table in turn as it fell to his part to have a few bars rest While their muffled melody came to the house through the wooden walls and the dense smoke Kate was cooking breakfast She did everything carefully for she was calmer than usual and felt relieved of the load that had oppressed her But once she leaned her head on the mantelshelf while stooping over the frying pan and looked vacantly into the fire and once she raised herself up from the table cloth at the sound of the drum and pressed her hand hard on her brow The child awoke in the bedroom above and cried Nancy Joe went flip flapping upstairs and brought her down with much clucking and cackling Kate took the child and fed her from a feeding bottle which had been warming on the oven top She was very tender with the little one kissing all its extremities in the way that women have worrying its legs and putting its feet into her mouth Pete came in hot and perspiring and Kate handed the child back to Nancy Hould hard cried Pete don t take her off yet Give me a hould of her the lil rogue My sailor What a child it is though Look at that now She s got a grip of my thumb What a fist to be sure It s lying in my hand like a meg Did you stick a piece of dough on the wall at your last baking Nancy Just as well to keep the evil eye off Coo oo oo She s going it reg lar same as the tide of a summer s day By jing Kitty I didn t think there was so much fun in babies Kate seated at the table was pouring out the tea and a sudden impulse seized her That s the way she said First the wife is everything but the child comes and then good bye to the mother who brought it No by gough said Pete The child is eighteen carat goold for the mother s sake but the mother is di monds for sake of the child If I lost that little one Kitty it would be like losing the half of you Losing indeed said Nancy Who s talking about losing Does she look like it bless her lil heart Take her into the kitchen Nancy said Kate Going to have a rare do to day said Pete over a mouthful I m off for Douglas to see Philip made Dempster Coming home with himself by way of saint John s It s all arranged woman Boys to meet the carriage by Kirk Christ Lezayre at seven o clock smart Then out I m getting laying hould of the drum the band is striking up and we re bringing him into Ramsey triumphant Oh we ll be doing it grand said Pete blowing over the rim of his saucer John the Clerk is tremenjous on the trombones and there s no bating Jonaique with the clar net the man is music to his little backbone The town will be coming out too and the fishermen shouting like one man We re bound to let the Governor see we mane it A friend s a friend say I and we re for bucking up for the man that s bucking up for us And when he goes to the Tynwald Coort there it ll be lockjaw and the measles with some of them If the ould Governor s got a tongue like a file Philip s got a tongue like a scythe he ll mow them down No harbour dues says he till we ve a raisonable hope of harbour improvements Build your embankments for your trippers in Douglas if you like but don t ask the fisher men to pay for them Pete wiped his mouth and charged his pipe It ll be a rare ould dust but we re not thinking of ourselves only though Aw no no If there wasn t nothing doing we would be giving him a little tune for all coming home Dempster Pete lit up My sailor It ll be a proud man I ll be this day Kitty Didn t I always say it He ll be the first Manxman living says I times and times and he s not going to de ceave me neither Kate was in fear lest Pete should look up into her face Catching sight of a rent in the cloth of his coat she whipped out her needle and began to stitch it up bending closely over it What an eye a woman s got now said Pete That was the steel of the drum ragging me sideways when I was a bit excited Bless me Kitty there won t be a rag left at me when I get through this everin They re ter ble on clothes is drums He was puffing the smoke through her hair as she knelt below him Well he deserves it all My sakes the years I ve known him Him and me have been same as brothers Yes have we ever since I was a slip of a boy in jackets and we went nesting on Maughold Head together And getting married hasn t been making no difference When a man marries he shortens sail usually and pitches out some ballast but not me at all You re taking a chill Kitty No Shuddering any way Chut This dress is like paper you should be having warmer things under it Don t be going out to day darling but to night about twenty five minutes better than seven just open the door and listen We ll be agate of it then like mad and when you re hearing the drum booming you ll be saying to yourself Pete s there and going it for all he knows Oh Pete Pete cried Kate and she dropped back at his feet Why what s this at all said Pete You ve been very very good to me Pete and if I never see you again you ll think the best of me will you not She had an impulse to tell all she could hardly resist it He smoothed the black ripples of her hair back from her forehead and said tenderly She s not so well to day that s it Her eyes are bubbling like the laver Then aloud with a laugh Never see me again eh I m not willing to share you with heaven yet though But I ll have to be doing as the doctor was saying sending you to England aver I will now I will he said lifting his big finger threateningly She slid backwards to the ground but at the next moment was landed on Pete s breast My poor lil Kirry Not willing to stay with me eh Tut tut She ll be as smart as ever soon She drew away from him with shame and self reproach mingled with that old feeling of personal repulsion which she could not conquer Then the gate of the garden clicked and Ross Christian came up the path He s sticking to me as tight as a limpet said Pete mister Quilliam said Ross I come from my father this time Deed man said Pete He is a little pressed for money And mister Peter Christian sends to me He thought you might like to lend on mortgage On Ballawhaine Ross stammered and stuttered Well yes certainly as you say on Balla To think to think muttered Pete He gazed vacantly before him for a moment and then said sharply I ve no time to talk of it now sir I m off to Douglas but if you like to stop awhile and talk of it with missus Quilliam I ll be hearing everything when I come back Good day Kate Take care of my wife Good day Nancy look after my two girls while I m away And Kitty bogh whispering mind you send to Robbie Clucas the draper for some nice warm underclothing Good bye Another Just one more then aloud Good day to you sir good day XIII He the Spirit Himself may come When all the nerve of sense is numb Philip had not slept at Ballure The house was in darkness as he passed He was riding to Douglas It is sixteen miles between town and town six of them over the steep headland of Kirk Maughold Before he reached the top of the ascent he had been an hour on the road and the night was near to morning He had seen no one after leaving Ramsey except a drunken miner with his bundle on his stick marching home to a tipsy travesty of some brave song His self righteousness was overthrown his pride was in the dust Since he returned home he had struggled to feel strong and easy in the sense of being an honourable man but now he was thrown violently out of the path in which he had meant to walk rightly What he was about to do was necessary was inevitable yet in his relation to Kate he was in the position of an immoral man a betrayer an adulterer with a vulgar secret which he must support by lying and share with servants And what was the outlook What would be the end Here was a situation from which there was no escape Let there be no false glamour no disguise no self deception On the eve of his promotion to the dignities and responsibilities of a Judge he was taking the first step down on the course of the criminal The moon was shining at the full It was low down in the sky on his right and casting his shadow on to the road He walked his horse up the long hill The even pace the quiet of the night the drowsy sounds of unseen stream and far off murmuring sea overcame him in spite of himself and he dozed in the saddle As he reached the hilltop the level step of the horse awoke him and he knew that he was passing that desolate spot on the border of parish and parish which is known as Tom Alone s Opening his eyes without realising that he had slept he thought he became aware of another horse and another rider walking by his side They were on the left of him going pace for pace stepping along with him like his shadow It is my shadow he thought and he forced up his head to look Nothing was there but a whitewashed wall that fenced a sheepfold The moon had gone under the mountains on the right and the night would have been dark but for the stars With an astonishment near to terror Philip gripped the saddle with his quaking knees and broke his horse into a trot When the hard ride had brought warmth to his blood and a glow to his cheeks he told himself he had been the victim of fancy It was nothing it was a delusion of the sight a mere shadow cast off by his distempered brain He was passing at a walking pace through Laxey by this time and as the horse s feet beat up the echoes of the sleeping town his heart grew brave Next day at noon he was talking with his servant Jem y Lord in his rooms in Athol Street He had lately become tenant of the entire house They were in his old chambers on the first floor looking on to the churchyard I may rely on you Jemmy You may Deemster His voice was low and husky his eyes were down he was fumbling the papers on the table Get the carriage a landau from Shimmin s but drive it yourself Be at Government offices at four we ll go by saint John s If there is any attempt at Ramsey to take the horse out of the carriage resist it I will alight at the head of the town Then drive on to the lane between the chapel and Elm Cottage The moment the lady joins you start away Return to Laxey are the rooms upstairs ready They will be The two in front of your own and the little parlour behind this We shall need no other servants the lady will be housekeeper I quite understand Deemster Philip turned his face aside and spoke thickly And you know what name I know what name Deemster You have no objection None whatever Deemster Phillip drew a long breath I am not Deemster yet Jemmy Perhaps it might have been but God knows You are a good fellow I shall not forget it He made a motion as if to dismiss the man but Jemmy did not go Beg pardon your honor Yes Your honour has eaten nothing at breakfast and the bed wasn t slept in last night I was riding late then I had work to do But I heard your foot on the floor it woke me times I may have speeches to make to day Fetch me a glass of water Jemmy brought water bottle and glass As Philip took the water an icy numbness seemed to seize his arm I well I I declare I can t lift ah thanks The man raised Philip s arm to his mouth the glass rattled against his teeth while he drank Pardon your honour You re looking ten years older lately The sooner this day is over the better Sleep Jemmy I only want sleep I must have a long long sleep at Ballure to night He left the house at three minutes to three carrying his cloak over his arm It was a hot day at the beginning of June and when he stepped out at the door the air of the street smote his face like a blast from an open furnace He reeled and almost fell The sun s heat was like a load on his head its dazzling rays made his sight dim and he had a sound in his ears like running water As he walked down the street he caught his wandering reflection in the shop windows Jemmy was right he thought My worst enemy would not accuse me of looking too young to day There was a small crowd about the entrance to Government offices Carriages were driving up discharging their occupants and going on The Bishop the Attorney General finally the Governor with his wife and daughter passed into the house In the commotion of these arrivals Philip reached the door unobserved When he was recognised there was a sudden hush of voices and then a low buzz of gossip He walked through with a firm step going in alone all eyes upon him The doorway opens on a narrow passage which is neither wide nor very light and the sunshine without made the gloom within more grey and uncertain As Philip stepped over the threshold he was conscious that somebody was coming out When he had taken two paces more he drew up sharply with the sense of walking into a mirror At the next instant he saw that what he had taken for the reflection of his own face in a glass was the actual face of another man The man was coming out as he went in They were approaching each other At two paces more they were side by side He looked at the man with creeping horror The man looked at him with amazement and dread Thus eye to eye they crossed and passed Then each turned his head over his shoulder and looked after the other Philip stepping into the gloom the stranger striding into the light At the next moment the narrow doorway was darkened by a ponderous figure rolling through Then a heavy hand fell on Philip s shoulder and a hearty voice exclaimed Hilloa Christian proud to see you boy You ve outstripped old stick in the mud but I always knew you would lead me the way though Funking a bit are you Hands like ice anyway Come along nothing to be nervous about we re not going to give you the dose of Illiam Dhone don t martyr the Christians these days you know Is was Philip s old master the Clerk of the Rolls Taking Philip s arm he was for swinging him along but Philip still looking towards the street said falteringly Did you perhaps see a man a young man going out at the door When As you came in Was there said the Clerk dubiously then as by a sudden light Did he wear a round hat and a monkey jacket Maybe I hardly know I didn t observe That ll be the man He s been at me half the morning for admission to the Council Said he d known you all his life Bough as a thorn bush but somehow I couldn t say no to the fellow at last He ought to be inside though It s nothing thought Philip Only another shadow from a tired brain Jemmy s talk about my altered looks the reflection in the shop windows the sudden gloom after the dazzling sunlight that s all that s all Sleep I want sleep When the Governor took his seat with the first Deemster on his right and motioned Philip to the chair on his left an involuntary murmur passed over the chamber at the contrast there presented the one Deemster very old with round russet face quick gleaming eyes and a comfortable youthful even merry expression the other very young with long pallid powerful face large eyes and a tired look of age Philip presented his commission received from the Home Secretary and the oath of office was administered to him Kissing a stained copy of a leather bound Testament he repeated the words after the Governor in a thick croak that seemed to hack the air By this book and by the holy contents thereof and by the wonderful works that God hath miraculously wrought in heaven above and on the earth beneath in six days and seven nights I Philip Christian do swear that I will without respect of favour or friendship love or hate loss or gain consanguinity or affinity envy or malice execute the laws of this Isle justly betwixt our Sovereign Lady the Queen and her subjects within this Isle and betwixt party and party as indifferently as the herring backbone doth lie in the midst of the fish As Philip pronounced these words he was conscious of only one face in that assembly It was not the face of the Governor of the Bishop of any dignitary of Church or State but a rugged eager dark face over a black beard in the grip of a great brown hand with sparkling eyes parted lips and a look of boyish pride it was the face of Pete It only remains for me said the Governor to congratulate your Honour on the high office to which it has pleased Her Majesty to appoint you and to wish you long life and health to fulfil its duties with blameless credit to yourself and distinction to your country There was some other speaking and then Philip replied He spoke clearly firmly and well A reference to his grandfather provoked applause His modesty and natural manner made a strong impression His Excellency is not so far wrong after all was the common whisper Some further business and the Council broke up for general gossip Then on the pavement outside while the carriages were coming in line there were renewed congratulations invitations and warnings The Governor invited Philip to dinner He excused himself saying he had promised to dine with his aunt at Ballure The ladies warned him to spare himself and recommended a holiday and then the Clerk of the Rolls proud as a peacock strutting here and there and everywhere and assuming the airs of a guardian cried Can t yet though for he holds his first court in Ramsey tomorrow morning Put on the cloak Christian It will be cold driving Good men are scarce An open landau came up at length with Jem y Lord on the box seat and Pete walking by the horse s head smoothing its neck and tickling its ears Why you were talking of the young man Christian and behold ye here s the great fellow himself Well young chap slapping Pete on the back see your Deemster take the oath eh He s my cousin said Philip Cousin Is he then can he perhaps be Ah yes of course certainly The good man stammered and stopped remembering the marriage of Philip s father He opened the carriage door and stood aside for Philip but Philip said Step in Pete and with a shamefaced look Pete rolled into the carriage Philip took the seat beside him amid a buzz of voices from the people standing about the door Well as you like good day then boy good day said the Clerk of the Rolls clashing the door back The carriage began to move Good day your Honour cried several out of the crowd Philip raised his hat The hats of the men went up to him Some of the girls were wiping their eyes XIV While Pete and Philip were driving over the road from Douglas Kate was sitting with the child on her lap before the fire in Elm Cottage Her eyes were restless her manner agitated She looked out at the window from time to time The setting sun behind the house still held the day with horizontal shafts of light in the spring green of the transparent leaves Wouldn t you like to see the procession to night Nancy she said Aw mortal said Nancy But I won t get lave though Take care of my two girls says he You may go Nancy I ll see to baby said Kate But the man himself woman he ll be coming home as hungry as a hunter I ll see to his supper too said Kate Carry the key with you that you may let yourself in and be back at half past seven Then Nancy began to fly about the kitchen like sputter ings out of the frying pan filling the kettle lighting the lamp and getting together the baby s night clothes Kate watched her and glanced at the clock Was the town quiet when you were out for the bacon Nancy she said Quiet enough said Nancy Everybody flying off Le zayre way already except what were making for the quay Is the steamer sailing to night then Yes the Peveril but not water enough to float her till half past seven they were saying Here s the lil one s nightdress and here s her binder bless her just big enough for a bandage for a person s wrist if she sprained it churning Lay them on the fender to air Nancy I ll not undress baby yet awhile And see it s nearly seven I ll be pinning my shawl on and away like the wind said Nancy The bogh she said with the pin between her teeth She s off again Do you really think now the angels in heaven are as sweet and innocent Kirry I don t They can t if they re grown up And having to climb Jacob s ladder poor things they must be Then if they re men but that s ridiculous anyway The clock is striking Nancy No use going when everything s over said Kate and the foot with which she rocked the child went faster now that the little one was asleep Sakes alive Let me tie the strings of my bonnet woman Pity you can t come yourself Kitty But if they re worth their salt they ll be whipping round this way and giving you a lil tune anyway Have you got the key Nancy Yes and I ll be back in an hour And mind you put baby to bed soon and mind you and mind you With as many warnings as if she had been mistress and Kate the servant Nancy backed herself out of the house It was now dark outside Kate rose immediately put the child in the cradle and began to lay the table for Pete s supper the cruet the plates the teapot on the hob to warm and then by force of habit two cups and saucers But sight of the cups awakened her to painful consciousness She put one of them back in the cupboard broke the coal on the fire settled the kettle up to the blaze fixed the Dutch oven with three rashers of bacon before the bars then lit a candle and with a nervous look around turned to go upstairs In the bedroom she drew on her cloak pinned her hat and veil with trembling fingers then took her purse from her pocket and emptied its contents onto the dressing table Not mine she thought And standing before the mirror at that moment she caught sight of her earrings I must take nothing of his she told herself and she raised her hands to her ears Then her heart smote her As if Pete would ever think of such things she thought No not if I took everything he has in the world And must I be thinking of them Yet I cannot I will not take them with me She opened a drawer and hurried everything into it the money the earrings the keeper off her finger and then she paused at the touch of the wedding ring A superstitious instinct restrained her Yet the ring was the badge of her broken covenant With this ring I thee wed She tore off the wedding ring also and cast it with the rest He will find them she thought There will be nothing else to tell him what has happened He will come and I shall be gone He will call and there will be no answer He will look for me and I shall be lost to him for ever Not a word left behind Not a line to say Thank you and good bye and God bless you dear Pete for all your love and goodness to rae It was cruel very cruel yet what could she write What could she say that had not better be left unsaid The least syllable no the uncertainty would be kinder Perhaps Pete would think she was dead perhaps that she had destroyed herself Even that would not be so bitter as the truth He would get over it he would become reconciled No she thought I can write nothing I can leave no message She shut the drawer quickly and picked up the candle As she did so the shadow of herself moved about her It mounted from the floor to the wall from the wall to the ceiling When she walked it seemed to be on top of her hanging over her pressing down on her crushing her She grew cold and sick and hastened to the door The room was full of other shadows the memories of sleepless nights and of painful awakenings These stared at her from every familiar thing the watch ticking in its stand on the mantelpiece the handle of the wardrobe the pink curtains of the bed the white pillow beneath them She felt like a frightened child With a terrified glance over her shoulder she crept out of the room Being downstairs again she breathed more freely There was light all about her and the hall parlour was bright and warm The kettle was now singing in the cheerful blaze the cat was purring on the rug and there was a smell of bacon slowly frying She looked at the clock it was a quarter after seven Time to waken baby she thought She took from a chest the child s outdoor clothes a robe a pelisse and a white hood Her fingers had touched a scarlet hood in a cardboard box but not that she thought and left it She spread the clothes about her chair and then lifted the little one from the cradle to her pillowing arm The child awoke as she raised it and made a fretful cry which she smothered in a gurgling kiss I can love the darling without shame now she thought It s sweet face will reproach me no more With soft cooings at the baby s cheek she was stooping to take the robe that lay at her feet when her eyes fell on the round place in the cradle where the child had been That made her think again of Pete He would come home and find the little nest cold and empty It would kill him it would be a second bereavement Was it not enough that she should go away herself Must she rob him of the child as well He loved it he doted on it It was the light of his eyes the joy of his life To lose it would be a blow like the blow of death Yet could a mother leave her child behind her Impossible The full tide of motherhood came over her and its tender selfishness swept down everything I cannot she thought come what may I cannot and I will not leave her And then she reached her hand for the child s pelisse It would be a kind of atonement though she thought To leave the little one to Pete would be making amends in some sort for the wrong that she was doing him To deny herself the sight of the child s sweet face day by day and hour by hour that would be a punishment also and she deserved to be punished Can I leave her she thought Can I Oh what mother could bear it No no never never And yet I ought I must Oh this is terrible In the midst of this agony of uncertainty thinking of Pete and of the wrong she had done him yet pressing the child to her breast with trembling arms as if some one were tearing it away the babe itself settled everything Making some inarticulate whimper of communication it nuzzled up to her its eyes closed but its head working against her bosom with the instinct of suckling though it had never sucked I m only half a mother after all she thought The highest joys the deepest rights of motherhood had been denied to her the child taking from the mother the mother giving to the child the child and the mother one this had not been hers My little baby can live without me she thought If I leave her she will never miss me She nearly broke down at that thought and almost let her purpose slip It was like God s punishment in advance God s hand directing her thus to withdraw the child from dependence on herself Yes I must leave her with Pete she thought She put the child back into the cradle half dressed as it was and rocked it until it slept again Then she hung over the tiny bed as a mother hangs over the little coffin that is soon to be shut up from her eyes for ever Her tears rained down on the small counterpane My sweet baby I my little Katherine I may never kiss you again never see you any more you may grow up to be a woman and know nothing of your mother The clock ticked loud in the quiet room it was twenty five minutes past seven One kiss more my little darling If they ever tell you they ll say because your mother left you Oh will she think I did not love her Hush Through the walls of the house there came the sound of a band playing at a distance She looked at the clock again it was nearly half past seven Almost at the same moment there was the rumble of carriage wheels on the road They stopped in the lane that ran between the chapel and the end of the garden Kate rose from her knees and opened the door softly The house had been as a dungeon to her and she was flying from it like a prisoner escaping A shrill whistle pierced the air The Peveril was leaving the quay Through the streets there was a sound as of water running over stones It was the scuttling of the feet of the townspeople as they ran to meet the procession She stepped out The garden was dark and quiet as a prison yard Hardly a leaf stirred but the moon was breaking through the old fir tree as she lifted her troubled face to the untroubled sky She stood and listened The band was coming nearer She could hear the thud of the big drum Boom Boom Boom Pete was there He was helping at Philip s triumph That was the beat of his great heart made audible At this her own heart stopped for a moment She grew chill at the thought of the brave man who asked no better lot than to love and cherish her and at the memory of the other upon whose mercy she had cast herself The band stopped There was a noise like the breaking of a mighty rocket in the sky The people were cheering and clapping hands Then a clearer sound struck her ear It was the clock inside the house chiming the half hour Nancy would be back soon Kate listened intently inclining her head inwards If the child had awakened at that instant if it had stirred and cried she must have gone back for good She returned for one moment and flung herself over the cradle again One spasm more of lingering tenderness Good bye my little one I am leaving you with him darling because he loves you dearly You will grow up and be a good good girl to him always Good bye my pet My precious my precious You will reward him for all he has done for me You are half of myself dearest the innocent half Yes you will wipe out your mother s sin You will be all he thinks I am but never have been Farewell my sweet Katherine my little darling baby good bye farewell good bye She leapt up and fled out of the house at last on tiptoe like a thief pulling the door after her When she heard the click of the lock she felt both wretchedness and exultation immense agony and immense relief If little Katherine were to cry now she could not return to her The door was closed the house was shut the prison was left behind And behind her too were the treachery the duplicity and deceit of ten stifling months She hurried through the garden to a side door in the wall leading to the lane The path was like a wave of the sea to her stumbling feet Her breathing was short her sight was weak her temples were beating audibly Half across the garden something touched her dress and she made a faint scream It was Pete s dog Dempster He was looking up at her out of the darkness of the bushes By the light through the blind of the house she could see his bat s ears and watchful eyes Boom Boom Boom The band had begun again It was coming nearer Philip Philip He was her only refuge now All else was a blank The side door had been little used Its hinges and bolt were rusty and stiff She broke her nails in opening it From the other side came the light jingle of a curb chain and over the wall hovered a white sheet of smoking light The carriage was in the lane and the driver Philip s servant Jem y Lord stood with the door open Kate stumbled on the step and fell into the seat The door was closed Then a new thought smote her It was about the child about Philip about Pete In leaving the little one behind her though she had meant it so unselfishly she had done the one thing that must be big with consequences It would bring its penalty its punishment its retribution Stop She would go back even yet Her face was against the glass she was struggling with the strap But the carriage was moving She heard the rumble of the wheels it was like a deafening reverberation from the day of doom Then her senses dwaled away and the carriage drove on XV Outside Ballure House there was a crowd which covered the garden the fence the high road and the top of the stone wall opposite The band had ceased to play and the people were shouting clapping hands and cheering At the door which was open Philip stood bareheaded and a shaft of the light in the house behind him lit up a hundred of the eager faces gathered in the darkness He raised his hand for silence but it was long before he was allowed to speak Salutations rugged rough almost rude but hearty to the point of homeliness and affectionate to the length of familiarity flew at his head from every side Good luck to you boy Bravo for Ramsey The Christians for your life A chip of the ould block Dempster Christian the Sixth Hush man he s spaking Go it Phil Give it fits boy Hush hush Fellow townsmen said Philip his voice swung like a quivering bell over a sea you can never know how much your welcome has moved me I cannot say whether in my heart of hearts I am more proud of it or more ashamed To be ashamed of it altogether would dishonour you and to be too proud of it would dishonour me I am not worthy of your faith and good fellowship Ah he raised his hand to check a murmur of dissent the crowd was now hushed from end to end let me utter the thought of all In honouring me you are thinking of others also No Yes you are thinking of my people above all of one who was laid under the willows yonder a wrecked a broken a disappointed man my father God rest him I will not conceal it from you his memory has been my guide his failures have been my lightship his hopes my beacon his love my star For good or for evil my anchor has been in the depths of his grave God forbid that I should have lived too long under the grasp of a dead hand It was my aim to regain what he had lost and this day has witnessed its partial reclamation God grant I may not have paid too dear for such success There were cries of No sir no He smiled faintly and shook his head Fellow countrymen you believe I am worthy of the name I bear There is one among you an old comrade a tried and trusted friend whose faith would be a spur if it were not a reproach His voice was breaking but still it pealed over the sea of heads Well I will try to do my duty from this hour onwards you shall see me try Fellow Manxmen you will help me for the honour of the place I fill for the sake of our little island and yes and for my own sake also I know you will to be a good man and an upright judge But he faltered his voice could barely support itself but if it should ever appear that your confidence has been misplaced if in the time to come I should seem to be unworthy of this honour untrue to the oath I took to day to do God s justice between man and man a wrongdoer not a righter of the wronged a whited sepulchre where you looked for a tower of refuge remember I pray of you my countrymen remember much as you may be suffering then there will be one who will be suffering more that one will be myself The general impression that night was that the Deemster s speech had not been a proper one Breaking up with some damp efforts at the earlier enthusiasm the people complained that they were like men who had come for a jig and were sent home in a wet blanket There should have been a joke or two a hearty word of congratulation a little natural glorification of Ramsey and a quiet slap at Douglas and Peel and Castletown a few fireworks a rip rap or two and some general illumination But sakes alive the solemn the young Dempster was And the melancholy And the mystarious Chut said Pete There s such a dale of comic in you boys Wonder in the world to me you re not kidnapped for pantaloonses Go home for all and wipe your eyes and remember the words he s been spaking I m not going to forget them myself anyway Handing over the big drum to little Jonaique Pete turned to go into the house Auntie Nan was in the hall hopping like a canary about Philip in a brown silk dress that rustled like withered ferns hugging him drawing him down to the level of her face and kissing him on the forehead The tears were raining over the autumn sunshine of her wrinkled cheeks and her voice was cracking between a laugh and a cry My boy My dear boy My boy s boy My own boy s own boy Philip freed himself at length and went upstairs without turning his head and then Auntie Nan saw Pete standing in the doorway Is it you Pete she said with an effort Won t you come in for a moment No A minute only then just to wish you joy Miss Christian ma am said Pete And you too Peter Ah she said with a bird like turn of the head you must be a proud man to night Pete Proud isn t the word for it ma am I m clane beside myself He took a fancy to you when you were only a little barefooted boy Pete So he did ma am And now that he s Deemster itself he owns you still Aw lave him alone for that ma am Did you hear what he said about you in his speech It isn t everybody in his place would have done that before all Pete Deed no ma am He s true to his friends whatever they are True as steel The maid was carrying the dishes into the dining room and Auntie Nan said in a strained way You won t stay to dinner Pete will you Perhaps you want to get home to the mistress Well home is best for all of us isn t it Martha I ll tell the Deemster myself that dinner is on the table Well good night Peter I m always so glad to see you She was whisking about to go upstairs but Pete had taken one step into the dining room and was gazing round with looks of awe Lord alive Miss Christian ma am what feelings now barefooted boy you say You re right there and cold and hungry too sleeping in the gable house with the cow and not getting much but the milk I was staling from her and a leathering at the ould man for that Philip fetched me in here one evenin that was the start ma am See that pepper and salt egg on the string there It s a Tommy Noddy s Philip got it nesting up Gob ny Garvain Nearly cost him his life though You see ma am Tommy Noddy has only one and she fights like mad for it We were up forty fathom and better atop of a cave and had two straight rocks below us in the sea same as an elephant s hoofs you know walking out on the blue floor And Phil was having his lil hand on the ledge where the egg was keeping when swoop came the big white wings atop of his bare head If I hadn t had a stick that day ma am it would have been heaven help the pair of us The next minute Tommy Noddy was going splash down the cliffs all feathers and blood together or Philip wouldn t have lived to be Dempster Aw frightened you have I ma am for all it s so long ago The heart s a quare thing now isn t it Got no yesterday nor to morrow neither Well good night ma am Pete was making for the door when he looked down and said What s this at all Down Dempster down The dog had came trotting into the hall as Pete was going out He was perking up his big ears and wagging his stump of a tail in front of him My dog ma am Yes ma am and like its master in some ways Not much of itself at all but it has the blood in it though and maybe it ll come out better in the next generation Looking for me are you Dempster Let s be taking the road then Perhaps you re wanted at home Pete Wouldn t trust Good night ma am Auntie Nan hopped upstairs in her rustling dress relieved and glad in the sweet selfishness of her love to get rid of Pete and have Philip to herself XVI Pete went off whistling in the darkness with the dog driving ahead of him I m to blame though he thought Should have gone home directly The town was now quiet the streets were deserted and Pete began to run She d be alone too That must have been Nancy in the crowd yonder by Mistress Beatty s Lowed her out to see the do it s like Ought to be back now though As Pete came near to Elm Cottage the moon over the tree tops lit up the panes of the upper windows as with a score of bright lamps One step more and the house was dark She ll be waiting for me Listening too I ll go bail He was at the gate by this time and the dog was panting at his feet with its nose close to the lattice Be quiet dog be quiet Then he raised the latch without a sound stepped in on tiptoe and closed the gate as silently behind him I ll have a game with her I ll take her by surprise His eyes began to dance with mischief like a child s and he crept along the path with big cat strides half doubled up and holding his breath lest he should laugh aloud The sweet creatures A man shouldn t frighten them though he thought When he reached the porch he went down on all fours and began mewing like a mournful tom cat near to the bottom of the door Then he listened with his ear to the jamb He expected a faint cry of alarm the raucous voice of Nancy Joe and the clatter of feet towards the porch There was not a sound She s upstairs he thought and stepped back to look up at the front of the house There was no light in the rooms above I know what it is Nancy is not home yet and Kirry s fallen asleep at the rocking He stole up to the window and tried to look into the hall but the blind was down and he could not see much through the narrow openings at the sides of it She s sleeping that s it The house was quiet and she dropped off rocking the lil one that s all He scraped a handful of the light gravel and flung a little of it at the window That ll remind her of something he thought and he laughed under his breath Then he listened again with his ear at the sill There was no noise within He flung more gravel and waited thinking he might catch her breathing but he could hear nothing Then rising hurriedly and throwing off his playfulness he strode to the door and tried to open it The door was locked He returned to the window Kate he called softly Kate Are you there Do you hear me It s Pete Don t be frightened Kate bogh There was no response He could hear the beat of the sea on the shore The dog had perched himself on one end of the window sill and was beginning to whine What s this at all She can t be out Couldn t take the child anyway Where s that Nancy What right had the woman to lave her She has fainted being left alone that s what s going doing He tried to open the window but the latch was shot Then he tried the other windows and the back door and the window above the hall which he reached from the roof of the porch but they would not stir When he returned to the hall window the white blind was darker The lamp inside the room was going out The moonlight was dripping down on him through the leaves of the trees He found some matches beside his pipe in his side pocket struck one and looked at the sash then took out his clasp knife to remove the pane under the latch His hand trembled and shook and burst through the glass with a jerk It cut his wrist but he felt the wound no more than if it had been the glass instead of his arm that bled He thrust his hand through shot back the latch then pushed up the sash and clambered into the room past the blind The cat sitting on the ledge inside rubbed against his hand and purred Kirry Kate he whispered The lamp had given up its last gleam with the puff of wind from the window and save for the slumbering fire all was dark within the house He hardly dared to drop to his feet for fear of treading on something When he was at last in the middle of the floor he stood with legs apart struck another match held the light above his head and looked down and around like a man in a cave There was nothing The child awakened by the draught of the night air began to cry from the cradle He took it up and hushed it with baby words of tenderness in a breaking voice Hush bogh hush Mammie will come to it then Mammie will come for all He lit a candle and crept through the house carrying the light about with him There was no sign anywhere until he came to the bedroom when he saw that the hat and cloak of Kate s daily wear had gone Then he knew that he was a broken hearted man With a cry of desolation he stopped in his search and came heavily downstairs He had been warding off the moment of despair but he could do so no longer now The empty house and the child the child and the empty house these allowed of only one interpretation She s gone bogh she s left us she wasn t willing to stay with us God forgive her Sitting on a stool with the little one on his knees he sobbed while the child cried two children crying together Suddenly he leapt up I m not for believing it he thought What woman alive could do the like of it There isn t a mother breathing that hasn t more bowels And she used to love the lil one and me too and does and does He saw how it was She was ill distraught perhaps even God help her I perhaps even mad Such things happened to women after childbirth the doctor himself had said as much In the toils of her bodily trouble beset by mental terrors she had fled away from her baby her husband and her home pursued by God knows what phantoms of disease But she would get better she would come back Hush bogh hush then he whimpered tenderly Mammie will come home again Still and for all she ll come back There was the click of a key in the lock and he crept back to the stool Nancy came in panting and perspiring Dear heart alive what a race I ve had to get home she said puffing the air of the night She was throwing off her bonnet and shawl and talking before looking round Such pushing and scrooging you never seen the like Kirry Aw my best Sunday bonnet only wore at me once look at the crunched it is But what d ye think now Poor Christian Killip s baby is dead for all Died in the middle of the rejoicings Aw dear yes and the band going by playing The Conquering Hero the very minute Poor thing she was distracted and no wonder I ran round to put a sight on the poor soul and why what s going wrong with the lamp at all Is that yourself on the stool Kirry Pete is it Then where s the mistress She plucked up the poker and dug the fire into a blaze What s doing on you man You ve skinned your knuckles like potato peel Man man what for are you crying at all Then Pete said in a thick croak Hould your bull of a tongue Nancy and take the child out of my arms She took the baby from him and he rose to his feet as feeble as an old man Lord save us she cried The window broke too What s happened Nothing growled Pete Then what s coming of Kirry I left her at home when I went out at seven I m choking with thirst woman Can t you be giving a man a drink of something He found a dish of milk on the table where the supper had been laid and he gulped it down at a mouthful She s gone that s what it is I see it in your face Then going to the foot of the stairs she called Kirry Kate Katherine Cregeen Stop that shouted Pete and he drew her back from the stairs Why aren t you spaking then she cried If you re man enough to bear the truth I m woman enough to hear it Listen to me Nancy said Pete with uplifted fist I m going out for an hour and till I m back stay you here with the child and say nothing to nobody I knew it cried Nancy That s what she hurried me out for Aw dear Aw dear What for did you lave her with that man this morning Do you hear me woman said Pete say nothing to nobody My heart s lying heavy enough already Open your lips and you ll kill me straight Then he went out of the house staggering stumbling bent almost double His hat lay on the floor he had gone bareheaded He turned towards Sulby She s there he thought Where else should she be The poor wandering lamb wants home XVII The bar room of The Manx Fairy was full of gossips that night and the puffing of many pipes was suspended at a story that mister Jelly was telling Strange enough I m thinking Deed but it s mortal strange Talk about tale books there s nothing in the Pilgrim s Progress itself to equal it The son of one son coming home Dempster with processions and bands of music at the very minute the son of the other son is getting kicked out of the house same as a dog Strange uncommon said John the Widow and other voices echoed him Jonaique looked round the room expecting some one to question him As nobody did so except with looks of inquiry he said My ould man heard it all He s been tailor at the big house since the time of Iron Christian himself Truth enough said Caesar And he was sewing a suit for the big man in the kitchen when the bad work was going doing upstairs You don t say You ve robbed me says the Ballawhaine Dear heart alive cried Grannie To his own son was it You ve cheated me says he you deceaved me you ve embezzled my money and broke my heart says he I ve spent a fortune on you and what have you brought me back says he This says he and this and this barefaced forgeries all of them says he The Lord help us muttered Caesar They re calling me a miser aren t they says he I grind my people to the dust do I What for then Whom for I ve been a good father to you anyway and a fool too if nobody knows it says he Nobody Did he say nobody mister Jelly said Caesar screwing up his mouth If you d had my father to deal with says he he d have turned you out long ago for a liar and a thief My God father says Ross struck silly for the minute A thief d ye hear me says the Ballawhaine a thief that s taken every penny I have in the world and left me a ruined man Did he say that said Caesar He did though said Jonaique The ould man was listening from the kitchen stairs and young Ross snaked out of the house same as a cur And where s he gone to said Caesar Gone to the devil I m thinking said Jonaique Well he d be good enough for him with a broken back pity the ould man didn t break it said Caesar But where is the wastrel now Gone to England over with to night s packet they re saying Praise God from whom all blessings flow said Caesar A grunt came out of the corner from behind a cloud of smoke You ve your own rasons for saying so Caesar said the husky voice of Black Tom People were talking and talking one while there that he d be bezzling somebody s daughter as well as the ould miser s money Answer a fool according to his folly muttered Caesar and then the door jerked open and Pete came staggering into the room Every pipe shank was lowered in an instant and Grannie s needles ceased to click Pete was still bareheaded his face was ghastly white and his eyes wandered but he tried to bear himself as if nothing had happened Smiling horribly and nodding all round as a man does sometimes in battle the moment the bullet strikes him he turned to Grannie and moved his lips a little as if he thought he was saying something though he uttered no sound After that he took out his pipe and rammed it with his forefinger then picked a spill from the table and stooped to the fire for a light Anybody belonging me here he said in a voice like a crow s coughing as he spoke the flame dancing over the pipe mouth No Pete no said Grannie Who were you looking for at all Nobody he answered Nobody partic lar Aw no he said and he puffed until his lips quacked though the pipe gave out no smoke Just come in to get fire to my pipe Must be going now So long boys S long Bye bye Grannie No one answered him He nodded round the room again and smiled fearfully crossed to the door with a jaunty roll and thus launched out of the house with a pretence of unconcern the dead pipe hanging upside down in his mouth and his head aside as if his hat had been tilted rakishly on his uncovered hair When he had gone the company looked into each other s faces in surprise and fear as if a ghost in broad daylight had passed among them Then Black Tom broke the silence Men said he that was a d lie Si began Caesar but the protest foundered in his dry throat Something going doing in Ramsey Black Tom continued I believe in my heart I ll follow him I ll be going along with you mister Quilliam said Jonaique And I said John the Clerk And I And I said the others and in half a minute the room was empty Father whimpered Grannie through the glass partition hadn t you better saddle the mare and see if any thing s going wrong with Kirry I was thinking the same myself mother Come then away with you The Lord have mercy on all of us XVIII As soon as he was out of earshot Pete began to run Within half an hour he was back at Elm Cottage She ll be home by this time he told himself but he dared not learn the truth too suddenly Creeping up to the hall window he listened at the broken pane The child was crying and Nancy Joe was talking to herself and sobbing as she bathed the little one Bless its precious heart it s as beautiful as the angels in heaven I ve bathed her mother on the same knee a hundred times Deed have I and a thousand times too Mother indeed What sort of mothers are in now at all She must have a heart as hard as a stone to lave the like of it Can t be a drop of nature in her Goodness Nancy what are saying for all Kate is it Your own little Kirry and you blackening her Aw dear aw dear The bogh the bogh Pete could not go in He crept back to the cabin in the garden and leaned against it to draw his breath and think Then he noticed that the dog was on the path with its long tongue hanging over its jaw It stopped its panting to whine woefully and then it turned towards the darker part of the garden He s telling me something thought Pete A car rattled down the side road at that moment and the light of its lamp shot through the bushes to his feet The ould gate must be open he thought He looked and saw that it was and then a new light dawned on him She s gone up to Philip s he told himself She s gone by Claughbane to Ballure to find me Five minutes afterwards he was knocking at Ballure House His breath was coming in gusts perspiration was standing in beads on his face and his head was still bare but he was carrying himself bravely as if nothing were amiss His knock was answered by the maid a tall girl of cheerful expression in a black frock a white apron and a snow white cap Pete nodded and smiled at her Anybody been here for me No he asked No sir n o I think not the girl answered and as she looked at Pete her face straightened There was a rustling within as of autumn leaves and then a twittering voice cried Is it captain n Quilliam Martha Yes ma am Some whispered conference took place at the dining room door and Auntie Nan came hopping through the hall But Pete was already moving away in the darkness Shall I call the Deemster Peter Aw no ma am no not worth bothering him Good everin Miss Christian ma am good everin to you Auntie Nan and Martha were standing in the light at the open door when the iron gate of the garden swung to with a click and Pete swung across the road He was making for the lane which goes down to the shore at the foot of Ballure Glen No denying it he thought It must be true for all The trouble in her head has driven her to it Poor girl poor darling He had been fighting against an awful idea and the quagmire of despair had risen to his throat at last The moon was behind the cliffs and he groped his way through the shadows at the foot of the rocks like one who looks for something which he dreads to find He found nothing and his catchy breathing lengthened to sighs Thank God not here anyway he muttered Then he walked down the shore towards the harbour The tide was still high the wash of the waves touched his feet on the one hand the dark sea unbroken by a light on the other the dull town blinking out and dropping asleep He reached the end of the stone pier at the mouth of the harbour and with his back to the seaward side of the lighthouse he stared down into the grey water that surged and moaned under the rounded wall A black cloud like a skate was floating across the moon and a startled gannet scuttled from under the pier steps into the moon s misty waterway There was nothing else to be seen He turned back towards the town following the line of the quay and glancing down into the harbour when he came to the steps Still he saw nothing of the thing he looked for But it was high water then and now it s the ebby tide he told himself He had met with nobody on the shore or on the pier but as he passed the sheds in front of the berth for the steamers he was joined by the harbour master who was swinging home for the night with his coat across his arm Then he tried to ask the question that was slipping off his tongue but dared not and only stammered awkwardly Any news to night mister Quay le Is it yourself captain n If you ve none I ve none It s independent young rovers like you for newses not poor ould chaps tied to the harbour post same as a ship s cable I was hearing you though You d a power of music in the everin yonder Fine doings up at Ballure seemingly Nothing fresh with yourself then Daniel No Except that I am middling sick of these late sailings and the sooner they re building us a breakwater the better If the young Deemster will get that for us he ll do They were nearing a lamp at the corner of the marketplace It s like you know the young Ballawhaine crossed with the boat to night Something wrong with the ould man they re telling me But boy veen what s come of your hat at all My hat said Pete groping about his head Oh my hat Blown off on the pier of coorse Deed man Not much wind either You ll be for home and the young wife eh captain n Must be said Pete with an empty laugh And the harbour master who was a bachelor laughed more heartily and added You married men are like Adam you ve lost the rib of your liberty but you ve got a warm little woman to your side instead Ha ha ha Goodnight Pete s laugh echoed through the empty market place The harbour master had seen nothing Pete drew a long breath followed the line of the harbour as far as to the bridge at the end of it and then turned back through the town He had forgotten again that he was bareheaded and he walked down Parliament Street with a tremendous step and the air of a man to whom nothing unusual had occurred People were standing in groups at the corner of every side street talking eagerly with the low hissing sound that women make when they are discussing secrets So absorbed were they that Pete passed some of them unobserved He caught snatches of their conversation The rascal said one Clane ruined the ould man anyway said another Ross Christian again thought Pete But a greater secret swamped everything Still he heard the people as he passed Sarve her right though whatever she gets she knew what he was Laving the child too the unfeeling creature Then the sharp voices of the women fell on the dull consciousness of Pete like forks of lightning Whisht woman the husband himself said somebody There was a noise of feet like the plash of retiring waves and Pete noticed that one of the groups had broken into a half circle facing him as he strode along the street He nodded cheerfully over both sides threw back his bare head and plodded on But his teeth were set hard and his breathing was quick and audible I see what they mane he muttered Outside his own house he found a crowd A saddle horse with a cloud of steam rising from her was standing with the reins over its head linked to the gate post It was Caesar s mare Molly Every eye was on the house and no one saw Pete as he came up behind Black Tom s saying there s not a doubt of it said a woman Gone with the young Ballawhaine eh said a man Shame on her the hussy said another woman Pete ploughed his way through with both arms smiling and nodding furiously If you plaze ma am I If you plaze As he pushed on he heard voices behind him Poor man he doesn t know yet I m taking pity to look at him The house door was open On the threshold stood a young man with long hair and a long note book He was putting questions Last seen at seven o clock left alone with child husband out with procession any other information Nancy Joe with the child on her lap was answering querulously from the stool before the fire and Caesar face down was leaning on the mantelpiece Pete took in the situation at a glance Then he laid his big hand on the young man s shoulder and swung him aside as if he had been turning a swivel What going doing he asked The young man faltered something Sorry to intrude captain n Quilliam s trouble What trouble said Pete Need I say the lamented I mean distressing in fact the mysterious disappearance What disappearance said Pete with an air of amazement Can it be sir that you ve not yet heard Heard what Your tongue s like a turnip watch in a fob pocket out with it man Your wife Captain What My wife disa What So this is the jeel My wife mysteriously disappear Oh my gough Pete burst into a peal of laughter He shouted roared held his sides doubled rocked up and down and at length flung himself into a chair threw back his head heaved out his legs and shook till the house itself seemed to quake Well that s good that s rich that bates all he cried The child awoke on Nancy s knee and sent its thin pipe through Pete s terrific bass Caesar opened his mouth and gaped and the young man now white and afraid scraped and backed himself to the door saying Then perhaps it s not true after all captain n Of coorse it s not true said Pete Maybe you know where she s gone Of course I know where s she s gone I sent her there myself You did though said Caesar Yes did I to England by the night sailing Deed man said Caesar The doctor ordered it You heard him yourself grandfather Well that s true too said Caesar The young man closed his long note book and backed into a throng of women who had come up to the porch Of course if you say so captain n Quilliam I do say so shouted Pete and the reporter disappeared The voices of two women came from the gulf of white faces wherein the reporter had been swallowed up I m right glad it s lies they ve been telling of her captain n said the first Of coorse you are Mistress Kinnish shouted Pete I could never have believed the like of the same woman and I always knew the child was brought up by hand said the other Coorse you couldn t Mistress Kewley Pete replied But he swung up and kicked the door to in their faces The strangers being shut out Caesar said cautiously Do you mane that Peter Molly s smoking at the gate like a brewer s vat father said Pete The half hasn t been told you Peter Listen to me It s only proper you should hear it When you were away at Kim berley this Ross Christian was bothering the girl terrible She ll be getting cold so long out of the stable said Pete I rebuked him myself sir and he smote me on the brow Look Here s the mark of his hand over my temple and I ll be carrying it to my grave Ross Christian Ross Christian muttered Pete impatiently By the Lord s restraining grace sir I refrained myself but if mister Philip hadn t been there that night I m not hould ing with violence no resist not evil but mister Philip fought the loose liver with his fist for me he chastised him sir he D the man cried Pete leaping to his feet What s he to me or my wife either Caesar went home huffed angry and unsatisfied And then all being gone and the long strain over Pete snatched the puling child out of Nancy s arms and kissed it and wept over it Give her to me the bogh he cried hoarse as a raven and then sat on the stool before the fire and rocked the little one and himself together If I hadn t something innocent to lay hould of I should be going mad that I should Oh Katherine bogh Katherine bogh My little bogh My I ll bogh millish In the deep hours of the night after Nancy had grumbled and sobbed herself to sleep by the side of the child Pete got up from the sofa in the parlour and stole out of the house again She may come up with the morning tide he told himself If she does what matter about a lie God forgive me God help me what matter about anything If she did not he would stick to his story so that when she came back wherever she had been she would come home as an honest woman And will be too he thought Yes will be too spite of all their dirty tongues as sure as the Lord s in heaven The dog trotted on in front of him as he turned up towards Ballure XIX Philip had not eaten much that night at dinner He had pecked at the wing of a fowl been restless absent preoccupied and like a man struggling for composure At intervals he had listened as for a step or a voice then recovered himself and laughed a little Auntie Nan had explained his uneasiness on grounds of natural excitement after the doings of the great day She had loaded his plate with good things and chirruped away under the light of the lamp So sweet of you Philip not to forget Pete amid all your success He s really such a good soul It would break his heart if you neglected him Simple as a child certainly and of course quite uneducated but Pete is fit to be the friend of any one Auntie The friend yes but you ll allow not exactly the companion If he is simple it is the simplicity of a nature too large for little things The dear fellow He s not a bit jealous of you Philip Such feelings are far below him Auntie He s your first cousin after all Philip There s no denying that As he says the blood of the Christians is in him The conversation took a turn Auntie Nan fell to talking of the other Peter uncle Peter Christian of Ballawhaine This was the day of the big man s humiliation The son he had doted on was disgraced She tried but could not help it she struggled but could not resist the impulse in her secret heart the tender little soul rejoiced Such a pity she sighed So touching when a father no matter how selfish is wrecked by love of a thankless son I m sorry indeed I am But I warned him six years ago Didn t I now Philip was far away He was seeing visions of Pete going home the deserted house the empty cradle the desolate man alone and heart broken They rose from the table and went into the little parlour Auntie Nan on Philip s arm proud and happy She fluttered down to the piano and sang to cheer him up a little an old song in a quavering old voice Of the wandering falcon The cuckoo complains He has torn her warm nest He has scattered her young Suddenly Philip got up stiffly and said in a husky whisper Isn t that his voice Who s dear Pete s Where dearest In the hall I hear nobody Let me look No Pete s not here But how pale you are Philip What s amiss Nothing said Philip I only thought Take some wine dear or some brandy You ve overtired yourself to day and no wonder You must have a long long rest to night Yes I ll go to bed at once So soon Well perhaps it s best You want sleep your eyes show that Martha Is everything ready in the Deemster s room All but the lamp Take it up Martha Philip you ll drink a little brandy and water first I ll carry it to your room then you might need it in the night Go before me dear Yes yes you must Do you think I want you to see how old I am when I m going upstairs Ah I hadn t to climb by the banisters this way when I came first to Bal lure On reaching the landing Philip was turning to his old room the bedroom he had occupied from his boyhood up the bedroom of his mother s father old captain n Billy Not that way to night Philip This way there What do you say to that She pushed open the door of the room opposite and the glow of the fire within rushed out on them My father s room said Philip and he stepped back Oh I ve aired it and it s not a bit the worse for being so long shut up See it s like toast Oo oo oo Not the least sign of my breath Come No Auntie no Are you afraid of ghosts There s only one ghost lives here Philip the memory of your dear father and that will never harm you But this place is too sacred No one has slept here since That s why dearest But now you have justified your father s hopes and it must be your room for the future Ah if he could only see you himself how proud he would be Poor father Perhaps he does Who knows perhaps kiss me Philip See what an old silly I am after all So happy that I have to cry But mind now you ve got to sleep in this room every time you come to hold court in Ramsey I refuse to share you with Elm Cottage any longer Talk about jealousy If Pete isn t jealous I know somebody who is or soon will be But Philip Philip Christian Yes The sweet old face grew solemn The greatest man has his cares and doubts and divisions That s only natural out in the open field of life But don t be ashamed to come here whenever you are in trouble It s what home is for Philip Just a place of peace and shelter from the rough world when it wounds and hurts you A quiet spot dear with memories of father and mother and innocent childhood and with an old goose of an auntie maybe who thinks of you all day and every day and is so vain and foolish and and who loves you Philip better than anybody in the World Philip s arms were about the old soul but he had not heard her With a terrified glance towards the window he was saying in a low quick voice Isn t that a footstep on the gravel N o no You re nervous to night Philip Lie and rest When you re asleep I ll creep back and look at you She left him and he looked around Not in all the world could Philip have found a spot so full of terrors It was like a sepulchre of dead things his dead father his dead mother his dead youth his dead innocence his slaughtered friendship and his outraged conscience Over the fireplace hung a portrait of his mother It was the picture of a comely girl young and soft with full ripe lips and bright brown eyes Philip shuddered as he looked at it The portrait was like the ghost of himself looking through the veil of a woman s face Facing this and hanging over the side of the bed was a portrait of his father The eyes were full of light the lines of the cheek were round the mouth seemed to quiver with a tender smile But Philip could not see it as it was He saw it with straggling hair damp and long as reeds the cheeks pallid and drawn the eyes like lamps in a mist the throat bare of the shirt and the lips kept apart by laboured breathing Near the window stood the cot where he had once slept with Pete and leaped up in the morning and laughed On every hand wherever his eye could rest there rose a phantom of his lost and buried life And Auntie Nannie s love and pride had brought him to this chamber of torture The night was calm enough outside but it seemed to lie dead within that room so quiet was it and so still There was a clock but it did not go and there was a cage for a bird but no bird pecked in it Philip thought he heard a knocking at the door of the house Nobody answered it so he rang for the maid She came upstairs with a smile Didn t you hear a knock at the front door Martha No sir said the girl Strange Very strange I could have sworn it was the knock of mister Quilliam Perhaps it was sir Ill go and look No matter I ve a singing in my ears to night It must be that The girl left him He threw off his boots and began to creep about the room as if he were doing something in which he feared detection Every time his eyes fell on the portrait of his father he dropped his head and turned aside Presently he heard voices in the room below This time the sound in his ears was no dreaming He opened the door noiselessly and listened It was Pete Martha was answering him Auntie Nan was calling from the dining room and Pete was saying No no in a light way and moving off The gate of the garden clicked and the front door was closed quietly Then Philip shut the door of his own room without a sound A moment later Auntie Nan re opened it She was carrying a lighted candle Such an extraordinary thing Philip Martha says you thought you heard Peter knocking and do you know he must have been coming up the hill at that very moment He was so strange too and looked so wild Asked if anybody had been here inquiring for him as if anybody should Wouldn t have me call to you and went off laughing about nothing Really if I hadn t known him for a sober man Philip felt sick and chill and he began to shiver An irresistible impulse took hold of him It was like the half smothered fear which makes guilty men go to sit at the inquests on their murdered victims Something wrong he said Where are my boots Going to Elm Cottage Philip Pity the coachman drove back to Douglas Hadn t you better send Martha Besides it may be only my fancy Why worry in any case You re too tender hearted indeed you are Philip fled downstairs like one who flies from torture While dragging on his coat in the hall he began to foresee what was before him He was to go to Pete pretending to know nothing he was to hear Pete s story and show surprise he was to comfort Pete perhaps to help him in his search for he dared not appear not to help he was to walk by Pete s side looking for what he knew they should not find He saw himself crawling along the streets like a snake and the part he had to play revolted him He went upstairs again On second thoughts you must be right auntie I m sure I am If not he ll come again I m sure he will If there s anything amiss with Pete he ll come first to me There can be nothing amiss except what I say Just a glass too much maybe and no great sin either considering the day and how proud he is for your sake Philip I believe in my heart that young man couldn t be prouder and happier if he stood in your own shoes instead Good night Auntie said Philip in a thick gurgle Good night dear I m going to bed and mind you go yourself Being alone Philip found himself leaning against the mantelpiece and looking across at his father s picture He began to contrast his father with himself He was a success his father had been a failure At seven and twenty he was Deemster at all events at thirty his father had died a broken man He had got what he had worked for he had recovered the place of his people and yet how mean a man he was compared to him who had done nothing and lost all Failure was all that his father had had to reproach himself with but he had to accuse himself of dishonour as well His father s offence had been a fault his own was a crime If his father had been willing to betray love and friendship he might have succeeded Because he himself had been true to neither he had not failed The very excess of his father s virtues had kept him down Every act of his own selfishness had pushed him up His father had thought first of love and truth and an upright life and last of money and rank and applause The world had renounced his father because his father had first renounced the world But it had opened its arms to him and followed him with shouts and cheers and loaded him with honours And yet miserable man better be down in the ooze and slime of a broken life better be dead and in the grave for the dead in his grave must despise him An awful picture rose before Philip It was a picture of himself in the time to come An old man great powerful perhaps even beloved maybe worshipped but heart dead tottering on to the grave and the mockery of a gorgeous funeral with crowds and drums and solemn music Then suddenly a great silence as if the snow had begun to fall and a great white light and an awful voice crying Who is this that comes with dust for a bleeding heart and ashes for a living soul Philip screamed aloud at the vision as piece by piece he put it together His cry died off with a tingle in the china ornaments of the mantelpiece and he remembered where he was Then two gentle taps came to the door of his room He composed himself a little snatched up a book and cried Come in It was Auntie Nan She was in her night dress and night cap A candle was in her hand and the flame was shaking Whatever s to do my child she said Only reading aloud Auntie Did I awaken you But you screamed Philip Macbeth Auntie See the banquet scene He has become king you know but his conscience He stopped The little lady looked at him dubiously and made a pull at the string of her night cap causing it to fall aside and give a grotesque appearance to her troubled old face Take a little brandy dear I left it here on the dressing table Don t trouble about me Auntie Good night again There go back to bed Half coaxing half forcing her he drew her to the door and she went out slowly reluctantly doubtfully the wandering strings of her cap trailing on her shoulders and her bare feet nipping up the bottom of the night dress behind her Philip looked at the book he had snatched up in his haste What had put that book of all books into his hand What had brought him to that room of all rooms And on that night of all nights What devil out of hell had tempted Auntie Nan to torture him He would not stay he would go back to his own bed Out on the landing he heard a low voice It came from Auntie Nan s room A spear of candle light shot from her door which was ajar He paused and looked in The white night dress was by the bedside the night cap was buried in the counterpane A cat had established itself beside it and was purring softly Auntie Nan was on her knees Philip heard his own name God bless my Philip in the great place to which he has been called this day Give him wisdom and strength and peace Holy woman with angels hovering over you who dared to think of devils tempting your innocence and love Philip went back to his father s room He began to reconcile himself to his position Though he had been extolling his father at his own expense what had he done but realise his father s hopes And after all he could not have acted differently At no point could he have behaved otherwise than he had What had he to accuse himself for If there had been sin he had been dragged into it by blind powers which he could not command And what was true of himself was also true of Kate Ah he could see her now She was gone where he had sent her There were tears in her beautiful eyes but time would wipe them away The duplicity of her old life was over the corroding deceit the daily torment the hourly infidelity all were left behind If there was remorse it was the fault of destiny and if she was suffering the pangs of shame she was a woman and she would bear it cheerfully for the sake of the man she loved She was going through everything for him Heaven bless her In spite of man and man s law she was his love his darling his wife yes his wife by right of nature and of God and come what would he should cling to her to the last Suddenly a thick voice cut through the still air of the night Philip It was Pete at last He was calling up at the window from the path below Philip groaned and covered his face with his hands Philip With rigid steps Philip walked to the window and threw up the sash It was starlight and the branches were bending in the night air Is it you Pete Yes it s me I was seeing the lamp so I knew you war n in bed at all Studdying a bit it s like eh I thought I wouldn t waken the house but just shout up and tell you What is it Pete said Philip His voice shivered like a sail at tacking Nothing much at all Only the wife s gone to England over by the night s steamer To England Aw time for it too I m thinking the wake and narvous she s been lately You remember what the doctor was saying yonder everin when we christened the child Send her out of the island says he and she ll be coming home another woman Wasn t for going though Crying and shouting she wouldn t be laving the lil one So I had to put out a bit of authority Of course a husband s got the right to do that Philip eh Well I ll be taking the road again Doing a fine night isn t it Make s a man unwilling to go to bed Philip trembled and felt sick He tried to speak but could utter nothing except an inarticulate noise As Pete went off an owl screeched in the glen Philip drew down the sash pulled the blind tugged the curtains across stumbled into the middle of the floor and leaned against the bed Such is the beginning of the end he thought The duplicity the deceit the daily torment which Kate had left behind were henceforward to be his own At one flash as of lightning he saw the path before him It was over cliffs and chasms and quagmires where his foot might slip at any step His head began to reel He took the brandy bottle from the dressing table poured out half a tumbler and drained it at one draught As he did so his eyes above the rim of the glass rested on the portrait of his mother over the fireplace The face as he saw it then was no longer the face of the winsome bride It was the living face as he remembered it bleared bloated gross and drunken She smiled on him she beckoned to him It was the beginning of the end indeed He was his mother s son as well as his father s The father had ruled down to that day but it was the turn of the mother now He could not resist her She was alive in his blood and he was hers Never before had he touched raw spirits and the brandy mastered him instantly Feeling dizzy he made an effort to undress and get into bed He dragged off his coat and his waistcoat and threw his braces over his shoulders Then he stumbled and he had to lay hold of the bedpost His hand grew chill and relaxed its hold Stupor came over him He slipped he slid he fell and rolled with outstretched arms on to the floor The fire went out and the lamp died down Then the sun came up over the sea It was a beautiful morning The town awoke people hailed each other cheerfully in the streets and joy bells rang from the big church tower for the first court day of the new Deemster But the Deemster himself still lay on the floor with damp forehead and matted hair behind the blind of the darkened room PART V MAN AND MAN I It was Saturday and the market place was covered with the carts and stalls of the country people After some feint of eating breakfast Pete lit his pipe called for a basket and announced his intention of doing the marketing Coming for the mistress are you captain n I m a sort of a grass widow ma am What s your eggs to day Mistress Cowley Sixteen this morning sir and right ones too They were telling me you ve been losing her Give me a shilling s worth then Any news over your side Mag Two four eight sixteen it s every appearance we ll be getting a early harvest captain n Is it yourself Liza And how s your butter to day Bad to bate to day sir and only thirteen pence ha penny Is the lil one longing for the mistress captain n I ll take a couple of pounds then What for longing at all when it s going bringing up by hand it is Put it in a cabbage leaf Liza Thus with his basket on his arm and his pipe in his mouth Pete passed from stall to stall chatting laughing bargaining buying shouting his salutations over the general hum and hubbub as he ploughed his way through the crowd but listening intently watching eagerly casting out grapples to catch the anchor he had lost and feeling all the time that if any eye showed sign of knowledge if any one began with captain n I can tell you where she is he must leap on the man like a tiger and strangle the revelation in his throat Next day Sunday his friends from Sulby came to quiz and to question He was lounging in his shirt sleeves on a deck chair in his ship s cabin smoking a long pipe and pretending to be at ease and at peace with all the world Fine morning captain n said John the Clerk It is doing a fine morning John said Pete Fine on the sea too said Jonaique Wonderful fine on the sea mister Jelly A nice fair wind though if anybody was going by the packet to Liverpool Was it as good think you for the mistress on Friday night mister Quilliam I ll gallantee said Pete Plucky though I wouldn t have thought it of the same woman I wouldn t raelly said Jonaique Alone too and landing on the other side so early in the morning said John the Clerk Smart uncommon It isn t every woman would have done it said Kelly the Postman Aw we ve mighty boys of women deese days we have dough snuffled the constable and then they all laughed together Pete watched their wheedling fawning and whisking of the tail and then he said Chut What s there so wonderful about a woman going by herself to Liverpool when she s got somebody waiting at the stage to meet her The laughing faces lengthened suddenly And had she then said John the Clerk Pete puffed furiously rolled in his seat laughed like a man with a mouth full of water and said Why sartenly my uncle of coorse Jonaique wrinkled his forehead Uncle he said with a click in his throat Yes my Uncle Joe said Pete Jonaique looked helplessly across at John the Clerk John the Clerk puckered up his mouth as if about to whistle and then said in a faltering way Well I can t really say I ve ever heard tell of your Uncle Joe before captain n No said Pete with a look of astonishment Not my Uncle Joseph The one that left the island forty years ago and started in the coach and cab line Well that s curious Where s he living Bless me where s this it is now Chut it s clane forgot at me But I saw him myself coming home from Kimberley and since then he s been writing constant Send her across

and the good company To look at that man s face you d say the sun was shining reg lar Aw it s fine times she ll be having with Uncle Joe No woman could be ill with yonder ould man about He d break your face with laughing if it was bursting itself with a squinsey And you never heard tell of my Uncle Joe of Scotland Road down Clarence Dock way To think of that now They went off with looks of perplexity and Pete turned into the house They re trying to catch me they re wanting to shame my poor lil Kirry I must keep her name sweet he thought The church bells had begun to ring and he was telling himself that heavy though his heart might be he must behave as usual She ll be going walking to church herself this morning Nancy he said putting on his coat so I ll just slip across to chapel He was swinging up the path on his return home to dinner when he heard voices inside the house It s shocking to see the man bittending this and bittending that It was Nancy she was laying the table there was a rattle of knives and forks Bittending to ate but only pecking like a robin bittending to sleep but never a wink on the night bittending to laugh and to joke and wink and a face at him like a ghose s and his hair all through others Walking about from river to quay and going on with all that rubbish it s shocking ma am it s shocking Hush a bye hush a bye It was the voice of Grannie low and quavery she was rocking the cradle You can t spake to him neither but he s scolding you scandalous I m not used of being cursed at I m saying and is it myself that has to be tould to respect my own Kitty But cry shame on her I must when I look at the lil bogh there and it so helpless and so beautiful Stericks you say Yes indeed ma am and if I stay here much longer it s losing myself I will be too with his bittending and bittending Lave him to it Nancy His poor head s that moidered and mixed it s like a black pudding there s no saying what s inside of it But he s good though aw right good he is for all and the world s cold and cruel Lave him alone woman lave him alone poor boy The child awoke and cried and under cover of this commotion and the crowing and cooing of the two women Pete stepped back to the gate clashed it hard swung noisily up the gravel and rolled into the house with a shout and a laugh Well well Grannie my gough Who d have thought of seeing Grannie now And how s the ould angel to day So you ve got the lil one there Aw you rogue you You re on Grannie s lap are you How s Caesar And how s missus Gorry doing Look at that now did you ever Opening one eye first to make sure if the world s all right The child s wise Coo oo oo Smart with the dinner Nancy wonderful hungry the chapel s making a man Coo oo What s she like now Grannie When I set her to my knee like this I can see my own lil Kirry again said Grannie looking down ruefully rocking the child with one knee and doubling over it to kiss it So she s like the mammy is she said Pete blowing at the baby and tickling its chin with his broad forefinger Mammy s gone to the ould uncle s hasn t she my lammie At that Grannie fell to rocking herself as well as the child and to singing a hymn in a quavery voice Then with a rattle and a rush throwing off his coat and tramping the floor in his shirt sleeves while Nancy dished up the dinner Pete began to enlarge on Kate s happiness in the place where she had gone Tremenjous grand the ould man s house is you wouldn t believe A reg lar Dempster s palace The grandeur on it is a show and a pattern Plenty to ate plenty to drink and a boy at the door with white buttons dotting on his brown coat bless you like like a turnip field in winter Then the man himself goodness me the happy that man is Happy Joe they re calling him Wouldn t trust but he ll be taking Kate to a theaytre Well and why not if a person s down a bit A merry touch and go where s the harm at all Fact is Grannie that s why we couldn t tell you Kate was going Caesar would have been objecting He s fit enough for it ha ha ha Grannie looked up at Pete as he laughed and the broad rose withered on his face H m h m he said clearing his throat I m bad dreadful wanting a smook And past the dinner table now smoking and ready he slithered out of the house Caesar was Pete s next visitor He said nothing of Kate and neither did Pete mention Uncle Joe The interview was a brief and grim one It was a lie that Ross Christian had been sent by his father to ask for a loan but it was true that Peter Christian was in urgent need of money He wanted six thousand pounds as mortgage on Ballawhaine Had Pete got so much to lend No need for personal intercourse Caesar would act as intermediary Pete took only a moment for consideration Yes he had got the money and he would lend it Caesar looked at Pete Pete looked at Caesar He s talking all this rubbish thought Caesar but he knows where the girl has gone to He knows who s taken her he manes to kick the rascal out of his own house neck and crop and right enough too and the Lord s own vengeance But Pete s thoughts were another matter The ould man won t live to redeem it and the young one will never try it ll do for Philip some day II For three days Pete bore himself according to his wont thinking to silence the evil tongues of the little world about him and keep sweet and alive the dear name which they were waiting to befoul and destroy By Tuesday morning the strain had become unbearable On pretences of business of pleasure of God knows what folly and nonsense he began to scour the island He visited every parish on the north passed through every village climbed every glen found his way into every out of the way hut and scraped acquaintance with every old woman living alone Sometimes he was up in the vague fore dawn creeping through the quiet streets like a thief going silently stealthily warily until he came to the roads or the fields or the open Curragh and could give swing to his step and breath to his lungs and voice to the cries that hurst from him Two long weeks he spent in this wild quest and meanwhile he was as happy as a boy to all outward seeming whistling laughing chaffing bawling talking nonsense any nonsense and kicking up his heels like a kid But wheresoever he went and howsoever early he started on his errands he never failed to be back at home at seven o clock in the evening washed combed in his slippers and shirt sleeves smoking a long clay over the garden gate as the postman went by with the letters She ll write he told himself When she s mending a bit she ll aise our mind and write Dear ould Pete excuse me for not writing afore that ll he the way of it Aw trust her trust her But day followed day and no letter came from Kate Ten evenings running he smoked over the gate leisurely largely almost languidly hut always watching for the peak of the postman s cap as it turned the corner by the Court house and following the toes of his foot as they stepped off the curb to see if they pointed in his direction and then turning aside with a deep breath and a smothered moan that ended in a rattle of the throat and a pretence at spitting The postman saw him as he went by and his little eyes twinkled treacherously Nothing for you yet captain n he said at length Chut said Pete with a mighty puff of smoke my business isn t done by correspondence mister Kelly Aw no but when a man s wife s away began the postman Oh I see said Pete with a look of intelligence and then with a lofty wave of the hand She s like her husband mister Kelly not bothering much with letters at all You ll be longing for a line though captain n that s only natural No news is good news I can lave it with her Of coorse that s truth enough yes But still and for all a taste of a letter it s doing no harm captain n aisy writ too and sweet to get sometimes you know shows a woman isn t forgetting a man when she s away mister Kelly mister Kelly said Pete with his hand before his face palm outwards Not necessary Well I lave it with you Good night captain n Good night to you sir said Pete He had laughed and tut tutted and lifted his eyebrows and his hands in mock protest and a pretence of indifference but the postman s talk had cut him to the quick People are suspecting he thought They re saying things This made him swear but a thought came behind that made him sweat instead Philip will be hearing them They ll be telling him she doesn t write to me that I don t know where she is that she has left me and that she s a bad woman To make Kate stand well with Philip was an aim that had no rival but one in Pete s reckoning to make Philip stand well with Kate Out of the shadow land of his memory of the awful night of his bereavement a recollection which had been lying dead until then came back now in its grave clothes to torture him It was what Caesar had said of Philip s fight with Ross Christian Philip himself had never mentioned it that was like him But when evil tongues told of Ross and hinted at mischief Philip would know something already he would be prepared perhaps he would listen and believe Two days longer Pete sat in the agony of this new terror and the dogged impatience of his old hope She ll write She ll not lave me much longer But she did not write and on the second night before returning to the house from the gate he had made his plan He must silence scandal at all hazards However his own heart might bleed with doubts and fears and misgivings Philip must never cease to think that Kate was good and sweet and true Off to bed Nancy he cried heaving into the hall like a man in drink I ve work to do to night and want the house to myself Goodness me is it yourself that s talking of bed then said Nancy Seven in the everin too and the child not an hour out of my hands And dear knows what work it is if you can t be doing it with good people about you Come get off woman you re looking tired mortal The lil one s ragging you ter ble But what s it saying Nancy bed is half bread Truth enough too and the other half is beauty Get off now You re spoiling your complexion dreadful I ll never be getting that husband for you Thus coaxing her cajoling her watching her dodging her nagging her driving her he got her off to bed at last Being alone he looked around listened shut the doors of the parlour and the kitchen put the bolt on the door of the stairs the chain on the door of the porch took off his boots and went about on tiptoe Then he blew out the lamp filled and trimmed and relit it going down on the hearthrug to catch the light of the fire After that he settled the table drew up the armchair took from a corner cupboard pens and ink a blotting pad a packet of notepaper and envelopes a stick of sealing wax a box of matches a postage stamp the dictionary and the exercise book in which Kate had taught him to write As the clock was striking nine Pete was squaring himself at the table pen in hand and his tongue in his left cheek Half an hour later he was startled by an interruption Who s there he shouted in a ferocious voice leaping up with a look of terror like a man caught in a crime It was only Nancy who had come creeping down the stairs under pretence of having forgotten the baby s bottle He made a sort of apologetic growl handed the flat bottle through an opening like a crack and ordered her back to bed Goodness sakes said Nancy going upstairs Is it coining money the man is Or is it whisky itself that s doing on him Two hours afterwards Pete fancied he saw a face at the window and he caught up a stick unchained the door and rushed into the garden It was no one the town lay asleep the night was all but airless only the faintest breeze moved the leaves of the trees there was no noise anywhere except the measured beat of the sea in its everlasting coming and going on the shore Stepping back into the house where the fire chirped and the kettle sang and all else was quiet he resumed his task and somewhere in the dark hours before the dawn he finished it The fingers of his right hand were then inky up to the first joint his collar was open his neck was bare his eyes were ablaze the cords on his face were big and blue great beads of cold sweat were standing on his forehead and the carpet around his chair was littered as white as if a snowstorm had fallen on it He went down on his knees and gathered up these remnants and burnt them with the air of a man destroying the evidences of his guilt Then he put back the ink and the dictionary the blotting pad and sealing wax and replaced them with a loaf of bread a table knife a bottle of brandy and a drinking glass After that he made up the fire with a shovel of slack that it might burn until morning removed the lamp from the table to the window recess that it might cast its light into the darkness outside and unchained the outer door that a wanderer of the night if any such there were might enter without knocking He did all this in the absent manner of a man who did it nightly Then unbolting the staircase door and listening a moment for the breathing of the sleepers overhead he crept into the dark parlour overlooking the road and lay down on the sofa to sleep It was done Pete s great scheme was afoot The mighty secret which he had enshrouded with such awful mystery lay in an envelope in the inside breast pocket of his monkey jacket signed sealed stamped and addressed Pete had written a letter to himself III Next day the crier was crying Great meeting Manx fishermen on Zigzag at Peel when boats come in to morrow morning protest agen harbour taxes The thing itself thought Pete with his hand pressed hard on the outside of his breast pocket At five o clock in the afternoon he went down to the harbour where his Nickey lay by the quay shouted to the master Take an odd man tonight mister Kemish then dropped to the deck and helped to fetch the boat into the bay They had to haul her out by poles alone the quay wall for the tide was low and there was no breakwater It was still early in the herring season but the fishing was in full swing Five hundred boats from all parts were making for the fishing round It lay off the south west tail of the island Before Pete s boat reached it the fleet were sitting together like a flight of sea fowl and the sun was almost gone The sun went down that night over the hills of Mourne very angry and red in its setting the sky to the north west was dark and sullen the round line of the sea was bleared and broken but there was little wind and the water was quiet Bring to and shoot cried Pete and they dropped sail to the landward of the fleet off the shoulder of the Calf Island with its two lights making one The boat was brought head to the wind with the flowing tide veering against her the nets were shot over the starboard quarter and they dropped astern the bow was swung round to the line of the floating mollags and boat and nets began to drift together Supper was served the pump was worked the lights were run up the small boat was sent round with a flare to fright away the evil spirits and then the night came down a dark night without moon or stars shutting out the island though it stood so near and even the rocks of the Hen and Chicken The first man for the look out took up his one hour s watch at the helm and the rest went below Pete s bunk was under the binnacle and the light of its lamp fell on a stamped envelope which he took out of his breast pocket from time to time that he might read the inscription It ran Capn Peatr Quilliam Lm Cottig Ramsey I O Man He looked at it lovingly fondly yearningly yet with a certain awe too as if it were the casket of some hidden treasure and he hardly knew what it contained The dim lit cabin was quiet the net boiler sparched drops of hot water at intervals the fire of the cooking stove slid and fell the men breathed heavily from unseen beds and the sea washed as the boat rolled What s she saying I wonder I wonder God bless her he mumbled and then he too fell asleep Two hours before hauling they proved the fishing by taking in a pair of the net found good herring and blew the horn as signal that they were doing well Then out of the black depths around wherein no boat could be seen the lights of other boats came floating silently astern until the company about them in the darkness was like a little city of the sea and the night At the first peep of morning over the round shoulder of the Calf the little city awoke There were the clicks of the capstan and the shouts of the men as the nets came back to the boats heavy and white with fish All being aboard the men went down on the deck according to their wont every man on his knee with his face in his cap and then leapt up with a shout perhaps an oath swung to the wind hoisted the square sails and made for home The dark northwest was lowering by this time and the sea was beginning to jump Breakfast boys sang out Pete with his head above the companion and all but the helmsman went below There was a pot full of the drop fish and every man ate his warp of herring It had been a great night s fishing Some of the boats were full to the mouth and all had plenty We ll do middling if we get a market said Pete We ve got to get home first said the master and at the same moment a sea struck the windward quarter with the force of a sledge hammer and the block at the masthead began to sing We ll run for Peel this morning boys said Pete smothering his voice in a mouthful Peel said the master shooting out his lip They ve got no harbour there at all with a cat s paw of a breeze let alone a northwester I m for going up to the meeting said Pete in an incoherent way Then they tacked before the rising gale and went off with the fleet as it swirled like a flight of gulls abreast of the wind The sea came tumbling down like a shoal of seahogs and washed the faces of the men as they sat in oilskins on the hatch head shaking the herring out of the nets into the hold But their work only began when they came into Peel The tide was down there was no breakwater the neck of the harbour was narrow and four hundred boats were coming to take shelter and to land their cargoes It was a scene of tumult and confusion shouting swearing and fighting among the men and crushing and cranching among the boats as they nosed their way to the harbour mouth threw ropes on to the quay where fifty ropes were round one post already or cast anchors up the bank of the castle rock which was steep and dangerous to lie on Pete got landed somehow but his Nickey with half the fleet turned tail and went round the island As he leapt ashore the helpless harbour master who had been bellowing over the babel through a cracked trumpet turned to him and said For the Lord s sake captain n Quilliam if you ve got a friend that can lend us a hand go off to the meeting at seven o clock I mane to said Pete but he had something else to do first It was the task that had brought him to Peel and no eye must see him do it Slowly and slyly like one who does a doubtful thing and pretends to be doing nothing he went stealing through the town behind the old Court house and up Castle Street into the market place and across it to the line of shops which make the principal thoroughfare At one of these shops a little single roomed place with its small shutter still up but the door half open and a noise of stamping going on inside he stopped in a lounging way half twisting on his heel as if idly looking back It was the Post Office With a stealthy look around he put a trembling hand into his breast pocket drew out the letter screened it by the flat of his big palm and posted it Then he turned hurriedly away and was gone in a moment like a man who feared pursuit down a steep and tortuous alley that led to the shore The morning was early the shops were not yet open only the homes of the fishermen were putting out curling wreaths of smoke the silent streets echoed to his lightest footstep But the shore road was busy enough Fishermen in sea boots and sou westers with oilskin over one arm and a string of herring in the other hand were trooping from the harbour up to the Zigzag by the rock called the Creg Malin It was at the end of the bay where cliff and beach and sea together form a bag like the cod end of the trawl net It s not the fishermen at all it s the farmers they re thinking of said one You re right said Pete and it s some of ourselves that s to blame for it How s that said somebody Aisy enough said Pete When I came home from Kimberly I met an ould fisherman you know the man Billy well you do Dan Phil Nelly of Ramsey How s the fishing Phil says I He gave me a Hm and a heise of his neck and I m not fishing no more says he The wife s keeping a private hotel says he And what are you doing yourself says I I m walking about says he and gough bless me if the man wasn t wearing a collar and carrying a stick and prating about advertising the island if you plaze At the sound of Pete s voice a group of the men gathered about him That s not the worst neither said he The other day I tumbled over Tom Hommy you know Tom Hommy yes you do the lil deaf man up Ballure He was lying in the hedge by the public house three sheets in the wind Why aren t you out with the boats Tom says I Wash for should I go owsh wish the boash when the childer can earn more on the roads says the drunken wastrel And is yonder your boys and girls tossing summersaults at the tail of the trippers car says I Yesh says he and they ll earn more in a day at their caperings than their father in a week at the herrings I believe it enough said one The man s about right said another and a querulous voice behind said Wonderful the prosperity of the island since the visitors came to it Get out with you there for a disgrace to the name of Manxman sang out Pete over the heads of those that stood between With the farming going to the dogs and the fishing going to the divil d ye know what the ould island s coming to It s coming to an island of lodging house keepers and hackney car drivers Not the Isle of Man at all but the Isle of Manchester There was a tremendous shout at this last word In another minute Pete was lifted shoulder high over the crowd on to the highest turn of the zigzag path and bidden to go on There were five hundred faces below him putting out hot breath in the cool morning air The sun was shooting over the cliffs a canopy as of smoke above their heads On the top of the crag the sea fowl were jabbering and the white sea itself was climbing on the beach Men said Pete there s not much to say This morning s work said everything We d a right fishing last night hadn t we Four hundred boats came up to Peel and we hadn t less than ten maise apiece That s you that s smart at your figguring and ciphering spake out now that s four thousand maise isn t it Shouts of Right Aw you re quick wonderful No houlding you at all when it s money that s in Four thousand maise ready and waiting for the steamers to England but did we land it No nor half of it neither The other half s gone round to other ports too late for the day s sailing and half of that half will be going rotten and getting chucked back into the sea That s what the Manx fishermen have lost this morning because they haven t harbours to shelter them and yet they re talking of levying harbour dues Man veen he s a boy He s all that Go it captain n What are we to do Do cried Pete I ll tell you what you re to do This is Friday Next Thursday is old Midsummer Day That s Tynwald Coort day Come to saint John s on Thursday every man of you come come in your sea boots and your jerseys let the Governor see you mane it Give us raisonable hope of harbour improvement and we ll pay says you If you don t we won t and if you try to make us we re two thousand strong and we ll rise like one man Don t be freckened you ve a right to be bould in a good cause I ll get somebody to spake for you You know the man I mane He s stood the fisherman s friend before to day and he isn t going taking off his cap to the best man that s setting foot on Tynwald Hill It was agreed Between that day and Tynwald day Pete was to enlist the sympathy of Philip and to go to Port saint Mary to get the company operation of the south side fishermen The town was astir by this time the sun was on the beach and the fishermen trooped off to bed IV Pete was back in his ship s cabin in the garden the same evening with a heart the heavier because for one short hour it had forgotten its trouble The flowers were opening the roses were creeping over the porch the blackbird was singing at the top of the tree but his own flower of flowers his rose of roses his bird of birds where was she Summer was coming coming coming coming with its light coming with its music coming with its sweetness but she came not The clock struck seven inside the house and Pete pipe in hand swung over to the gate No need to night to watch for the postman s peak no need to trace his toes A letter for you mister Quilliam Hearing these words Pete his eyes half shut as if dosing in the sunset wakened himself with a look of astonishment What For me is it A letter you say Aw I see taking it and turning it in his hand just a line from the mistress it s like Well well A letter for me if you plaze and he laughed like a man much tickled He was in no hurry He rammed his dead pipe with his finger lit it again sucked it made it quack drew a long breath and then said quietly Let s see what s her news at all He opened the letter leisurely and read bits of it aloud as if reading to himself but holding the postman while he did so in idle talk on the other side of the gate And how are you living to day mister Kelly Aw h m getting that much better it s extraordinary Yes a nice everin very mister Kelly nice nice that happy and comfortable and Uncle Joe is that good heavy bag at you to night you say Aw heavy yes heavy love to Grannie and all inquiring friends nothing mister Kelly nothing just a scribe of a line thinking a man might be getting unaisy She needn t though she needn t But chut It s nothing Writing a letter is nothing to her at all Why she d be knocking that off bless you holding out a half sheet of paper in less than an hour and a half Truth enough sir Then looking at the letter again What s this though PN They re always putting a P N at the bottom of a letter mister Kelly P N I was expecting to be home before but I wouldn t get away for Uncle Joe taking me to the theaytres Ha ha ha A mighty boy is Uncle Joe But mister Kelly mister Kelly with a solemn look not a word of this to Caesar The postman had been watching Pete out of the corners of his ferret eyes Do you know captain n what Black Tom is saying What s that said Pete with a sudden change of tone He s saying there is no Uncle Joe No Uncle Joe cried Pete lifting voice and eyebrows together The postman signified assent with a nod of his peak Well that s rich said Pete in a low breath raising his face as if to invoke the astonishment of the sky itself No Uncle Joe he repeated in a tone of blank incredulity Ask the man if it s in bed he is Why and Pete s eyes opened and closed like a doll s he ll be saying there s no Auntie Joney next The postman looked up inquiringly Never heard of Auntie Joney Uncle Joe s wife No Well really really is it sleeping I am Not Auntie Joney the Primitive Aw a good ould woman as ever lived A saint if ever the like was in and died a triumphant death too No theaytres for her though She won t bemane herself No but she s going to chapel reg lar and getting up in the middle of every night of life to say her prayers Deed she is So Black Tom says there is no Uncle Joe Pete gave a long whistle then stopped it sudden with his mouth agape and said from his throat I see He put his mouth close to the postman s ear and whispered Ever hear Black Tom talk of the fortune he s expecting through the Coort of Chancery The postman s peak bobbed downwards You have Tom s thinking to grab it all for himself Ha ha That s it Ha ha The postman went off blinking and giggling and Pete reeled up the path biting his lip and muttering Keep it up Pete keep it up it s ploughing a hard furrow though Then aloud A letter from the mistress Nancy Nancy met him in the porch clearing her fingers thick with dough There you are said Pete flapping the letter on one hand Good sakes alive said Nancy Did it come by the post though Pete Look at the stamp woman and see for yourself said Pete My goodness me From Kirry you say Let me in then and I ll be reading you bits Nancy went back to her kneading with looks of bewilderment and Pete followed her opening the letter She s well enough Nancy no need to read that part at all But see running his forefinger along the writing Kisses for the baby and love to Nancy and tell Grannie not to be fretting et setterer et setterer See Nancy looked up at her thumping and thunging and said Did mister Kelly give it you He did that said Pete this minute at the gate It s his time isn t it Nancy glanced at the clock I suppose it must be right she said Take it in your hand woman said Pete Nancy cleaned her hands and took the letter turned it over and felt it in her fingers as if it had been linen And this is from Kirry is it It s nice too I haven t much schooling Pete but I m asking no better than a letter myself It s like a peppermint in your frock on Sunday if you re low you re always knowing it s there anyway She looked at it again and then she said like one who says a strange thing I once had a letter myself deed I had Pete It was from father He went down in the Black Sloop trading oranges with the blacks in their own island somewhere They put into the port of London one day when they were having a funeral there What s this one they were calling after the big boots Wellingtons that s the man They were writing home all about it the people and the chariots and the fighting horses and the music in the streets and the Cateedrals and we were never hearing another word from them again never To Miss Annie Cain your affecshunet father Joe Cain I knew it all off every word and I kept it ten years in my box under the lavender Philip came later He was looking haggard and tired his face was pallid and drawn his eyes were red quick and wandering his hair was neglected and ragged his step was wavering and uncertain Gough alive man cried Pete didn t you take oath to do justice between man and man Philip looked up with alarm Well he said Well cried Pete with a frown and a clenched fist there s one man you re not doing justice to Who s that said Philip with eyes down Yourself said Pete and Philip drew a long breath Pete laughed protested that Philip must not work so hard and then plunged into an account of the morning s meeting Tremenjous Talk of enthusiasm Man veen man veen Didn t I say we d rise as one man We will too We re going up to Tynwald Coort on Tynwald day two thousand strong Tynwald Coort Yes and why not Drum and fife bands bless you two of them Not much music maybe but there ll be noise enough It s all settled Southside fishermen are coming up Foxal way north side men going down by Peel Meeting under Harry Delany s tree and going up to the hill on mass en masse No bawling though no singing out no disturbing the Coort at all Well well What then said Philip Then we re wanting you to spake for us Dempster Aw nothing much nothing to rag you at all Just tell them flat we won t that ll do It s a serious matter Pete I must think it over Aw think and think enough Dempster but mind you do it though The boys are counting on you He s our anchor and he ll hould they re saying But bother the harbours anyway reaching his hand for something on the mantelpiece What do you think Nay said Philip with a long breath of weariness and relief Guess then said Pete putting his hand behind him Philip shook his head and smiled feebly Then with the expression of a boy on his birthday Pete leaned over Philip and said in a half whisper across the top of his head I ve heard from Kate Philip turned ghastly his lip trembled and he stammered You ve you ve heard from Kate have you Look at that cried Pete and round came the letter with a triumphant sweep Philip s respiration grew difficult and noisy Slowly very slowly he reached out his hand took the letter and looked at its superscription Read it read it said Pete no secrets at all With head down and eyebrows hiding his eyes with trembling hands that tore the envelope Philip took out the letter and read it in passages broken blurred smudged as by the smoke of a fo c stle lamp Deerest peat i am gettin that much better i am that happy and comforbel sometimes i am longing for a sight of the lil ones swate face no more at present ure own trew wife Come to the P N yet Philip said Pete He was on his knees before the fire lighting his pipe with a red coal axpectin to be home sune but give my luv and bess respects to the Dempster when you see him he was so good to me when were forren the half was never towl you She s not laving a man unaisy you see said Pete Philip could not speak His throat was choking his tongue filled his mouth his eyes were swimming in tears that scorched them Nancy who had been up to Sulby with news of the letter came in at the moment and Philip raised his head I told my aunt not to expect me to night Nancy Is my room upstairs ready Aw yes always ready your honour said Nancy with a curtsey He got up with head aside took a candle from Nancy s hand excused himself to Pete he was tired sleepy had a heavy day to morrow said Good night and went upstairs stumbling and floundering tore open his bedroom door and clashed it back like a man flying from an enemy Pete thought he had succeeded to admiration but he looked after Philip and was not at ease He had no misgivings Writing was writing to him and it was nothing more But in the deep midnight Philip who had not slept heard a thick voice that was like a sob coming from somewhere downstairs He opened his door crept out on to the stairhead and listened The house was dark In some unseen place the voice was saying Lord forgive me for deceaving Philip I couldn t help it though Thou knows Thyself I couldn t A lie s a dirty thing Lord It s like chewing dough it sticks in your throat and chokes you But I had to do it to save my poor lost lamb and if I didn t I should go mad myself Thou knows I should So forgive me Lord for Kirry s sake Amen The thick voice stopped the house lay still then the child awoke in a room beyond and its thin cry came through the darkness Philip crept back in terror This is what she had to go through O God My God V Caesar called next day and took Pete to the office of the High Bailiff where the business of the mortgage was completed The deeds of Ballawhaine were then committed to Caesar s care for custody and safe keeping and he carried them off to his safe at the mill with a long stride and a face of fierce triumph The ould Ballawhaine is dying he thought and if we kick out the young one some day it ll only be the Lord s hand on a rascal On drawing his big cheque Pete had realised that with reckless spending and more reckless giving he had less than a hundred pounds to his credit No matter he thought Philip will pay me back when he comes in to his own Grannie was with Nancy at Elm Cottage when Pete returned home The child was having its morning bath and the two women were on their knees at either side of the tub cackling and crowing like two old hens over one egg Aw did you ever now Nancy Deed no you never did see such a lil angel Up a daisy Cry I must Grannie when I see it looking so beautiful Warm towels you say I m a girl of this sort when I get my heart down I can never get it up again Fuller s earth is it Here then Boo loo loo the bog millish Nancy we must be shortening her soon And with that they fell to an earnest council on frocks and petticoats and other mysteries unread by man Pete sat and watched and listened People will be crying shame on her if they see the Grannie doing everything he thought That night he lounged through the town and examined the shop windows out of the corner of his eye He was trying to bear himself like a workman enjoying his Saturday night s ramble in clean clothes but the streets were thronged and he found himself observed Not here he told himself I can buy nothing here Doesn t do to be asleep at all and a man isn t always in bed when he s sleeping Some hours later Nancy and the child being upstairs Pete bethought himself of something that was kept at the bottom of a drawer Going to the drawer to open it he found it stiff to his tugging and it came back with a jerk which showed it had not lately been disturbed Pete found what he looked for and came upon something beside It was a cardboard box tied about with a string which was knotted in a peculiar way Kate s knot thought Pete with a sigh He slipped it and opened the lid and took out a baby s hood of scarlet plush The very thing he thought He held it mouth open over his big brown hand and laughed with delight She s been buying it for the child and never using it His eyes glistened The very thing he thought and then he took down pen and paper to write something to go with it This is what he wrote For lil Katerin from her Luvin mother Then he held it at arm s length and looked at it The subscription crossed the whole face of a half sheet of paper But the triumphant success of his former effort had made him bold He could not resist the temptation to write more So he turned the paper over and wrote on the back tell pa pa not to wurry about me i aspect to be home sune but dont no ezactly His eyes were swimming by the time he got that down but they brightened again as he remembered something Weve had grate times ear uncle Jo Must go on milking that ould cow he thought tuk me to sea the prins of Wales yesterda He could not help it he began to take a wild joy in his own inventions flags and banns of musick all day and luminerashuns all night it was grand we were top of an umnibuss goin down lord strete and saw him as plane as plane Bless me said Pete dropping his pen and rubbing his hands in ravishing contemplation of his own fiction the next thing we hear she ll be riding in her carriage and pair He was sobbing a little for all that in a low smothered way but he could not deny himself one word more luv to all enquirin frens and bess respecs to the Dempster if im not forgot at him This second forgery of love being finished he went about the house on tiptoe found brown paper and twine put the hood back into the box with his half sheet peeping from between the frills where the little face would go and made it up with his undeft fingers into an ungainly parcel which he addressed to himself as before After that he did his accustomed duty with the lamp and the door and lay down in the parlour to sleep On Monday at dinner he broke out peevishly with Ter ble botheration Nancy I must be going to Port saint Mary about that thundering demonstration Then from underneath the sofa in the parlour he rooted up a brown paper parcel stuffed it under his coat buttoned it up and so smuggled it out of the house VI They set sail early in the afternoon and ran down the coast under a fair breeze that made the canvas play until the sea hissed The day was wet and cheerless a thick mist enshrouded the land and going by Laxey they could just descry the top arc of the great wheel like a dun coloured ghost of a rainbow in a grey sky As they came to Douglas the mist was lifting but the rain was coming down in a soaking drizzle A band was playing dance tunes on the iron pier which shot like a serpent s tongue out of the mouth of the bay The steamer from England was coming round the head and her sea sick passengers were dense as a crowd on her forward deck the men with print handkerchiefs tied over their caps the women with their skirts over their drooping feathers A harp and a violin were scraping lively airs amidships The town was like a cock with his tail down crowing furiously in the wet When they came to Port saint Mary the mist had risen and the rain was gone but the fishing town looked black and sullen under a lowering cloud The tide was down and many boats lay on the beach and in the shallow water within the rocks Pete was put ashore his Nickey went round the Calf to the herring ground beyond the shoulder a number of fishermen were waiting for him on the quay with heavy looks and hands deep in their trousers pockets No need for much praiching at all said Pete pointing to the boats lying aground There you are boys fifty of you at the least with no room to warp for the rocks Yet they re for taxing you for dues for a harbour Go ahead captain n said one of the fishermen there s five hundred men here to back you up through thick and thin Pete posted his brown paper parcel as stealthily as he had posted his letter and left Port saint Mary the same night for Douglas The roads were thick with coaches choked full with pleasure seekers from Port Erin These cheerful souls were still wearing the clothes which had been drenched through in the morning their boots were damp and cold they were chill with the night air but they did not repine They sang and laughed and ate oranges drew up frequently at wayside houses and handed round bottles of beer with the corks drawn In their own way they were bright and cheerful company Sometimes Hold the Fort sung in a brake going ahead mingled with Molly and I and the Baby from lusty throats coming behind Battling through Castletown they shouted wild chaff at the redcoats lounging by the Castle and when the darkness fell they dropped asleep the men usually on the women s shoulders and then the horses hoofs were heard splashing along the muddy road and every rider cracked his whip over a chorus of stertorous snores Douglas was ablaze with light as they dipped down to it from the dark country Long sinuous tails of light where the busy streets were running in and out this way and that and belching into the wide squares and market places like the race of a Curragh fire The sleepers awoke and shook themselves Going to the Castle to night said one What do you think said another and they all laughed at the foolish question I ll sleep here thought Pete I ve not searched Douglas yet The driver found him a bed at his mother s house It was a lodging house in Church Street overlooking the churchyard Finding himself so near to Athol Street Pete thought he would look at the outside of Philip s chambers He lit on the house easily though the street was dark It was one of a line of houses having brass plates each with its name and always the word Advocate Philip s house bore one plate only a small one with the name hardly legible in the uneertain light It ran The Deemster Christian Having spelt out this inscription Pete crept away That was the last house in the island at which he wished to call He was almost afraid of being seen in the same town Philip might think he was in Douglas to look for Kate Pete rambled through the narrow thoroughfares of Post Office Place Heywood Lane and Fancy Street until he came to the sea front It was now full tide of busy night and the holiday town seemed to be given over to enjoyment The steps of the terraces were thronged itinerant photographers pitched their cameras on the curb stones every open window had its dark heads with the light behind pianos were clashing in the houses harps were twanging in the street tinkling tram cars like toast racks were sweeping the curve of the bay there was a steady flow of people on the pavement and from water s edge to cliff top three parts round like a horse s shoe the town flashed and fizzed and sparkled and blazed under its thousand lights with the splendour of a forest fire Pete called to mind the blinking and groping of the dear old half lit town to the north he remembered the dark village at the foot of the lonely hills with its trout stream burrowing under the low bridge and he thought She may have tired of it all poor thing He looked at every woman s face as she went by him hungering for one glimpse of a face he feared to see He did not see it and he wandered like a lost soul through the little gay town until he drifted with the wave that flowed around the bay into the place that was known as the Castle It was a dancing palace in a garden built in the manner of a conservatory with the ground level for those who came to dance and the galleries for such as came to see Seated by the front rail of the gallery Pete peered down into the faces below Three thousand young men and young women were dancing the men in flannels and coloured scarves the women in light muslins and straw hats Sometimes the white lights in the glass roof were coloured with red and blue and yellow The low buzz of the dancers feet the clang and clash of the brass instruments the boom of the big drum the quake of the glass house itself and the low rumble of the hollow floor beneath it was like a battle field set to music She may have tired poor thing God knows she may thought Pete His eyes were growing hazy and his head dizzy when he became conscious of a waft of perfume behind him and a soft voice saying at his ear Were you looking for anybody then He turned with a start and looked at the speaker It was a young girl with a pretty face thick with powder He could not be angry with the little thing she was so young and she was smiling Yes he said I was looking for somebody and then he tried to shake her off Is it Maudie you mane dear Are you the young man from Dublin Lave me my girl lave me said Pete patting her hand and twisting about The girl looked at him with a sort of pity and then close at his neck she said A fine boy like you shouldn t be going fretting his heart about the best girl that s in He looked at the pretty face again and the little knowing airs began to break down You re a Manx girl aren t you The smile vanished like a flash How do you know that My tongue doesn t tell you does it And the little thing was ashamed Pete took the tight gloved fingers in his big palm So you re my lil countrywoman then he said How old are you The painted lips began to tremble Sixteen for harvest she answered My God exclaimed Pete The darkened eyelids blinked she was beginning to cry It wasn t my fault He was a visitor with my mother at Ballaugh and he left me to it Pete took a sovereign out of his pocket and shut it in the girl s hand Go home to night my dear he whispered and then he clambered out of the place Not there cried Pete in his heart not there I swear to God she is not there That ended his search He resolved to go home the same night and he went back to his lodgings to pay his bill Turning out of Athol Street Pete was almost overrun by a splendid equipage with two men in buff on the box seat and one man behind The Governor s carriage said somebody At the next moment it drew up at Philip s door its occupant alighted and then it swung about and moved away It was the young Deemster said a girl to her companion as she went skipping past Pete had seen the tall dark figure bent and feeble as it walked heavily up the steps Truth enough he thought there s nothing got in this world without paying the price of it It was three in the morning when Pete reached Ramsey Elm Cottage was dark and silent He had to knock again and again before awakening Nancy Now if this had been Kate he thought and a new fear took hold of him His poor darling his wandering lamb could she have knocked twice Where was she to night He had been picturing her in happiness and plenty was she in poverty and distress All the world was sleeping was she asleep His hope was slipping away his great faith was breaking down Lord do not forsake me Master strengthen me My poor lost love where is she What is she Shall I see her face again Something cold touched his hand It was the dog Without a bark he had put his nose into Pete s palm What Dempster man Dempster The bat s ears were cocked Pete felt them the scut of a tail was wagged and Pete got comfort from the battered old friend that had tramped the world at his heels Nancy unchained the door opened it an inch held a candle over her head and peered out My goodness is it the man himself However did you come home By John the Flayer s pony said Pete and he laughed and made light of his night long walk But next morning when Nancy came downstairs with the child Pete was busy with a screwdriver taking the chain off the door Ter ble ould fashioned these chains must be moving with the times you know Then what are you putting in its place said Nancy You ll see you ll see said Pete At seven that night Pete was smoking over the gate when Kelly the Thief came up with a brown paper parcel Parcel for you mister Quilliam said the postman with the air of a man who knew something he should not know Pete blinked and looked bewildered You don t say he said Well if that s your name began the postman holding the address for Pete to read Pete gave it a searching look Cap n Peatr Quilliam that s it sartenly Lm Cottig yes it must be right he said taking the parcel gingerly Then with a prolonged O o shutting his eyes and nodding his head I know a bit of a present from the mother to the lil one Wonderful thoughtful a woman is about a baby when she s a mother mister Kelly The postman giggled threw his finger seaward over one shoulder and said Why aren t you writing back to her then What s that said Pete sharply making the parcel creak Why aren t you writing to tell her how the lil one is I m saying Pete looked at the postman as if the idea had dropped from heaven I must have a head as thick as a mooring post mister Kelly Do you know I never once thought of it I m like Goliath when he got little David s stone at his forehead such a thing never entered my head before Do it for all mister Quilliam said the postman moving off I will I will said Pete and then he turned into the house Scissors Nancy he shouted throwing the parcel on the table My sakes a parcel cried Nancy Aisy to tell where it comes from too See that knot woman said Pete with a knowing wink What in the world is it Pete said Nancy I wonder said Pete Papers enough round it anyway A letter We ll look at that after he said loftily and then out came the scarlet hood Gough bless mee what s this thing at all and he held it up by the crown Nancy made a cry of alarm took the hood out of his hand and scolded him roundly These men they re fit to spoil an angel s wings Then she whipped up the baby out of the cradle tried the hood on the little round head and shouted with delight Now I was thinking of that d ye know she said I was yes I was believe me or not I was Kirry will be sending something for the lil one the next time she writes I was thinking and behould ye here it is Something spakes to us Nancy said Pete Deed it does though The child gurgled and purred and for all her fine headgear she was absorbed in her bare toes And there s yourself Pete going to Peel and to Douglas and I don t know where and you ve never once thought of the lil one and knowing we were for shortening her too Pete cast down his head and looked ashamed Well no of coorse I never have that s truth enough he faltered VII Pete went out to buy a sheet of notepaper and an envelope a pen and a postage stamp He had abundance of all theso at home but that did not serve his turn Going to as many shops as might be he dropped hints everywhere of the purpose to which his purchases were to be put Finally he went to the barber s in the market place and said Will you write an address for me Jonaique Coorse I will said the barber sweeping a hand of velvet over one cheek of the postman who was in the chair leaving the other cheek in lather while he took up the pen Mistress Peter Quilliam care of Master Joseph Quilliam Esquire Scotland Road Liverpool dictated Pete What number captain n said Jonaique Number said Pete perplexed Bless me what s this the number is now Oh by a sudden inspiration five hundred and fifteen Five hundred d ye say five said the postman from the half of his mouth that was clear Five said Pete emphatically Aw they re well up If you say so captain n said the barber and down went five hundred fifteen Pete returned home with the stamped and addressed envelope open in his hands Clane the table quick he shouted I must be writing to Kirry Will I give her your love Nancy With much hem ing and ha ing and clearing of his throat Pete was settling himself before a sheet of note paper when the door opened and Philip stepped into the house His face was haggard and emaciated his eyes burned as with a fire that came up from within I ve come to warn you he said you are in great danger You must stop that demonstration Sit down sir sit down said Pete Philip did not seem to hear He walked to and fro with short nervous noiseless steps The Governor sent for me last night and I found him in a frenzy Deemster he said they tell me there s to be a disturbance at Tynwald have you heard of anything I said Yes I had heard of a meeting of fishermen at Peel They talk of their rights said he I ll teach them something of one right they seem to forget the right of the Governor to shoot down the disturbers of Tynwald without judge or jury That s a very old prerogative your Excellency I said it comes down from more lawless days than ours You will never use it Will I not said he Listen I ll tell you what I ve done already I ve ordered the regiment at Castletown to be on Tynwald Hill on Tynwald day Every man of these there are three hundred shall have twenty rounds of ball cartridge Then if the vagabonds try to interrupt the Court I ve only to lift my hand so and they ll be mown down like grass You can t mean it I said and I tried to take his big talk lightly Judge for yourself see and he showed me a paper It was an order for the ambulance waggons to be stationed on the ground and a request to the doctors of Douglas to be present Then we ve made the ould boy see that we mane it said Pete If you know any one of the ringleaders Deemster he said with a look into my face somebody had been with him there are tell tales everywhere It s the way of the world still said Pete Tell him said he that I don t want to take the life of any man I don t want to send any one to penal servitude It was useless to protest The man was mad but he was in earnest His plan was folly frantic folly but it was based on a sort of legal right So for the Lord s sake Pete stop this thing Stop it at once and finally It s life or death If ever you thought my word worth anything you ll do as I bid you now God knows where I should be myself if the Governor were to do what he threatens Stop it stop it I haven t slept for thinking of it Pete had been sitting at the table chewing the tip of the pen and now he lifted to the paleness and wildness of Philip s face a cool bold smile It s good of you Phil We ve a right to be there though haven t we You ve a right certainly but Then by gough we ll go said Pete dropping the pen and bringing his fist down on the table The penalty will be yours Pete yours You are the man who will suffer you first you alone Pete smiled again No use I m incorr ible I m like Dan ny Clae the sheep stealer when he came to die I m going to eternal judgment what ll I do says Dan Give back all you ve stolen says the parzon I ll chance it first says the ould rascal It s the other fellow that s for stealing this time but I ll chance it Philip Death it may be and judgment too but I ll chance it boy Philip s eyes wandered over the floor Then you ll not change your plan for anything I ve told you I will though said Pete for one thing anyway You shan t be getting into trouble I ll be spokesman for the fishermen myself Oh I ll spake enough if they get my dander up I ll just square my arms acrost my chest and I ll say Your Excellency I ll say you can t do it and you shan t do it because it isn t right But chut botheration to all such bobbery Look here man alive look here She s not forgetting the lil one you see and making a proud sweep of the hand Pete pointed to the scarlet hood It had been put to sit across the back of a china dog on the mantelpiece with Pete s half sheet of paper pinned to the strings Philip recognised it The hood was the present he had made as godfather His eyes blinked his mouth twitched the cords of his forehead moved So she she sent that he stammered Listen here said Pete and he unpinned the paper and read the message aloud with flourishes of voice and gesture For lil Katherine from her loving mother papa not to worry love to all inquiring friends best respects to the Dempster if Im not forgot at him Then in an off hand way he tossed the paper into the fire Aw what s a bit of a letter he said largely as it took flame and burned Philip s bloodshot eyes seemed to be starting from his head Nancy s right a man would never have thought of the like of that now would he said Pete looking proudly from Philip to the hood and from the hood back to Philip Philip did not answer Something seemed to be throttling him But when a woman goes away she leaves her eyes behind her as you might say What ll I be getting for them that s at home she s thinking and up comes a nice warm lil thing for the baby Aw the women s good Philip They re what they make the sovereigns of God bless them Philip felt as if he must rush out of the house shrieking One moment he stood up before Pete as though he meant to say something and then he turned to go Not sleeping to night no Have to get back to Douglas Then maybe you ll write me a letter first Philip nodded his head and returned his mouth tightly closed sat down at the table and took up the pen What is it he asked Am I to give you the words Phil Yes Well if you won t be thinking mane Pete charged His pipe out of his waistcoat pocket and began to dictate Dear wife At that Philip gave an involuntary cry Aw best to begin proper you know Dear wife said Pete again Philip made a call on his resolution and put the words down His hand felt cold his heart felt frozen to the core Pete lit up and walked to and fro as he dictated his letter Nancy sat knitting by the cradle with one foot on the rocker Glad to get your welcome letter darling and the bonnet for the baby Go on said Philip in an impassive voice Got that down Philip Aw you re smart wonderful with the pen though When she s got it on her lil head you d laugh tremenjous She s straight like a lil John the Baptist in the church window Pete paused Philip lifted his pen and waited Done already Man veen there s no houlding you Glad to hear you re so happy and comfortable with Uncle Joe and Auntie Joney Give the pair of them my fond love and best respects We re getting on beautiful and I m as happy as a sandboy Sometimes Grannie gets a bit down with longing and so does Nancy but I tell them you ll be home for their funeral sarmon anyway and then they re comforted wonderful Don t be writing his rubbage and lies your Honour said Nancy Chut woman where s the harm at all A merry touch to keep a person s spirits up when she s away from home eh Philip and Pete appealed to him with a nudge at his writing elbow Philip gave no sign With a look of stupor he was staring down at the paper as he wrote Pete puffed and went on Caesar s at it still going through the Bible same as a trawl boat fishing up the little texes The Dempster s putting a sight on us reg lar and you re not forgot at him neither Deed no but thinking of you constant and trusting you re the better for laving home Going too fast am I So I m bating you at last eh A cold perspiration had broken out on Philip s forehead and he was looking up with the eyes of a hunted dog Am I to must I write that he said in a helpless way Coorse go ahead said Pete puffing clouds of smoke and laughing Philip wrote it His hand was now stiff It sprawled and splashed over the paper As for myself I m a sort of a grass widow and if you keep me without a wife much longer they ll be taxing me for a bachelor Pete put his pipe on the mantelpiece cleared his throat repeatedly and began to be afflicted with a cough Glad to hear you re coming home soon darling cough Dearest Kirry I m missing you mortal cough worse nor at Kimberley cough When I m going to bed Where is she to night I m saying And when I m getting up Where is she now I m thinking And in the dark midnight I m asking myself Is she asleep I wonder Cough cough Come home quick bogh but not before you re well at all Never do to fetch her too soon you know he said in a whisper over Philip s shoulder with another nudge at his elbow Philip answered incoherently and shrank under Pete s touch as if he had been burnt The coughing continued the dictating began again I m keeping a warm nest for you here love There ll be a welcome from everybody and nobody saying anything but the good and the kind So come home soon my true lil wife before the foolish ould heart of your husband is losing him Pete coughed violently and stretched his neck and mouth awry This cough I ve got in my neck is fit to tear me in pieces he said A spoonful of cold pinjane Nancy it s ter ble good to soften the neck Nancy was nodding over the cradle she had fallen asleep Philip had turned white and giddy and sick For one moment an awful impulse seized him He wanted to fall on Pete to lay hold of him to choke him The consciousness of his own inferiority his own duplicity made him hate Pete The very sweetness of the man sickened him He could not help it the last spark of his self pride was fighting for its life Then in shame in remorse in horror of himself and dread of everything he threw down the pen caught up his hat shouted Good night in a voice like the growl of a beast in terror and ran out of the house Nancy started up from a doze Goodness grazhers she cried and the cradle rocked violently under her foot He s that tender hearted and sympathising whispered Pete as he closed the door Cough cough The letter s finished though and here s the envelope VIII The following evening the Deemster was in his rooms in Athol Street His hat was on his cloak was over his arm he was resting his elbow on the sash of the window and looking vacantly into the churchyard Jem was behind him answering at his back Their voices were low they scarcely moved All well upstairs said Philip Pretty well your Honour More cheerful and content Much more except when your Honour is from home The Deemster s back she ll say and her poor face will be like sunshine on a rainy day Philip remained silent for a moment and then said in a scarcely audible voice Not fretting so much about the child Jemmy Just as anxious to hear of it though Has he been to Ramsey to day Did he see her Is she well That s the word constant sir The Deemster was silent again and Jem was withdrawing with a deep bow Jemmy I m going to Government House and may be late Don t wait up for me Jem answered in a half whisper Some one waits up for your Honour whether I do or not He s at home now she ll say and then creep away to bed Philip muttered thickly and huskily The decanter is empty leave out another bottle Then he turned to go from the room keeping his eyes from his servant s face He found the Governor as violent as before and eager to fall on him before he had time to speak They tell me Deemster that the leader of this rising is a sort of left hand relative of yours Surely you can stop the man I ve tried to your Excellency and failed said Philip The Governor tossed up his chin I m told the fellow can t even write his own name he said It s true said Philip An illiterate and utterly uneducated person All the same he s the wisest and strongest man on this island said Philip decisively The Governor frowned and the pockmarks on his forehead seemed to swell The wisest and strongest man on this island will have to leave it he said Philip made no answer He had come to plead but he saw that it was hopeless The Governor put his right hand in the breast of his white waistcoat he was alone in the dining room after dinner and darted at Philip a look of anger and command Deemster he said if as you say you cannot stop this low bred rascal there s one thing you can do leave him to himself That is to say said Philip out of a corner of his mouth to you To me be it and who has more right said the Governor hotly Philip held himself in hand He was silent and his silence was taken for submission Cracking some nuts and munching them the Governor began to take another tone I should be sorry mister Christian if anything came between you and me very sorry We ve been good friends thus far and you will allow that you owe me something Don t you see it yourself this man is dishonouring me in the eyes of the island If you have tried your best to keep his neck out of the halter let the consequences be his own Eh said Philip with his eyes on the floor You have done your duty by the man I say Help yourself to a glass of wine Still Philip did not speak The Governor saw his advantage but little did he guess the pitiless power of it The fellow is your kinsman Deemster and I shall not ask you to deal with him That would be inhuman If there is no hope of restraining him to morrow wise as he is if he will not listen to saner counsels I will only beg of you but this is a matter for the police You are a high official now It would be a pity to give you pain Stay at home I ll gladly excuse you you look as if a day s rest would do you good Philip drank two glasses of the wine in quick succession The Governor poured him a third and went on I don t know what you re feeling for the man may be it can t be friendship I m sure he s a thorn in your flesh And as long as he s here he will always be Philip looked up with inquiry doubt and fear Ah I knew it Even if this matter goes by your time will come You ll quarrel with the fellow yet you know you will it s in the nature of things if he s the man you say Philip drank the third glass of wine and rose to go Leave him to me I ll deal with him You ll be done with him and a good riddance too I reckon And now come in to the ladies they ll know you re here Philip excused himself and went off with feverish gestures and an excited face The Governor is right he thought as he went home over the dark roads Pete was a thorn in his flesh and always would be his enemy his relentless enemy notwithstanding his love for him The misery of the past month could not be supported any longer Perpetual fear of discovery perpetual guard of the tongue keeping watch and ward on every act of life to day to morrow the next day on and on until life s end in wretchedness or disgrace it was insupportable it was impossible it could not be attempted Then came thoughts that were too fearful to take form too awful to take words They were like the flapping of unseen wings going by him in the night but the meaning of them was this If Pete persists in his purpose there will be a riot If any one is injured Pete will be transported If any one is killed Pete will be indicted for his life Well I have done my duty by him his heart whimpered I have tried to restrain him I have tried to restrain the Governor It isn t my fault What more can I do Philip walked fast Here was the way of escape from the evil that beset his path Fate was stretching out her hands to him When men had done wrong they did yet more wrong to elude the consequences of their first fault but there was no need for that in his case The hour was late A strong breeze was blowing off the sea It flicked his face with salt as he went swinging down the hill into the town His blood was a fire He had a feeling never felt before of courage and even ferocity Something told him that he was not so good a man as he had been but it was a tingling pleasure to feel that he was a stronger man than before Should he tell Kate No Let the thing go on let it end After it was over she would see where their account lay Thinking in this way he laughed aloud The town was quiet when he came to it So absorbed had he been that though the air was sharp he had been carrying his cloak over his arm Now he put it on and drew the hood close over his head A dog a homeless cur had begun to follow at his heels He drove it off but it continued to hang about him At last it got in front of his feet and he stumbled over it in one of his large quick strides Then he kicked the dog and it crossed the dark street yelping He was a worse man and he knew it He let himself into the house with his latch key and banged the door behind his back But no sooner had he breathed the soft woolly stagnant air within than a change came over him His ferocious strength ebbed away and he began to tremble The hall passage and staircase were in darkness This was by his orders coming in late he always forgot to put out the gas But the lamp of his room was burning on the candle rest at the stairhead and it cast a long sword of light down the staircase well Chilled by some unknown fear he had set one foot on the first tread when he thought he heard the step of some one coming down the stairs It was a familiar step He was sure he knew it It must be a step he heard daily He stopped and the step seemed to stop also At that moment there was a shuffling of slippered feet on an upper landing and Jem y Lord called down Is it you your Honour With an effort he answered Yes Is anything the matter called the man servant There s somebody coming downstairs isn t there said Philip Somebody coming downstairs repeated the man servant and the light shifted as if he were lifting the lamp Is it you coming down Jem Me coming down I m here holding the lamp your Honour Another of my fancies thought Philip and he laid hold of the handrail and started afresh The step came on He knew it now it was his own step An echo he told himself A dream he thought a mirage of the mind and he compelled himself to go up The step came down It passed him on the stairs going by the wall as he went by the rail with an irresistible down drive headlong heavily Then came one of those moments of partial unconsciousness in which the sensation of a sound takes shape It seemed to Philip that the figure of a man had passed him He remembered it instantly It was the same that he had seen in the lobby to the Council Chamber his own figure but wrapped in a cloak like the one he was then wearing and with the hood drawn over the head The body had been half turned aside the face had been hidden and the whole form had expressed contempt repugnance and loathing Not well to night your Honour said the far off voice of Jem y Lord He was holding the dazzling lamp up to the Deemster s face A little faint that s all Go to bed Then Philip was alone in his room Conscience he thought Pete may go but this will be with me to the end Which O God which He poured out half a tumbler from the bottle on the table and gulped it down at a draught At the same moment he heard a light foot overhead It was a woman s foot it crossed the floor and then ceased IX Next morning the Deemster was still sleeping while the sun was shining into his room He was awakened by a thunderous clamour which came as from a nail driven into the back of his head Opening his eyes he realised that somebody was knocking at his door and shouting in a robustious bass Christian I say Ever going to get up at all It was the Clerk of the Rolls Under one of his heavy poundings the catch of the door gave way and he stepped into the room Degenerate Manxman he roared In bed on Tynwald morning Pooh this room smells of dead sleep dead spirits and dead everything Let me get at that window you pitch your clothes all over the floor Ah that s fresher Headache I should think so Get up then and I ll drive you to saint John s Don t think I ll go to day sir said Philip in a feeble whimper Not go Holy saints Judge of his island and not go to Tynwald What will the Governor say He said last night he would excuse my absence Excuse your fiddlesticks The air will do you good I ve got the carriage below Listen it s striking ten by the church I ll give you fifteen minutes and step into your breakfast room and look over the Times The Clerk rolled out and then Philip heard his loud voice through the door in conversation with Jem y Lord And how s missus Cottier to day Middling sir thank you sir You don t let us see too much of her Jemmy Not been well since coming to Douglas sir Cups and saucers rattled the newspaper creaked the Clerk cleared his throat and there was silence Philip rose with a heavy heart still in the torment of his great temptation He remembered the vision of the night before and broad morning as it was he trembled In the Isle of Man such visions are understood to foretell death and the man who sees them is said to see his soul But Philip had no superstitions He knew what the vision was he knew what the vision meant Jem y Lord came in with hot water and Philip without looking round said in a low tone as the door closed How now my lad Fretting again your Honour said the man in a half whisper He busied himself in the room a moment and then added Somehow she gets to know things Yesterday evening now I was taking down some of the bottles and I met her on the stairs Next time I saw her she was crying Philip said in a confused way fumbling the razor Tell her I intend to see her after Tynwald I have your Honour It s not that mister Cottier she answered me My wig and gown to day Jemmy said Philip and he went out in his robes as Deemster The day was bright and the streets were thronged with vehicles Brakes wagonettes omnibuses private carriages and cadger s carts all loaded to their utmost were climbing out of Douglas by way of the road to Peel The town seemed to shout the old island rock itself seemed to laugh Bless me Christian said the Clerk of the Rolls looking at his watch do you know it s half past ten Service begins at eleven Drive on coachman You ve eight miles to do in half an hour Can t go any faster with this traffic on the road sir said the coachman over his shoulder I got so absorbed in the newspaper said the Clerk that Well if we re late we re late that s all Philip folded his arms across his breast and hung his head He was fighting a great battle No idea that the fisherman affair was going to be so serious said the Clerk It seems the Governor has ordered out every soldier and pensioner If I know my countrymen they ll not stand much of that Philip drew a long breath there was a cloud of dust the women in the brakes were laughing I hear a whisper that the ringleader is a friend of yours Christian an irregular relative of a high official as the reporter says He is my cousin sir said Philip What The big curly pated fellow you took home in the carriage I say coachman no need to drive quite so fast Philip s head was still down The Clerk of the Rolls sat watching him with an anxious face Christian I am not so sure the Governor wasn t right after all Is this what s been troubling you for a month You re the deuce for a secret If there s anything good to tell you re up like the sun but if there s bad news going an owl is a poll parrot compared with you for talking Philip made some feeble effort to laugh and to say his head was still aching They were on the breast of the steep hill going up to Greeba The road ahead was like a funnel of dust the road behind was like the tail of a comet Pity a fine lad like that should get into trouble said the Clerk I like the rascal He got round an old man s heart like a rope round a capstan One of the big hearty dogs that make you say By Jove and I m a Manxman too He s in the right in this affair whatever the Governor may say And the Governor knows it Christian that s why he s so anxious to excuse you He can overawe the Keys and as for the Council we re paid our wages God bless us and are so many stuffed snipes on his stick But you you re different Then the man is your kinsman and blood is thicker than water if it s only Why what s this There was some whooping behind the line of carriages swirled like a long serpent half a yard near the hedge and through the grey dust a large covered car shot by at the gallop of a fire engine The Clerk sat bolt upright Now what in the name of It s an ambulance waggon said Philip between his set teeth A moment later a second waggon went galloping past then a third and finally a fourth Well upon my Ah good day Doctor Good day good day The Clerk had recognised friends on the waggons and was returning their salutations When they were gone he first looked at Philip and then shouted Coachman right about face We re going home again and chance it We can t be turning here sir said the coachman The vehicles are coming up like bees going a swarming We ll have to go as far as Tynwald anyway Go on said Philip in a determined voice After a while the Clerk said Christian it isn t worth while getting into trouble over this affair After all the Governor is the Governor Besides he s been a good friend to you Philip was passing through a purgatorial fire and his old master was feeding it with fuel on every side They were nearing Tynwald and could see the flags the tents and the crowd as of a vast encampment and hear the deep hum of a multitude like the murmur of a distant sea X Tynwald Hill is the ancient Parliament ground of Man It is an open green in the midst of the island with hills on three of its sides and on the fourth a broad plain dipping to the coast This green is of the shape of a guitar Down the middle of the guitar there is a walled enclosure of the shape of a banjo At the end stands a church The round drum is the mount which has four circles the topmost being some six paces across The carriage containing the Deemster and the Clerk of the Bolls had drawn up at the west gate of the church and a policeman had opened the door There came the sound of singing from the porch A quarter late said the Clerk of the Rolls consulting his watch Shall we go in your Honor Let us take a turn round the fair instead said Philip The carriage door was shut back and they began to move over the green The open part of it was covered with booths barrows stands and show tents There were cheap jacks with shoddy watches phrenologists with two chairs fat women dwarfs wandering minstrels itinerant hawkers of toffee in tin hat boxes and other shiny and slimy creatures with the air and grease of the towns There were a few oxen and horses also tethered and lanketted and kicking up the dust under the dry turf The crowd was dense already and increasing at every moment As the brakes arrived they drove up with a swing that sent the people surging on either side Some brought well behaved visitors others brought an eruption of ruffians Down the neck of the enclosure and round the circular end of it stood a regiment of soldiers with rifles and bayonets The steps to the mount were laid down with rushes Two armchairs were on the top under a canopy hung from a flagstaff that stood in the centre These chairs were still empty and the mount and its approaches were kept clear The sun was overhead the heat was great the odour was oppressive Now and again the sound of the service within the church mingled with the crack of the toy rifle ranges and the jabber of the cheap jacks At length there was another sound a more portentous sound the sound of bands playing in the distance It came from both south and west from the direction of Peel and from that of Port saint Mary They re coming said the Clerk and Philip s face when he turned his head to listen quivered and grew yet more pale As the bands approached they ceased to play Presently a vast procession of men from the west came up in silence to the skirt of the hill and turned off in the direction from which the men from the south were seen to be coming They were in jerseys and sea boots marching four deep and carrying nothing in their brawny hands One stalwart fellow walked firmly at the head of them It was Pete Philip could support the strain no longer He got out of the carriage The Clerk of the Rolls got out also and followed him as he walked with wavering irregular steps Under a great tree at the junction of three roads the two companies of fishermen met and fell into a general throng There was a low wall around the tree trunk and standing on this Pete s head was clear above the rest Boys he was saying there s three hundred armed soldiers on the hill yonder with twenty rounds of ball cartridge apiece You re going to the Coort because you ve a right to go You re going up peaceable and when you re getting there you re going to mix among the soldiers three to every man two on either side and one behind Then your spokesmen are going to spake out your complaint If they re listened to you re wanting no better But if they re not and if the word is given to fire on them then before there s time to do it you re going to stretch every man of the three hundred on his back and take his weapon Don t hurt the soldiers the poor soldiers are only doing what they re tould But don t let the soldiers hurt you neither You re going there for justice You re not going there to fight But if anybody fights you let him never forget the day he done it Break up every taffy stand in the fair if you can t find anything better And if blood is shed lave the man that orders it to me And now go up boys like men and like Manxmen There was no cheering no shouting no clapping of hands Only broken exclamations and a sort of confused murmur Come whispered the Clerk of the Rolls putting his hand through Philip s quivering arm Little does the poor devil think that if blood is shed he will be the first to fall God in heaven muttered Philip XI The crowd on Tynwald had now gathered thick down the neck of the enclosure and dense round the mount To the strains of the National Anthem played by the band of the regiment the Governor had come out of the church He was in cocked hat and with sword and the sword of state was carried upright before him With his Keys Council and clergy he walked to the hill top There he took one of the two chairs under the canopy the other was taken by the Bishop in his lawn Their followers came behind and broke up on the hill into an indiscriminate mass A number of ladies were admitted to the space on the topmost round They stood behind the chairs with their parasols still open There are men that the densest crowd will part and make way for The crowd had parted and made way for Philip As the court was being fenced he appeared with his companion at the foot of the mount There he was recognised by many but he scarcely answered their salutations The Governor made a deferential bow smiled and beckoned to him to come up to his side He went up slowly pausing at every other step like a man who was in doubt if he ought to go higher At length he stood at the Governor s right hand with all eyes upon him for the favourite of the great is favoured He was then the highest figure on the mount the Governor and the Bishop being seated The people could see him from end to side of the Tynwald and he could see the people as they stood closely packed on the green below The business of the Court began It was that of promulgating the laws Philip s senior colleague the old Deemster of the happy face read the titles of the laws in English Then the Coroner of the premier sheading began to recite the same titles in Manx Nobody heard them hardly anybody listened The ladies on the mount chatted among themselves the Keys and the clergy intermingled and talked the officials of the Council looked at the crowd and the crowd itself having nothing to hear no more to see indifferent to doings they could not understand resumed their amusements among the frivolities of the fair There were three persons in that assembly of fifteen thousand who were following the course of events with feverish interest The first of these was the Governor whose restless eyes were rolling from side to side with almost savage light the second was the captain of the regiment who was watching the Governor s face for a signal the third was Philip who was looking down at the crowd and seeing something that had meaning for himself alone The fishermen came up quietly three thousand strong Half a hundred of them lounged around the magazine the ammunition was at their command The rest pushed edged and elbowed their way through the people until they came to the line of the guard Wherever there was a red coat behind it there were three jerseys and stocking caps Philip saw it all from his elevation on the mount His face was deadly pale his eyelids wavered his lower lip trembled his hand twitched when he was spoken to he hardly answered he was like a man holding counsel with himself and half in fear that everybody could read his hidden thoughts He was in the last throes of his temptation The decisive moment was near It was heavy with the fate of his after life He thought of Pete and the torture of his company of Kate and the unending misery of her existence of himself and the deep duplicity to which he was committed From all this he could be freed for ever by what By doing nothing having already done his duty Only let him command himself and then relief from an existence enthralled by torment from constant alarm and watchfulness peace sleep love Kate Somebody was speaking to him over his shoulder It was nothing only the quip of a witty fellow descendant of a Spanish freebooter Ladies caught his eye smiled and bowed to him A little man whose swarthy face showed African blood reached up and quoted something about the bounds of freedom wide and wider The Coroner had finished the proceedings were at an end there was a movement something had happened the Governor had half risen from his chair Twelve men in sea boots and blue jerseys had passed the line of the guard and were standing midway across the steps of the mount One of them was beginning to speak It was Pete Governor he said but the captain of the regiment was abreast of him in a moment and a score of the soldiers were about his companions at the next breath The fishermen stood their ground like a wall and the soldiers fell back There was hardly any scuffle Governor said Pete again touching his cap The Governor was twisting in his seat Looking first at Pete and then at the captain he was in the act of lifting his hand when suddenly it was held by another hand at his side and a low voice whispered at his ear No sir for God s sake no It was Philip The Governor looked at him with amazement What do you mean I mean said Philip still whispering over him hotly and impetuously that there s only one way back to Government House but if you lift your hand it will be one too many I mean that if blood is shed you ll never live to leave this mount I mean that your three hundred soldiers are only as three hundred rabbits in the claws of three thousand crows At the next instant he had left the Governor and was face to face with the fishermen Fishermen he cried lifting both hands before him let there be no trouble here to day no riot for God s sake no bloodshed Listen to me I am the grandson of a fisherman I have been a fisherman myself I love the fishermen As long as I live I will stand by you Your rights shall be my rights your sins my sins and where you go I will go too Then swinging back to the Governor he bowed low and said in a deferential voice Your Excellency these men mean no harm they wish to speak to you they have a petition to make they will be loyal and peaceable But the Governor having recovered from his first fear was now in a flame of anger No he said with the accent of authority this is no time and no place for petitions Forgive me your Excellency said Philip with a deeper bow this is the time of all times the place of all places There had been a general surging of the Keys and clergy towards the steps and now one of them cried out of their group Is Tynwald Court to be turned into a bear garden And another said in a cynical voice Perhaps your Excellency has taken somebody else s seat Philip raised himself to his full height and answered with his eyes on the speakers We are free born men on this island your Excellency We did not come to Tynwald to learn order from the grandson of a Spanish pirate or freedom from the son of a black chief Hould hard boys cried Pete lifting one hand against his followers as if to keep them quiet He was boiling with a desire to shout till his throat should crack The Governor had exchanged rapid looks and low whispers with the captain He saw that he was outwitted that he was helpless that he was even in personal danger The captain was biting his leg with vexation that he had not reckoned more seriously with this rising that he had not drawn up his men in column Your Excellency will hear the fishermen said Philip No no no said the Governor He was at least a brave man if a vain and foolish one There was silence for a moment Then standing erect and making an effort to control himself Philip said May it please your Excellency you fill a proud position here you are the ruler of this island under your sovereign lady our Queen But we your subjects your servants are in a prouder position still We are Manxmen This is the Court of our country Hould hard cried Pete again For a thousand years men with our blood and our names have stood on this hill to hear the voice of the people and to do justice between man and man That s what the place was meant for If it has lost that meaning root it up it is a show and a sham Bravo cried Pete he could hold himself in no longer and his word was taken up with a shout both on the hill and on the green beneath Philip s voice had risen to a shrill cry but it was low and meek as he added bowing yet lower while he spoke Your Excellency will hear the fishermen The Governor rolled in his seat Go on he said impatiently The men made their petition Three or four of them spoke briefly and to the point They had had harbours their fathers harbours which had been freed to them forty years before don t ask them to pay harbour dues until proper harbours were provided The Governor gave his promise Then he rose the band struck up God save the Queen and the Legislature filed back to the chapel Philip went with them He had fought a great battle and he had prevailed Through purging fires the real man had emerged but he had paid the price of his victory His eye burned like live coal his cheek bones seemed to have upheaved He walked alone his ancient colleague had stepped ahead of him But now and again as he passed down the long path to the church door fishermen and farmers pushed between the rifles of the guards and said in husky voices Let me shake you by the hand Dempster The scene was repeated with added emotion half an hour afterwards when the court being adjourned and the Governor gone in ominous silence Philip came out white and smiling and leaning on the arm of his old master the Clerk of the Rolls He could scarcely tear himself through the thick set hedge of people that lined the path to the gate As he got into the carriage his smile disappeared Sinking into the seat he buried himself in the corner and dropped his head on his breast The people began to cheer Drive on he cried The cheering became loud Drive drive he cried The people cheered yet louder They thought that they had seen a grand triumph that day a man triumphing over the Governor But there had been a grander triumph which they had not seen a man triumphing over himself Only one saw that and it was God XII Pete seemed to be beside himself He laughed until he cried he cried until he laughed His resonant voice rang out everywhere Hear him My gough it was like a bugle spaking There s nobody can spake but himself When the others are toot tooting it s just Polly put the kettle on mimicking a mincing treble See the lil Puffin on his throne of turf there Looked as if Ould Nick had been thrashing peas on his face for a week Pete s enthusiasm rose to frenzy and he began to sweep through the fair bemoaning his country and pouring mouth fuls of anathema on his countrymen Mannin veg villish sweet little Isle of Man with your English Governors and your English Bishops and boys of your own worth ten of them Manninee graihagh beloved Manxmen you re driving them away to be Bishops for others and Governors abroad and yourselves going to the dogs and the divil and d you Pete s prophetic mood dropped to a jovial one He bought the remaining stock in trade of an itinerant toffee seller and hammered the lid of the tin hat box to beat up the children They followed him like hares hopping in the snow and he distributed his bounty in inverse relation to size a short stick to a big lad a long stick to a little one and two sticks to a girl The results were an infantile war Here a damsel of ten squaring her lists to fight a hulking fellow of twelve for her sister of six and there a mother wiping the eyes of her boy of five and whispering Hush bogh hush You shall have the bladder when we kill the pig Pete began to drink How do Faddy Taking joy of you Juan Are you in life Thom Half a glass of rum will do no harm boys Not the drink at all just the good company you know He hailed the women also but they were less willing to be treated I d have more respect for my quarterly ticket sir said Betsy she was a Primitive with her husband on the Planbeg There s a hole in your pocket captain n stop it up with your fist man said Liza she was a gombeen woman and when she got a penny in her hand it was a prisoner for life Chut woman said Pete what s the good book say ing Riches have wings let the birds fly then and off he went reeling and tottering and laughing his formidable laugh Pete grew merry Rooting up the remains of the fishermen s band he hired them to accompany him through the fair They were three little musicians now exceedingly drunk and their duty was to play Hail Isle of Man as he went swaggering along in front of them Hail Isle of Man Swate ocean lan I love thy sea girt border Play up Jackie The barley sown Potatoes down We ll get our boats in order Thus he forged through the fair capering laughing shouting protests over his shoulder when the tipsy music failed pretending to be very drunk trying to show that he was carrying on that he was going it that he hadn t a second thought but watching everything for all that studying every face and listening to the talk of everybody Whips of money at him Liza whips of it millions they re saying He s spending it like flitters then The Manx chaps isn t fit for fortunes no they aren t I wonder in the world what sort of wife there s at him I don t low my husband the purse Three ha pence is enough to be giving any man at once Wife you re saying Don t you know woman Then some whispering Bass boy more bass I tell thee We then sought nex The soothing sex Our swatearts at Port Erin Who is the man at all Why captain n Quilliam from Kimberley Deed man Him that married with some of the Caesar Glenmooar s ones She s left him though and gone off with a wastrel You don t say Well I saw the young woman myself At Quiggin s Hall There s enough for all Good beer and all things proper Hould boys Pete had drawn up suddenly and stopped his musicians with a sweep of the arm Were you spaking mister Corteen Nothing captain n No need to stare at all I was only saying I was at the camp meeting at Sulby and I saw Go on Jackie A pleasant place With beds of aise When we are done our supper The unhappy man was deceiving himself at least as much as anybody else After looking for the light of intelligence in every face waiting for a word watching for a glance expecting every moment that some one from south or north or east or west would say I ve seen her yet covering up the burning coal of his anxiety with the ashes of mock merriment he tried to persuade himself that Kate was not on the island if nobody at Tynwald had seen her that he had told the truth unwittingly and that he was as happy as the day was long XIII A man in a gig came driving a long horned cow in front of him Driver horse gig and cow were like animated shapes of dust but Pete recognised them Is it yourself Caesar So you re for selling ould Horney Grieved in my heart I am to do it sir Many a good glass of milk she has given to me and mine and Caesar was ready to weep Going falling in fits isn t she Caesar Hush man hush man said Caesar looking about A good cow very but down twice since I left home this morning I d give a bad sixpence to see Caesar selling that cow thought Pete Three men were bargaining over a horse Two were selling the third it was Black Tom was buying Rising five years sir Sired by Mahomet Oh I ve got the papers to prove it said one of the two What man Five shouted Black Tom down the horse s open mouth She ll never see eight the longest day she lives No use decaiving the man said the other dealer speaking in Manx She s sixteen low she s nine anyway Fair play boys spake English before a poor fellow said Black Tom with a snort This brother of mine lows she s seven said the first of the two You thundering liar said Black Tom in Manx He says she s sixteen Dealing ponies then asked Pete Anything sir anything Buying for farmers up Lonan way said Black Tom Come on said Pete here s Caesar with a long horned cow They found the good man tethering a white long horned cow to the wheel of the tipped up gig How do Caesar And how much for the long horn said Black Tom Aw look at the base beast mister Quilliam Examine her for yourself said Caesar Middling fair ewer good quarter five calves is it five Caesar said Black Tom holding one of the long horns Three sir and calving again for February No milk fever No Kicks a bit at milking Never Fits Ever had fits Caesar opening wide one of the cow s eyes Have you known me these years for a dacent man mister Quilliam began Caesar in an injured tone Well what s the figure Fourteen pound sir and she ll take the road before I ll go home with a pound less Fourteen what Ten I ll give you ten not a penny more Good day to you mister Quilliam said Caesar Then as if by an afterthought You re an ould friend of mine Thomas a very ould friend Tom I ll split you the diff rance Break a straw on it said Black Tom and the transaction was complete I ve had a clane strike here the base is worth fifteen chuckled Black Tom in Pete s ear as he drove the cow in to a shed beyond I must be buying another cow in place of poor ould Horney whispered Caesar as he dived into the cattle stand Strike up Jackie shouted Pete West of the mine The day being fine The tide against us veering Ten minutes later Pete heard a fearful clamour which drowned the noise that he himself was making Within the shed the confusion of tongues was terrific What s this at all he asked crushing through with an innocent face The man s cow has fits cried Black Tom I ll have my money back The ould psalm singing Tommy Noddy did he think he was lifting the collection My money My twelve goolden pounds If Black Tom had not been as bald as a bladder he would have torn his hair in his mortification But Pete pacified him Caesar is looking for another cow sell him his own back again Impozz ble Who says it s impozz ble Cut off her long horns and he ll never be knowing her from her grandmother Then Pete made up to Caesar and said Tom s got a mailie hornless cow to sell and it s the very thing you re wanting Is she a good mailie asked Caesar Ten quarts either end of the day Caesar and fifteen pounds of butter a week said Pete Where s the base sir said Caesar They met Black Tom leading a hornless white cow from the shed to the green Are you coming together Peter he said cheerfully Caesar eyed the cow doubtfully for a moment and then said briskly What s the price of the mailie mister Quilliam Aw look at the base first mister Cregeen Examine her for yourself sir Yes yes well yes a middling good base enough Four calves Thomas Two sir and calves again for January Twenty four quarts of new milk every day of life and butter fit to burst the churn for you No fever at

Quilliam No Half a one then Aw you re hard Tom thirteen Having paid the last pound Caesar stood a moment contemplating his purchase and then said doubtfully Well if I hadn t Grannie will be saying it s the same base back the cow began to reel Yes and it no surely a mailie for all the cow fell It s got the same fits anyway cried Caesar and then he rushed to the cow s head It is the same base The horns are going cutting off at her My money back Give me my money back my thirteen yellow sovereigns the sweat of my brow he cried Aw no said Black Tom There s no money giving back at all If the cow was good enough for you to sell she s good enough for you to buy and he turned on his heel with a laugh of triumph Caesar was choking with vexation Never mind sir said Pete If Tom has taken a mane advantage of you it ll be all set right at the Judgment You ve that satisfaction anyway Have I No I haven t said Caesar from between his teeth The man s clever He ll get himself converted before he comes to die and then there ll not be a word about cutting the horns off my cow Strike up Jackie shouted Pete Hail Isle of Man Swate ocean lan I love thy sea girt border XIV The sky became overcast rain began to fall and there was a rush for the carts In half an hour Tynwald Hill was empty and the people were splashing off on every side like the big drops of rain that were pelting down Pete hired a brake that was going back to the north and gathered up his friends from Ramsey When these were seated there was a rush of helpless and abandoned ones who were going in the same direction young mothers with children old men and old women Pete hauled them up till the seats and the floor were choked and the brake could hold no more He got small thanks Such crushing and scrooging I declare my black merino frock that I ve only had on once will be teetotal spoilt If they don t start soon I ll be taking the neuralgy dreadful They got started at length and at the tail of a line of stiff carts they went rattling over the mountain road The harebells nodded their washed faces from the hedge and the talk was brisk and cheerful Our Thorn s sowl a hafer and got a good price What for didn t you buy the mare of Corlett Beldroma Juan Did I want to be killed as dead as a herring Kicks does she Bate her man bate her A horse is like a woman If you aren t bating her now and then They stopped at every half way houses it was always halfway to somewhere The men got exceedingly drunk and began to sing At that the women grew very angry Sakes alive you re no better than a lot of Cottonies Deed but they re worse than any Cottonies ma am Some excuse for the like of them In their cotton mills all the year and nothing at home but a piece of grass the size of your hand in the backyard and going hopping on it like a lark in a cage The rain came down in torrents the mountain path grew steep and desolate the few houses passed were empty and boarded up gorse bushes hissed to the rising breeze geese scuttled and screamed across the untilled land a solitary black crow flew across the leaden sky and on the sea outside a tall pillar of smoke went stalking on and on where the pleasure steamer carried her freight of tourists round the island Then songs gave way to sighs some of the men began to pick quarrels and some to break into fits of drunken sobbing Pete kept them all up He chaffed and laughed and told funny stories Choking stifling wounded to the heart as he was still he was carrying on struggling to convince everybody and himself as well that nothing was amiss that he was a jolly fellow and had not a second thought He was glad to get home nevertheless where he need play the hypocrite no longer Going through Sulby he dropped out of the brake and looked in at the Fairy The house was shut Grannie was sitting up for Caesar and listening for the sound of wheels There was something unusual and mysterious about her Cruddled over the fire she was smoking a long clay in little puffs of blue smoke that could barely be seen The sweet old soul in her troubles had taken to the pipe as a comforter Pete could see that something had happened since morning but she looked at him with damp eyes and he was afraid to ask questions He began to talk of the great doings of the day at Tynwald then of Philip and finally of Kate apologising a little wildly for the mother not coming home sooner to the child but protesting that she had sent the little one no end of presents Presents bless ye he began rapturously You don t ate enough Pete deed you don t said Grannie Ate Did you say ate cried Pete If you d seen me at the fair you d have said That man s got the inside of a limekiln Aw no Grannie I m not letting my jaws travel far When I ve got anything before me it s down same as an ostrich Going away in the darkness he heard Caesar creaking up in the gig with old Horney now old Mailie diving along in front of him Nancy was waiting for Pete at Elm Cottage She tried to bustle him upstairs Come man come she said get yourself off to bed and I ll bring your clothes down to the fire He had never slept in the bedroom since Kate had left Chut I ve lost the habit of beds he answered Always used of the gable loft you know and the wind above the thatch Not to be thought to behave otherwise than usual he went upstairs that night But Feather beds are saft Pentit rooms are bonnie But ae kiss o my dear love Better s far than ony The rain was still falling the sea was loud the mighty breath of night was shaking the walls of the house and rioting through the town He was wet and tired longing for a dry skin and a warm bed and rest Yet fain wad I rise and rin If I tho t I would meet my dearie The long strained rapture of faith and confidence was breaking down He saw it breaking He could deceive himself no more She was gone she was lost she would lie on his breast no more God help me O Lord help me he cried in his crushed and breaking heart XV When Kate thought of her husband after she had left him it was not with any crushing sense of shame She had injured him but she had gained nothing by it On the contrary she had suffered she had undergone separation from her child To soften the hard blow inflicted she had outraged the tenderest feelings of her heart As often as she thought of Pete and the deep wrong she had done him she remembered this sacrifice she wept over this separation Thus she reconciled herself to her conduct towards her husband If she had bought happiness at the cost of Pete s sufferings her remorse might have been deep but she had only accepted shame and humiliation and the severance of the dearest of her ties When she had said in the rapture of passionate confidence that if she possessed Philip s love there could be no humiliation and no shame she had not yet dreamt of the creeping degradation of a life in the dark under a false name in a false connection a life under the same roof with Philip yet not by his side unacknowledged unrecognised hidden and suppressed Even at the moment of that avowal somewhere in the secret part of her heart where lay her love of refinement and her desire to be a lady she had cherished the hope that Philip would find a way out of the meanness of their relation that she would come to live openly beside him she hardly knew how and she did not care at what cost of scandal for with Philip as her own she would be proud and happy Philip had not found that way out yet she did not blame him She had begun to see that the deepest shame of their relation was not hers but his Since she had lived in Philip s house the man in him had begun to decay She could not shut her eyes to this rapid demoralisation and she knew well that it was the consequence of her presence The deceptions the subterfuges the mean shifts forced upon him day by day by every chance every accident were plunging him in ever deepening degradation And as she realised this a new fear possessed her more bitter than any humiliation more crushing than any shame the fear that he would cease to love her the terror that he would come to hate her as he recognised the depth to which she had dragged him down XVI Back from Tynwald Philip was standing in his room From time to time he walked to the window which was half open for the air was close and heavy A misty rain was falling from an empty sky and the daylight was beginning to fail The tombstones below were wet the treed were dripping the churchyard was desolate In a corner under the wall lay the angular wooden lid which is laid by a gravedigger over an open grave Presently the iron gates swung apart and a funeral company entered It consisted of three persons and an uncovered deal coffin One of the three was the sexton of the church another was the curate the third was a policeman The sexton and the policeman carried the coffin to the church door which the curate opened He then went into the church and was followed by the other two A moment later there were three strokes of the church bell Some minutes after that the funeral company reappeared It made for the open grave in the corner by the wall The cover was removed the coffin was lowered the policeman half lifted his helmet and the sexton put a careless hand to his cap Then the curate opened a book and closed it again The burial service was at an end Half an hour longer the sexton worked alone in the drenching rain shovelling the earth back into the grave Some waif thought Philip some friendless homeless nameless waif He went noiselessly up the stairs to the floor above slinking through the house like a shadow At a door above his own he knocked with a heavy hand and a woman s voice answered him from within Is any one there It is he said I am coming to see you Then he opened the door and slipped into the room It was a room like his own at all points only lower in the ceiling and containing a bed A woman was standing with her back to the window as if she had just turned about from looking into the churchyard It was Kate She had been expecting Philip and waiting for him but she seemed to be overwhelmed with confusion As he crossed the floor to go to her he staggered and then she raised her eyes to his face You are ill she said Sit down Shall I ring for the brandy No he answered We have had a hard day at Tyn wald some trouble some excitement I m tired that s all He sat on the end of the bed and gazed out on the veil of rain slanting across the square church tower and the sky I was at Ramsey two days ago he said that s what I came to tell you Ah She linked her hands before her and gazed out also Then in a trembling voice she asked Is mother well Yes I did not see her but yes she bears up bravely And and the words stuck in her throat and Pete Well also in health at all events You mean that he is broken hearted With a deep breath he answered To listen to him you would think he was cheerful enough And little Katherine She is well too I did not see her awake It was late and she was in her cradle So rosy and fresh and beautiful My sweet darling She was clean too They take care of her don t they More care they could not take My darling baby Has she grown Yes they talk of taking her out of the long clothes soon Nancy is like a second mother to her Kate s foot was beating the floor Oh why can t her own mother she began and then in a faltering voice but that cannot be I suppose Do her eyes change Are they still blue But she was asleep you say My dear baby Was it very late Nine o clock Just nine I was thinking of her at that moment It is true I am always thinking of her but I remember because the clock was striking She will be in her little cot now I thought bathed and clean and so pretty in her nightdress the one with the frill My sweet sweet angel Her speech was confused and broken Do you think if I never see her until Will I know her if It s useless to think of that though Is her hair like What is the colour of her hair Philip Fair quite fair as fair as mine was She swirled round came face to face with him and cried Philip Philip why can t I have my darling to myself She would be well enough here I could keep her quiet Oh she would not disturb you And I should be so happy with my little Kate for company The time is long with me sometimes Philip and I could play with her all the day And then at night when she would be in the cot I could make her little stock of clothes her frocks and her little pinafores and Impossible Kate impossible said Philip She turned to the window Yes she said in a choking voice I suppose it would even be stealing to fetch her away now Only think A mother stealing her own child O gracious heaven have I sinned myself so far from my innocent baby My child my child My little Katherine Her bosom heaved and she said in a hard tone I daresay they think I m a bad mother because I left her to others to nurse her and to love her to see her every day and all day to bathe her sweet body and to comb her yellow hair to look into her little blue eyes and to watch all her pretty pretty ways Oh yes yes she said with increasing emotion I daresay they think that of me They think nothing but what is good of you Kate nothing but what is good and kind She looked out on the rain which fell unceasingly and said in a low voice Is Pete still telling the same story that I am only away for a little while that I am coming back He is writing letters to himself now and saying they come from you From me Such simple things all in his own way full of love and happiness I am so happy and comfortable it is pitiful He is like a child he never suspects anything You are better and enjoying yourself and looking forward to coming home soon Sending kisses and presents for the baby too and greetings for everybody There are messages for me also Your true and loving wife it is terrible She covered her face with both hands And is he telling everybody Yes that s what the letters are meant for He thinks he is keeping your name sweet and your place clean so that you may return at any time and scandal may not touch you Oh why do you tell me that Philip It is dragging me back And the child is dragging me back also Does he show the letters to you Worse than that Kate much worse he makes me answer them I answered one the other night Oh when I think of it Dear wife glad to get your welcome letters God knows how I held the pen I was giddy enough to drop it He gave you all the news about your father and Grannie and everybody All in his own bright way poor old Pete the cheeriest sunniest soul alive The Dempster is putting a sight on us regular trusts you are the better for leaving home It was awful awful Dearest Kirry I m missing you mortal worse than Kimberley So come home soon my true lil wife to your foolish ould husband for his heart is losing him He leapt up and began to tramp the floor But why do I tell you this I should bear my own burdens Her hands had come down from her face which was full of a great compassion And did you have to write all that she asked Oh he meant no harm He had no thought of hurting anybody He never dreamt that every word was burning and blistering me to the heart of hearts His voice deepened and his face grew hard and ugly But it was the same as if some devil out of hell had entered into the man and told him how to torture me as if the cruellest tyrant on earth had made me take up the pen and write down my own death warrant I could have killed him I could not help it yes I felt at that moment as if Oh what am I saying He stopped sat on the end of the bed again and held his head between his hands She came and sat by his side Philip she said I am ruining you Yes I am corrupting you I who would have had you so high and pure and you so pure minded I am bringing you to ruin Having me here is destroying you Philip No one visits you now You are shutting the door on everybody I heard you come in last night Philip I hear you every night Yes I know everything Oh you will end by hating me I know you will Why don t you send me away It will be better to send me away in time Philip Besides it will make no difference We are in the same house yet we never meet Send me away now before it is too late He dropped his hand and felt for her hand he was trying not to look into her face We have both suffered Kate We can never hate one another we have suffered for each other s sake She clung tightly to the hand he gave her and said Then you will never forsake me whatever happens Never Kate never he answered and with a smothered cry she threw her arms about his neck The rain continued to pour down on the roofs and on the tombs with a monotonous plash But what is to be done she said God knows he answered What is to become of us Philip Are we never to smile on each other again We cannot carry a burden like this for ever To day to morrow the next day the next year is it to go on like this for a lifetime Is this life Is there nothing that will end it Yes Kate yes there is one thing that will end it one thing only Do you mean death He did not answer She rose slowly from his side and returned to the window rested her forehead against the pane and looked down on the desolate churchyard and the sexton at his work in the rain Suddenly she broke the silence Philip she said I know now what we ought to do I wonder we have never thought of it before What is it he asked She was standing in front of him Her breath came quickly Tell Pete that I am dead No no no She took both his hands Yes yes she said He kept his face away from her Kate what are you saying What is more natural Philip Only think if you had been anybody else it would have come to that already You must have hated me for dragging you down into this mire of deceit you must have forsaken me and I must have gone to wreck and ruin Oh I see it all just as if it had really happened A solitary room somewhere alone sinking dying unknown unnamed forgotten His eyes were wandering about the room It will kill him If his heart can break it will break it he said He has lived after a heavier blow than that Philip Do you think he is not suffering For all his bright ways and hopeful talk and the letters and the presents do you think he is not suffering He liberated his hands and began to tramp the room as before but with head down dud hands linked behind him It will be cruel to deceive him he said No Philip but kind Death is not cruel The wound it makes will heal It won t bleed for ever Once he thinks I am dead he will weep a little perhaps and then she was stifling a sob then it will be all over Poor girl he will say she was much to blame I loved her once and never did her any wrong But she is gone and she was the mother of little Katherine let us forget her faults He had not heard her he was standing before the window looking down You are right Kate I think you must be right I m sure I am He will suffer but he will get over it Yes indeed And you Philip he will torture you no longer No more letters no more presents no more messages I ll do it I ll do it to morrow he said She opened her arms wide and cried Kiss me Philip kiss me We shall live again Yes we shall laugh together still kiss me kiss me Not yet when I come back Very well when you come back She sank into a chair crying with joy and he went out as he had entered noiselessly stealthily like a shadow When a man who is not a criminal is given over to a deep duplicity of life he will clutch at any lie wearing the mask of truth which seems to shield him from shame and pain He may be a wise man in every other relation a shrewd man a far seeing and even a cunning man but in this relation that of his own honour his own fame his own safety he is certain to be a blunderer a bungler and a fool Such is the revenge of Nature such is God s own vengeance XVII Philip was walking from Ballure House to Elm Cottage It was late and the night was dark and silent a muggy dank and stagnant night without wind or air moon or stars The road was quiet the trees were still the sea made only a far off murmur And as he walked he struggled to persuade himself that in what he was about to do he would be doing well It will not be wrong to deceive him he thought It will only be for his own good The suspense would kill him He would waste away The sap of the man s soul would dry up Then why should I hesitate Besides it is partly true true in its own sense and that is the real sense She is dead dead to him She can never return to him she is lost to him for ever So it is true after all it is true It is a lie said a voice at his ear He started He could have been sure that somebody had spoken Yet there was nobody by his side He was alone in the road It must have been my own voice he thought I must have been thinking aloud And then he resumed his walk and his meditation And if it is a lie is it therefore a crime he asked himself Sure it is how very sure it was a wise man that said so a great fault once committed is the first link in a chain The other links seem to be crimes also but they are not they are consequences Our fault was long ago and even then it was partly the fault of Fate If the past could be recalled we could not act differently unless our fates were different And what has followed has been only the consequence It was the consequence when Kate was married to Pete it was the consequence when she left him and this is the consequence It is a lie said the same voice by his side He stopped The darkness was gross around him he could see nothing Who s there he demanded There was no answer He stretched his hand out nervously There was no one at his side It must have been the wind in the trees he thought but there could be no wind in the stagnant dampness of that air It was like my own voice he thought Then he remembered how his man in Douglas had told him that he had contracted a habit of talking to himself of late It was my own voice he thought and he went on again A lie is a bad foundation to build on that s certain The thing that should be cannot rest on the thing that is not It will topple down it will come to ruin it will wreck everything Still It is a lie said the voice again There could be no mistaking it this time It was a low deep whisper It seemed to be spoken in the very cavity of his ear It was not his own voice and yet it struck upon his sense with the sound as of his own It must be his own voice speaking to himself When this idea took hold of him he was seized with a deadly shuddering His heart knocked against his ribs and an icy coldness came over him Only the same tormenting dream he thought Before it was a vision now it is a voice It is generated by solitude and separation I must resist it I must be strong It will drive me into an oppression as of madness Men do not see their souls until they are bordering on madness from religious mania or crime A lie a lie said the voice This is madness itself To paint faces on the darkness to hear voices in the air is madness The madman can do no more A lie said the voice again He cast a look over his shoulder It was the same as if some one had touched him and spoken He walked faster The voice seemed to walk with him I will hold myself firm he thought I will not be afraid Reason does not fail a man until he allows himself to believe that it is failing I am going mad he thinks and then he shrieks and is mad indeed I will not depart from my course If I do so now I shall be lost The horror will master me and I shall be its slave for ever He had turned out of Ballure into the Ramsey Road and he could see the town lights in the distance But the voice continued to haunt him persistently besiegingly despotically Great God he thought what is the imaginary devil to the horror of this presence Your own eye your own voice always with you always following you No darkness so dense that it can hide the sight no noise so loud that it can deaden the sound He walked faster Still the voice seemed to stride by his side an invisible thing with deliberate and noiseless step from which there was no escape He drew up suddenly and walked slower His knees were tottering he was treading as on waves yet he went on I will not yield I will master myself I will do what I intended I am not mad he thought He was at the gate of Elm Cottage by this time and with a strong glow of resolution he walked boldly to the door and knocked XVIII Pete had not awakened until late that morning While still in bed he had heard Grannie and Nancy in the room below The first sound of their voices told him that something was amiss Aw God bless me God bless me said Nancy as though with uplifted hands It was Kelly the postman said Grannie in a doleful tone the tone in which she had spoken between the puffs of her pipe The dirt said Nancy He was up at Caesar s before breakfast this morning said Grannie There now cried Nancy There s men like that though Just aiger for mischief It s sweeter than all their prayers to them But where can she be then Has she made away with herself poor thing That s what I was asking Caesar said Grannie If she s gone with the young Ballawhaine what for aren t you going to England over and fetching her home says I And what did Caesar say No says he not a step says he If she s dead says he we ll only know it a day the sooner and if she s in life it ll be a disgrace to us the longest day we live Aw bolla veen bolla veen said Nancy When some men is getting religion there s no more inside at them than a gutted herring and they re good for nothing but to put up in the chimley to smook It s Black Tom woman said Grannie Caesar s freckened mortal of the man s tongue going It s water to his wheel he s saying He ll be telling me to set my own house in order and me a local preacher too But how s the man himself Pete said Nancy Aw tired enough last night and not down yet Hush It s his foot on the loft Poor boy poor boy said Grannie The child cried and then somebody began to beat the floor to the measure of a long drawn hymn Grannie must have been sitting before the fire with the baby across her knees Something has happened thought Pete as he drew on his clothes A moment later something had happened indeed He had opened a drawer of the dressing table and found the wedding ring and the earrings where Kate had left them There was a commotion in the room below by this time but Pete did not hear it He was crying in his heart It is coming I know it I feel it God help me Lord forgive me Amen Amen Caesar the postman and the constable as a deputation from The Christians had just entered the house Black Tom was with them He was the ferret that had fetched them out of their holes Get thee home woman said Caesar to Grannie This is no place for thee It is the abode of sin and deception It s the home of my child s child and that s enough for me said Grannie Get thee back I tell thee said Caesar and come thee to this house of shame no more Take her Nancy said Grannie giving up the child Shame enough indeed I m thinking when a woman has to shut her heart to her own flesh and blood if she s not to disrespect her husband and she went off weeping But Caesar s emotions were walled in by his pietistical views Every one that hath forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or land for My name s sake shall receive an hundredfold said Caesar with a cast of his eye towards Black Tom Well if I ever said Nancy The husband that wanted the like of that from me now A hundredfold indeed No not for a hundred hundredfolds the nasty dirt Don t he turning up your nose woman but call your master said Caesar It s more than some ones need do then and I won t call my master neither no thank you said Nancy I ve something to tell him and I ve come too for to do it said Caesar The devil came farther than ever you did and it was only a lie he was bringing for all that said Nancy Hould your tongue Nancy Cain said Caesar and take that Popish thing off the child s head It was the scarlet hood Pity the money that s wasted on the like wasn t given to the poor I ve heard something the same before Caesar Cregeen said Nancy It was Judas Iscariot was saying it first and you re just thieving it from a thief Chut cried Caesar goaded by the laughter of Black Tom I ll call the man myself Peter Quilliam and he made for the staircase door Stand back cried Nancy holding the child like a pillow over one of her arms and lifting the other threateningly Aw you ll never be raising your hand to the man of God woman giggled Black Tom Won t I though said Nancy grimly or the man of the devil either she added flashing at himself The woman s not to trust sir snuffled the constable She s only an infidel anyway I ve heard tell of her saying she didn t believe the whale swallowed Jonah That s the diff rance between us then said Nancy for there s some of you Manx ones would believe if Jonah swallowed the whale The staircase door opened at the back of Nancy and Pete stepped into the room What s this friends he asked in a careworn voice Caesar stepped forward with a yellow envelope in his hand What s that sir he answered Pete took the envelope and opened it That s your letter back to you through the dead letter office isn t it said Caesar Well said Pete There s nobody of that name in that place is there said Caesar Well said Pete again Letters from England don t come through Peel but your first letter had the Peel postmark hadn t it Well Parcels from England don t come through Port saint Mary but your parcel was stamped in Port saint Mary wasn t it Anything else The handwriting inside the letter wasn t your own handwriting was it The address on the outside of the parcel wasn t your own address no Is that all Enough to be going on I m thinking What about Uncle Joe said Black Tom with another giggle Your mistress is not in Liverpool You don t know where she is She has gone the way of all sinners said Caesar Is that what you re coming to tell me said Pete No we re coming to tell you said Caesar that as a notorious loose liver we must be putting her out of class And we re coming to call on yourself to look to your own salvation You ve deceaved us mister Quilliam You ve grieved the Spirit of the Lord with another glime in the direction of Black Tom you ve brought contempt on the fellowship that counts you for one of the fold You ve given the light of your countenance to the path of an evildoer and you ve brought down the head of a child of God with sorrow to the grave Caesar was moved by his self satisfied piety and began to make noises in his nostrils Let us lay the case before the Lord he said and he went down on his knees and prayed Our brother has deceived us O Lord but we forgive him freely Forgive Thou also his trespasses so that at the last he escape hell fire Count not Thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial wherever she is this day May it be good for her to be cut off from the body of the righteous Grant that she feel this mercy in her carnal body before her eternal soul be called to everlasting judgment Lord strengthen Thy servant Let not his natural affections be as the snare of the fowler unto his feet Though it grieve him sore even to tears and tribulation help him to pluck out the gourd that groweth in his own bosom Dear heart alive cried Nancy clattering her clogs it s a wonder in the world the man isn t thinking shame to blacken his own daughter before the Almighty Himself Be merciful O Lord continued Caesar to all rank unbelievers and such as live in heathen darkness in a Christian land and don t know Saturday from Sunday and are imper ent uncommon and bad with the tongue Stop that now cried Nancy that s meant for me Pete had stood through this in silence but with an angry miserable face Beg pardon all he said I m not going for denying to what you say I m like the fish at the heel of the trawl boat the net s closing in on me and I m caught The game s up I did deceave you I did write those letters myself I ve no Uncle Joe nor no Auntie Joney neither My wife s left me I m not knowing where she is or what s becoming of her I m done and I m for throwing up the sponge There were grunts of satisfaction But don t you feel the need of pardon brother said Caesar I don t said Pete What I was doing I was doing for the best and if I was doing wrong the Almighty will have to forgive me that s about all Caesar shot out his lip Pete raised himself to his full height and looked from face to face until his eyes settled on the postman But it takes a thief to catch a thief he said Which of you was the thief that catcht me Maybe I ve been only a blundering blockhead and perhaps you ve been clever and smart uncommon but I m thinking there s some of you hasn t been rocked enough for all that He held out the yellow envelope This letter was sealed when you gave it to me mister Cregeen how did you know what was inside of it On Her Majesty s Sarvice you say But it isn t dead letters only that s coming with words same as that The postman was meddling with his front hair The Lord has His own wayses of doing His work has He Caesar I never heard tell though that opening other people s letters was one of them mister Kelly s ferret eyes were nearly twinkling themselves out Pete threw letter and envelope into the fire You ve come to tell me you re going to turn my wife out of class All right You can turn me out too and if the money I gave you is anywhere handy you can turn that out at the same time and make a clane job Black Tom was doubling with suppressed laughter at the corner of the dresser and Caesar was writhing under his searching glances You re knowing a dale about the ould Book and I m not knowing much said Pete but isn t it saying somewhere Let him that s without sin amongst you chuck the first stone I m not worth mentioning for a saint myself so I lave it with you His voice began to break You re thinking a dale about the broken law seemingly but I m thinking more about the broken heart There s the like in somewhere you go bail The woman that s gone may have done wrong I m not saying she didn t poor thing but if she comes home again you may turn her out but I ll take her back whatever she is and whatever she s done so help me God I will and I ll not wait for the Day of Judgment to ask the Almighty if I m doing right Then he sat down with his back to them on a chair before the fire Now you can go home to nurse said Nancy wiping her eyes and lave me to sweeten the kitchen it s wanting water enough after dirts like you Caesar also was wiping his eye the one nearest to Black Tom Come he said with plaintive resignation our errand was useless The Ethiopian cannot change his skin nor the leopard his spots No but he can get a topcoat to cover them though said Nancy Oh that flea sticks does it Caesar Don t blame the looking glass if your face is ugly Caesar pretended not to hear her Well he said with a sigh discharged at Pete s back we ll pray spite of appearances that we may all go to heaven together some day No thank you not me said Nancy I wouldn t be mane myself going anywhere with the like of you The Job in Caesar could bear up no longer Vain and ungrateful woman he cried who hath eaten of my bread and drunken of my cup Cursing me are you said Nancy Sakes you must have been found in the bulrushes at Pharaoh s daughter and made a prophet of No use bandying words sir wid a single woman dat lives alone wid a single man said mister Niplightly Nancy flopped the child from her right arm to her left and with the back of her hand she slapped the constable across the face Take that for the cure of a bad heart she said and tell the Dempster I gave it you Then she turned on the postman and Black Tom Out of it you lil thief your mouth s only a dirty town well and your tongue s the pump in it Go home and die you big black spider you re ould enough for it and wicked enough too Out of it the lot of you she cried and clashed the door at their backs and then opened it again for a parting shot And if it s true you re on your way to heaven together just let me know and I ll see if I can t put up with the other place myself XIX That evening Pete was sitting with one foot on the cradle rocker one arm on the table and the other hand trifling tenderly with the ring and the earrings which he had found in the drawer of the dressing table when there was a hurried knock on the door It had the hollow reverberation of a knock on the lid of a coffin Come in called Pete It was Philip but it was almost as if Death had entered so thin and bony were his cheeks so wild his eyes so cold his hands Pete was prepared for anything You ve found me out too I see you have he said defiantly You needn t tell me it s chasing caught fish Be brave Pete said Philip It will be a great shock to you Pete looked up and his manner changed Speak it out sir It s a poor man that can t stand I ve come on the saddest errand said Philip taking a seat as far away as possible You ve found her you ve seen her sir Where is she She is began Philip and then he stopped Go on mate I ve known trouble before to day said Pete Can you bear it said Philip She is and he stopped again She is where said Pete She is dead said Philip at last Pete rose to his feet Philip rose also and now poured out his message with the headlong rush of a cataract In fact it all happened some time ago Pete but I couldn t bring myself to tell you before I tried but I couldn t It was in Douglas of a fever in a lodging alone unattended Hould hard sir Give me time said Pete I d a gunshot wound at Kimberley and since then I ve a stitch in my side at whiles and sometimes a bit of a catch in my breathing He staggered to the porch door and threw it open then came back panting Dead dead Kate is dead Nancy came from the kitchen at the moment and hearing what he was saying she lifted both hands and uttered a piercing shriek He took her by the shoulders and turned her back shut the door behind her and said holding his right hand hard at his side Women are brave sir but when the storm breaks on a man He broke off and muttered again Dead Kirry is dead The child awakened by Nancy s cry was now whimpering fretfully Pete went to the cradle and rocked it with one foot crooning in a quavering treble Hush a bye hush a bye Philip s breathing was oppressed He felt like a man at the edge of a precipice with an impulse to throw himself over God forgive me he said I could kill myself I ve broken your heart No fear of me sir said Pete I m an ould hulk that s seen weather I ll not go to pieces from inside at all Give me time mate give me time And then he went on muttering as before Dead Kirry dead Hush a bye My Kirry dead The little one slept and Pete drew back in his chair nodded into the fire and said in a weak childish voice I ve known her all my life d ye know She s been my lil sweetheart since she was a slip of a girl and slapped the schoolmaster for bating me wrongously Swate lil thing in them days mate with her brown feet and tossing hair And now she s a woman and she s dead The Lord have mercy upon me He got up and began to walk heavily across the floor dipping and plunging as if going upstairs The bright and happy she was when I started for Kimberley too with her pretty face by the aising stones in the morning all laughter and mischief Five years I was seeing it in my drames like that and now it s gone Kirry is gone My Kirry God help me O God have mercy upon me He stopped in his unsteady walk and sat and stared into the fire His eyes were red blotches of heart s blood seemed to be rising to them but there was not the sign of a tear Philip did not attempt to console him He felt as if the first syllable would choke in his throat I see how it s been sir said Pete While I was away her heart was changing her and when I came back she thought she must keep her word My poor lamb She was only a child anyway But I was a man I ought to have seen how it was I m like a drowning man too things are coming back on me I m seeing them plain enough now But it s too late My poor Kirry And I thought I was making her so happy Then with a helpless look You wouldn t believe it sir but I was never once thinking nothing else No I wasn t it s a fact I was same as a sailor working all the voyage home making a cage and painting it goold for the love bird he s catcht in the sunny lands somewhere but when he s putting it in it s only wanting away poor thing With a sense of grovelling meanness Philip sat and listened Then with eyes wandering across the floor he said You have nothing to reproach yourself with You did everything a man could do everything And she was innocent also It was the fault of another He came between you Perhaps he thought he couldn t help it perhaps he persuaded himself God knows what lie he told himself but she s innocent Pete believe me she s Pete brought his fist down heavily on the table and the rings that lay on it jumped and tingled What s that to me he cried hoarsely What do I care if she s innocent or guilty She s dead isn t she and that s enough Curse the man I don t want to hear of him She s mine now What for should he come here between me and my own The torn heart and racked brain could bear no more Pete dropped his head on the table Presently his anger ebbed Without lifting his head he stretched his hand across the rings to feel for Philip s hand Philip s hand trembled in his grasp He took that for sympathy and became the more ashamed Give me time mate he said I ll be my own man soon My head s moithered dreadful I m not knowing if I heard you right In Douglas you say By herself too Not by herself surely Not quite alone neither She found you out didn t she You d be there Phil You d be with her yourself She d be wanting for nothing Philip answered huskily his eyes still wandering If it will be any comfort to you yes I was with her she wanted for nothing My poor girl said Pete Did she send had she any maybe she said a word or two at the last eh Philip clutched at the question There was something at last that he could say without falsehood She sent a prayer for your forgiveness he said She told me to tell you to think of her as little as might be not to grieve for her too much and to try to forget her so that her sin also might be forgotten And the lil one anything about the lil one asked Pete That was the bitterest grief of all said Philip It was so hard that you must think her an unnatural mother My Katherine My little Katherine My sweet angel It was her cry the whole day long I see I see said Pete nodding at the fire she left the lil one for my sake wanting it with her all the while Poor thing You d comfort her Philip You d let her go aisy The child is well and happy I told her He s thinking nothing of yourself but what is good and kind I said God s peace rest on her My darling My wife said Pete solemnly Then suddenly in another tone Do you know where she s buried Philip hesitated He had not foreseen this question Where had been his head that he had never thought of it But there was no going back now He was compelled to go on He must tell lie on lie Yes he faltered Could you take me to the grave Philip gasped the sweat broke out on his forehead Don t be freckened sir said Pete I m my own man again Could you take me to my wife s grave Yes said Philip He was in the rapids He was on the edge of precipitation He was compelled to go over He made a blindfold plunge Lie on lie lie on lie Then we ll start by the coach to morrow said Pete Philip rose with rigid limbs He had meant to tell one lie only and already he had told many Truly a lie is a cripple it cannot stand alone Good night Pete I ll go home I m not well to night We ll stop the coach at your aunt s gate in the morning said Pete They stepped to the door together and stood for a moment in the dank and lifeless darkness The world s getting wonderful lonely man and you re all that s left to me now Phil you and the child I m not for wailing though When I got my gun shot wound out yonder I was away over the big veldt hundreds of miles from anywhere behind the last bush and the last blade of grass with the stones and the ashes and the dust about as far you d say as the world was finished and never looking to see herself and the ould island and the ould faces no more I m not so lonesome as that at all Good night ould fellow and God bless you The gate opened and closed Philip went stumbling up the road He was hating Pete To hate this open hearted man who had dragged him into an entanglement of lies was the only resource of his stifled conscience Pete went back to the house muttering Kirry is dead Kirry is dead He put the catch on the door said Close the shutters Nancy and then returned to his chair by the cradle XX Later the same night Pete carried the news to Sulby Grannie was in the bar room and he broke it to her gently tenderly lovingly Loud voices came from the kitchen Caesar was there in angry contention with Black Tom An open Bible was between them on their knees Tom tugged it towards him bobbed his blunt forefinger down on the page and cried There s the text that ll pin you publicans and sinners Caesar leaned back in his seat and said with withering scorn It s a bad business I ll give you lave to say that It s men like you that s making it bad But whether is it better for a bad business to be in bad hands or in good ones There s a big local praicher in London they re telling me that s hot for joining the public house to the church and turning the parsons into the publicans That s what they all were on the Isle of Man in ould days gone by and pity they re not so still Oh I ve been giving it my sarious thoughts sir I ve been making it a subject for prayer Will I give up my public or hould fast to it to keep it out of worse hands And I m strong to believe the Lord hath spoken It s a little vineyard a little work in a little vineyard Stick to it Caesar and so I will Pete stepped into the kitchen and flung his news at Caesar with a sort of wild melancholy as who would say There is that enough for you Are you satisfied now Mair yee shoh it s the hand of God said Caesar A middling bad hand then said Pete I ve seen better anyway A high spiritual pride took hold of Caesar Black Tom was watching him and working his big eyebrows vigorously With mouth firmly shut and head thrown back Caesar said in a sepulchral voice The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away Blessed be the name of the Lord Pete made a crack of savage laughter Aren t you feeling it sir said Caesar Not a feel near me said Pete I never did the Lord no harm that I know of but He s taken my young wife and left my poor innocent lil one motherless Unsearchable the wisdom and justice of God said Caesar Unsearchable said Pete It s all that But I don t know if you re calling it justice I m not myself It isn t my tally Blasphemy I lave it with you A scoffer am I So be it The Lord s licked me and I ve had enough But I m not going down on my knees for it anyway The Almighty and me is about quits With that word on his lips he strode out of the place grim implacable almost savage a fierce smile fluttering on his ashy face XXI Grannie came to Elm Cottage next morning with two duck eggs for Pete s breakfast She was boiling them in a saucepan when Pete came downstairs Come now she said coaxingly as she laid them on the table with the water smoking off the shells But Pete could not eat He hasn t destroyed any food these days said Nancy A little before she had rolled her apron slipped out into the street and brought back a tiny packet screwed up in a bit of newspaper Perhaps he ll ate them on the road said Grannie I ll put them in the hankerchief in his hat anyway My faith no woman cried Nancy He s the mischief for sweating He ll be mopping his forehead and forgetting the eggs But here where s your waistcoat pocket Pete Have you room for a hayseed anywhere There It s a quarter of twist poor boy she whispered behind her hand to Grannie Thus they vied with each other in little attentions to the down hearted man Meantime Crow the driver of the Douglas coach a merry old sinner with a bulbous nose and short hair standing erect like the steel pins of an electric brush was whistling as he put his horses to in the marketplace Presently he swirled round the corner and drew up at the gate The women then became suddenly quiet and put their aprons to their mouths as if a hearse had stopped at the door but Pete bustled about and shouted boisterously to cover the emotion of his farewell Good bye Grannie I ll say a word for you when I get there Good bye Nancy I ll not be forgetting yourself neither Good bye lil bogh dropping on one knee at the side of the cradle What right has a man s heart to be going losing him while he has a lil innocent like this to live for Good bye There was a throng of women at the gate talking of Kate Aw a civil person very a civiller person never was It s me that ll be missing her too I served her eggs to the day of her death as you might say Good morning Christian Anne says she just like that Welcome you say I was at home at the woman s door And the beautiful she came home in the gig with the baby Only yesterday you might say And now Lord a massy Hush it s himself I m fit enough to cry when I look at the man The cheerful heart is broke at him Hush They dropped their heads so that Pete might avoid their gaze and held the coach door open for him expecting that he would go inside as to a funeral But he saluted them with Good morning all and leapt to the box seat with Crow The coach stopped to take up the Deemster at the gate of Ballure House Philip looked thin and emaciated and walked with a death like weakness but also a feverish resolution Behind him carrying a rag came Aunty Nan in her white cap with little nervous attentions and a face full of anxiety Drive inside to day Philip she said No no he answered and kissed her pushed her to the other side of the gate with gentle protestation and climbed to Pete s side Then the old lady said Good morning Peter I m so sorry for your great trouble and trust But you ll not let the Deemster ride too long outside if it grows He s had a sleepless night and Go on Crow said Philip in a decisive voice I ll see to that Miss Christian ma am shouted Crow over his shoulder His honour s studdying a bit too hard that s what he is But a gentleman s not much use if his wife s a widow as the man said eh Looking well enough yourself though Miss Christian ma am Getting younger every day in fact I ll have to be fetching that East Indee captain n up yet I will that Ha ha Get on Boxer Then with a flick of the whip they were off on their journey The day was calm and beautiful Old Barrule wore his yellow skull cap of flowering gorse the birds sang on the trees and the sea on the shore sang also with the sound of far off joy bells It was a heart breaking day to Pete but he tried to bear himself bravely He was seated between Philip and the driver On the farther side of Crow there were two other passengers a farmer and a fisherman The farmer a foul mouthed fellow with a long staff and two dogs racing and barking on the road was returning from Midsummer fair at which he had sold his sheep the fisherman a simple creature was coming home from the mackerel fishing at Kinsale with a box of the fish between his legs The wife s been having a lil one since I was laving in March said the fisherman laughing all over his bronzed face A boy d ye say Aw another boy of coorse Three of them now all men Got a letter at Ramsey post office coming through She s getting on as nice as nice and the ould woman s busy doing for her Gee up Boxer we ll wet its head at the Hibernian said Crow I m not partic lar at all said the fisherman cheerily The mack rel s been doing middling this season anyway And then in his simple way he went on to paint home and the joy of coming back to it with the new baby and the mother in child bed and the grandmother as housekeeper and the other children waiting for new frocks and new jackets out of the earnings of the fishing and himself going round to pay the grocer what had been put on strap while he was at Kin sale till Pete was melted and could listen no longer I m persuaded still she wasn t well when she went away he whispered turning his shoulder to the men and his face to Philip He talked in a low voice just above the rumble of the wheels trying to extenuate Kate s fault and to excuse her to Philip It s no use thinking hard of anybody is it sir he said We can t crawl into another person s soul as the saying is After that he asked many questions about Kate s illness about the doctor about the funeral about everything except the man of him he asked nothing Philip was compelled to answer He was like a prisoner chained at the galleys he was forced to go on They crossed the bridge over the top of Ballaglass which goes down to the mill at Cornaa There s the glen sir said Pete Aw the dear ould days Wading in the water leaping over the stones clambering on the trunks aw dear aw dear Bareheaded and barefooted in those times sir but smart extraordinary and a terble notion of being dressy too Twisting ferns about her lil neck for lace sticking a mountain thistle sparkling with dew on her breast for a diamond twining a trail of fuchsia round her head for a crown aw dear aw dear And now well well to think to think There was laughter on the other side of the coach What do you say captain n Pete shouted Crow What s that asked Pete The fisherman had treated the driver and the farmer at the Hibernian and was being rewarded with robustious chaff I m telling Dan Johnny here these childers that s coming when a man s away from home isn t much to trust Best put a sight up with the lil one to the wise woman of Glen Aldyn eh A man doesn t like to bring up a cuckoo in the nest what d ye say captain n I say you re a dirty ould divil Crow and I don t want to be chucking you off your seat said Pete and with that he turned back to Philip The driver was affronted but the farmer pacified him by an appeal to his fear He d be coarse to tackle the same fellow I saw him clane out a tent with one hand at Tyn wald It s a wonder she didn t come home for all said Pete at Philip s ear at the end you know Couldn t face it out I suppose Nothing to be afraid of though if she d only known I had kept things middling straight up to then And I d have broke the head of the first man that d wagged a tongue But maybe it was myself she was freckened of Freckened of me Poor thing poor thing Philip was in torment To witness Pete s simple grief to hear him breathe a forgiveness for the erring woman and to be trusted with the thoughts of his heart as a father might be trusted by a young child it was anguish it was agony it was horror More than once he felt an impulse to cast off his load to confess to tell everything But he reflected that he had no right to do this that the secret was not his own to give away His fear restrained him also He looked into Pete s face so full of manly sorrow and shuddered to think of it transformed by rage Sit hard gentlemen Breeches work here shouted Crow They were at the top of the steep descent going down to Laxey The white town lay sprinkled over the green banks of the glen and the great water wheel stood in the depths of the mountain gill behind it She s there She s yonder It s herself at the door She s up She s looking out for the coach cried the fisherman clambering up on to the seat Aisy all shouted Crow No use mister Crow Nothing will persuade me but that s herself with the lil one in a blanket at the door Before the coach had drawn up at the bridge the fisherman had leapt to the ground shouldered his keg shouted Good everin all and disappeared down an alley of the town The driver alighted A crowd gathered around There were parcels to take up parcels to set down and the horses to water When the coach was ready to start again the farmer with his dogs had gone but there was a passenger for an inside place It was a girl a bright young thing with a comely face and laughing black eyes She was dressed smartly after her country fashion in a hat covered with scarlet poppies and with a vast brooch at the neck of her bodice In one hand she carried a huge bunch of sweet smelling gilvers A group of girl companions came to see her off and there was much giggling and chatter and general excitement Are you forgetting the pouch and pipe Emma Let me see am I No it s here in my frock Well you ll be coming together by the coach at nine it s like It s like we will Liza if the steamer isn t late Now then ladies off the step Any room for a lil calf in the straw with you missy Freckened Tut Only a lil calf as clane as clane and breath as swate as your own miss There you are it ll be lying quiet enough till we get to Douglas All ready Ready we are then Collar work now gentlemen Aise the horse sir Thank you Thank you Not you your Honour sit where you are Dempster XXII Pete got down to walk up the hill but Philip though he made some show of alighting also was glad of the excuse to remain in his seat It relieved him of Pete s company for a while at all events He had time to ask himself again why he was there where he was going to and what he was going to do But his brain was a cloudy waste Only one picture emerged from the maze It was that of the burial of the nameless waif in the grave at the foot of the wall If he was conscious of any purpose it was a vague idea of going to that grave But it lay ahead of him only as an ultimate goal He was waiting and watching for an opportunity of escape If it came God be praised If it did not come God help and forgive him Meanwhile Pete walked behind and caught fragments of a conversation between the girl and Crow So you re going to meet himself coming home miss eh My faith how d ye know that But it s yourself for knowing things mister Crow Has he been sailing foreign Yes sir and nine months away for a week come Monday But spoken at Holyhead in Tuesday s paper and paid off in Liverpool yesterday That s his nitials if you want to know J W I worked them on the pouch myself I ve spun him a web for a jacket too Sweethearting with the miner fellows while Jemmy s been away Have I d ye say How people will be talking Aw no offence at all But sorry you re not keeping another string to your bow missy These sailor lads aren t partic lar anyway Bless your heart no but getting as tired of one swateheart as a pig of brewer s grain Constant Chut When the like of that sort is away foreign he lays up of the first girl he comes foul of The girl laughed and shook her head bravely but the tears were beginning to trickle from her eyes and the hand that held the flowers was trembling Don t listen to the man my dear said Pete There s too much comic in these ould bachelor bucks Your boy is dying to get home to you Go bail on that Emma The packet isn t making half way enough for him and he s bad dreadful wanting to ship aloft and let out the topsail At the crest of the hill Pete climbed back to Philip s side and said The heart s a quare thing sir Got its winds and tides same as anything else The wind blows contrary ways in one day and it s the same with the heart itself Changeable Well maybe We shouldn t be too hard on it for all If I d only known now She wasn t much better than a child when I left for Kimberley and then what was I I was only common stuff anyway not much fit for the likes of herself when you think of it sir If I d only guessed when I came back I could have done it sir I was loving the woman like life but if I d only known now Well and what s love if it s thinking of nothing but itself If I d thought she was loving another man by the time I came home I could have given her up to him yes I could I m persuaded I could so help me God I could Philip was wasting on that journey like a piece of wax Pete saw his face melting away till it looked more like a skeleton than the face of a man really alive You mustn t be taking it so bad at all Phil said Pete She ll be middling right where she s gone to sir She ll be right enough yonder he said rolling his head sideways to where the sun was going round to its setting And then softly as if half afraid she might not be he muttered into his beard God be good to my poor broken hearted girl and forgive her sins for Christ s sake An elderly gentleman got on the coach at Onchan Helloa Deemster he cried You look as sober as an old crow Sober Old Crow Ha ha He was a facetious person of high descent in the island Crow never goes home without getting off the box once or twice to pick up the moonlight on the road do you Crow That ll do parson that ll do roared Crow And then his reverence leaned across the driver and directed the shaft of his wit at Philip And how s the young housekeeper Deemster Philip shuddered visibly and made some inarticulate reply Good looking young woman they re telling me Jem y Lord s got taste seemingly But take care your Honour take care Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour s wife nor his ox nor his ass Philip laughed noisily The miserable man was writhing in his seat Take an old fiddler s advice Deemster have nothing to do with the women When they re young they re kittens to play with you but when they re old they re cats to scratch you Pete twisted his body until the whole breadth of his back blocked the parson from Philip s face A fortnight ago you were saying sir A fortnight muttered Philip There ll be daisies growing on her grave by this time said Pete softly The parson had put up his nose glasses Who s this fellow Crow Captain what His honour s cousin Cousin Oh of course yes I remember Tynwald ah h m The coach set down its passengers in the market place Pete inquired the hour of its return journey and was told that it started back at six He helped the girl to alight and directed her to the pier where a crowd of people were awaiting the arrival of the steamer Then he rejoined Philip who led the way through the town The Deemster was observed by everybody As he passed along the streets there was much whispering and nudging and some bowing and lifting of hats He responded to none of it He recognised no one He who was famous for courtesy renowned for gracious manners beloved for a smile like sunshine the brighter and more winsome when it broke as from a cloud returned no man s salutation that day and replied to no woman s greeting His face was set hard like a marble mask It passed along without appearing to see Pete walked one step behind They did not speak as they went through the town Not a word or a sign passed between them Philip turned into a side street and drew up at an iron gate which opened on to a churchyard They were at the churchyard of saint George s This is the place said Philip huskily Pete took off his hat The gate was partly open It was Saturday and the organist was alone in the church practising hymns for Sunday s services They passed through The churchyard was an oblong enclosure within high walls overlooked on its long sides by rows of houses One of these rows was Athol Street and one of the houses was the Deemster s It was late afternoon by this time Long shadows were cast eastward from the tombstones the horizontal sunlight was making the leaves very light Philip walked noisily jerkily irregularly like a man conscious of weakness and determined to conquer it Pete walked behind so softly that his foot on the gravel was hardly to be heard The organist was playing Cowper s familiar hymn God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform There was a broad avenue bordered by railed tombs leading to the church door Philip turned out of this into a narrow path which went through a bare green space that was dotted with pegs of wood and little unhewn slabs of slate like an abandoned quoit ground At the farthest corner of this space he stopped before a mound near to the wall It was the new made grave The scars of the turf were still unhealed and the glist of the spade was on the grass Philip hesitated a moment and looked round at Pete as if even then even there he would confess But he saw no escape from the mesh of his own lies and with a deep breath of submission he pointed down turned his head over his shoulder and said in a strange voice There The silence was long and awful At length Pete said in a broken whisper Lave me sir lave me Philip turned away breathing audibly A moment longer Pete stood where he was gripping his hat with both hands in front of him Then he went down on his knees Oh forgive me my hard thoughts of thee he said Jesus forgive me my hard thoughts of my poor Kirry Philip heard no more The organ was very loud and triumphant Deep in unfathomable mines Of never failing skill He treasures up His bright designs And works His sovereign will A red shaft of sunlight tipped down on Pete s uncovered head from the top of the wall The blessed tears had come to him He was sobbing aloud he was alone with his love at last He was alone with her indeed At that moment Kate was looking down from the window of her room She saw him kneeling and praying by another s grave Philip never knew how he got out of the churchyard He crawled out creeping along by the wall and slinking through the gate heart sick and all but heart dead When he came to himself he was standing in Athol Street and a company of jolly fellows in a jaunting car driving out of the golden sunset were rattling past him with shouts and peals of laughter XXIII Kate was standing in her room with the door open beating her hands together in the first helpless stupor of fear when she saw a man coming up the stairs His legs seemed to be giving way as he ascended he was bent and feeble and had all the look of great age As he approached he lifted his face which was old and withered Then she saw who it was It was Philip She made an involuntary cry and he smiled upon her a hard frozen terrible smile He is lost she thought Her scared expression penetrated to his soul He knew that she had seen everything At first he tried to speak but he could utter nothing Then a mad desire seized him to lay hold of her by the arms by the shoulders by the throat Conquering this impulse he stood motionless passing his hands through his hair She dropped her eyes and hung her head Their abasement in each other s eyes was complete He was ashamed before her she was ashamed before him One moment they faced each other thus in silence in pitiless and awful silence and then slowly very slowly stupefied and crushed he turned away and crept out of the house It is the end the end What was the use of going farther He had fallen too low His degradation was abject It was hopeless irreparable irremediable End it all end it all The words clamoured in his inmost soul Halting down the quay he made for the ferry steps where boats were waiting for hire He had lately hired one of an evening and pulled round the Head for the sake of the breath and the silence of the sea Going far out this evening your Honor the boatman asked Farther than ever he answered Pull pull Away from the terrible past Away from the horrible present The steamer had arrived and had discharged her passengers She was still pulsing at the end of the red pier like a horse that pants after running a race A band was playing a waltz somewhere on the promenade Pleasure boats were darting about the bay Sea birds were sitting on the water where the sewers of the gay little town empty into the sea Pull pull He was flying from remorse from despair from the deep duplicity of a double life from the lie that had slain the heart of a living man How low he had fallen Could he fall lower without falling into crime Pull pull He would be a criminal next When a man had been degraded in his own eyes and in the eyes of her he loved crime stood beckoning him He might try but he could not resist he must yield he must fall It was the only degradation remaining Better end everything before dropping into that last abyss Pull pull He was the judge of his island and he had outraged justice Holding a false title living on a false honour he was safe of no man s respect secure of no woman s goodwill Exposure hung over him He would be disgraced the law would be disgraced the island would be disgraced Pull pull pull before it is too late out far out farther than tide returns or sea tells stories to the shore He had rowed like a slave escaping from his chains in terror of being overtaken and dragged back The voices of the harbour were now hushed the music of the band was deadened the horses running along the promenade seemed to creep like ants and the traffic of the streets was no louder than a dull subterranean rumble He had shot out of the margin of smooth blue water in which the island lay as on a mirror and out of the shadow of the hill upon the bay The sea about him now was running green and glistening and the red sun light was coming down on it like smoke Only the steeples and towers and glass domes of the town reached up into luminous air He could see the squat tower of saint George s silhouetted against the dying glory of the sky Seven years he had been its neighbour and it had witnessed such happy and such cruel hours All the joy of work the sweetness of success the dreams of greatness the rosy flushes of love and then the tortures of conscience the visions the horror the secret shame the self abandonment and last of all the twofold existence as of husband with wife hidden incomplete unfulfilled yet full of tender ties which had seemed like galling bonds so many a time but were now so sweet when the hour had come to break them How distant it all appeared to be And was he flying from the island like this The island that had honoured him that had rewarded him beyond his deserts and earlier than his dreams that had suffered no jealousy to impede him no rivalry to fret him no disparity of age and service to hold him back the little island that had seemed to open its arms to him and to cry Philip Christian son of your father grandson of your grandfather first of Manxmen come up Oh for what might have been Useless regrets Pull pull and forget But the home of his childhood Ballure Auntie Nan his father s death brightened by one hope the last but ah how vain Port Mooar Pete The sea s calling me Pull pull The sea was calling him indeed Calling him to the deep womb that is death not birth He was far out The sun had gone the island was like a bird of ashy grey stretched across the horizon the great wing of night was coming down from the sky and up out the mysterious depths of the sea came the profound hum the mighty voice that is the organ of the world He took in the oars and his tiny shell began to drift At that moment his eye caught something at the bottom of the boat It was a flower a broken stem a torn rose and a few scattered rose leaves Only a relic of the last occupants but it brought back the perfume of love a sense of tenderness of bright eyes of a caress a kiss His mind went back to Sulby to the Melliah to the glen to the days so full of tremulous love when they hovered on the edge of the precipice They had been hurled over it since then It was some relief that between love and honour he would not have to struggle any longer And Kate When all was over and word went round The Deemster is gone what would happen to Kate She would still be at his house in Athol Street That would be the beginning of evil She would wait for him and when hope of his return was lost she would weep for him That would be the key of discovery The truth would become known Though he might be at the bottom of the sea yet the cloud that hung over his life would break It was inevitable And she would be there to bear the storm alone alone with the island which had been deceived alone with Pete who had been lied to and betrayed Was that just Was that brave And then what then What would become of her Openly shamed charged as she must be with the whole weight of the crime from whose burden he had fled accused of his downfall a Delilah a Jezebel what fate should befall her Where would she go Down to what depths He saw her sinking lower than ever man sinks he heard her appeals her supplications Oh what have I done he cried that I can neither live nor die Then in that delirium of anguish in which the order of nature is reversed and external objects no longer produce sensation but sensation produces as it were external objects he thought he saw something at the bottom of the boat where the broken rose had been It was the figure of a man stretched out still and lifeless His eyes went up to the face The face was his own It was ashy grey and it stared up at the grey sky The brain image was himself and he was dead He watched it and it faded away There was nothing left but the scattered rose leaves and the torn flower on the broken stem The terrible shadow was gone he felt that it was gone for ever It was dead and it would haunt him no longer It had lived on an empire of evil doing and his evil doing was at an end He would see his soul no more The tears gushed to his eyes and blinded him They were the first he could remember since he was a boy Alone between the two mirrors of sea and sky the chain that he had dragged so long fell away from him He was a free man again Go back your place is by her side Don t sneak out of life and leave another to pay Suffering is a grand thing It is the struggle of the soul to cast off its sin Accept it go through with it come out of it purged Go back to the island Your life is not ended yet XXIV We were just going sending a lil yawl after you Dempster when we were seeing you a bit overside the head yonder coming back He s drifting home on the flowing tide says I and so you were Must have been a middling stiff pull for all We were thinking you were lost one while there I was almost lost but I m here again thank God said Philip He spoke cheerily and went away with a light step It was now full night the town was lit up and the musicians of the pavement were twanging their banjos and harps Philip felt a sort of physical regeneration a renewal of youth a new birth of heart and hope He was like a man coming out of some hideous Gehenna of delirious illness he though he had never been so light so buoyant so happy in his life before The future was vague He did not yet know what he would do It would be something radical something that would go down to the heart of his condition Oh he would be strong he would be resolute he would pay the uttermost farthing he would not wait to count the cost And she she would be with him He could do nothing without her The partner of his fault would share his redemption also God bless her He let himself into the house and shut the door firmly behind him The lights were still burning in the hall so it was not very late He mounted the stairs with a loud step and swung into his room The lamp was on the table and within the circle cast by its blue shade a letter was lying He took it up with dismay It was in Kate s handwriting Forgive me I am going away It is all my fault I have broken the heart of one man and I am destroying the soul of another If I stay here any longer you will be ruined and lost I am only a millstone about your neck I see it I feel it And yet I have loved you so and wished to be so proud of you Your heart is brave enough though I have sunk it down so low You will live to be strong and good and true though that can never be while I am with you I have been far below you from the first All along I have only been thinking how much I loved you but you have had so many other things to consider My life seems to have been one long battle for love I think it has been a cruel battle too Anyway I am beaten and oh so tired Do not follow me I pray of you do not try to find me It is my last request Think of me as on a long journey I may be the Great God of heaven knows I am taking the little cracked medallion from the bottom of the oak box It is the only picture I can find and it will remind me of some one else as well my little Katherine my motherless baby I have nothing to leave with you but this it was a lock of her hair At first I thought of the wedding ring that you gave me when I came here but it would not come off and besides I could not part with it Good bye I ought to have done this long ago But you will not hate me now We could never be happy together again Good bye PART VI MAN AND GOD I The summer had gone the gorse had dried up the herring fishing had ended and Pete had become poor His Nickey had done nothing his last hundred pounds had been spent and his creditors in scores quiet as mice until then were baying about him like bloodhounds He sold his boat and satisfied everybody but fell nevertheless to the position of a person of no credit and little consequence On the lips of the people he descended from captain n Pete to Peter Bridget When he saluted the rich with How do they replied with a stare a lift of the chin and You ve the odds of me my good man To this he replied with a roll of the head and a peal of laughter Have I now But you ll die for all Ballajora Chapel had been three months rehearsing a children s cantata entitled Under the Palms and building an arbour of palm branches on a platform for Pete s rugged form to figure in but Caesar sat there instead Still Pete had his six thousand pounds in mortgage on Ballawhaine Only three other persons knew anything of that Caesar who had his own reasons for saying nothing Peter Christian himself who was hardly likely to tell and the High Bailiff who was a bachelor and a miser and kept all business revelations as sacred as are the secrets of another kind of confessional When Pete s evil day came and the world showed no pity Caesar became afraid I wouldn t sell out sir said he Hould on till Martinmas anyway The first half year s interest is due then There s no knowing what ll happen before that What s it saying He shall give His angels charge concerning thee The ould man has had a polatic stroke they re telling me Aw the Lord s mercy endureth for ever Pete began to sell his furniture He cleared out the parlour as bare as a vault Time for it too he said I ve been wanting the room for a workshop Martinmas came and Caesar returned in high feather No interest he said Give him the month s grace and hould hard till it s over The Lord will provide Isn t it written In the world ye shall have tribulation Things are doing wonderful though Last night going home from Ballajora I saw the corpse lights coming from the big house to Kirk Christ s Churchyard with the parson psalming in front of them The ould man s dying I ve seen his soul To thy name O Lord be all the glory Pete sold out a second room and turned the key on it Mortal cosy and small this big ugly mansion is getting Nancy he said The month s grace allowed by the deed of mortgage expired and Caesar came to Elm Cottage rubbing both hands Turn him out neck and crop sir Not a penny left to the man and six thousand goolden pounds paid into his hands seven months ago But who s wondering at that There s Ross back again carrying half a ton of his friends over the island and lashing out the silver like dust Your silver sir yours And here s yourself with the world darkening round you terrible But no fear of you now The meek shall inherit the earth Aw God is opening His word more and more sir more and more There s that Black Tom too He was talking big a piece back but this morning he was up before the High Bailiff for charming and cheating and was put away for the Dempster Lord keep him from the gallows and hell fire Oh it s a refreshing saison It was God spaking to me by Providence when I tould you to put money on that mortgage What s the Scripture saying For brass I bring thee goold Turn him out sir turn him out Didn t you tell me that ould Ballawhaine had a polatic stroke said Pete I did but he s a big man let him pay his way said Caesar Samson was a strong man and Solomon was a wise one but they couldn t pay money when they hadn t got it said Pete Let him look to his son then said Caesar That s just what he s going to do said Pete I ll let him die in his bed God forgive him The winter came and Pete began to think of buying a Dandie which being smaller than a Nickey and of yawl rig he could sail of himself and so earn a living by fishing the cod To do this he had a further clearing of furniture thereby reducing the size of the house to three rooms The featherbed left his own bedstead the watch came out of his pocket and the walls of the hall kitchen gaped and yawned in the places where the pictures had been The bog bane to the rushy curragh say I Nancy said Pete Not being used of such grandeur I was taking it hard Never could remember to wind that watch And feathers bless you Don t I remember the lil mother with a sickle and a bag going cutting the long grass on the steep brews for the cow and drying a handful for myself for a bed Sleeping on it Never slept the like since at all The result of Pete s first week s fishing was twenty cod and a gigantic ling He packed the cod in boxes and sent them by Crow and the steam packet to the market in Liverpool The ling he swung on his back over his oilskin jacket and carried it home the head at his shoulder and the tail dangling at his legs There he cried dropping it on the floor split it and salt it and you ve breakfas es for a month When the remittance came from Liverpool it was a postal order for seven and sixpence Never mind said Pete we re bating Dan Hommy anyway the ould muff has only made seven and a penny The weather was rough the fishing was bad the tackle got broken and Pete began to extol plain living Gough bless me he said I don t know in the world what s coming to the ould island at all When I was for a man servant with Caesar the farming boys were ateing potatoes and herrings three times a day But now butcher s mate every dinner time if you plaze And tay the girls must be having it reg lar and taking no shame with them neither My sake I remember when the mother would be whispering Keep an eye on the road boy while I m brewing myself a cup of tay Truth enough Nancy An ounce a week and a pound of sugar and people wondering at the woman for that The mountains were taken from the people and they were no longer allowed to cut turf for fuel coals were dear the winter was cold and Pete began to complain of a loss of appetite My teeth must be getting bad Nancy he whined They were white as milk and faultless as a negro s Don t domesticate my food somehow What s the odds though I Can t ate suppers at all and that s some constilation Nothing like going to bed hungry Nancy if you re wanting to get up with an appetite for breakfast Then the beautiful drames woman Gough bless me the dinners and the feasts and the bankets you re ateing in your sleep Now if you filled your skin like a High Bailiff afore going to bed ten to one you d have a buggane riding on your breast the night through and drame of dying for a drink of water Aw sleep s a reg lar Radical Good for levelling up anyway Christmas approached servants boasted of the Christmas boxes they got from their masters and Pete remembered Nancy Nancy said he they re telling me Liza Billy ny Clae is getting twenty pound per year per annum at her new situation in Douglas She isn t nothing to yourself at cooking Mustn t let the lil one stand in your way woman She s getting a big girl now and I ll be taking her out in the Dandie with me and tying her down on the low deck there and giving her a pig s bladder and she ll be playing away as nice as nice See Nancy looked at him and he dropped his eyes before her Is it wanting to get done with me you are Pete she said in a quavering voice There s my black I can sell it for something it s never been wore at me since I sat through the sarvice with Grannie the Sunday after we got news of Kirry And I m not a big eater Pete never was you can clear me of that anyway A bit of bread and cheese for my dinner when you are out at the fishing and I m asking no better Hould your tongue woman cried Pete Hould your tongue afore you break my heart I ve seen my rich days and I ve seen my poor days I ve tried both and I m content II Meantime Philip in Douglas was going from success to success from rank to rank from fame to fame Everything he put his hand to counted to him for righteousness When he came to himself after the disappearance of Kate his heart was a wasted field of volcanic action with ashes and scoriae of infernal blackness on the surface but the wholesome soil beneath In spite of her injunction he set himself to look for her More than love more than pity more than remorse prompted and supported him She was necessary to his resurrection to his new birth So he scoured every poor quarter of the town every rookery of old Douglas and this was set down to an interest in the poor An epidemic broke out on the island and during the scare that followed wherein some of the wealthy left their homes for England and many of the poor betook themselves to the mountains and even certain of the doctors found refuge in flight Philip won golden opinions for presence of mind and personal courage He organised a system of registration regulated quarantine and caused the examination of everybody coming to the island or leaving it From day to day he went from house to house from hospital to hospital from ward to ward No dangers terrified him he seemed to keep his eye on each case He was only looking for Kate only assuring himself that she had not fallen victim to the pest only making certain that she had not come or gone But the divine madness which seizes upon a crowd when its heart is touched laid hold of the island at the sight of Philip s activities He was worshipped he was beloved he was the idol of the poor almost everybody else was forgotten in the splendour of his fame no committee could proceed without him no list was complete until it included his name Philip was ashamed of his glories but he had no heart to repudiate them When the epidemic subsided he had convinced himself that Kate must be gone that she must be dead Gone therefore was his only hold on life and dead was his hope of a moral resurrection He could do nothing without her but go on as he was going To pretend to a new birth now would be like a death bed conversion it would be like renouncing the joys of life after they have renounced the renouncer His colleague the old Deemster was stricken down by paralysis and he was required to attend to both their duties This made it necessary at first that all Deemster s Courts should be held in Castletown and hence Ramsey saw him rarely He spent his days in the Court house of the Castle and his nights at home His fair hair became prematurely white and his face grew more than ever like that of a man newly risen from a fever Study said the world and it bowed its head the lower Yet he was seen to be not only a studious man but a melancholy one To defeat curiosity he began to enter a little into the life of the island and as time went on to engage in some of the social duties of his official position On Christmas Eve he gave a reception at his house in Athol Street He had hardly realised how it would tear at the tenderest fibres of memory The very rooms that had been Kate s were given over to the ladies who were his guests All afternoon the crush was great and the host was the attraction He was a fascinating figure so young yet already so high so silent yet able to speak so splendidly and then so handsome with that whitening head and that smile like vanishing sunshine In the midst of the reception Philip received a letter from Ramsey that was like the cry of a bleeding heart My lil one is ill theyr sayin shes Diein cum to me for gods sake Peat The snow was beginning to fall as the guests departed When the last of them was gone the clock on the bureau was striking six and the night was closing in By eight o clock Philip was at Elm Cottage III Pete was sitting at the foot of the stairs unwashed uncombed with his clothes half buttoned and his shoes unlaced Phil he cried and leaping up he took Philip by both hands and fell to sobbing like a child They went upstairs together The bedroom was dense with steam and the forms of two women were floating like figures in a fog There she is the bogh cried Pete in a pitiful wail The child lay outstretched on Grannie s lap with no sign of consciousness and hardly any sign of life except the hollow breathing of bronchitis Philip felt a strange emotion come over him He sat on the end of the bed and looked down The little face with its twitching mouth and pinched nostrils beating with every breath was the face of Kate The little head with its round forehead and the silvery hair brushed back from the temples was his own head A mysterious throb surprised him a great tenderness a deep yearning something new to him and born as it were in his breast at that instant He had an impulse never felt before to go down on his knees where the child lay to take it in his arms to draw it to him to fondle it to call it his own and to pour over it the inarticulate babble of pain and love that was bursting from his tongue But some one was kneeling there already and in his jealous longing he realised that his passionate sorrow could have no voice Pete at Grannie s lap was stroking the child s arm and her forehead with the tenderness of a woman The bogh millish Seems aisier now doesn t she Grannie Quieter anyway Not coughing so much is she The doctor came at the moment and Caesar entered the room behind him with a face of funereal resignation See cried Pete there s your lil patient doctor She s lying as quiet as quiet and hasn t coughed to spake of for better than an hour H m said the doctor ominously He looked at the child made some inquiries of Grannie gave certain instructions to Nancy and then lifted his head with a sigh Well we ve done all we can for her he said If the child lives through the night she may get over it The women threw up their hands with Aw dear aw dear Philip gave a low sharp cry of pain but Pete who had been breathing heavily watching intently and holding his arms about the little one as if he would save it from disease and death and heaven itself now lost himself in the immensity of his woe Tut doctor what are you saying he said You were always took for a knowledgable man doctor but you re talking nonsense now Don t you see the child s only sleeping comfortable And haven t I told you she hasn t coughed anything worth for an hour Do you think a poor fellow s got no sense at all The doctor was a patient man as well as a wise one he left the room without a word But thinking to pour oil on Pete s wounds and not minding that his oil was vitriol Caesar said If it s the Lord s will it s His will sir The sins of the fathers are visited upon the children yes and the mothers too God forgive them At that Pete leapt to his feet in a flame of wrath You lie you lie he cried God doesn t punish the innocent for the guilty If He does He s not a good God but a bad one Why should this child be made to suffer and die for the sin of its mother Aye or its father either Show me the man that would make it do the like and I ll smash his head against the wall Blaspheming am I No but it s you that s blaspheming God is good God is just God is in heaven and you are making Him out no God at all but worse than the blackest devil that s in hell Caesar went off in horror of Pete s profanities If the Lord keep not the city he said the watchman waketh in vain Pete s loud voice had aroused the child It made a little cry and he was all softness in an instant The women moistened its lips with barley water and hushed its fretful whimper Come said Philip taking Pete s arm Let me lean on you Philip said Pete and the stalwart fellow went tottering down the stairs They sat on opposite sides of the fireplace and kept the staircase door open that they might hear all that happened in the room above Get thee to bed Nancy said the voice of Grannie Dear knows how soon you ll be wanted You ll be calling me for twelve then Grannie now mind you ll be calling me Poor Pete He s not so far wrong though What s it saying Suffer lil childers But Caesar s right enough this time Grannie The bogh is took for death as sure as sure I saw the crow that was at the wedding going crossing the child s head the very last time she was out of doors Pete was listening intently Philip was gazing passively into the fire I couldn t help it sir I couldn t really whispered Pete across the hearth When a man s got a child that s ill they may talk about saving souls but what s the constilation in that It s not the soul he s wanting saving at all it s the child now isn t it now Philip made some confused response Coorse I can t expect you to understand that Philip You re a grand man and a clever man and a feeling man but I can t expect you to understand that now is it likely The greenest gall s egg of a father that isn t half wise has the pull of you there Phil Deed he has though When a man has a child of his own he s knowing what it manes the Lord help him Something calls to him it s like blood calling to blood it s like I don t know that I m understanding it myself neither not to say understand exactly Every word that Pete spoke was like a sword turning both ways Philip drew his breath heavily You can feel for another Phil the Lord forbid you should ever feel for yourself Books are your children and they re best off that s never having no better But the lil ones God help them to see them fail and suffer and sink and you not able to do nothing and themselves calling to you calling still calling reg lar calling out of mercy the way I am telling of any way O God O God Philip s throat rose He felt as if he must betray himself the next instant Perhaps the doctor was right for all Maybe the child isn t willing to stay with us now the mother is gone maybe it s wanting away poor thing And who knows Wouldn t trust but the mother is waiting for the lil bogh yonder waiting and waiting on the shore there and ticing and ticing I ve heard of the like anyway Philip groaned His brain reeled his legs grew cold as stones A great awe came over him It was not Pete alone that he was encountering In these searchings and rendings of the heart which uncovered every thought and tore open every wound he was entering the lists with God himself The church bell began to ring What s that cried Philip It had struck upon his ear like a knell Oiel Verree said Pete The bell was ringing for the old Manx service for the singing of Christmas carols The fibres of Pete s memory were touched by it He told of his Christmases abroad how it was summer instead of winter and fruits were on the trees instead of snow on the ground how people who had never spoken to him before would shake hands and wish him a merry Christmas Then from sheer weariness and a sense of utter desolation broken by the comfort of Philip s company he fell asleep in his chair The night wore on the house was quiet only the husky rasping of the child s hurried breathing came from the floor above An evil thought in the guise of a pious one took possession of Philip God is wise he told himself God is merciful He knows what is best for all of us What are we poor impotent grasshoppers that we dare pray to Him to change His great purposes It is idle It is impious While the child lives there will be security for no one If it dies there will be peace and rest and the beginning of content The mother must be gone already so the dark chapter of our lives will be closed at last God is all wise God is all good The child made a feeble cry and Philip crept upstairs to look Grannie had dozed off in her seat and little Katherine was on the bed A disregarded doll lay with inverted head on the counterpane The fire had slid and died down to a lifeless glow and the kettle had ceased to steam There was no noise in the room save the child s galloping breathing which seemed to scrape the walls as with a file Sometimes there was a cough that came like a voice through a fog Philip crept in noiselessly knelt down by the bed head and leaned over the pillow A candle which burned on the mantelpiece cast its light on the head that lay there The little face was drawn the little pinched nostrils were beating like a pulse the little lip beneath was beaded with perspiration the beautiful round forehead was damp and the silken silvery hair was matted Philip thought the child must be dying and his ugly piety gave way There was a movement on the bed One little hand that had been clenched hard on the breast came over the counterpane and fell outstretched and open before him He took it for an appeal a dumb and piteous appeal and the smothered tenderness of the father s heart came uppermost Her child his child dying and he there yet not daring to claim her A new fear took hold of him He had been wrong there could be no security in the child s death no peace no rest no content As surely as the child died he would betray himself He would blurt it all out he would tell everything My child my darling my Kate s Kate The cry would burst from him He could not help it And to reveal the black secret at the mouth of an open grave would be terrible it would be horrible it would be awful Spare her O Lord spare her In a fear bordering on delirium he went downstairs and shook Pete by the shoulders to awaken him Come quickly he said Pete opened his eyes with a bewildered look She s better isn t she he asked Courage said Philip Is she worse It s life or death now We must try something that I saw when I was away Good Lord and I ve been sleeping Save her Philip You re great your clever Be quiet for God s sake my good fellow Quick a kettle of boiling water a blanket some hot towels Oh you re a friend you ll save her The doctors don t know nothing Ten minutes afterwards the child made a feeble cry coughed loosely threw up phlegm and came out of the drowsy land which it had inhabited for a week In ten minutes more it was wrapped in the hot towels and sitting on Pete s knee before a brisk are opening its little eyes and pursing its little mouth and making some inarticulate communication Then Grannie awoke with a start and reproached herself for sleeping But dear heart alive she cried with both hands up the bogh villish is mended wonderful Nancy came back in her stockings blinking and yawning She clapped and crowed at sight of the child s altered face The clock in the kitchen was striking twelve by this time the bells had begun to ring again the carol singers were coming out of the church there was a sound on the light snow of the street like the running of a shallow river and the waits were being sung for the dawn of another Christmas The doctor looked in on his way home and congratulated himself on the improved condition The crisis was passed the child was safe Ah better better he said cheerily I thought we might manage it this time It was the Dempster that done it cried Pete He was cooing and blowing at little Katherine over the fringe of her towels He couldn t have done more for the lil one if she d been his own flesh and blood Philip dared not speak He hurried away in a storm of emotion Not yet he thought not yet The time of his discovery was not yet It was like Death though it waited for him somewhere Somewhere and at some time some day in the year some place on the earth Perhaps his eyes knew the date in the calendar perhaps his feet knew the spot on the land yet he knew neither Somewhere and at some time God knew where God knew when He kept his own secrets That night Philip slept at the Mitre and next morning he went up to Ballure IV The Governor could not forget Tynwald Exaggerating the humiliation of that day he thought his influence in the island was gone He sold his horses and carriages and otherwise behaved like a man who expected to be recalled Towards Philip he showed no malice It was not merely as the author of his shame that Philip had disappointed him He had half cherished a hope that Philip would become his son in law But when the rod in his hand had failed him when it proved too big for a staff and too rough for a crutch he did not attempt to break it Either from the instinct of a gentleman or the pride of a strong man he continued to shower his favours upon Philip Going to London with his wife and daughter at the beginning of the new year he appointed Philip to act as his deputy Philip did not abuse his powers As grandson of the one great Manxman of his century and himself a man of talents he was readily accepted by the island His only drawback was his settled melancholy This added to his interest if it took from his popularity The ladies began to whisper that he had fallen in love and that his heart was buried in the grave He did not forget old comrades It was remembered in his favour that one of his friends was a fisherman a cousin across the bar of bastardy who had been a fool and gone through his fortune On saint Bridget s Day Philip held Deemster s Court in Ramsey The snow had gone and the earth had the smell of violets It was almost as if the violets themselves lay close beneath the soil and their odour had been too long kept under The sun which had not been seen for weeks had burst out that day the air was warm and the sky was blue Inside the Court house the upper arcs of the windows had been let down the sun shone on the Deemster as he sat on the dais and the spring breeze played with his silvery wig Some times in the pauses of rasping voices the birds were heard to sing from the trees on the lawn outside The trial was a tedious and protracted one It was the trial of Black Tom During the epidemic that had visited the island he had developed the character of a witch doctor His first appearance in Court had been before the High Bailiff who had committed him to prison He had been bailed out by Pete and had forfeited his bail in an attempt at flight The witnesses were now many and some came from a long distance It was desirable to conclude the same day At five in the evening the Deemster rose and said The Court will adjourn for an hour gentlemen Philip took his own refreshments in the Deemster s room Jem y Lord was with him then put off his wig and gown and slipped through the prisoners yard at the back and round the corner to Elm Cottage It was now quite dark The house was lit by the firelight only which flashed like Will o the wisp on the hall window Philip was surprised by unusual sounds There was laughter within then singing and then laughter again He bad reached the porch and his approach had not been heard The door stood open and he looked in and listened The room was barer than he had ever seen it a table three chairs a cradle a dresser and a corner cupboard Nancy sat by the fire with the child on her lap Pete was squatting on the floor which was strewn with rushes and singing Come Bridget Saint Bridget come in at my door The crock s on the bink and the rush is on the floor Then getting on to all fours like a great boy and bobbing his head up and down and making deep growls to imitate the terrors of a wild beast he made little runs and plunges at the child who jumped and crowed in Nancy s lap and laughed and squealed till she kinked Now stop you great omathaun stop said Nancy It isn t good for the lil one deed it isn t But Pete was too greedy of the child s joy to deny himself the delight of it Making a great low sweep of the room he came back hopping on his haunches and barking like a dog Then the child laughed till the laughter rolled like a marble in her little throat Philip s own throat rose at the sight and his breast began to ache He felt the same thrill as before the same yet different more painful more full of jealous longing This was no place for him He thought he would go away But turning on his heel he was seen by Pete who was now on his back on the floor rocking the child up and down like the bellows of an accordion and to and fro like the sleigh of a loom My faith the Dempster Come in sir come in cried Pete looking over his forehead Then giving the child back to Nancy he leapt to his feet Philip entered with a sick yearning and sat down in the chair facing Nancy You re wondering at me Dempster I know you are sir Said Pete Deed but I m wondering at myself as well I thought I was never going to see a glad day again and if the sky would ever be blue I would be breaking my heart But what is the Manx poet saying sir I have no will but Thine O God That s me sir truth enough and since the lil one has been mending I ve never been so happy in my life Philip muttered some commonplace and put his thumb into the baby s hand It was sucked in by the little fingers as by the soft feelers of the sea anemone Pete drew up the third chair and then all interest was centred on the child She s growing said Philip huskily And getting wise ter ble said Pete You wouldn t be lave it sir but that child s got the head of an almanac She has though Listen here sir what does the cow say darling Moo o said the little one Look at that now said Pete rapturously She knows what the dog says too said Nancy What does Dempster say bogh Bow wow said the child Bless me soul said Pete turning to Philip with amazement at the child s supernatural wisdom And there s Tom Hommy s boy and a fine lil fellow enough for all but six weeks older than this one and not a word out of him yet Hearing himself talked of the dog had come from under the table The child gurgled down at it then made purring noises at its own feet and wriggled in Nancy s lap Dear heart alive if it s not like nursing an eel said Nancy Be quiet will you and the little one was shaken back to her seat Aisy all woman said Pete She s just wanting her lil shoes and stockings off that s it Then talking to the child Um am im lum la loo Just so I don t know what that means myself but she does you see Aw the child is taiching me heaps sir Listening to the lil one I m remembering things Well we re only big children the best of us That s the way the world s keeping young and God help it when we re getting so clever there s no child left in us at all Time for young women to be in bed though said Nancy getting up to give the baby her bath Let me have a hould of the rogue first said Pete and as Nancy took the child out of the room he dragged at it and smothered its open mouth with kisses Poor sport for you sir watching a foolish ould father playing games with his lil one said Pete Philip s answer was broken and confused His eyes had begun to fill and to hide them he turned his head aside Thinking he was looking at the empty places about the walls Pete began to enlarge on his prosperity and to talk as if he were driving all the trade of the island before him Wonderful fishing now Phil I m exporting a power of cod Gretting postal orders and stamps and I don t know what Seven and sixpence in a single post from Liverpool that s nothing sir nothing at all Nancy brought back the child whose silvery curls were now damp What a young lady coming in her night dress cried Pete Work enough had to get it over her head too said Nancy She wouldn t no she wouldn t Here take and dry her hair by the fire while I warm up her supper Pete rolled the sleeves of his jersey above his elbows took the child on his knee and rubbed her hair between his hands singing Come Bridget Saint Bridget come in at my door Nancy clattered about in her clogs filled a saucepan with bread and milk and brought it to the fire Give it to me Nancy said Philip and he leaned over and held the saucepan above the bar The child watched him intently Well did you ever said Pete The strange she s making of you Philip Don t you know the gentleman darling Aw but he s knowing you though The saucepan boiled and Philip handed it back to Nancy Go to him then away with you said Pete Gro to your godfather He d have been your name father too if it had been a boy you d been Off you go and he stretched out his hairy arms until the child touched the floor Philip stooped to take the little one who first pranced and beat the rushes with its feet as with two drumsticks then trod on its own legs swirled about to Pete s arms dropped its lower lip and set up a terrified outcry Ah she knows her own father bless her cried Pete plucking the child back to his breast Philip dropped his head and laughed A sort of creeping fear had taken possession of him as if he felt remotely that the child was to be the channel of his retribution Will you feed her yourself Pete said Nancy She was coming up with a saucer of which she was tasting the contents He s that handy with a child sir you wouldn t think Deed you wouldn t Then stooping to the baby as it ate its supper But I m saying young woman is there no sleep in your eyes to night No but nodding away here like a wood thrush in a tree said Pete He was ladling the pobs into the child s mouth and scooping the overflow from her chin Sleep s a terrible enemy of this one sir She s having a battle with it every night of life anyway God help her she ll have luck better than some of us or she ll be fighting it the other way about one of these days She s us ally going off with the spoon in her mouth sir for all the world like a lil cherub said Nancy Too busy looking at her godfather to night though said Pete Well look at him You owe him your life you lil sandpiper And my sakes the straight like him you are too Isn t she said Nancy If I wasn t thinking the same myself Couldn t look straighter like him if she d been his born child now could she And the curls too and the eyes Well well If she d been a boy now began Pete But Philip had risen to return to the Court house and Pete said in another tone Hould hard a minute sir I ve something to show you Here take the lil one Nancy Pete lit a candle and led the way into the parlour The room was empty of furniture but at one end there was a stool a stone mason s mallet a few chisels and a large stone The stone was a gravestone Pete approached it solemnly held up the candle in front of it and said in a low voice It s for her I ve been doing it myself sir and it s lasted me all winter dark nights and bad days I ll be finishing it to night though God willing and to morrow maybe I ll be taking it to Douglas Is it began Philip but he could not finish The stone was a plain slab rounded at the top bevelled about the edge smoothed on the face and chiselled over the back but there was no sign or symbol on it and no lettering or inscription Is there to be no name asked Philip at last No said Pete No Tell you the truth sir I ve been reading what it s saying in the ould Book about the Recording Angel calling the dead out of their graves Yes And I ve been thinking the way he ll be doing it will be going to the graveyards and seeing the names on the gravestones and calling them out loud to rise up to judgment some as it s saying to life eternal and some to everlasting punishment Well Well sir I ve been thinking if he comes to this one and sees no name on it Pete s voice sank to a whisper maybe he ll pass it by and let the poor sinner sleep on Stumbling back to the Court house through the dark lane Philip thought It was a lie then but it s true now It must be true She must be dead There was a sort of relief in this certainty It was an end at all events a pitiful end a cowardly end a kind of sneaking out of Fate s fingers it was not what he had looked for and intended but he struggled to reconcile himself to it Then he remembered the child and thought Why should I disturb it Why should I disturb Pete I will watch over it all its life I will protect it and find a way to provide for it I will do my duty by it The child shall never want He was offering the key to the lock of the prisoners yard when some one passed him in the lane peered into his face then turned about and spoke Oh it s you Deemster Christian Yes doctor Good night Have you heard the news from Ballawhaine The old gentleman had another stroke this morning No I had not heard it Another Dear me dear me Back in his room Philip resumed his wig and gown and returned to the Court house The place was now lit up by candlelight and densely crowded Everybody rose to his feet as the Deemster stepped to the dais V Come Bridget Saint Bridget come in at my door The crock s on the bink and the rush She s fast said Nancy Rocking this one to sleep is like waiting for the kettle to boil You may try and try and blow and blow but never a sound And no sooner have you forgotten all about her but she s singing away as steady as a top Nancy put the child into the cradle tucked her about twisted the head of the little nest so that the warmth of the fire should enter it and hung a shawl over the hood to protect the little eyelids from the light Will you keep the house till I m home from Sulby Pete I ve my work woman said Pete from the parlour I ll put a junk on the fire and be off then said Nancy She pulled the door on to the catch behind her and went crunching the gravel to the gate There was no sound in the house now but the gentle breathing of the sleeping child soft as an angel s prayer the chirruping of the mended fire like a cage of birds the ticking of the clock and through the parlour wall the dull pat put pat put of the wooden mallet and the scrape of the chisel on the stone Pete worked steadily for half an hour and then came back to the hall kitchen with his tools in his hands The cob of coal had kindled to a lively flame which flashed and went out and the quick black shadows of the chairs and the table and the jugs on the dresser were leaping about the room like elves With parted lips just breaking into a smile Pete went down on one knee by the cradle put the mallet under his arm and gently raised the shawl curtain God bless my motherless girl he said in a voice no louder than a breath Suddenly while he knelt there he was smitten as by an electric shock His face straightened and he drew back still holding the shawl at the tips of his fingers The child was sleeping peacefully with one of its little arms over the counterpane On its face the flickering light of the fire was coming and going making lines about the baby eyes and throwing up the baby features It is in such lights that we are startled by resemblances in a child s face Pete was startled by a resemblance He had seen it before but not as he saw it now A moment afterwards he was reaching across the cradle again his arms spread over it and his face close down at the child s face scanning every line of it as one scans a map Deed but she is though he murmured She s like him enough anyway An awful idea had taken possession of his mind He rose stiffly to his feet and the shawl flapped back The room seemed to be darkening round him He broke the coal though it was burning brightly stepped to the other side of the cradle and looked at the child again It was the same from there The resemblance was ghostly He felt something growing hard inside of him and he returned to his work in the parlour But the chisel slipped the mallet fell too heavily and he stopped His mind fluctuated among distant things He could not help thinking of Port Mooar of the Carasdhoo men of the day when he and Philip were brought home in the early morning Putting his tools down he returned to the room He was holding his breath and walking softly as if in the presence of an invisible thing The room was perfectly quiet he could hear the breath in his nostrils In a state of stupor he stood for some time with bis back to the fire and watched his shadow on the opposite wall and on the ceiling The cradle was at his feet He could not keep his eyes off it From time to time he looked down across one of his shoulders With head thrown back and lips apart the child was breathing calmly and sleeping the innocent sleep This angel innocence reproached him My heart must be going bad he muttered Your bad thoughts are blackening the dead For shame Pete Quilliam for shame He was feeling like a man who is in a storm of thunder and lightning at night Familiar things about him looked strange and awful Stooping to the cradle again he turned back the shawl on to the cradle head as a girl turns back the shade of her sun bonnet Then the firelight was full on the child s face and it moved in its sleep It moved yet more under his steadfast gaze and cried a little as if the terrible thought that was in his mind had penetrated to its own He was stooping so when the door was opened and Caesar entered violently making asthmatic noises in his throat Pete looked up at him with a stupefied air Peter he said will you sell that mortgage Pete answered with a growl Will you transfer it to me said Caesar The time s not come said Pete What time The time foretold by the prophet when the lion can lie down with the lamb Pete laughed bitterly Caesar was quivering his mouth was twitching and his eyes were wild Will you come over to the Mitre then What for to the Mitre Ross Christian is there Pete made an impatient gesture That stormy petrel again He s always about when there s bad weather going Will you come and hear what the man s saying What s he saying Will you hear for yourself Pete looked hard at Caesar looked again then caught up his cap and went out at the door VI With two of his cronies the man had spent the day in a room overlooking the harbour drinking hard and playing billiards Early in the afternoon a messenger had come from Ballawhaine saying Your father is ill come home immediately By and bye he had said and gone on with the game Later in the afternoon the messenger had come again saying Your father has had a stroke of paralysis and he is calling for you Let me finish the break first he had replied In the evening the messenger had come a third time saying Your father is unconscious Where s the hurry then he had answered and he sang a stave of the Miller s Daughter They married me against my will When I was daughter at the mill Finally Caesar who had been remonstrating with the Ballawhaine at the moment of his attack came to remonstrate with Ross and to pay off a score of his own as well Honour thy father and thy mother that thy days cried Caesar with uplifted arm and the high pitch of the preacher But your days will not be long anyway and if you are the death of that foolish ould man it won t be the first death you re answerable for So you believe it too said Ross cue in hand You believe your daughter is dead do you old Jephthah Jeremiah Would you be surprised to hear now the cronies giggled that she isn t dead at all Good shotr cannon off the cushion Halloa Jephthah Jeremiah has seen a ghost seemingly Saw her myself man when I was up in town a month ago Want to know where she is Shall I tell you Oh you re a beauty You re a pattern You know how to train up a child in the way Pocket off the red It s you to preach at my father isn t it She s on the streets of London ah Jeremiah s gone They married me against my will There you are then good shot love twenty five and nothing left Pete pushed through to the billiard room Fearing there might be violence hoping there would be yet thinking it scarcely proper to lend the scene of it the light of his countenance Caesar had stayed outside Halloa here s Uriah cried Ross Talk of the devil just thought as much Ever read the story of David and Uriah Should though Do you good mister David was a great man Aw with a mock imitation of Pete s Manx a ter ble wonderful shocking great man Uriah was his henchman Ter ble clavar too but that green for all the ould cow might have ate him And Uriah had a nice lil wife The nice now you wouldn t think But when Uriah was away David took her and then and then dropping the Manx it doesn t just run on Bible lines neither but David told Uriah that his wife was dead ha ha ha Who saw her diet I said the fly I saw her Stop that let go help You ll choke me help help At two strides Pete had come face to face with Ross put one of his hands at the man s throat and his leg behind him doubled him back on his knee and was holding him there in a grip like that of a vice Help help oo ugh The fellow gasped and his face grew dark You re not worth it said Pete I meant to choke the life out of your dirty body for lying about the living and blackening the dead but you re not worth hanging for You ve got the same blood in you too and I m ashamed for you There get up With a gesture of indescribable loathing Pete flung the man to the ground and he fell over his cue and broke it The people of the house came thronging into the room and met Pete going out of it His face was hard and ugly At first sight they mistook him for Ross so disfigured was he by bad passions Caesar was tramping the pavement outside Will you let me do it now he said in a hot whisper Do as you like said Pete savagely The wicked is snared in the work of his own hand Higgaion Selah said Caesar and they parted by the entrance to the Court house Pete went home muttering to himself The man was lying she s dead she s dead At the gate of Elm Cottage the dog came up to him barking with glee Then it darted back to the house door which stood open Some one has come thought Pete She s dead The man lied She s dead he muttered and he stumbled down the path VII While the Deemster was stepping up to the dais and the people in the court were rising to receive him a poor bedraggled wayfarer was toiling through the country towards the town It was a woman She must have walked far her step was so slow and so heavy From time to time she rested not sitting but standing by the gates of the fields as she came to them and holding by the topmost bar When she emerged from the dark lanes into the lamplit streets her pace quickened for a moment then it slackened and then it quickened again She walked close to the houses as if trying to escape observation Where there was a short cut through an ill lighted thoroughfare she took it Any one following her would have seen that she was familiar with every corner of the town It would be hard to imagine a woman of more miserable appearance Not that her clothes were so mean though they were poor and worn but that an air of humiliation sat upon her such as a dog has when it is lost and the children are chasing it Her dress was that of an old woman the long Manx cloak of blue homespun fastened by a great hook close under the chin and having a hood which is drawn over the head But in spite of this old fashioned garment and the uncertainty of her step she gave the impression of a young woman Where the white frill of the old countrywoman s cap should have shown itself under the flange of the hood there was a veil which seemed to be suspended from a hat The oddity and incongruity of her attire attracted attention Women came out of their houses and crossed to the doors of neighbours to look after her Even the boys playing at the corners looked up as she went by She was not greatly observed for all that An unusual interest agitated the town A wave of commotion flowed down the streets The traffic went in one direction That direction was the Court house The Court house square was thronged on three of its sides by people who were gathered both on the pavement and on the green inside the railings Its fourth side was the dark lane at the back going by the door to the prisoners yard and the Deemster s entrance The windows were lit up and partly open Some of the people had edged to the walls as if to listen and a few had clambered to the sills as if to see Around the wide doorway there was a close crowd that seemed to cling to it like a burr The woman had reached the first angle of the square when the upper half of the Court house door broke into light over the heads of the crowd A man had come out He surged through the crowd and came down to the gate with a tail of people trailing after him and asking questions Wonderful he was saying The Dempster s spaking Aw a Daniel come to judgment sir Pity for Tom though the man ll get time I m sorry for an ould friend but the Lord s will be done Let not the ties of affection be a snare to our feet it ll be five years if it s a day and D V he ll never live to see the end of it It was Caesar He crossed the street to the Mitre The woman trembled and turned towards the lane at the back She walked quicker than ever now But stumbling over the irregular cobbles of the paved way she stopped suddenly at the sound of a voice By this time she was at the door to the prisoners yard and it was standing open The door of the corridor leading by the Deemster s chamber to the Court house was also ajar as if it had been opened to relieve the heat of the crowded room within Be just and fear not said the voice Remember whatever unconscious misrepresentations have been made this day whatever deliberate false swearing and God and the consciences of the guilty ones know well there have been both truth is mighty and in the end it will prevail The poor bedraggled wayfarer stood in the darkness and trembled Her hands clutched at the breast of the cloak her head dropped into her breast and a half smothered moan escaped from her She knew the voice it had once been very sweet and dear to her she had heard it at her ear in tones of love It was the voice of the Deemster He was speaking from the judge s seat the people were hanging on his lips And he was standing in the shadow of the dark lane under the prisoners wall The woman was Kate It was true that she had been to London it was false that she had lived a life of shame there In six months she had descended to the depths of poverty and privations One day she had encountered Ross He was fresh from the Isle of Man and he told her of the child s illness The same night she turned her face towards home It was three weeks since she had returned to the island and she was then low in health in heart and in pocket The snow was falling It was a bitter night Growing dizzy with the drifting whiteness and numb with the piercing cold she had crept up to a lonely house and asked shelter until the storm should cease The house was the home of three old people two old brothers and an old sister who had always lived together In this household Kate had spent three weeks of sickness and the Manx cloak on her back was a parting gift which the old woman had hung over her thinly clad shoulders Back in the roads Kate had time to tell herself how foolish was her journey She was like a sailor who has alarming news of home in some foreign port and hears nothing afterwards until he comes to harbour A month had passed So many things might have happened The child might be better it might be dead and buried Nevertheless she pushed on When she left London she had been full of bitterness towards Philip It was his fault that she had ever been parted from her baby She would go back If she brought shame upon him let him bear it On coming near to home this feeling of vengeance died Nothing was left but a great longing to be with her little one and a sense of her own degradation Every face she recognised seemed to remind her of the change that had been wrought in herself since she had looked on it last She dare not ask she dare not speak she dare not reveal herself While she stood in the shadow of the prisoners yard listening to Philip s voice and held by it as by a spell there was a low hiss and then a sort of white silence as when a rocket breaks in the air The Deemster had finished the people in the court were breathing audibly and moving in their seats A minute later she was standing by her old home hers no longer and haunted in her mind by many bitter memories It was dark and cheerless A candle had been burning in the parlour but it was now spluttering in the fat at the socket As she looked into the room it blinked and went out During the last mile of her journey she had made up her mind what she would do She would creep up to the house and listen for the sound of a child s voice If she heard it and the voice was that of a child that was well she would be content she would go away And if she did not hear it if the child was gone if there was no longer any child there if it was in heaven she would go away just the same only God knew how God knew where The road was quiet With trembling fingers she raised the latch of the gate and stepped two paces into the garden There was no sound from within She took two steps more and listened intently Nothing was audible Her heart fell yet lower She told herself that when a child lived in a house the very air breathed of its presence and its little voice was everywhere Then she remembered that it was late that it was night that even if the child were well it would now be bathed and in bed How foolish she thought and she took a few steps more She had meant to reach the hall window and look in butt before she could do so something came scudding along the path in her direction It was the dog and he was barking furiously All at once he stopped and began to caper about her Then he broke into barking again this time with a note of recognition and delight shot into the house and came back still barking and making a circle of joyful salutation in the darkness round her Quaking with fear of instant discovery she crept under the old tree and waited Nobody came from the house There s no one at home she told herself and at that thought the certainty that the child was gone fell on her as an oppression of distress Nevertheless she stepped up to the porch and listened again There was no sound within except the ticking of the clock Making a call on her courage she pushed the door open with the tips of her fingers It made a rustle as the bottom brushed over the rushes At that she uttered a faint cry and crept back trembling But all was silence again in an instant The fire gave out a strong red glow which spread over the walls and the ceiling Her mind took in the impression that the place was almost empty but she had no time for such observations With slow and stiff motions she slid into the house Then she heard a sleepy whimper and it thrilled her In an instant she had seen the thing she looked for the cradle with its hood towards the door and its foot to the fire At the next moment she was on her knees beside it doubled over it and crying softly to the baby looking so different smelling of milk and of sleep My darling my darling That was the moment when Pete was coming up the path The dog was frisking and barking about him She s dead he was saying The man lied She s dead With that word on his lips he heaved heavily into the house As he did so he became aware that some one was there already Before his eye had carried the news to his brain his ear had told him He heard a voice which he knew well though it seemed to be a memory of no waking moment but to come out of the darkness and the hours of sleep It was a soft and mellow voice saying My beautiful darling My beautiful rosy darling I My darling My darling He saw a woman kneeling by the cradle with both arms buried in it as though they encircled the sleeping child Her hood was thrown back and her head was bare The firelight fell on her face and he knew it He passed his hand across his eyes as if trying to wipe out the apparition but it remained He tried to speak but his tongue was stiff He stood motionless and stared He could not remove his eyes Kate heard the door thrown open and she lifted her head in terror Pete was before her with a violent expression on his face The expression changed and he looked at her as if she had been a spirit Then in a voice of awe he said Who art thou Don t you know me she answered timidly It seemed as if he did not hear Then it s true he muttered to himself the man did not lie She felt her knees trembling under her I haven t come to stay she faltered They told me the child was ill and I couldn t help coming Still he did not speak to her As he looked his face grew awful The dew of fear broke out on her forehead Don t you know me Pete she said in a helpless way Still he stood looking down at her fixedly almost threateningly I am Katherine she said with a downcast look Katherine is dead he answered vacantly Oh oh She is in her grave he said again Oh that she were in her grave indeed said Kate and she covered her face with her hands She is dead and buried and gone from this house for ever said Pete He did not intend to cast her off he was only muttering vague words in the first spasm of his pain but she mistook them for commands to her to go There was a moment s silence and then she uncovered her face and said I understand yes I will go away I oughtn t to have come back at all I know that But I will go now I won t trouble you any more I will never come again She kissed the child passionately It rubbed its little face with the back of its hand but it did not awake She pulled the hood on to her head and drew the veil over her face Then she lifted herself feebly to her feet stood a moment looking about her made a faint pathetic cry and slid out at the door When she was gone Pete without uttering a word or a sound stumbled into a chair before the fire put one hand on the cradle and fell to rocking it After some time he looked over his shoulder like a man who was coming out of unconsciousness and said Eh The soul has room for only one great emotion at once and he had begun to say to himself She s alive She s here The air of the house seemed to be soft with her presence Hush He got on to his feet Kate he called softly very softly as if she were near and had only just crossed the threshold Kate he called again more loudly Then he went out at the porch and floundered along the path crying again and again in a voice of boundless emotion Kate Kate Kate But Kate did not hear him He was tugging at the gate to open it when something seemed to give way inside his head and a hoarse groan came from his throat She s better dead he thought and then reeled back to the house like a drunken man The fire looked black as if it had gone out He sat down in the darkness and put his hand into his teeth to keep himself from crying out VIII The Deemster in the half lit Court house was passing sentence Prisoner he said you have been found guilty by a jury of your countrymen of one of the cruellest of the crimes of imposture You have deceived the ignorant betrayed the unwary lied to the simple and robbed the poor You have built your life upon a lie and in your old age it brings you to confusion In ruder times than ours your offence would have worn another complexion it would have been called witchcraft not imposture and your doom would have been death The sentence of the court is that you be committed to the Castle Rushen for the term of one year Black Tom who had stood during the Deemster s sentence with his bald head bent wiping his eyes on his sleeve and leaving marks on his face recovered his self conceit as he was being hustled out of court You re right Dempster he cried Witchcraft isn t worth nothing now Religion s the only roguery that s going these days Your friend Caesar was wise sir Bes re spec s to him Dempster and may you live up to your own tex yourself too If my industry and integrity said a solemn voice at the door and what s it saying in Scripture If any provide not for his own house he is worse than an infidel But the Lord is my shield What for should I defend myself I am a worm and no man saith the Psalms The Psalms is about right then Caesar shouted Black Tom from between two constables In the commotion that followed on the prisoner s noisy removal the Clerk of the Court was heard to speak to the Deemster There was another case just come in attempted suicide woman tried to fling herself into the harbour been prevented would his Honour take it now or let it stand over for the High Bailiff s court We ll take it now said the Deemster We may dismiss her in a moment poor creature The woman was brought in She was less like a human creature than like a heap of half drenched clothes A cloak which looked black with the water that soaked it at the hood covered her body and head Her face seemed to be black also for a veil which she wore was wet and clung to her features like a glove Some of the people in court recognised her figure even in the uncertain candlelight She was the woman who had been seen to come into the town during the hour of the court s adjournment Half helped half dragged by constables she entered the prisoner s dock There she clutched the bar before her as if to keep herself from falling Her head was bent down between her shrinking shoulders as if she were going through the agony of shame and degradation The woman shouldn t have been brought here like this quick be quick said the Deemster The evidence was brief One of the constables being on duty in the market place had heard screams from the quay On reaching the place he had found the harbour master carrying a woman up the quay steps mister Quarry coming out of the harbour office had seen a woman go by like the wind A moment afterwards he had heard a cry and had run to the second steps The woman had been caught by a boathook in attempting to get into the water She was struggling to drown herself The Deemster watched the prisoner intently Is anything known about her he asked The clerk answered that she appeared to be a stranger but she would give no information Then the sergeant of police stepped up to the dock In emphatic tones the big little person asked the woman various questions What was her name No answer Where did she come from No answer What was she doing in Ramsey Still no answer Your Honour said the sergeant doubtless this is one of the human wrecks that come drifting to our shores in the summer season The poorest of them are often unable to get away when the season is over and so wander over the island a pest and a burden to every place they set foot in Then turning back to the figure crouching in the dock he said Woman are you a street walker The woman gave a piteous cry let go her hold of the bar sank back to the seat behind her brushed up the wet black veil and covered her face with her hands Sit down this instant mister Gawne said the Deemster hotly and there was a murmur of approval from behind We must not keep this woman a moment longer He rose leaned across to the rail in front clasped his hands before him looked down at the woman in the dock and said in a low tone that would have been barely loud enough to reach her ears but for the silence as of a tomb in the court My poor woman is there anybody who can answer for you The prisoner stooped her head lower and began to cry When a woman is so unhappy as to try to take her life it sometimes occurs only too sadly that another is partly to blame for the condition that tempts her to the crime The Deemster s voice was as soft as a caress If there is such a one in this case we ought to learn it He ought to stand by your side It is only right it is only just Is there anybody here who knows you The prisoner was now crying piteously Ah we mean no harm to any one It is in the nature of woman however low she may sink however deep her misfortunes to shield her dearest enemy That is the brave impulse of the weakest among women and all good men respect it But the law has its duty and in this instance it is one of mercy The woman moaned audibly Don t be afraid my poor girl Nobody shall harm you here Take courage and look around Is there anybody in court who can speak for you who can tell us how you came to the place where you are now standing The woman let fall her hands raised her head and looked up at the Deemster face to face and eye to eye Yes she said there is one The Deemster s countenance became pale his eyes glistened his look wandered his lips trembled he was biting them they were bleeding Remove her in custody he muttered let her be well cared for There was a tumult in a moment Everybody had recognised the prisoner as she was being taken out though shame and privation had so altered her Peter Quilliam s wife Caesar Cregeen s daughter where s the man himself Then it s truth they re telling it s not dead she is at all but worse Lor a massy What a trouble for the Dempster When Kate was gone the court ought to have adjourned instantly yet the Deemster remained in his seat There was a mist before his eyes which dazzled him He had a look at once wild and timid His limbs pained although they were swelling to enormous size He felt as if a heavy invisible hand had been laid on the top of his head The clerk caught his eye and then he rose with an apologetic air took hold of the rail and made an effort to cross the dais At the next moment his servant Jem y Lord had leapt up to his side but he made an impatient gesture as if declining help There are three steps going down to the floor of the court and a handrail on one side of them Coming to these steps he stumbled muttered some confused words and fell forward on to his face The people were on their feet by this time and there was a rush to the place Stand back He has only fainted cried Jem y Lord Worse than that said the sergeant Get him to bed and send for doctor Mylechreest instantly Where can we take him said somebody They keep a room for him at Elm Cottage said somebody else No not there said Jem y Lord It s nearest and there s no time to lose said the sergeant Then they lifted Philip and carried him as he lay in his wig and gown as Deemster to the house of Pete IX There is a kind of mental shock which like an earthquake under a prison bursts open every cell and lets the inmates escape 
2740-288813-0000	train-other-500	After a time Pete remembered that he was sitting in the dark and he got up to light a candle Looking for candlestick and matches he went from table to dresser from dresser to table and from table back to dresser doing the same thing over and over again
2740-288813-0001	train-other-500	and not perceiving that he was going round and round When at length the candle was lighted he took it in his hand and went into the parlour like a sleepwalker He set it on the mantelpiece and sat down on the stool
2740-288813-0002	train-other-500	In his blurred vision confused forms floated about him Ah my tools he thought and picked up the mallet and two of the chisels He was sitting with these in his hands when his eyes fell on the other candlestick the one in which the candle had gone out
none	none	 I meant to light a candle he thought and he got up and took the empty candlestick into the hall 
2740-288813-0003	train-other-500	When he came back with another lighted candle he perceived that there were two I m going stupid he thought and he blew out the first one A moment afterwards he forgot that he had done so and seeing the second still burning he blew that out also
2740-288813-0004	train-other-500	So dull were his senses that he did not realise that anything was amiss His eyes were seeing objects everywhere about they were growing to awful size and threatening him
2740-288813-0005	train-other-500	His ears were hearing noises they were making a fearful tumult inside his head The room was not entirely dark A shaft of bleared moonlight came and went at intervals
2740-288813-0006	train-other-500	The moon was scudding through an angry sky sometimes appearing sometimes disappearing Pete returned to the stool and then he was in the light but the nameless stone leaning against the wall was in the shade
2740-288813-0007	train-other-500	He took up the mallet and chisels again intending to work Hush he said as he began The clamour in his brain was so loud that he thought some one was making a noise in the house This task was sacred He always worked at it in silence
2740-288813-0008	train-other-500	Pat put pat put How long he worked he never knew There are moments which are not to be measured as time In the uncertain handling of the chisel and the irregular beat of the mallet something gave way There was a harsh sound like a groan
2740-288813-0009	train-other-500	A crack like a flash of forked lightning had shot across the face of the stone He had split it in half Its great pieces fell to the floor on either side of him Then he remembered that the stone had been useless It doesn t matter now he thought
2740-288813-0010	train-other-500	Nothing mattered With the mallet hanging from his hand he continued to sit in the drifting moonlight feeling as if everything in the world had been shivered to atoms His two idols had been scattered at one blow his wife and his friend
2740-288813-0011	train-other-500	The golden threads that had bound him to life were broken When poverty had come he had met it without repining when death had seemed to come he had borne up against it bravely But wifeless friendless deceived where he had loved
2740-288813-0012	train-other-500	betrayed where he had worshipped he was bankrupt he was broken and a boundless despair took hold of him When hope is entirely gone anguish will sometimes turn a man into a monster There was a fretful cry from the cradle
2740-288813-0013	train-other-500	and still in the stupor of his despair he went out to rock it The fire which had only slid and smouldered was now struggling into flame and the child looked up at him with Philip s eyes A knife seemed to enter his heart at that moment
2740-288813-0014	train-other-500	He was more desolate than he had thought Hush my child hush he said without thinking His child He had none That solace was gone Anger came to save his reason
2740-288813-0015	train-other-500	Not to have felt anger he must have been less than a man or more He remembered what the child had been to him He remembered what it was when it came and again when he thought its mother was dead he remembered what it was when death frowned on it
2740-288813-0016	train-other-500	and what it had been since death passed it by Flesh of his flesh blood of his blood bone of his bone heart of his heart Not his merely but himself
2740-288813-0017	train-other-500	A lie a mockery a delusion a deception She has practised it Oh she had hidden her secret She had thought it was safe But the child itself had betrayed it The secret had spoken from the child s own face
2740-288813-0018	train-other-500	Yet I ve seen her kneel by the cot and pray God bless my baby and its father and its mother Why had he not killed her A wild vision rose before him of killing Kate and then going to the Deemster and saying
2740-288813-0019	train-other-500	Take me I have murdered her because you have dishonoured her Condemn me to death yet remember God lives and He will condemn you to damnation But the pity of it the pity of it
2740-288813-0020	train-other-500	By a quick revolt of tenderness he recalled Kate as he had just seen her crouching at the back of the cradle like a hunted hare with uplifted paws uttering its last pitiful cry He remembered her altered face so pale even in the firelight
2740-288813-0021	train-other-500	so thin so worn and his anger began to smoke against Philip The flower that he would have been proud to wear on his breast Philip had buried in the dark Curse him Curse him She had given up all for that man
2740-288813-0022	train-other-500	husband child father mother her friends her good name the very light of heaven How she must have loved him Yet he had been ashamed of her had hidden her away had been in fear lest the very air should whisper of her whereabouts
2740-288813-0023	train-other-500	Curse him Curse him Curse him In the heat of his great anger Pete thought of himself also Jealousy was far beneath him
none	none	 but like all great souls this simple man had known something of the grandeur of friendship 
2740-288813-0024	train-other-500	Two streams running into them and taking heaven into their bosom But Philip had kept him apart had banked him off and yet drained him to the dregs He had uncovered his nakedness the nakedness of his soul itself
2740-288813-0025	train-other-500	Bit by bit Pete pieced together the history of the past months He remembered the night of Kate s disappearance when he had gone to Ballure and shouted up at the lighted window
none	none	 I ve sent her to England 
2740-288813-0026	train-other-500	thinking to hide her fault At that moment Philip had known all where she was for it was where he had sent her why she was gone and that she was gone for ever Curse him Curse him Pete recalled the letters
2740-288813-0027	train-other-500	the first one that he had put into Philip s hand the second that he had read to him the third that Philip had written to his dictation The little forgeries to keep her poor name sweet the little inventions to make his story plausible the little lies of love
2740-288813-0028	train-other-500	the little jests of a breaking heart And then the messages The presents to the child The reference to the Deemster himself And the Deemster had sat there and seen through it all as the sun sees through glass yet he had given no sign
2740-288813-0029	train-other-500	he had never spoken he had held a quivering naked heart in his hand while his own lay within as cold as a stone Curse him O God Curse him Pete remembered the night when Philip came to tell him that Kate was dead
2740-288813-0030	train-other-500	and how he had comforted himself with the thought that he was not altogether alone in his great trouble because his friend was with him He remembered the journey to the grave the grave itself another s grave
2740-288813-0031	train-other-500	how he knelt at the foot of it and prayed aloud in Philip s hearing Forgive me my poor girl How shall I kill him thought Pete Deemster too First Deemster now and held high in honour Worshipped for his justice
2740-288813-0032	train-other-500	Beloved for his mercy O God O God There are passions so overmastering that they stifle speech and man sinks back to the animal With an inarticulate shout Pete went to the parlour and caught up the mallet
2740-288813-0033	train-other-500	A frantic thought had flashed on him of killing Philip as he sat on the bench which he had disgraced administering the law which he had outraged The wild justice of this idea made the blood to bubble in his ears He saw himself holding the Deemster by the throat
2740-288813-0034	train-other-500	and crying aloud to the people You think this man is a just judge he is a whited sepulchre You think he is as true as the sun he is as false as the sea He has robbed me of wife and child
2740-288813-0035	train-other-500	at the very gates of heaven he has lied to me like hell The hour of justice has struck and thus I pay him and thus and thus But the power of words was lost in the drunkenness of his rage
2740-288813-0036	train-other-500	With a dismal roar he flung the mallet away and it rolled on the ground in narrowing circles My hands my hands he thought He would strangle Philip and then he would kill everybody in his way merely for the lust of killing Why not
2740-288813-0037	train-other-500	The fatal line was past Nothing sacred remained The world was a howling wilderness of boundless license With the savage growl of a caged beast this wild man flung himself on the door tore it open and bounded on to the path
2740-288813-0038	train-other-500	Then he stopped suddenly There was a thunderous noise outside such as the waves make in a cave A company of people were coming in at the gate Some were walking with the heavy step of men who carry a corpse
2740-288813-0039	train-other-500	Others were bearing lanterns and a few held high over their heads the torches which fishermen use when they are hauling the white nets at night Who s there cried Pete in a voice that was like a howl Your friend said somebody
2740-288813-0040	train-other-500	My friend I have no friend cried Pete in a broken roar Deed he s gone seemingly said a voice out of the dark Pete did not hear Seeing the crowd and the lights but only as darkness veined with fire
2740-288813-0041	train-other-500	he thought Philip was coming again as he had so often seen him come in his glory in his greatness in his triumph Where is he he roared He s here they answered And then Philip was brought up the path in the arms of four bearers his head hanging aside
2740-288813-0042	train-other-500	and shaking at every step his face white as the wig above it and his gown trailing along the earth There was a sudden calm and Pete dropped back in awe and horror A bolt out of heaven seemed to have fallen at his feet
2740-288813-0043	train-other-500	and he trembled as if lightning had blinded him Dead His anger had ebbed his fury had dashed itself against a rock His towering rage had shrunk to nothing in the face of this awful presence
2740-288813-0044	train-other-500	The Dark Spirit had gone before him and snatched his victim out of his hands He had come out to kill this man and here he met him being brought home dead Dead Then his sin was dead also God forgive him
2740-288813-0045	train-other-500	God forgive him where he was gone Presumptuous man stand back Oh mighty and merciful Death Death the liberator the deliverer the pardoner the peace maker Even the shadow of thy face can quench the fires of revenge
none	none	 even the gathering of thy wings can deaden the clamour of madness and turn hatred into love and curses into prayers X In that stripped and naked house there was one room still untouched It was the room that had been kept for the Deemster Philip lay on the bed motionless and apparently lifeless Jem y Lord stood beating his hands at the foot Pete sat on a low stool at the side with his face doubled on to his knees Nancy now back from Sulby was blowing into the bars of the grate to kindle a fire A little group of men stood huddled like sheep near the door Some one said the Deemster s heart was beating They brought from another room a little ivory hand glass and held it over the mouth When they raised it the face of the mirror was faintly blurred That little cloud on the glass seemed more bright than the shining tread of an angel on the sea Jem y Lord took a sponge and began to moisten the cold forehead One by one the people behind produced their old wife s wisdom Somebody remembered that his grandmother always put salts to the nostrils of a person seemingly dead somebody else remembered that when on the very day of old Iron Christian s death his father had been thrown by a colt and lay twelve hours unconscious the farrier had bled him and he had opened his eyes instantly The doctor had been half an hour gone to Ballaugh and a man had been put on a horse and sent after him But it was a twelve miles journey the night was dark it would be a good hour before he could be back They touched Pete on the shoulder and suggested something Eh he answered vacantly Dazed they told themselves The poor man could not give a wise like answer He had had a shock and there was worse before him They talked in low voices of Kate and of Ross Christian they were sorry for Pete they were still more sorry for the Deemster The Deemster s wig had been taken off and tossed on to the dressing table It lay mouth upwards like any old woman s night cap His hair had dragged after it on the pillow The black gown had not been removed but it was torn open at the neck so that the throat might be free One of Philip s arms had dropped over the side of the bed and the long thin hand was cold and green and ethereal as marble Pete was crouching on his low stool beside this hand He needed no softening to touch it now The chill fingers were in his palm and his hot tears were falling on them Remembering the crime that he had so nearly committed he was holding himself in horror His friend His life long friend His only friend The Deemster no longer but only the man Not the man either but the child The cruel years had rolled back with all their burden of trouble Forgotten days were come again days long buried under the debris of memory They were boys together again A little sunny fellow in velvet and a bigger lad in a stocking cap the little one talking always talking the big one listening always listening the little one proposing the big one agreeing the little one leading the big one following the little one looking up and yet a little down the big one looking down and yet a little up Oh the happy happy times before anger and jealousy and rage and the mad impulse of murder had darkened their sun shine The memories that brought the tenderest throb to Pete as he sat there fingering the lifeless hand were of the great deeds that he had done for Philip how he had fought for him and been licked for him and taken bloody noses for him and got thrashed for it by Black Tom But there were others only less tender Philip was leaving home for King William s and Pete was cudgelling his dull head what to give him for a parting gift Decision was the more difficult because he had nothing to give At length he had hit on making a whistle the only thing his clumsy fingers had ever been deft at With his clasp knife he had cut a wondrous big one from the bough of a willow he had pared it he had turned it it blew a blast like a fog horn The morning was frosty and his feet were bare but he didn t mind the cold he didn t feel it no not a ha p orth He was behind the hedge by the gate at Ballure waiting for the coach that was to take up Philip and passing the time by polishing the whistle on the leg of his shining breeches and testing its tone with just one more blow Then up came Crow and out came Philip in his new peaked cap and leggings Whoop Gee up Away Off they went without ever seeing him without once looking back and he was left in the prickly hedge with his blue feet on the frost a look of dejection about his mouth and the top of the foolish whistle peeping out of his jacket pocket The thick sob that came of these memories was interrupted by a faint sound from the bed It was a murmur of delirium as soft as the hum of bees yet Pete heard it Cover me up Pete cover me up said Philip dreaming aloud Philip was a living man Thank God Thank God A whisper goes farther than a shout The people behind whispered the news to the passage the passage to the stairs the stairs to the hall and the hall to the garden where a crowd had gathered in the darkness to look up at the house over which the angel of death was hovering In a moment the room was croaking like a frog pond Praise the Lord cried one His mercy endureth for ever cried another What s he saying said a third Rambling in his head poor thing said a fourth Pete turned them out all except Jem y Lord who was still moistening the Deemster s face and opening his hands which were now twitching and tightening Out of this Out you go cried Pete hoarsely No use taking the anger with him the man s tried they muttered and away they went Jemmy was loth to see them go He was afraid to be left alone with Pete afraid that the Deemster should be at the mercy of this wild creature with the flaming eyes And now that Philip was a living man Pete began to feel afraid of himself At sight of life in Philip s face his gnawing misery returned He thought his hatred had been overcome but he was wrestling in the throes of forgiveness again Here was the man who had robbed him of wife and child and home In another moment he might have held him in the grip of his just wrath It is an inscrutable and awful fact that just at that moment when a man s good angel has conquered but is spent his evil angel is sure to get the advantage of chance Philip s delirium set in strong and the brute beast in Pete going through its final struggle stood over the bed and watched him In his violence Philip tore at his breast and dragged something from beneath his shirt A moment later it fell from his graspless fingers to the floor It was a lock of dark hair Pete knew whose hair it was and he put his foot on it and that instant the mad impulse came again to take Philip by the throat and choke him Again and again it came He had to tread it down even amid his sobs and his tears But love cannot be killed in an instant It does not drop down dead There was a sort of tenderness in the thought that this was the man for whom Kate had given up all the world Pete began to feel gently towards Philip because Kate loved him he began to see something of Kate in Philip s face This strange softening increased as he caught the words of Philip s delirium He thought he ought to leave the room but he could not tear himself away Crouching down on the stool he clasped his hands behind his head and tightened his arms over his ears It was useless He could not help but listen Only disjointed sentences odd pages torn from the book of life some of them blurred with tears but they were like a cool hand on a fevered brow to him that heard him I was a child Philip didn t know what love was then coming home by Ramsey steamer tell the simple truth Philip say we tried to be faithful and loyal and could not because we loved each other and there was no help for tell Kirry yes Auntie I have read father s letters that picture is cracked This in the voice of one who speaks in his sleep and then in a hushed hot whisper Haven t I a right to you yes I have a right take your topcoat then the storm is coming I ll never let you go don t you remember can you ever forget my husband my husband Pete lifted his head as he listened He had been thinking that Philip had robbed him of Kate Was it he who had robbed Kate of Philip I can t live any longer in this house Philip the walls are crushing me the ceiling is falling on me the air is stifling me three o clock Pete yes three to morrow in the Council Chamber at Douglas I m not a bad woman Philip Christian there is something you have never guessed and I have never told you is it the child Kate did you say the child you are sure you are not deceiving yourself All this in a tone of deep entreaty and then with quick coming breath Jemmy get the carriage at Shimmin s and drive it yourself if there is any attempt at Ramsey to take the horse out drive to the lane between the chapel and the cottage the moment the lady joins you you are right Kate you cannot live here any longer this life of deception must end that s the churring of the night jar going up to Ballure Glen Jem y Lord who was beating out the pillow dropped it in his fumbling half over the Deemster s face and looked at Pete in terror Would this cruel delirium never break Where was the doctor Would he not come at all Pete had risen to his feet and was gazing down with a look of stupor He had been thinking that Philip had robbed him of the child Was it he who had robbed Philip Yes Pete is telling the same story He is writing letters to himself such simple things poor old Pete he means no harm he never dreams that every word is burning Jemmy leave out more brandy to night the decanter is empty Pete leaned over the pillow All at once he started back Philip s eyes were open and shining up at him It was hard to believe that Philip was not speaking to him eye to eye But there was a veil between them the veil of the hand of God I know Philip I know said the unconscious man in a quick whisper he was breathing fast and loud Tell him I m dead yes yes that s it that s it cruel no but kind Poor girl he ll say I loved her once but she s gone I ll do it I ll do it Then in tones of fear It s madness to paint faces on the darkness to hear voices in the air is madness And then solemnly with a chill thick utterance There there that one by the wall Big drops of sweat broke out on Pete s forehead Had he been thinking that Philip had tortured him It was he who had been torturing Philip The letters the messages the presents these had been the whips and scorpions in his hand Every innocent word every look every sign had been as thongs in the instrument of torture Pete began to feel a great pity for Philip He had suffered plenty thought Pete He has carried this cross about far enough Good night boatman I went too far yes I am back again thank God These words brightly cheerily hopefully then in the deepest tones Good bye Philip it s all my fault I ve broken the heart of one man and I m destroying the soul of another I m leaving this lock of hair it is all I have to leave good bye I ought to have gone long ago you will not hate me now The last words frayed off broke in the throat and stopped Then quickly with panting breath came Kate Kate Kate again and again repeated beginning in a loud beseeching cry and dying down to a long wail as if shouted over a gloomy waste wherein the voice was lost Jem y Lord had been beating round towards the door wringing his white hands like a woman and praying to God that the Deemster might never come out of his unconsciousness He has told him everything thought Jem The man will take his life I came between them thought Pete She was not for me She was not mine She was Philip s It was God s doings The bitterness of Pete s heart had passed away But I wish what s the good of wishing though God help us all he muttered in a breaking voice and then he crouched down on the stool as before and covered his face with his hands Philip had lifted his head and risen on one elbow He was looking out on the empty air with his glassy eyes as if a picture stood up before them Yes no yes don t tell me that Kate it s a mistake that s not Kate that white face those hollow eyes that miserable woman besides Kate is dead she must be dead what s to do with the lamps they are going out in the dock too and before me she there and I here she the prisoner I the judge All this with violent emotion and with one arm outstretched over Pete s crouching head If I could hear her voice though perhaps her voice now I m going to fall it s Kate it s Kate Oh oh Philip had paused for several seconds as if trying to listen and then with a loud cry of agony he had closed his eyes and rolled back on to the pillow God has meant me to hear all this thought Pete God had intended that for this the peace of his soul he should follow the phases of this drama of a naked heart He was sobbing but his sobs were like growls What s he doing now thought Jem y Lord craning his neck at the door Shall I call for somebody Pete had picked up from the floor the lock of hair that had been lying under his foot and he was putting it back into Philip s breast Nothing but me between them he thought nothing but me Sit down sir cried the unconscious man It was only the last outbreak of Philip s delirium but Pete trembled and shrank back Then Philip groaned and his blue lips quivered He opened his eyes They wandered about the room for a moment and afterwards fixed themselves on Pete in a long and haggard gaze Pete s own eyes were too full of tears to be full of sight but he could see that the change had come He panted with expectation and looked down at Philip with doglike delight There was a moment s silence and then in a voice as faint as a breath Philip murmured What s where s is it Pete At that Pete uttered a shout of joy He s himself He s himself Thank God Eh said Philip helplessly Don t you be bothering yourself now cried Pete Lie quiet boy you re in your own room and as nice as nice But said Philip will you not kindly Not another word Phil It s nothing You re all serene and about as right as ninepence Your Honour has been delirious said Jem y Lord Chut said Pete behind his hand and then with another joyful shout Is it a beefsteak you ll be having Phil or a dish of tay and a herring Philip looked perplexed But could you not help me he faltered You fainted in the Court house sir said Jem y Lord Ah It had all come back Hould your whisht you gawbie whispered Pete and he made a furtive kick at Jemmy s shins Pete was laughing and crying in one breath In the joyful reflux from evil passions the great fellow was like a boy He poked the fire into a blaze snuffed the candle with his fingers sang out My gough when he burnt them and then hopped about the floor and cut as many capers as a swallow after a shower of rain Philip looked at him and relapsed into silence It seemed as if he had been on a journey and something had happened in his absence The secret which he had struggled so long to confess had somehow been revealed Jem y Lord was beating out his pillows Does he know said Philip Yes whispered Jemmy Everything Everything You have been delirious Delirious said Philip with alarm Then he struggled to rise Help me up Let me go away Why did you bring me here I couldn t help it sir I tried to prevent I cannot face him said Philip I am afraid Help me help me You are too weak sir Lie still No one shall harm you The doctor is coming Philip sank back with a look of fear Water he cried feebly Here it is said Jem y Lord lifting from the dressing table the jug out of which he had moistened the sponge Tut cried Pete and he tipped the jug so that half the water spilled Brandy for a man when he s in bed you goosey gander Hould hard boy I ve a taste of the rael stuff in the cupboard Half a minute mate A drop will be doing no harm at all and away he went down the stairs like a flood almost sweeping over Nancy who had come creeping up in her stockings at the sound of voices The child had awakened in its cradle and with one dumpy leg over its little quilt it was holding quiet converse with its toes Hollo young cockalorum is it there you are shouted Pete At the next moment with a noggin bottle of brandy in his fist he was leaping upstairs three steps at a time Meanwhile Jem y Lord had edged up to the Deemster and whispered with looks of fear and mystery Don t take it sir What said Philip vacantly The brandy said Jem Eh It will be began Jem but Pete s step was thundering up the stairs and with a big opening of the mouth rather than an audible utterance of the tongue he added poisoned Philip could not comprehend and Pete came shouting Where s your water now ould Snuff the Wind While Pete was pouring the brandy into a glass and adding the water Jemmy caught up a scrap of newspaper that was lying about rummaged for a pencil wrote some words on the margin tore the piece off and smuggled it into the Deemster s hand Afraid of Pete thought Philip It is monstrous monstrous At that moment there was the sound of a horse s hoofs on the road The doctor cried Jem y Lord The doctor at last Wait sir wait and he ran downstairs Here you are cried Pete coming to the bedside glass in hand Drink it up boy It ll stiffen you My faith but it s a oner Aw God is good though He s all that He s good tremenjous Pete was laughing he was crying he was tasting a new sweetness the sweetness of being a good man again Philip was holding Jem y Lord s paper before his eyes and trying to read it What s this that Jemmy has given me he said Read it Pete My eyes are dazed Pete took the paper in his left hand still holding the glass in his right To get the light on to the writing he went down on his knees by the bed head and leaned over towards the fire Then like a school boy repeating his task he read in a singsong voice the words that Jem y Lord had written Don t drink the brandy Pete is trying to kill you Pete made a grating laugh That s a pretty thing now he began but he could not finish His laughter ceased his eyes opened wide his tongue seemed to hang out of his mouth and he turned his head and looked back with an agony of doubt into Philip s face Philip struggled up Give me the brandy Pete He took the glass out of Pete s hand and without a second thought with only a smile of faith and confidence he raised it to his lips and drank When the doctor entered the room a moment afterwards Pete was sobbing into the bed clothes and Philip s hand was resting on his head XI Early the next morning Pete visited Kate in prison He had something to say to her something to ask but he intended to keep back his own feelings to bear himself bravely to sustain the poor girl s courage The light was cold and ashen within the prison walls and as he followed the sergeant into the cell he could not help but think of Kate as he had first known her so bright so merry so full of life and gaiety He found her now doubled up on a settle by a newly kindled fire in the sergeant s own apartment She lifted her head with a terrified look as he entered and she saw his hollow cheeks and deep eyes and ragged beard I m not coming to trouble you he said I ve forgiven him and I m forgiving you too You are very good she answered nervously Good He gave a crack of bitter laughter I meant to kill him that s how good I am And it s the same as if all the devils out of hell had been at me the night through to do it still Maybe I hadn t much to forgive I m like a bat in the light I m not knowing where I am ezactly Daresay the people will laugh at me when they re getting to know Wouldn t trust but they ll think me a poor spirited cur anyway Let them there s never much pity for the dog that s licked His voice shook although so hard and so husky That s not what I came to say though You ll be laving this place soon and I m wanting to ask I m wanting to know She had covered her face and now she said through her hands Do as you like with me Pete You are my husband and I must obey He looked down at her for a moment But you cannot love me I have deceived you and whatever you tell me to do I will do it But you cannot love me I ll be a good wife for the future Pete I will indeed indeed I will But you cannot love me She began to cry That s enough he said I ll not force you You are very good she said again He laughed more bitterly than before Dou yo think I m wanting your body while another man has your heart That s a game I ve played about long enough I m thinking Good Not me missis His eyes which had been fixed on the fire wandered to his wife and then his lips quivered and his manner changed I m hard I ll cut it short Fact is I ve detarmined to do something but I ve a question to ask first You ve suffered since you left me Kate He has dragged you down a dale but tell me do you love him still She shuddered and crept closer to the wall Don t be freckened It s a woman s way to love the man that s done wrong by her Being good to her is nothing sarvice is nothing kindness is nothing Maybe there s some ones that cry shame on her for that but not me Giving herself body and soul and thinking nothing what she gets for it that s the glory of a woman when she cares for anybody Spake up Kate do you love him in spite of all The answer came in a whisper that was like a breath Yes That ll do said Pete He pressed his hand against the place of his old wound I might have known you could never care for me I might have known that he said with difficulty But don t think I can t stand my rackups as the saying is I know my course now I know my job She was sobbing into her hands and he was breathing fast and loud One word more only one about the child Little Katherine Have I a right to her She gasped audibly but did not answer and he tried a second time Does she belong to me Kate Her confusion increased He tried a third time speaking more gently than before If I should lave the island Kate could I must I may I take the child along with me At that her fear got the better of her shame and she cried Don t take her away Oh don t don t Ah He pressed his hand hard at his side again But maybe that s only mother s love and what mother He broke off and then began once more in a voice so low that it was scarcely to be heard Tell me when the time comes and it will come Kate have no fear about that He was breaking down he was struggling hard When the time comes for himself and you to be together will you be afraid to have the little one with you will it seem wrong Kate you two and little Katherine one household one family no n o No That s enough The words seemed to come out of the depths of his throat I ve nothing more to think about He must think of all the rest And you Pete What matter about me D ye think there s anything worse coming D ye think I m caring what I ate and what I drink and what becomes of me He was laughing again and her sobs broke out afresh God is good he said more quietly He ll take care of the likes of me His motionless eyes were on the crackling fire and he stood in the light that flashed from it with a face like stone I ve no child now he muttered as though speaking to himself She slid to her knees at his feet took the hand that hung by his side and began to cover it with kisses Forgive me she said I have been very weak and very guilty What s the use of talking like that he answered What s past is past and he drew his hand away No child now no child now he muttered again as though his dispair cried out to God He was feeling like a man wrecked in mid ocean A spar came floating towards him It was all he could lay hold of from the foundering ship in which he had sailed and sung and laughed and slept He had thought to save his life by it but another man was clinging to it and he had to drop it and go down She could not look into his face again she could not touch his hand she could not ask for his forgiveness He stood over her for a moment without speaking and then with his hollow cheeks and deep eyes and ragged heard he went away in the morning sunlight XII Phillip fell into a deep sleep When he awoke he saw as in a mirror a solution to the tumultuous drama of his life It was a glorious solution a liberating and redeeming end an end bringing freedom from the bonds which had beset him What matter if it was hard if it was difficult if it was bitter as Marah and steep as Calvary He was ready he was eager Oh blessed sleep Oh wise and soothing sleep I It had rent the dark cloud of his past and given the flash of light that illumined the path before him He opened his eyes and saw Auntie Nan seated by his side reading a volume of sermons At the change in his breathing the old dove looked round dropped the book and began to flutter about Hush dearest hush she whispered There was a heavy monotonous sound like the beating of a distant drum or the throb of an engine under the earth Auntie Yes dearest What day is it Sunday Oh you ve had a long long sleep Philip You slept all day yesterday Is that the church bell ringing Yes dear and a fine morning too so soft and springlike I ll open the window Then my hearing must be injured Ah they muffled the bell that s it The church is so near they said it might trouble him A carriage was coming down the road It rattled on the paved way then the rattling ceased and there was a dull rumble as of a cart sliding on to a wooden bridge That horse has fallen said Philip trying to rise It s only the straw on the street said Auntie Nan The people brought it from all parts We must deaden the traffic by the house they said Oh you couldn t think how good they ve been Yesterday was market day but there was no business done Couldn t have been they were coming and going the whole day long And how s the Deemster now And how s he now It was fit to make you cry I believe in my heart Philip nobody in Ramsey went to bed the first night at all Everybody waiting and waiting to see if there wasn t something to fetch and the kettle kept boiling in every kitchen round about But hush dearest hush Not so much talking all at once Hush now Where is Pete asked Philip his face to the wall Oiling the hinges of the door dearest He was laying carpets on the stairs all day yesterday But never the sound of a hammer The man s wonderful He must have hands like iron His heart s soft enough though But then everybody is so kind everybody everybody The doctor and the vicar and the newspapers oh it s beautiful It s just as Pete was saying What was Pete saying Auntie He was saying the angels must think there s somebody sick in every house in the island A sound of singing came through the open window above the whisper of young leaves and the twitter of birds It was the psalm that was being sung in church Blessed is the man that considereth the poor and needy The Lord shall deliver him in time of trouble Listen Philip That must be a special psalm I m sure they re singing it for you How sweet of them But we are talking too much dear The doctor will scold I must leave you now Philip Only for a little though while I go back to Bal lure and I ll send up Cottier Yes send up Cottier said Philip My darling said the old soul looking down as she tied her bonnet strings You ll lie quiet now You re sure you ll lie quiet Well good bye good bye As Philip lay alone the soar and swell of the psalm filled the room Oh the irony of it all The frantic hideous awful irony He was lying there he the guilty one with the whole island watching at his bedside pitying him sorrowing for him holding its breath until he should breathe and she his partner his victim his innocent victim was in jail in disgrace in a degradation more deep than death Still the psalm soared and swelled He tried to bury his head in the pillows that he might not hear Jem y Lord came in hurriedly and Philip beckoned him close Where is she he whispered They removed her to Castle Rushen late last night your Honour said Jemmy softly Write immediately to the Clerk of the Bolls said Philip Say she must be lodged on the debtors side and have patients diet and every comfort My Kate my Kate he kept saying it shall not be for long not for long my love not for long The convalescence was slow and Philip was impatient I feel better to day doctor he would say don t you think I may get out of bed Traa dy liooar time enough Deemster the doctor would answer Let us see what a few more days will do I have a great task before me doctor he would say again I must begin immediately You have a life s work before you Deemster and you must begin soon but not just yet I have something particular to do doctor he said at last I must lose no time You must lose no time indeed that s why you must stay where you are a little longer One morning his impatience overcame him and he got out of bed But being on his feet his head reeled his limbs trembled he clutched at the bed post and had to clamber back Oh God bear me witness this delay is not my fault he murmured Throughout the day he longed for the night that he might close his eyes in the darkness and think of Kate He tried to think of her as she used to be bright happy winsome full of joy of love of passion dangling her feet from the apple tree or tripping along the tree trunk in the glen teasing him tempting him It was impossible He could only think of her in the gloom of the prison That filled his mind with terrors Sometimes in the dark hours his enfeebled body beset his brain with fantastic hallucinations Calling for paper and pens he would make show of writing a letter producing no words or intelligible signs but only a mass of scrawls and blotches This he would fold and refold with great elaboration and give to Jem y Lord with an air of gravity and mystery saying in a whisper For her Thus night brought no solace and the dawn found him waiting for the day that he might open his eyes in the sunlight and think She is better where she is God will comfort her A fortnight went by and he saw nothing of Pete At length he made a call on his courage and said Auntie why does Pete never come He does dearest Only when you re asleep though He stands there in the doorway in his stockings I nod to him and he comes in and looks down at you Then he goes away without a word What is he doing now Going to Douglas a good deal seemingly Indeed they re saying but then people are so fond of talking What are people saying Auntie It s about a divorce dearest Philip groaned and turned away his face He opened his eyes one day from a doze and saw the plain face of Nancy Joe framed in a red print handkerchief The simple creature was talking with Auntie Nan holding council and making common cause with the dainty old lady as unmarried women and old maids both of them Why don t you keep your word true says I Wasn t you saying you d take her back says I whatever she d done and whatever she was so help you God says I Isn t she shamed enough already poor thing without you going shaming her more Have you no bowels at all Are you only another of the gutted herrings on a stick says I Why don t you keep your word true Because says he I want to be even with the other one says he and then away he went wandering down by the tide It s unchristian Nancy said Auntie Nan but it s human for although he forgives the woman he can hardly be expected to forgive the man and he can t punish one without punishing both Much good it ll do to punish either say I What for should he put up his fins now the hook s in his gizzard But that s the way with the men still Talking and talking of love and love but when trouble is coming no better than a churn of sour cream on a thundery day We re best off that never had no truck with them I don t know what you think Miss Christian ma am They may talk about having no chances I don t mind if they do do you I had chance enough once though I don t know what you ve had ma am I had one sweetheart anyway a sort of a sweetheart as you might say but he was sweeter on the money than on me Always asking how much I had got saved in the stocking And when he heard I had three new dresses done Nancy says he we had better be putting a sight up on the parzon now before they re all wore out at you The Governor who was still in London wrote a letter full of tender solicitude and graceful compliment The Clerk of the Rolls had arranged from the first that two telegrams should be sent to him daily giving accounts of Philip s condition At last the Clerk came in person and threw Auntie Nan into tremors of nervousness by his noise and robustious ness He roared as he came along the path roared himself through the hall up the stairs and into the bedroom roared again as he set eyes on Philip protesting that the sick man was worth five hundred dead men yet and vowing with an oath and a tear trickling down his nose that he would like to give time to the fools who frightened good people with bad reports Then he cleared the room for a private consultation Out you go Cottier Look slippy man Auntie Nan fled in terror When she had summoned resolution to invade afresh the place of the bear that had possession of her lamb the Clerk of the Rolls was rising from the foot of the bed and saying We ll leave it at that then Christian These d things will happen but don t you bother your head about it I ll make it all serene Besides it s nothing nothing in a lifetime I ll have to send you the summons though You needn t trouble about that just toss it into the fire Philip s head was down his eyes were on the counterpane and a faint tinge of colour overspread his wasted face Ah you re back Miss Christian I must be going though Good bye old fellow Take care of yourself good men are scarce Good bye Miss Christian Good bye all Good bye Phil God bless you With that he went roaring down the stairs but came thunging up again in a moment put his head round the doorpost and said Lord bless my soul if I wasn t forgetting an important bit of news very important news too It hasn t got into the papers yet but I ve had the official wrinkle What d ye think the Governor has resigned True as gospel Sent in his resignation to the Home Office the night before last I saw it coming He hasn t been at home since Tynwald Look sharp and get better now Good bye Philip got up for the first time the day following The weather was soft and full of whispers of spring the window was open and Philip sat with his face in the direction of the sea Auntie Nan was knitting by his side and running on with homely gossip The familiar and genial talk was floating over the surface of his mind as a sea bird floats over the surface of the sea sometimes reflected in it sometimes skimming it sometimes dipping into it and being lost Poor Pete The good woman here thinks he s hard Perhaps he is but I m sure he is much to be pitied Ross has behaved badly and deserves all that can come to him He s the same to me as you are dear in blood I mean but somehow I can t be sorry Ah you re too tender hearted Philip indeed you are You d find excuses for anybody The doctor says overwork dearest but I say the shock of seeing that poor creature in that awful position And what a shock you gave me too To tell you the truth Philip I thought it was a fate Never heard of it No Never heard that grandfather fainted on the bench He did though and he didn t recover either How well I remember it Word broke over the town like a clap of thunder The Deemster has fallen in the Court house Father heard it up at Ballure and ran down bareheaded Grandfather s carriage was at the Courthouse door and they brought him up to Ballawhaine I remember I was coming downstairs when I saw the carriage draw up at the gate The next minute your father with his wild eyes and his bare head was lifting something out of the inside Poor Tom He had never set foot in the house since grandfather had driven him out of it And little did grandfather think in whose arms he was to travel the last stage of his life s journey Philip had fallen asleep Jem y Lord entered with a letter It was in a large envelope and had come by the insular post Shall I open it thought Auntie Nan She had been opening and replying to Philip s letters during the time of his illness but this one bore an official seal and so she hesitated Shall I she thought with the knitting needle to her lip I will I may save him some worry She fixed her glasses and drew out the letter It was a summons from the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice a petition for divorce The petitioner s name was Peter Quilliam the respondent the company respondent As Philip awoke from his doze with the salt breath of the sea in his nostrils and the songs of spring in his ears Auntie Nan was fumbling with the paper to get it back into the envelope Her hands trembled and when she spoke her voice quivered Philip saw in a moment what had happened She had stumbled into the pit where the secret of his life lay buried The doctor came in at that instant He looked attentively at Auntie Nan and said significantly You have been nursing too long Miss Christian you must go home for a while I will go home at once she faltered in a feeble inward voice Philip s head was on his breast Such was the first step on the Calvary he intended to ascend O God help him God support him God bear up his sinking feet that he might not fall from weakness or fear or shame XIII Caesar visited Kate at Castle Rushen He found her lodged in a large and light apartment once the dining room of the Lords of Man indulged with every comfort and short of nothing but her liberty As the turnkey pulled the door behind him Caesar lifted both hands and cried The Lord is my refuge and my strength a very present help in trouble Then he inquired if Pete had been there before him and being answered No he said The children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light After that he fell to the praise of the Deemster who had not only given Kate these mercies comfortable to her carnal body if dangerous to her soul but had striven to lighten the burden of her people at the time when he had circulated the report of her death knowing she was dead indeed dead in trespasses and sins and choosing rather that they should mourn her as one who was already dead in fact than feel shame for her as one that was yet alive in iniquity Finally he dropped his handkerchief on to the slate floor went down on one knee by the side of his tall hat and called on her in prayer to cast in her lot afresh with the people of God May her lightness be rebuked O Lord he cried Give her to know that until she repents she hath no place among Thy children And Lord succour Thy servant in his hour of tribulation Let him be well girt up with Christian armour Help him to cry aloud amid his tears and his lamentations Though my heart and hers should break Thy name shall not be dishonoured my Lord and my God Rising from his knee and dusting it Caesar took up his tall hat and left Kate as he had found her crouching by the fire inside the wide ingle of the old hall covering her face and saying nothing He was in this mood of spiritual exaltation as he descended the steps into the Keep and came upon a man in the dress of a prisoner sweeping with a besom It was Black Tom Caesar stopped in front of him moved his lips lifted his face to the sky shut both eyes then opened them again and said in a voice of deep sorrow Aw Thomas Thomas Quilliam I m taking grief to see thee man An ould friend whose hand has rested in my hand and swilling the floor of a prison Well I warned thee often But thou wast ever stony ground Thomas And now thou must see for thyself whether was I right that honesty is the better policy Look at thee and look at me The Lord has delivered me and prospered me even in temporal things I have lands and I have houses And what hast thou thyself Nothing but thy conscience and thy disgrace Even thy very clothes they have taken away from thee and they would take thy hair itself if thou had any Black Tom stood with feet flatly planted apart rested himself on the shank of his besom and said Don t be playing cammag shindy with me mister Holy Ghoster It isn t honesty that s making the diff rance between us at all it s luck You ve won and I ve lost you ve succeeded and I ve failed you re wearing your chapel hat and I m in this bit of a saucepan lid but you re only a reg lar ould Pharisee anyway Caesar waved his hand I can t take the anger with thee Thomas he said backing himself out I thought the devil had been chained since our last camp meeting but I was wrong seemingly He goeth about still like a raging lion seeking whom he may devour Don t be trying to knock me down with your tex es said Thomas shouldering his besom Any cock can crow on his own midden You can t help it Thomas said Caesar edging away It isn t my ould friend that s blaspheming at all It s the devil that has entered into his heart and is rending him But cast the devil out man or hell will be thy portion I was there last night in my dreams Caesar said Black Tom following him up Oh Lord Devil let me in says I Where d ye come from says he The Isle of Man says I I m not taking any more from there till my Bishop comes says he Who s that says I Bishop Caesar the publican who else says he I marvel at thee Thomas said Caesar half through the small door of the portcullis but the sons of Belial have to fight hard for his throne I ll pray for thee though that it be not remembered against thee when D V there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth That night Caesar visited the Deemster at Elm Cottage His eyes glittered and there was a look of frenzy in his face He was still in his mood of spiritual pride and when he spoke it was always with the thees and the thous and in the high pitch of the preacher The Ballawhaine is dead your Honour he cried They wouldn t have me tell thee before because of thy body s weakness but now they suffer it Groanings and moanings and stericks of torment Ter ble sir ter ble Took a notion he would have water poured out for him at the last It couldn t wash him clane though And shouting with his dying voice I ve sinned O God I ve sinned Oh I delivered my soul sir he can clear me of that anyway Lay hould of a free salvation says I I ve not lived a right life says he Truth enough says I you ve lived a life of carnal freedom but now is the appointed time Say Lord I belaive help thou my unbelaife Too late mister Cregeen too late says he and the word was scarce out of his mouth when he was key cold in a minute and gone into the night of all flesh that s lost Well it was his own son that killed him sir robbed him of every silver sixpence and ruined him The last mortgage he raised was to keep the young man out of prison for forgery Bad sir bad To indulge a child to its own damnation is bad A human infirmity though and I m feeling for the poor sinner myself being tempted that is to say inclining but thank the Lord for his strengthening arm Is he buried asked Philip Buried enough and a poor funeral too sir said Caesar walking the room with a proud step the legs straightened the toes conspicuously turned out Driving rain and sleet sir the wind in the trees the grass wet to your calf and the parson in his white smock under the umbrella Nobody there to spake of neither only myself and the tenants mostly Where was Ross Gone sir without waiting to see his foolish ould father pushed under the sod Well there was not much to wait for neither The young man has been a besom of fire and burnt up everything Not so much left as would buy a rope to hang him And Ballawhaine is mine sir mine in a way of spak ing my son in law s anyway and he has given me the right to have and to hould it Aw a Sabbath time sir a Sabbath time I made up my mind to have it the night the man struck me in my own house in Sulby He betrayed my daughter at last sir and took her from her home and then her husband lent six thousand pounds on mortgage Do what you like with it said he and I said to myself The man shall starve he shall be a beggar he shall have neither bread to eat nor water to drink nor a roof to cover him And the moment the breath was out of the ould man s body I foreclosed Philip was trembling from head to foot Do you mean he faltered that that was your reason It is the Lord s hand on a rascal said Caesar and proud am I to be the instrument of his vengeance God moves in a mysterious way sir Oh the Lord is opening His word more and more And I have more to tell thee too Balla whaine would belong to thyself sir if every one had his rights It was thy grandfather s inheritance and it should have been thy father s and it ought to be thine Take it sir take it on thy own terms it is worth a matter of twelve thousand but thou shalt have it for nine and pay for it when the Lord gives thee substance Thou hast been good to me and to mine and especially to the poor lost lamb who lies in the Castle to night in her shame and disgrace Little did I think I should ever repay thee though But it is the Lord s doings It is marvellous in our eyes Deep in unfathomable mines Caesar was pacing the room and speaking in tones of rapture Philip who was sitting at the table rose from it with a look of fear Frightful frightful he muttered A mistake a mistake The Lord God makes no mistakes sir cried Caesar But what if it was not Ross began Philip Caesar paid no heed What if it was not Ross Caesar glanced over his shoulder What if it was some one else said Philip Caesar stopped in front of him Some one you have never thought of some one you have respected and even held in honour Who then said Caesar huskily mister Cregeen said Philip it is hard for me to speak I had not intended to speak yet but I should hold myself in horror if I were silent now You have been living in awful error Whatever the cost whatever the consequences you must not remain in that error a moment longer It was not Ross who took away your daughter Who was it cried Caesar His voice had the sound of a cracked bell Philip struggled hard He tried to confess His eyes wandered about the walls As you have cherished a mistaken resentment he faltered so you have nourished a mistaken gratitude Who who cried Caesar looking fixedly into Philip s face Philip s rigid fingers were crawling over the papers on the table like the claws of crabs They touched the summons from the Chancery Court and he picked it up Read this he said and held it out to Caesar Caesar took it but continued to look at Philip with eyes that were threatening in their wildness Philip felt that in a moment their positions had been changed He was the judge no longer but only a criminal at the bar of this old man this grim fanatic half mad already with religious mania The Lord of Hosts is mighty muttered Caesar and then Philip heard the paper crinkle in his hand Caesar was feeling for his spectacles When he had liberated them from the sheath he put them on the bridge of his nose upside down With the two glasses against the wrinkles of his forehead and his eyes still uncovered he held the paper at arm s length and tried to read it Then he took out his red print handkerchief to dust the spectacles Fumbling spectacles and sheath and handkerchief and paper in his trembling hands together he muttered again in a quavering voice as if to fortify himself against what he was to see The Lord of Hosts is mighty He read the paper at length and there was no mistaking it Quilliam v Quilliam and Christian Philip He laid the summons on the table and returned his spectacles to their sheath His breathing made noises in his nostrils Ugh cha nee woe is me he muttered Ugh cha nee Ugh cha nee Then he looked helplessly around and said Depart from me for I am a sinful man O Lord The vengeance that he had built up day by day had fallen in a moment into ruins His hypocrisy was stripped naked I see how it is he said in a hoarse voice The Lord has de ceaved me to punish me It is the public house Ye cannot serve God and mammon What s gained on the devil s back is lost under his belly I thought I was a child of God but the deceitfulness of riches has choked the word Ugh cha nee Ugh cha nee My prosperity has been like the quails only given with the intent of choking me Ugh cha nee His spiritual pride was broken down The Almighty had refused to be made a tool of He took up his hat and rolled his arm over it the wrong way of the nap Half way to the door he paused Well I ll be laving you good day sir he said nodding his head slowly The Lord s been knowing what you were all the time seemingly But what s the use of His knowing He never tells on nobody And I ve been calling on sinners to flee from the wrath and He s been letting the devils make a mock at myself Ugh cha nee Ugh cha nee Philip had slipped back in his chair and his head had fallen forward on the table He heard the old man go out he heard his heavy step drop slowly down the stairs he heard his foot dragging on the path outside Ugh cha nee Ugh cha nee The word rang in his heart like a knell Jem y Lord who had been out in the town came back in great excitement Such news your Honour Such splendid news What is it said Philip without lifting his head They re signing petitions all over the island asking the Queen to make you Governor God in heaven said Philip that would be frightful XIV When Philip was fit to go out they brought up a carriage and drove him round the bay The town had awakened from its winter sleep and the harbour was a busy and cheerful scene More than a hundred men had come from their crofts in the country and were making their boats ready for the mackerel fishing at Kinsale There was a forest of masts where the flat hulls had been the taffrails and companions were touched up with paint and the newly barked nets were being hauled over the quay Good morning Dempster cried the men They all saluted him and some of them after their Manx fashion drew up at the carriage door lifted their caps with their tarry hands and said Taking joy to see you out again Dempster When a man s getting over an attack like that it s middling clear the Lord s got work for him Philip answered with smiles and bows and cheerful words but the kindness oppressed him He was thinking of Kate She was the victim of his success For all that he received she had paid the penalty He thought of her dreams her golden dreams her dreams of going up side by side and hand in hand with the man she loved Oh my love my love he murmured Only a little longer The doctor was waiting for him when he reached home I have something to say to you Deemster he said with averted face It s about your aunt Is she ill said Philip Very ill But I ve inquired daily By her express desire the truth has been kept back from you The carriage is still at the door began Philip I ve never seen any one sink so rapidly She s all nerve No doubt the nursing exhausted her It s not that I ll go up immediately She was to expect you at five I cannot wait said Philip and in a moment he was on the road O God he thought how steep is the path I have to tread On getting to Ballure he pushed through the hall and stepped upstairs At the door of Auntie Nan s bedroom he was met by Martha the housemaid now the nurse She looked surprised and made some nervous show of shutting him out Before she could dc so he was already in the room The air was heavy with the smell of medicines and vinegar and the odours of sick life Hush said Martha with a movement of lips and eyebrows Auntie Nan was asleep in a half sitting position on the bed It was a shock to see the change in her The beautiful old face was white and drawn with pain the chin was hanging heavily the eyes were half open there was no cap on her head her hair was straggling loosely and was dull as tow She must be very ill said Philip under his breath Very said Martha She wasn t expecting you until five sir Has the doctor told her Does she know Yes sir but she doesn t mind that She knows she s dying and is quite resigned quite and quite cheerful but she fears if you knew hush There was a movement on the bed She ll be shocked if she and she s not ready to receive in here sir whispered Martha and she motioned to the back of a screen that stood between the door and the bed There was a deep sigh a sound as of the moistening of dry lips and then the voice of Auntie Nan not her own familiar voice but a sort of vanishing echo of it What is the time Martha Twenty minutes wanting five ma am So late It wasn t nice of you to let me sleep so long Martha I m expecting the Governor at five What a mercy he hasn t come earlier It wouldn t be right to keep him waiting and then bring me the sponge girl Moisten it first Now the towel The comb next That s better How lifeless my hair is though Oil you say I wonder I ve never used it in my life but at a time like this well just a little then there that will do Bring me a cap the one with the pink bow in it My face is so pale it will give me a little colour That will do You couldn t tell I had been ill could you Not very ill anyway Now side everything away The medicines too put them in the cupboard So many bottles How ill she must have been he would say And now open the drawer on the left Martha the one with the key in it and bring me the paper on the top Yes the white paper The folded one with the endorsement Endorsement means writing on the back Martha Ah I ve lived all my life among lawyers Lay it on the counterpane The keys Lay them beside it No put them behind my pillow just at my back Yes there lower though deeper still that s right Now set a chair so that he can sit beside me This side of the bed no this side Then the light will be on him and I will be able to see his face my eyes are not so good as they were you know A little farther back not quite so much neither that will do Ah There was a long breath of satisfaction and then Auntie Nan said I suppose it s what time is it now Martha Ten minutes wanting five ma am Did you tell Jane about the cutlets He likes them with bread crumbs you know I hope she won t forget to say Your Excellency I shall hear his voice the moment he comes into the hall My ears are no worse if my eyes are Perhaps he won t speak though She s been so ill he ll think Martha I think you had better open the door Jane is so forgetful She might say things too If he asks How is she to day Martha you must answer quite brightly Better to day your Excellency There was an exclamation of pain Oh Ugh Oo Oh blessed Lord Jesus Are you sure you are well enough ma am Hadn t I better tell him No I ll be worse to morrow and the next day worse still Give me a dose of medicine Martha the morning medicine the one that makes me cheerful Thank you Martha If I feel the pain when he is here I ll bear it as long as I can and then I ll say I m finding myself drowsy Philip you had better go and lie down Will you understand that Martha Yes ma am said Martha I m afraid we must be a little deceitful Martha But we can t help that can we You see he has to be installed yet and that is always a great excitement If he thought I was very ill now very very ill you know yes I really think he would wish to postpone it and I wouldn t have that for worlds and worlds He has always been so fond of his old auntie Well it s the way with these boys I daresay people wonder why he has never married being so great and so prosperous That was for my sake He knew I should Philip was breathing heavily Auntie Nan listened I m sure there s somebody in the hall Martha Is it Yes it s Go down to him quick Yes ma am said Martha making a noise with the screen to cover Philip s escape on tiptoe Then she came to him on the landing wiping her eyes with her apron and pretended to lead Philip back to the room My boy my boy cried Auntie Nan and she folded him in her arms The transformation was wonderful She had a look of youth now almost a look of gaiety I ve heard the great great news she whispered taking his hand That s only a rumour Auntie said Philip Are you better Oh but it will come true Yes yes I m better I m sure it will come true And dear heart what a triumph I dreamt it all the night before I heard of it You were on the top of the Tynwald and there was a great crowd But come and sit down and tell me everything So you are better yourself Quite strong again dear Oh yes any where Philip sit anywhere Here this chair will do this one by my side Ah How well you look She was carried away by her own gaiety Leaning back on the pillow but still keeping his hand in hers she said Do you know Philip Christian who is the happiest person in the world I m sure you don t for all you re so clever So I ll tell you Perhaps you think it s a beautiful young wife just married to a husband who worships her Well you re quite quite wrong sir It s an old old lady very very old and very feeble just tottering on and not expecting to live a great while longer but with her sons about her grown up and big and strong and having all the world before them That s the happiest person on earth And I m the next thing to it for my boy my own boy s boy She broke off and then with a far off look she said I wonder will he think I ve done my duty Who asked Philip Your father she answered Then she turned to the maid and said quite gaily You needn t wait Martha His Excellency will call you when I want my medicine Won t you your Excellency Philip could not find it in his heart to correct her again The girl left the room Auntie Nan glanced at the closing door then reached over to Philip with an air of great mystery and whispered You mustn t be shocked Philip or surprised or fancy I m very ill or that I m going to die but what do you think I ve done Nay what I ve made my will Is that very terrible You ve done right Auntie said Philip Yes the High Bailiff has been up and everything is in order every little thing See and she lifted the paper that the maid had laid on the counterpane Let me tell you She nodded her head as she ran over the items Some little legacies first you know There s Martha such a good girl I ve left her my silk dresses Then old Mary the housemaid at Ballawhaine Poor old thing she s been down with rheumatism three years and flock beds get so lumpy I ve left her my feather one I thought at first I should like you to have my little income Do you know your old auntie is quite an old miser I ve grown so fond of my little money And it seemed so sweet to think but then you don t want it now Philip It would be nothing to you would it I ve been thinking though now what do you think I ve been thinking of doing with my little fortune Philip stroked the wrinkled fingers with his other hand What s right I m sure Auntie What is it You would never guess No I ve been thinking with sudden gravity Philip there s nobody in the world so unhappy as a poor gentlewoman who has slipped and fallen Then this one s father he has turned his back on her they re telling me and of course she can t expect anything from her husband I ve been thinking now Yes said Philip with his eyes down To tell you the truth I ve been thinking it would be so nice And then nervously faltering in a quavering voice with many excuses out came the great secret the mighty strategy Auntie Nan had willed her fortune to Kate You re an angel Auntie said Philip in a thick voice But he saw through her artifice She was talking of Kate but she was thinking of himself She was trying to relieve him of an embarrassment to remove an impediment that lay in his path to liberate his conscience to cover up his fault to conceal everything And then this house dear said Auntie Nan It s yours but you ll never want it It s been a dear little harbour of refuge but the storm is over now Would you do you see any objection perhaps you might could you not let the poor soul come and live here with her little one after I when all is over I mean and she is eh Philip could not speak He took the wrinkled hand and drew it up to his lips The old soul was beside herself with joy Then you re sure I ve done right Quite sure Lock it up in the drawer again dearest The top one on the left Oh the keys Dear me yes where are the keys How tiresome I remember now They re at the back of my pillow Will you call Martha Or perhaps you would yourself will you very artfully you don t mind then Yes that s it more this way though a little more ah My boy my boy The old dove s second strategy had succeeded also In fumbling behind her pillow for the keys Philip had to put his arms about her again and she was kissing him on the forehead and on the cheeks Then came a spasm of pain It dragged at her features but her smile struggled through it She fetched a difficult breath and said And now dear I m finding myself a little drowsy how selfish of me your cutlets browned nicely browned breadcrumbs you know Philip fled from the room and summoned Martha He wandered aimlessly about the house for hours that night At one moment he found himself in the blue room Auntie Nan s workroom so full of her familiar things the spinning wheel the frame of the sampler the old fashioned piano the scent of lavender all the little evidences of her presence so dainty so orderly so sweet A lamp was burning for the convenience of the doctor but there was no fire The doctor came again towards ten o clock There was nothing to be done nothing to be hoped still she might live until morning if At midnight Philip crept noiselessly to the bedroom The condition was unaltered He was going to lie down but wished to be awakened if there was any change It was long before he dropped off and he seemed to have slept only a moment when there was a knocking at his door He heard it while he was still sleeping The dawn had broken the streamers of the sun were rising out of the sea A sparrow in the garden was hacking the air with its monotonous chirp Auntie Nan was far spent yet the dragging expression of pain was gone and a serenity almost angelic overspread her face When she recognised Philip she felt for his hand guided it to her heart and kept it there Only a few words did she speak for her breath was short She commended her soul to God Then with a look of pallid sunshine she beckoned to Philip He stooped his ear to her lips and she whispered Hush dearest Never tell any one for nobody ever knew ever dreamt but I loved your father and God gave him to me in you The dear old dove had delivered herself of her last great secret Philip put his lips to her cheek iced already over the damps and chills of death Then the eyes closed the sweet old head slid back the lips changed their colour but still lay open as with a smile Thus died Auntie Nan peacefully hopefully trustfully almost joyfully in the fulness of her love and of her pride O God thought Philip let me go on with my task Give me strength to withstand the temptation of love like this Her love had tempted him all his life His father had been twenty years dead but she had kept his spirit alive his aims his ambitions his fears and the lessons of his life There lay the beginnings of his ruin his degradation and the first cause of his deep duplicity He had recovered everything that had been lost he had gained all that his little world could give and what was the worth of it What was the price he had paid for it What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul Philip put his lips to the cold forehead Sweet soul forgive me God strengthen me Let me not fail at this last moment XV Philip did not go back to Elm Cottage He buried Auntie Nan at the foot of his father s grave There was no room at either side his mother s sunken grave being on the left and the railed tomb of his grandfather on the right They had to remove a willow two feet nearer to the path When all was over he returned home alone and spent the afternoon in gathering up Auntie Nan s personal belongings labelling some of them and locking them up in the blue room The weather had been troubled for some days Spots had been seen on the sun There were magnetic disturbances and on the night before the aurora had pulsed in the northern sky When the sun was near to sinking there was a brilliant lower sky to the west with a bank of rolling cloud above it like a thick thatch roof and a shaft of golden light dipping down into the sea as if an angel had opened a door in heaven After the sun had gone a fiery red bar stretched across the sky and there were low rumblings of thunder Pausing in his work to look out on the beach Philip saw a man riding hard on horseback It was a messenger from Government Offices He drew up at the gate A moment later the messenger was in Philip s room handing him a letter If anybody had seen the Deemster as he took that letter he must have thought it his death warrant A deadly pallor came to his face when he broke the seal of the envelope and drew out the contents It was a commission from the Home Office Philip was appointed Governor of the Isle of Man My punishment my punishment he thought The higher he rose the lower he had to fall It was a cruel kindness a painful distinction an awful penalty Truly the steps of this Calvary were steep Would he ever ascend it The messenger was bowing and smirking before him Thousand congratulations your Excellency Thank you my lad Go downstairs They ll give you something to eat A moment later Jem y Lord came into the room on some pretence and hopped about like a bird Yes your Excellency No your Excellency Quite so your Excellency Martha came next and met Philip on the landing with a courageous smile and a courtesy And the whole house lately so dark and sad seemed to lighten and to laugh as when after a sleepless night you look and lo the daylight is on the blind you listen and the birds are twittering in their cages below the stairs She will hear it too thought Philip He wrote her two lines of a letter the first that he had penned since his illness Keep up heart dear I will be with you soon This without signature or superscription he put into an envelope and addressed Then he went out and posted it himself There was lightning as he returned He felt as if he would like to wander away in it down to Port Mooar and round by the caves and under the cliffs where the sea birds scream XVI The night had fallen and he was sitting in his room when there was a clamour of loud voices in the hall Some one was calling for the Deemster It was Nancy Joe She was newly returned from Sulby Something had happened to Caesar and nobody could control him Go to him your Honour she cried from the doorway It s only yourself that has power with him and we don t know in the world what s doing on the man He s got a ram s horn at him and is going blowing round the house like the mischief calling on the Lord to bring it down and saying it s the walls of Jericho Philip sent for a carriage and set off for Sulby immediately The storm had increased by this time Loud peals of thunder echoed in the hills Forks of lightning licked the trunks of the trees and ran like serpents along the branches As they were going by the church at Lezayre the coachman reached over from the box and said There s something going doing over yonder sir See A bright gleam lit up the dark sky in the direction they were taking At the turn of the road by the Ginger somebody passed them running What s yonder called the coachman And a voice out of the darkness answered him The Fairy is struck by lightning and Caesar s gone mad It was the fact While Caesar in his mania had been blowing his ram s horn around his public house under the delusion that it was Jericho the lightning had struck it The fire was past all hope of subduing A great hole had been burnt into the roof and the flames were leaping through it as through a funnel All Sulby seemed to be on the spot Some were dragging furniture out of the burning house others were running with buckets to the river and throwing water on the blazing thatch But encircling everything was the figure of a man going round and round with great plunging strides over the road across the river and through the mill pond behind blowing a horn in fierce unearthly blasts and crying in a voice of triumph and mockery first to this worker and then to that No use I tell thee Thou can never put it out It s fire from heaven Didn t I say I d bring it down It was Caesar His eyes glittered his mouth worked convulsively and his cheeks were as black with the flying soot as the colley of the pot When he saw Philip he came up to him with a terrible smile on his fierce black face and pointing to the house he cried above the babel of voices the roar of the thunder and crackle of the fire An unclean spirit lived in it sir It has been tormenting me these ten years He seemed to listen and to hear something That s it roaring he cried and then he laughed with wild delight Compose yourself mister Cregeen said Philip and he tried to take him by the arm But Caesar broke away blew a terrific blast on his ram s horn and went striding round the house again When he came back the next time there was a deep roll of thunder in the air and he said It s the Ballawhaine He had the stone five years and he used to groan so Again Philip entreated him to compose himself It was useless Round and round the burning house he went blowing his horn and calling on the workers to stop their ungodly labour for the Lord had told him to blow down the walls of Jericho and he had burnt them down instead The people began to be afraid of his frenzy They ll have to put the man in the Castle said one Or have him chained up in an outhouse said another They kept the Kirk Maug hold lunatic fifteen years on the straw in the gable loft and his children in the house grew up to be men and women It s the girl that s doing on Caesar Shame on the daughters that bring ruin to their old fathers Still Caesar went careering round the fire blowing his ram s horn and crying No use It s the Lord God The more the fire blazed the more it resisted the efforts of the people to subdue it the more fierce and unearthly were Caesar s blasts and the more triumphant his cries At last Grannie stepped out and stopped him Come home father she whimpered He looked at her with bewildered eyes then he looked at the burning house and he seemed to recover himself in a moment Come home bogh said Grannie tenderly I ve got no home said Caesar in a helpless way And I ve got no money The fire has taken all No matter father said Grannie We had nothing when we began we ll begin again Then Caesar fell to mumbling texts of Scripture and Grannie to soothing him after her simple fashion My soul is passing through deep waters I am feeble and sore broken Save me O God for the waters are come in unto my soul I sink in deep mire where there is no standing Aw no Caesar we re on the road now It s dry enough here anyway Many bulls have compassed me great bulls of Bashan have beset me round Save me from the lion s mouth for Thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorn Never mind the lion and the unicorn father but come and we ll change thy wet trousers Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow Aw yes we ll wash thee enough when we get to Ramsey Come then bogh He had dropped his ram s horn somewhere and she took him by the hand Then he suffered himself to be led away and the two old children went off into the darkness XVII There was a letter waiting for Philip at home It was from the Clerk of the Rolls Only a few lines scribbled on the back of a draft deposition telling him the petition for divorce had been heard that day within closed doors The application had been granted and all was settled and comfortable I don t want to hurt your already much wounded feelings Christian wrote the Clerk of the Rolls or to add anything to your responsibility when you come to make provision for the woman but I must say she has given up for your sake a deuced good honest fellow I know it said Philip aloud When I told him that all was over and that his erring wife would trouble him no more I thought he was going to burst out crying But Philip had no time yet to think of Pete All his heart was with Kate She would receive the official intimation of the divorce and it would fall on her in her prison like a blow She would think of herself with all the world against her and of him with all the world at his feet He wanted to run to her to pluck her up in his arms to kiss her on the lips and say Mine mine at last His wife her husband all forgiven all forgotten Philip spent the rest of the night in writing a letter to Kate He told her he could not live without her that now for the first time she was his and he was hers and they were one that their love was re born and that he would spend the future in atoning for the wrongs he had inflicted upon her in the past Then he dropped to the sheer babble of affection and poured out his heart to her all the babydom of love the foolish prattle the tender nonsense What matter that he was Governor now and the first man in the island He forgot all about it What matter that he was writing to a fallen woman in prison He only remembered it to forget himself the more Just a little longer my love just a little longer I am coming to you I am coming Older perhaps perhaps sadder and a boy no more but hopeful still and ready to face whatever fate befall with her I love beside me Next day Jem y Lord took this letter to Castle Rushen and brought back an answer It was one line only My darling At last At last Oh Philip Philip But what about our child XVIII The proclamation of Philip s appointment as Governor of the Isle of Man had been read in the churches and nailed up on the doors of the Court houses and the Clerk of the Rolls was pushing on the arrangements for the installation Let it be on the Tuesday of Easter week he wrote and of course at Castle Rushen The retiring Governor is ready to return for that day to deliver up his seals of office and to receive your commission P S Private And if you think that soft voiced girl has been long enough At Her Majesty s pleasure I will release her Not that she is taking any harm at all but we had better get these little accounts squared off before your great day comes Meantime you may wish to provide for her future Be liberal Christian you can afford to treat her liberally But what am I saying Don t I know that you will be ridiculously over generous Philip answered this letter promptly The Tuesday of Easter week will do as well as any other day As to the lady let her stay where she is until the morning of the ceremony when I will myself settle everything Philip s correspondence was now plentiful and he had enough work to cope with it The four towns of the island vied with each other in efforts to show him honour Douglas as the scene of his career wished to entertain him at a banquet Ramsey as his birthplace wanted to follow him in procession He declined all invitations I am in mourning he wrote And besides I am not well Ah no he thought nobody shall reproach me when the times comes There was no pause no pity no relenting rest in the world s kindness It began to take shapes of almost fiendish cruelty in his mind as if the devil s own laughter was behind it He inquired about Pete Hardly anybody knew anything hardly anybody cared The spendthrift had come down to his last shilling and sold up the remainder of his furniture The broker was to empty the house on Easter Tuesday That was all Not a word about the divorce The poor neglected victim forgotten in the turmoil of his wrongdoer s glory had that last strength of a strong man the strength to be silent and to forgive Philip asked about the child She was still at Elm Cottage in the care of the woman with the upturned nose and the shrill voice Every night he devised plans for getting possession of Kate s little one and every morning he abandoned them as difficult or cruel or likely to be spurned On Easter Monday he was busy in his room at Ballure with a mounted messenger riding constantly between his gate and Government offices He had spent the morning on two important letters Both were to the Home Secretary One was sealed with his seal as Deemster the other was written on the official paper of Government House He was instructing the messenger to register these letters when through the open door he heard a formidable voice in the hall It was Pete s voice A moment afterwards Jem y Lord came up with a startled face He s here himself your Excellency Whatever am I to do with him Bring him up said Philip Jem began to stammer But but and then the Bishop may be here any minute Ask the Bishop to wait in the room below Pete was heard coming upstairs Aisy all aisy Stoop your lil head bogh That s the ticket Philip had not spoken to Pete since the night of the drinking of the brandy and water in the bedroom He could not help it his hand shook There would be a painful scene Stoop again darling There you are And then Pete was in the room He was carrying the child on one shoulder they were both in their best clothes Pete looked older and somewhat thinner the tan of his cheeks was fretted out in pale patches under the eyes which were nevertheless bright He had the face of a man who had fought a brave fight with life and been beaten yet bore the world no grudge Jem y Lord and the messenger were gone from the room in a moment and the door was closed What d ye think of that Phil Isn t she a lil beauty Pete was dancing the child on his knee and looking sideways down at it with eyes of rapture She s as sweet as an angel said Philip in a low tone Isn t she now said Pete and then he rattled on as if he were the happiest man alive You ve been wanting something like this yourself this long time Phil Deed you have

and hearing her breathing and slipping in to look and everything quiet and the red fire on her lil face and Grod bless her the darling says you and then back to your desk content Aw you ll have to be having a lil one of your own one of these days Phil He has come to say something thought Philip The child wriggled off Pete s knee and began to creep about the floor Philip tried to command himself and to talk easily And how have you been yourself Pete he asked Well said Pete meddling with his hair only middling somehow He looked down at the carpet and faltered You ll be wondering at me Phil but you see he hesitated not to tell you a word of a lie then with a rush I m going foreign again that s the fact Again Well I am said Pete looking ashamed Yes truth enough that s what I m thinking of doing You see with a persuasive air when a man s bitten by travel it s like the hydrophobia ezactly he can t rest no time in one bed at all Must be running here and running there and running reg lar It s the way with me anyway Used to think the ould island would be big enough for the rest of my days But no I m longing shocking for the mines again and the compound and the niggers and the wild life out yonder The sea s calling me you know And then he laughed Philip understood him Pete meant to take himself out of the way Shall you stay long he faltered Well yes I was thinking so said Pete You see the stuff isn t panning out now same as it used to and fortunes aren t made as fast as they were in my time Not that I m wanting a fortune neither is it likely now But still and for all well I ll be away a good spell anyway Philip tried to ask if he intended to go soon To morrow sir by the packet to Liverpool for the sailing on Wednesday I ve been going the rounds saying goodbye to the ould chums Jonaique and John the Widow and Niplightly and Kelly the postman Not much heart at some of them just a bit of a something stowed away in their giblets but it isn t right to be expecting too much at all This is the only one that doesn t seem willing to part with me Pete s dog had followed him into the room and was sitting soberly by the side of his chair There s no shaking him off poor ould chap The dog got up and wagged his stump Well we ve tramped the world together haven t we Dempster He doesn t seem tired of me yet neither Pete s face lengthened But there s Grannie now The ould angel is going about like a bit of a thunder cloud and doesn t know in the world whether to burst on me or not Thinks I ve been cruel seemingly I can t be explaining to her neither Maybe you ll set it right for me when I m gone sir It s you for a job like that you know Don t want her to be thinking hard of me poor ould thing Pete whistled at the child and halloed to it and then in a lower tone he continued Not been to Castletown sir Got as far as Ballasalla and saw the castle tower Then my heart was losing me and I turned back You ll say good bye for me Phil Tell her I forgave no not that though Say I left her my love that won t do neither You ll know best what to say when the time comes Phil so I lave it with you Maybe you ll tell her I went away cheerful and content and well happy why not No harm in saying that at all Not breaking my heart anyway for when a man s a man H m clearing his throat I m bad dreadful these days wanting a smook in the mornings May I smook here I may You re good too He cut his tobacco with his discoloured knife rolled it charged his pipe and lit it Sorry to be going away just before your own great day Phil I ll get the skipper to fire a round as we re steaming by Castletown and if there s a band aboord I ll tip them a trifle to play Myle Charaine That ll spake to you like the blackbird s whistle as the saying is Looks like deserting you though But chut it would be no surprise to me at all I ve seen it coming these years and years You ll be the first Manxman living says I the day I sailed before You ve not deceaved me neither D ye remember the morning on the quay and the oath between the pair of us Me swearing you same as a high bailiff nothing and nobody to come between us d ye mind it Phil And nothing has and nothing shall He puffed at his pipe and said significantly You ll be getting married soon Aw you will I know you will I m sarten sure you will Philip could not look into his face He felt little and mean You re a wise man sir and a great man but if a plain common chap may give you a bit of advice aw but you ll be losing no time though I ll not be here myself to see it I ll be on the water maybe with the waves washing agen the gun ale and the wind rattling in the rigging and the ship burrowing into the darkness of the sea But I ll be knowing it s morning at home and the sun shining and a sort of a warm quietness everywhere and you and her at the ould church together The pipe was puffing audibly Tell her I lave her my blessing Tell her but the way I m smooking it s shocking Your curtains will be smelling thick twist for a century Philip s moist eyes were following the child along the floor What about the little one he asked with difficulty Ah I tell you the truth Phil that s the for I came Well mostly anyway You see a child isn t fit for a compound ezactly Not but they re thinking diamonds of a lil thing out there specially if it s a girl But still and for all with niggers about and chaps as rough as a thornbush and no manners to spake of Philip interrupted eagerly Will you leave her with Grannie Well no that wasn t what I was thinking Grannie s a bit ould getting and she s had her whack Wanting aisement in her ould days anyway Then she ll be knocking under before the lil one s up that s only to be expected No I was thinking what d ye think I was thinking now What said Philip with quick coming breath He did not raise his head I was thinking well yes I was then it s a fact though I was thinking maybe yourself now Pete Philip had started up and grasped Pete by the hand but he could say no more he felt crushed by Pete s magnanimity And Pete went on as if he were asking a great favour She s been your heart s blood to you Pete thinks I to my self and there isn t nobody but himself you could trust her with nobody else you would give her up to He ll love her thinks I he ll cherish her he ll rear her as if she was his own he ll be same thing as a father itself to her Philip was struggling to keep up I ve been laving something for her too said Pete No no Yes though one of the first Manx estates going Caesar had the deeds but I ve been taking them to the High Bailiff and doing everything regular When I m gone sir Philip tried to protest Aw but a man can lave what he likes to his own sir can t he Philip was silent He could say nothing The make believe was to be kept up to the last tragic moment And out yonder lying on my hunk in the sheds good mattresses and thick blankets Phil nothing to complain of at all I ll be watching her growing up year by year same as if she was under my eye constant She s in pinafores now thinks I Now she s in long frocks and is doing up her hair She s as straight as an osier now and red as a rose and the best looking girl in the island and the spitting picture of what her mother used to be Aw I ll be seeing her in my mind s eye sir plainer nor any potegraph Pete puffed furiously at his pipe And the mother I ll be seeing herself too A woman every inch of her God bless her Wherever there s a poor girl lying in her shame she ll be there I ll go bail on that And yourself I ll be seeing yourself sir whiter maybe and the sun going down on you but strong for all And when any poor fellow has had a knock down blow and the world is darkening round him he ll be coming to you for light and for strength and you ll be houlding out the right hand to him because you re knowing yourself what it is to fall and get up again and because you re a man and Grod has made friends with you Pete rammed his thumb into his pipe and stuffed it still smoking into his waistcoat pocket Chut he said huskily The talk a man ll be putting out when he s going away foreign All for poethry then or something of that spacious H m h m clearing his throat must be giving up the pipe though Not much worth for the voice at all Philip could not speak The strength and grandeur of the man overwhelmed him It cut him to the heart that Pete could never see could never hear how he would wash away his shame The child had crawled across the room to an open cabinet that stood in one corner and there possessed herself of a shell which she was making show of holding to her ear Well did you ever cried Pete Look at that child now She s knowing it s a shell Deed she is though Aw crawling reg lar sir morning to night Would you like to see the prettiest sight in the world Phil He went down on his knees and held out his arms Come here you lil sandpiper Fix that chair a piece nearer sir that s the ticket Good thing Nancy isn t here She d be on to us like the mischief Wonderful handy with babies though and if anybody was wanting a nurse now a stepmother s breath is cold but Nancy My gough you daren t look over the hedge at her lammie but she s shouting fit for an earth wake Stand nice now Kitty stand nice bogh The woman s about right too the lil one s legs are like bits of qualebone Come now bogh come Pete put the child to stand with its back to the chair and then leaned towards it with his arms outspread The child staggered a step in the sea of one yard s space that lay between looked back at the irrecoverable chair looked down on the distant ground and then plunged forward with a nervous laugh and fell into Pete s arms Bravo Wasn t that nice Phil Ever see anything prettier than a child s first step Again Kitty bogh But go to your new father this time Aisy now aisy in a thick voice Grive me a kiss first with a choking gurgle One more darling with a broken laugh Now face the other way One two are you ready Phil Phil held out his long white trembling hands Yes with a smothered sob Three four and away The child s fingers slipped into Philip s palm there was another halt another plunge another nervous laugh and then the child was in Philip s arms his head was over it and he was clasping it to his heart After a moment Philip without raising his eyes said Pete But Pete had stolen softly from the room Pete where are you Where was he He was on the road outside crying like a boy no like a man at thought of the happiness he had left upstairs XIX The town of Peel was in a great commotion that night It was the night of saint Patrick s Day and the mackerel fleet were leaving for Kinsale A hundred and fifty boats lay in the harbour each with a light in its binnacle a fire in its cabin smoke coming from its stove pipe and its sails half set The sea was fresh there was a smart breeze from the northwest and the air was full of the brine At the turn of the tide the boats began to drop down the harbour Then there was a rush of women and children and old men to the end of the pier Mothers were seeing their sons off women their husbands children their fathers girls their boys all full of fun and laughter and joyful cries One of the girls remembered that the men were leaving the island before the installation of the new Governor Straightway they started a game of make believe the make believe of electing the Governor for themselves Who are you voting for mister Quayle Aw Dempster Christian of coorse Throw us your rope then and we ll give you a pull Heave oh girls And the rope would be whipped round a mooring post on the quay twenty girls would seize it and the boat would go slipping past the pier round the castle rocks and then away before the north wester like a gull Good luck Harry Whips of money coming home Jem Write us a letter mind you write now I Goodnight father No crying yet no sign of tears nothing but fresh young faces bright eyes and peals of laughter as one by one the boats slid out into the fresh green water of the bay and the wind took them and they shot into the night Even the dogs on the quay frisked about and barked as if they were going crazy with delight In the midst of this happy scene a man wearing a monkey jacket and a wide brimmed soft hat came up to the harbour with a little misshapen dog at his heels He stood for a moment as if bewildered by the strange midnight spectacle before him Then he walked through the throng of young people and listened awhile to their talk and laughter No one spoke to him and he spoke to no one His dog followed with its nose at his ankles If some other dog in youthful frolic frisked and barked about it it snarled and snapped and then croodled down at his master s feet and looked ashamed Dempster Dempster getting a bit ould eh said the man After a little while he went quietly away Nobody missed him nobody had observed him He had gone back to the town At a baker s shop which was still open for the convenience of the departing fleet he bought a seaman s biscuit With this he returned to the harbour by way of the shore At the slip by the Rocket House he went down to the beach and searched among the shingle until he found a stone like a dumb bell large at the ends and narrow in the middle Then he went back to the quay The dog followed him and watched him The last of the boats was out in the bay by this time She could be seen quite plainly in the moonlight with the green blade of a wave breaking on her quarter Somebody was carrying a light on her deck and the giant shadow of a man s figure was cast up on the new lugsail There were shouts and answers across the splashing water Then a fresh young voice on the boat began to sing Lovely Mona fare thee well The women took it up and the two companies sang it in turns verse by verse the women on the quay and the men on the boat with the sea growing wider between them An old fisherman on the skirts of the crowd had a little girl on his shoulder You ll not be going to Kinsale this time mate said a voice behind him Aw no sir I ve seen the day though Thirty years I was going and better But I m done now Well that s the way you see It s the turn of the young ones now Let them sing God bless them We re not going to fret though are we There s one thing we can always do we can always remember and that s some constilation isn t it I m doing it reg lar said the old fisherman After all it s been a good thing to live and when a man s time comes it ll not be such a darned bad thing to die neither Don t you hould with me there mate I do sir I do The last boat had rounded the castle rock and its topsail had diminished and disappeared On the quay the song had ended and the women and children were turning their faces with a shade of sadness towards the town Well with a deep universal inspiration wasn t it beautiful Wasn t it Then what are you crying about The girls laughed at each other with wet eyes and went off with springless steps The mothers picked up their children and carried them home whimpering and the old men went a way with drooping heads and shambling feet When all was gone and the harbour master had taken his last look round the man with the dog went to the end of the empty quay and sat on the mooring post that had served for the running of the ropes All was quiet enough now The voices the singing the laughter were lost There was no sound but the gurgle of the ebbing tide which was racing out with the river s flow between the pier and the castle rock The man looked at his dog stooped to it gave it the biscuit and petted it and stroked it while it munched its supper Dempster bogh Dempster Getting ould eh Travelled far together haven t we Tired a bit aren t you Couldn t go through another rough journey anyway Hard to part though Machree Machree He took the stone out of his pocket tied it to one end of the string made a noose on the ether end slipped it about the dog s neck and without warning picked up the dog and stone at once and dropped them over the pier The old creature gave a piteous cry as it descended there was a splash and then the racing of the water past the pier The man had turned away quickly and was going heavily along the quay XX It had been a night of pain to Philip All the world seemed to be conspiring to hold him back from what he had to do Thou shalt not was the legend that appeared to be written everywhere Four persons had learnt his secret and all four seemed to call upon him to hide it First the Clerk of the Rolls who had heard the divorce proceedings within closed doors next Pete who might have clamoured the scandal on all hands and plucked him down from his place but had chosen to be silent and to slip away unseen then Caesar whose awful self deception was an assurance of his secrecy and finally Auntie Nan whose provision for Kate s material welfare had been intended to prevent the necessity for revelation All these had seemed to say to him whether from affection or from fear Hold your peace Say nothing The past is the past it is dead it does not exist Go on with your career It is only beginning What right have you to break it up The island looks to you waits for you Step forward and be strong Thank God it was too late to be moved by that temptation Too late to be bought by that bribe Already he had taken the irrevocable course he had made the irrevocable step He could not now go back But the awful penalty of the island s undeceiving The pain of that moment when everybody would learn that he had deceived the whole world He was a sham a whited sepulchre Every step he had gone up in his quick ascent had been over the body of some one who had loved him too well First Kate who had been the victim of the Deemstership and now Pete who was paying the price that made him Governor He could see the darkened looks of the proud he could hear the execration of the disappointed he could feel the tears of the true hearted at the downfall of a life that had looked so fair In the frenzy of that last hour of trial it seemed as if he was contending not with man and the world but with the devil who was using both to make this bitter irony of his position who was bribing him with worldly glory that he might damn his soul forever And therein lay a temptation that sat closer at his side the temptation to turn his face and fly away It was midnight The moon was shining on the boundless plain of the sea He was in the slack water of the soul when the ebb is spent before the tide has begun to flow Oh to leave everything behind the shame and the glory together It was the moment when the girls on Peel Quay were pulling the rope for the men on the boats who were ready to vote for Christian The pains of sleep were yet greater He thought he was in Castletown skulking under the walls of the castle With a look up towards Parliament House and down to the harbour he fumbled his private key into the lock of the side entrance to the council chamber The old caretaker heard him creep down the long corridor and she came clattering out with a candle shaded behind her hand Something I ve forgotten he said Pardon your Honour and then a deep courtesy He opened noiselessly the little door leading from the council chamber to the keep but in the dark shadow of the steps the turnkey challenged him Who s there Stop Hush The Deemster Beg your Honour s pardon Show me the female wards This way your Honour Her cell Here your Honour The key your lantern Now go back to the guard room He was with Kate My love my love My darling Come let us fly away from the island I cannot face it I thought I could but I cannot I ve got the child too Come And then Kate I would go anywhere with you Philip anywhere anywhere I only want your love But is this worthy of a man like you Leave me We have fallen too low to drop into a pit like that Away with you Go And he slunk out of the cell before the wrathful love that would save him from himself He the Deemster the Governor had slunk out like a dog It was only a dream When he awoke the birds were singing and the day was blue over the sea The temptation was past it was under his feet He could hesitate no longer his cup was brimming over he would drink it to the dregs Jem y Lord came with his mouth full of news The town was decorated with bunting There was to be a general holiday A grand stand had been erected on the green in front of the Court house The people were not going to be deterred by the Deemster s refusals He who shrank from honours was the more worthy of being honoured They intended to present their new Governor with an address Let them let them said Philip Jem looked up inquiringly His master s face had a strange expression Shall I drive you to day your Excellency Yes my lad It may be for the last time Jemmy What was amiss with the Governor Had the excitement proved too much for him XXI It was a perfect morning soft and fresh and sweet with the odours and the colours of spring New gorse flashed from the hedges the violets peeped from the banks over the freshening green of the fields the young lambs sported and the lark sang in the thin blue air The town as they dipped into it was full of life At the turn of the Court house the crowd was densest A policeman raised his hand in front of the horses and Jem y Lord drew up Then the High Bailiff stepped to the gate and read an address It mentioned Iron Christian calling him The Great Deemster the town took pride to itself that the first Manx Governor of Man was born in Ramsey Philip answered briefly confining himself to an expression of thanks there was great cheering and then the carriage moved on The journey thereafter was one long triumphal passage At Sulby Street and at Ballaugh Street there were flags and throngs of people From time to time other carriages joined them falling into line behind The Bishop was waiting at Bishop s Court and place was made for his carriage immediately after the carriage of the Governor At Tynwald there was a sweet and beautiful spectacle The children of saint John s were seated on the four rounds of the mount boys and girls in alternate rows and from that spot sacred to the memory of their forefathers for a thousand years they sang the National Anthem as Philip passed on the road The unhappy man lay back in his seat His eyes filled his throat rose Oh for what might have been Under Harry Delany s tree a company of fishermen were waiting with a letter It was from their mates at Kinsale They could not be at home that day but their hearts were there Every boat would fly her flag at the masthead and at twelve o clock noon every Manx fisherman on Irish waters would raise a cheer If the Irishmen asked them what they meant by that they would answer and say It s for the fisherman s friend Governor Philip Christian The unhappy man was no longer in pain His agony was beyond that A sort of divine madness had taken possession of him He was putting the world and the prince of the world behind his back All this worldly glory and human gratitude was but the temptation of Satan With God s help he would not succumb He would resist He would triumph over everything Jem y Lord twisted on the box seat See your Excellency Listen The flags of Castletown were visible on the Eagle Tower of the castle Then there was a multitudinous murmur Finally a great shout Now boys Three times three Hip hip hurrah At the entrance to the town an evergreen arch had been erected It bore an inscription in Manx Dooiney Vannin lhiat myr hoilloo Man of Man success as thou deservest The carriage had slacked down to a walk Drive quicker cried Philip The streets are crowded your Excellency said Jem y Lord Flags were flying from every window from every roof from every lamp post The people ran by the carriage cheering Their shout was a deafening uproar Philip could not respond She will hear it he thought His head dropped He was picturing Kate in her cell with the clamour of his welcome coming muffled through the walls They took the road by the harbour Suddenly the carriage stopped The men were taking the horses out of the shafts No no cried Philip He had an impulse to alight but the carriage was moving again in a moment It is the last of my punishment he thought and again fell back Then the shouting and the laughter ran along the quay with the crackle and roar of a fire A regiment of soldiers lined the way from the drawbridge to the porlcullis As the carriage drew up they presented arms in royal salute At the same moment the band of the regiment inside the Keep played God save the Queen The High Bailiff of the town opened the carriage door and presented an address It welcomed the new Governor to the ancient castle wherein his predecessors had been installed and took fresh assurance of devotion to the Crown from the circumstance that one of their own countrymen had been thought worthy to represent it No Manxman had ever been so honoured in that island before since the days of the new Governor s own great kinsman familiarly and affectionately known to all Manxmen through two centuries as Illiam Dhone Brown William Philip replied in few words the cheering broke out afresh the band played again and they entered the castle by the long corridor that led to the council chamber In an anteroom the officials were waiting They were all elderly men and old men who had seen long and honourable service but they showed no jealousy The Clerk of the Rolls received bis former pupil with a shout wherein personal pride struggled with respect and affection with humility Then the Attorney General welcomed him in the name of the Bar as head of the Judicature as well as head of the Legislature taking joy in the fact that one of their own profession had been elevated to the highest office in the Isle of Man glancing at his descent from an historic Manx line at his brief but distinguished career as judge which had revived the best traditions of judicial wisdom and eloquence and finally wishing him long life and strength for the fulfilment of the noble promise of his young and spotless manhood mister Attorney General said Philip I will not accept your congratulations much as it would rejoice my heart to do so It would only be another grief to me if you were to repent as too soon you may the generous warmth of your reception There were puzzled looks but the sage counsellors could not receive the right impression they could only understand the reply in the sense that agreed with their present feelings It is beautiful they whispered when a young man of real gifts is genuinely modest Excuse me gentlemen said Philip I must go into my room The Clerk of the Rolls followed him saying Ah poor Tom Christian would have been a proud man this day prouder than if the honour had been his own ten thousand thousand times Have mercy have mercy and leave me alone said Philip I didn t mean to offend you Christian said the Clerk Philip put one hand affectionately on his shoulder The eyes of the robustious fellow began to blink and he returned to his colleagues There was a confused murmur beyond the farther wall of the room It was the room kept for the Deemster when he held court in the council chamber One of its two doors communicated with the bench As usual a constable kept this door The man loosened his chain and removed his helmet His head was grey Is the Court house full asked Philip The constable put his eye to the eye hole Crowded your Excellency Keep the passages clear Yes your Excellency Is the Clerk of the Court present He is your Excellency And the jailor Downstairs your Excellency Tell both they will be wanted The constable turned the key of the door and left the room Jem y Lord came puffing and perspiring The ex Governor is coming over by the green sir He ll be here in a moment My wig and gown Jemmy said Philip Deemster s wig your Excellency Yes Last time you ll wear it sir The last indeed my lad There was a clash of steel outside followed by the beat of drum He s here said Jem y Lord Philip listened The rattling noise came to him through opening doors and reverberating corridors like the trampling of a wave to a man imprisoned in a cave She ll hear it too That thought was with him constantly In his mind s eye he was seeing Kate crouching in the fire seat of the palace room that was now her prison and covering her ears to deaden the joyous sounds that broke the usual silence of the gloomy walls Jem y Lord was at the eye hole of the door He s coming on to the bench sir The gentlemen of the council are following him and the Court house is full of ladies Philip was pacing to and fro like a man in violent agitation At the other side of the wall the confused murmur had risen to a sharp crackle of many voices The constable came back with the Clerk of the Court and the jailor Everything ready your Excellency said the Clerk of the Court The constable turned the key of the door and laid his hand on the knob One moment give me a moment said Philip He was going through the last throes of his temptation Something was asking him as if in tones of indignation what right he had to bring people there to make fools of them And something was laughing as if in mockery at the theatrical device he had chosen for gathering together the people of rank and station and then dismissing them like naughty school children This idea clamoured loud in wild derision telling him that he was posing that he was making a market of his misfortune that he was an actor and that whatever the effect of the scene he was about to perform it was unnecessary and must be contemptible You talk of your shame and humiliation no atonement can wipe it out You came here prating to yourself of blotting out the past no act of man can do so Vain vain and idle as well as vain Mere mummery and display and a blow to the dignity of justice Under the weight of such torment the thought came to him that he should go through the ceremony after all that he should do as the people expected that he should accept the Governorship and then defy the social ostracism of the island by making Kate his wife It s not yet too late said the tempter Philip stopped in his walk and remembered the two letters of yesterday Thank God it is too late he said He had spoken the words aloud and the officers in attendance glanced up at him Jem y Lord was behind trembling and biting his lip It was indeed too late for that temptation And then the vanity of it the cruelty and insufficiency of it He had been a servant of the world long enough From this day forth he meant to be its master No matter if all the devils of hell should laugh at him He was going through with his purpose There was only one condition on which he could live in the world that he should renounce it There was only one way of renouncing the world to return its wages and strip off its livery His sin was not only against Kate against Pete it was against the island and the island must set him free Philip approached the door slackened his pace with an air of uncertainty at one step from the constable he stopped He was breathing noisily If the officers had observed him at that moment they must have thought he looked like a man going to execution But the constable gazed before him with a sombre expression held his helmet in one hand and the knob of the door in the other Now said Philip with a long inspiration There was a flash of faces a waft of perfume a flutter of pocket handkerchiefs and a deafening reverberation Philip was in the Court house XXII It was remarked that his face was fearfully worn and that it looked the whiter for the white wig above it and the black gown beneath His large eyes flamed as with fire The sword too keen for the scabbard whispered somebody There is a kind of aloofness in strong men at great moments Nobody approaches them They move onward of themselves and stand or fall alone Everybody in court rose as Philip entered but no one offered his hand Even the ex Governor only bowed from the Governor s seat under the canopy Philip took his customary place as Deemster He was then at the right of the Governor the Bishop being on the left Behind the bishop sat the Attorney General and behind Philip the Clerk of the Rolls The cheers that had greeted Philip on his entrance ended with the clapping of hands and died off like a wave falling back from the shingle Then he rose and turned to the Governor I do not know if you are aware your Excellency that this is Deemster s Court day The Governor smiled and a titter went round the court We will dispense with that he said We have better business this morning thirty four Excuse me your Excellency said Philip I am still Deemster With your leave we will do everything according to rule There was a slight pause a questioning look then a cold answer Of course if you wish it but your sense of duty The ladies in the galleries bad ceased to flutter their fans and the members of the House of Keys were shifting in their seats in the well below The Clerk of the Deemster s Court pushed through to the space beneath the bench There is only one case your Honour he whispered up Speak out sir said Philip What case is it The Clerk gave an informal answer It was the case of the young woman who had attempted her life at Ramsey and had been kept at Her Majesty s pleasure How long has she been in prison Seven weeks your Honour Give me the book and I will sign the order for her release The book was handed to the bench Philip signed it handed it back to the Clerk and said with his face to the jailor But keep her until somebody comes to fetch her There had been a cold silence during these proceedings When they were over the ladies breathed freely You remember the case left her husband and little child divorced since I m told a worthless person Ah yes wasn t she first tried the day the Deemster fell ill in court Men are too tender with such creatures Philip had risen again Your Excellency I have done the last of my duties as Deemster His voice had hoarsened He was a worn and stricken figure The ex Governor s warmth had been somewhat cooled by the unexpected interruption Nevertheless the pock marks smoothed out of his forehead and he rose with a smile At the same moment the Clerk of the Rolls stepped up and laid two books on the desk before him a New Testament in a tattered leather binding and the Liber Juramentorum the Book of Oaths The regret I feel said the ex Governor and feel increasingly day by day at the severance of the ties which have bound me to this beautiful island is tempered by the satisfaction I experience that the choice of my successor has fallen upon one whom I know to be a gentleman of powerful intellect and stainless honour He will preserve that autonomous independence which has come down to you from a remote antiquity at the same time that he will uphold the fidelity of a people who have always been loyal to the Crown I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may attend his administration and that if the time ever comes when he too shall stand in the position I occupy to day he may have recollections as lively of the support and kindness he has met with and regrets as deep at his separation from the little Manx nation which he leaves behind Then the Governor took the staff of office and gave the signal for rising Everybody rose And now sir he said turning to Philip with a smile to do everything as you say according to rule let us first take Her Majesty s commission of your appointment There was a moment s pause and then Philip said in a cold clear voice Your Excellency I have no commission The commission which I received I have returned I have therefore no right to be installed as Governor Also I have resigned my office as Deemster and though my resignation has not yet been accepted I am in reality no longer in the service of the State The people looked at the speaker with eyes that were full of the stupefaction of surprise Somebody bad risen at the back of the bench It was the Clerk of the Rolls He stretched out his hand as if to touch Philip on the shoulder Then he hesitated and sat down again Gentlemen of the Council and of the Keys continued Philip you will think you have assembled to see a man take a leap into an abyss more dark than death That is as it may be You have a right to an explanation and I am here to make it What I have done has been at the compulsion of conscience I am not worthy of the office I hold still less of the office that is offered me There was a half articulate interruption from behind Philip s chair Ah do not think old friend that I am dealing in vague self depreciation I should have preferred not to speak more exactly but what must be must be Your Excellency has spoken of my honour as spotless Would to God it were so but it is deeply stained with sin He stopped made an effort to begin afresh and stopped again Then in a low tone with measured utterance amid breathless silence he said I have lived a double life Beneath the life that you have seen there has been another God only knows how full of wrongdoing and disgrace and shame It is no part of my duty to involve others in this confession Let it be enough that my career has been built on falsehood and robbery that I have deceived the woman who loved me with her heart of hearts and robbed the man who would have trusted me with his soul The people began to breathe audibly There was the scraping of a chair behind the speaker The Clerk of the Rolls had risen His florid face was violently agitated May it please your Excellency he began faltering and stammering in a husky voice it will be within your Excellency s knowledge and the knowledge of every one on the island that his Honour has only just risen from a long and serious illness brought on by overwork by too zealous attention to his duties and that in fact that well not to blink the plain truth that A sigh of immense relief had passed over the court and the Governor grown very pale was nodding in assent But Philip only smiled sadly and shook his head I have been ill indeed he said but not from the cause you speak of The just judgment of God has overtaken me The Clerk of the Rolls sank back into his seat The moment came when I had to sit in judgment on my own sin the moment when she who had lost her honour in trusting to mine stood in the dock before me I who had been the first cause of her misfortunes sat on the bench as her judge She is now in prison and I am here The same law which has punished her failing with infamy has advanced me to power There was an icy quiet in the court such as comes with the first gleam of the dawn By that quick instinct which takes possession of a crowd at great moments the people understood everything the impurity of the character that had seemed so pure the nullity of the life that had seemed so noble When I asked myself what there was left to me to do I could see but one thing It was impossible to go on administering justice being myself unjust and remembering that higher bar before which I too was yet to stand I must cease to be Deemster But that was only my protection against the future not my punishment for the past I could not surrender myself to any earthly court because I was guilty of no crime against earthly law The law cannot take a man into the court of the conscience He must take himself there He stopped again and then said quietly My sentence is this open confession of my sin and renunciation of the worldly advantages which have been bought by the suffering of others It was no longer possible to doubt him He had sinned and he had reaped the reward of his sin Those rewards were great and splendid but he had come to renounce them all The dreams of ambition were fulfilled the miracle of life was realised the world was conquered and at his feet yet he was there to give up all The quiet of the court had warmed to a hush of awe He turned to the bench but every face was down Then his own eyes fell Gentlemen of the Council you who have served the island so long and so honourably perhaps you blame me for permitting you to come together for the hearing of this confession But if you knew the temptation I was under to fly away without making it to turn my back on my past to shuffle my fault on to Fate to lay the blame on Life to persuade myself that I could not have acted differently you would believe it was not lightly and God knows not vainly that I suffered you to come here to see me mount my scaffold He turned back to the body of the court My countrymen and countrywomen you who have been so much more kind to me than my character justified or my conduct merited I say good bye but not as one who is going away In conquering the impulse to go without confessing I conquered the desire to go at all Here where my old life has fallen to ruin my new life must be built up That is the only security It is also the only justice On this island where my fall is known my uprising may come as is most right only with bitter struggle and sorrow and tears But when it comes it will come securely It may be in years in many years but I am willing to wait I am ready to labour And meantime she who was worthy of my highest honour will share my lowest degradation That is the way of all women God love and keep them The exaltation of his tones infected everybody It may be that you think I am to be pitied There have been hours of my life when I have been deserving of pity But they have been the hours the dark hours when in the prodigality of your gratitude you have loaded me with distinctions and a shadow has haunted me saying Philip Christian they think you a just judge you are not a just judge they think you an upright man you are not an upright man Do not pity me now when the dark hours are passed when the new life has begun when I am listening at length to the voice of my heart which has all along been the voice of God His eyes shone his mouth was smiling If you think how narrowly I escaped the danger of letting things go on as they were going of covering up my fault of concealing my true character of living as a sham and dying as a hypocrite you will consider me worthy of envy instead Good bye good bye God bless you Before any one appeared to be aware that his voice had ceased he was gone from the bench and the Deemster s chair stood empty Then the people turned and looked into each other s stricken faces They were still standing for nobody had thought of sitting down There was no further speaking that day Without a word or a sign the Governor descended from his seat and the proceedings came to an end Every one moved towards the door A great price to pay for it though thought the men How he must have loved her after all thought the women At that moment the big Queen Elizabeth clock of the Castle was striking twelve and the fishermen on Irish waters were raising a cheer for their friend at home A loud detonation rang out over the town It was the report of a gun There was another and then a third The shots were from a steamer that was passing the bay Philip remembered it was Pete s last farewell XXIII Half an hour later the Keep the courtyard and the passage to the portcullis were filled with an immense crowd Ladies thronged the two flights of external steps to the prisoners chapel and the council chamber Men had climbed as high as to the battlements and were looking down over the beetle browed walls All eyes were on the door to the debtors side of the prison and a path from it was being kept clear The door opened and Philip and Kate came out There was no other exit and they must have taken it He was holding her firmly by the hand and half leading half drawing her along Under the weight of so many eyes her head was held down but those who were near enough to see her face knew that her shame was swallowed up in happiness and her fear in love Philip was like a man transfigured The extreme pallor of his cheeks was gone his step was firm and his face was radiant It was the common remark that never before had he looked so strong so buoyant so noble This was the hour of his triumph not that within the walls this when his sin was confessed when conscience had no power to appal him when the world and the pride of the world were beneath his feet and he was going forth from a prison cell hand in hand with the fallen woman by his side to face the future with their bankrupt lives And she She was sharing his fiery ordeal Before her outraged sisters and all the world she was walking with him in the depth of his humiliation at the height of his conquest at the climax of his shame and glory Once for a moment she halted and stumbled as if under the hot breath that was beating upon her head But he put his arm about her and in a moment she was strong The sun dipped down from the great tower on to his upturned face and his eyes were glistening through their tears THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Manxman by Hall Caine END OF THIS
