First The Maiden I On an evening in the latter part of May a middle aged man was walking homeward from Shaston to the village of Marlott in the adjoining Vale of Blakemore or Blackmoor The pair of legs that carried him were rickety and there was a bias in his gait which inclined him somewhat to the left of a straight line He occasionally gave a smart nod as if in confirmation of some opinion though he was not thinking of anything in particular An empty egg basket was slung upon his arm the nap of his hat was ruffled a patch being quite worn away at its brim where his thumb came in taking it off Presently he was met by an elderly parson astride on a gray mare who as he rode hummed a wandering tune Good night t ee said the man with the basket Good night Sir John said the parson The pedestrian after another pace or two halted and turned round Now sir begging your pardon we met last market day on this road about this time and I said Good night and you made reply Good night Sir John as now I did said the parson And once before that near a month ago I may have Then what might your meaning be in calling me Sir John these different times when I be plain Jack Durbeyfield the haggler The parson rode a step or two nearer It was only my whim he said and after a moment s hesitation It was on account of a discovery I made some little time ago whilst I was hunting up pedigrees for the new county history I am Parson Tringham the antiquary of Stagfoot Lane Don t you really know Durbeyfield that you are the lineal representative of the ancient and knightly family of the d Urbervilles who derive their descent from Sir Pagan d Urberville that renowned knight who came from Normandy with William the Conqueror as appears by Battle Abbey Roll Never heard it before sir Well it s true Throw up your chin a moment so that I may catch the profile of your face better Yes that s the d Urberville nose and chin a little debased Your ancestor was one of the twelve knights who assisted the Lord of Estremavilla in Normandy in his conquest of Glamorganshire Branches of your family held manors over all this part of England their names appear in the Pipe Rolls in the time of King Stephen In the reign of King John one of them was rich enough to give a manor to the Knights Hospitallers and in Edward the Second s time your forefather Brian was summoned to Westminster to attend the great Council there You declined a little in Oliver Cromwell s time but to no serious extent and in Charles the Second s reign you were made Knights of the Royal Oak for your loyalty Aye there have been generations of Sir Johns among you and if knighthood were hereditary like a baronetcy as it practically was in old times when men were knighted from father to son you would be Sir John now Ye don t say so In short concluded the parson decisively smacking his leg with his switch there s hardly such another family in England Daze my eyes and isn t there said Durbeyfield And here have I been knocking about year after year from pillar to post as if I was no more than the commonest feller in the parish And how long hev this news about me been knowed Pa son Tringham The clergyman explained that as far as he was aware it had quite died out of knowledge and could hardly be said to be known at all His own investigations had begun on a day in the preceding spring when having been engaged in tracing the vicissitudes of the d Urberville family he had observed Durbeyfield s name on his waggon and had thereupon been led to make inquiries about his father and grandfather till he had no doubt on the subject At first I resolved not to disturb you with such a useless piece of information said he However our impulses are too strong for our judgement sometimes I thought you might perhaps know something of it all the while Well I have heard once or twice tis true that my family had seen better days afore they came to Blackmoor But I took no notice o t thinking it to mean that we had once kept two horses where we now keep only one I ve got a wold silver spoon and a wold graven seal at home too but Lord what s a spoon and seal And to think that I and these noble d Urbervilles were one flesh all the time Twas said that my gr t granfer had secrets and didn t care to talk of where he came from And where do we raise our smoke now parson if I may make so bold I mean where do we d Urbervilles live You don t live anywhere You are extinct as a county family That s bad Yes what the mendacious family chronicles call extinct in the male line that is gone down gone under Then where do we lie At Kingsbere sub Greenhill rows and rows of you in your vaults with your effigies under Purbeck marble canopies And where be our family mansions and estates You haven t any Oh No lands neither None though you once had em in abundance as I said for you family consisted of numerous branches In this county there was a seat of yours at Kingsbere and another at Sherton and another in Millpond and another at Lullstead and another at Wellbridge And shall we ever come into our own again Ah that I can t tell And what had I better do about it sir asked Durbeyfield after a pause Oh nothing nothing except chasten yourself with the thought of how are the mighty fallen It is a fact of some interest to the local historian and genealogist nothing more There are several families among the cottagers of this county of almost equal lustre Good night But you ll turn back and have a quart of beer wi me on the strength o t Pa son Tringham There s a very pretty brew in tap at The Pure Drop though to be sure not so good as at Rolliver s No thank you not this evening Durbeyfield You ve had enough already Concluding thus the parson rode on his way with doubts as to his discretion in retailing this curious bit of lore When he was gone Durbeyfield walked a few steps in a profound reverie and then sat down upon the grassy bank by the roadside depositing his basket before him In a few minutes a youth appeared in the distance walking in the same direction as that which had been pursued by Durbeyfield The latter on seeing him held up his hand and the lad quickened his pace and came near Boy take up that basket I want ee to go on an errand for me The lath like stripling frowned Who be you then John Durbeyfield to order me about and call me boy You know my name as well as I know yours Do you do you That s the secret that s the secret Now obey my orders and take the message I m going to charge ee wi Well Fred I don t mind telling you that the secret is that I m one of a noble race it has been just found out by me this present afternoon P M And as he made the announcement Durbeyfield declining from his sitting position luxuriously stretched himself out upon the bank among the daisies The lad stood before Durbeyfield and contemplated his length from crown to toe Sir John d Urberville that s who I am continued the prostrate man That is if knights were baronets which they be Tis recorded in history all about me Dost know of such a place lad as Kingsbere sub Greenhill Ees I ve been there to Greenhill Fair Well under the church of that city there lie Tisn t a city the place I mean leastwise twaddn when I was there twas a little one eyed blinking sort o place Never you mind the place boy that s not the question before us Under the church of that there parish lie my ancestors hundreds of em in coats of mail and jewels in gr t lead coffins weighing tons and tons There s not a man in the county o South Wessex that s got grander and nobler skillentons in his family than I Oh Now take up that basket and goo on to Marlott and when you ve come to The Pure Drop Inn tell em to send a horse and carriage to me immed ately to carry me hwome And in the bottom o the carriage they be to put a noggin o rum in a small bottle and chalk it up to my account And when you ve done that goo on to my house with the basket and tell my wife to put away that washing because she needn t finish it and wait till I come hwome as I ve news to tell her As the lad stood in a dubious attitude Durbeyfield put his hand in his pocket and produced a shilling one of the chronically few that he possessed Here s for your labour lad This made a difference in the young man s estimate of the position Yes Sir John Thank ee Anything else I can do for ee Sir John Tell em at hwome that I should like for supper well lamb s fry if they can get it and if they can t black pot and if they can t get that well chitterlings will do Yes Sir John The boy took up the basket and as he set out the notes of a brass band were heard from the direction of the village What s that said Durbeyfield Not on account o I Tis the women s club walking Sir John Why your da ter is one o the members To be sure I d quite forgot it in my thoughts of greater things Well vamp on to Marlott will ye and order that carriage and maybe I ll drive round and inspect the club The lad departed and Durbeyfield lay waiting on the grass and daisies in the evening sun Not a soul passed that way for a long while and the faint notes of the band were the only human sounds audible within the rim of blue hills II The village of Marlott lay amid the north eastern undulations of the beautiful Vale of Blakemore or Blackmoor aforesaid an engirdled and secluded region for the most part untrodden as yet by tourist or landscape painter though within a four hours journey from London It is a vale whose acquaintance is best made by viewing it from the summits of the hills that surround it except perhaps during the droughts of summer An unguided ramble into its recesses in bad weather is apt to engender dissatisfaction with its narrow tortuous and miry ways This fertile and sheltered tract of country in which the fields are never brown and the springs never dry is bounded on the south by the bold chalk ridge that embraces the prominences of Hambledon Hill Bulbarrow Nettlecombe Tout Dogbury High Stoy and Bubb Down The traveller from the coast who after plodding northward for a score of miles over calcareous downs and corn lands suddenly reaches the verge of one of these escarpments is surprised and delighted to behold extended like a map beneath him a country differing absolutely from that which he has passed through Behind him the hills are open the sun blazes down upon fields so large as to give an unenclosed character to the landscape the lanes are white the hedges low and plashed the atmosphere colourless Here in the valley the world seems to be constructed upon a smaller and more delicate scale the fields are mere paddocks so reduced that from this height their hedgerows appear a network of dark green threads overspreading the paler green of the grass The atmosphere beneath is languorous and is so tinged with azure that what artists call the middle distance partakes also of that hue while the horizon beyond is of the deepest ultramarine Arable lands are few and limited with but slight exceptions the prospect is a broad rich mass of grass and trees mantling minor hills and dales within the major Such is the Vale of Blackmoor The district is of historic no less than of topographical interest The Vale was known in former times as the Forest of White Hart from a curious legend of King Henry III s reign in which the killing by a certain Thomas de la Lynd of a beautiful white hart which the king had run down and spared was made the occasion of a heavy fine In those days and till comparatively recent times the country was densely wooded Even now traces of its earlier condition are to be found in the old oak copses and irregular belts of timber that yet survive upon its slopes and the hollow trunked trees that shade so many of its pastures The forests have departed but some old customs of their shades remain Many however linger only in a metamorphosed or disguised form The May Day dance for instance was to be discerned on the afternoon under notice in the guise of the club revel or club walking as it was there called It was an interesting event to the younger inhabitants of Marlott though its real interest was not observed by the participators in the ceremony Its singularity lay less in the retention of a custom of walking in procession and dancing on each anniversary than in the members being solely women In men s clubs such celebrations were though expiring less uncommon but either the natural shyness of the softer sex or a sarcastic attitude on the part of male relatives had denuded such women s clubs as remained if any other did or this their glory and consummation The club of Marlott alone lived to uphold the local Cerealia It had walked for hundreds of years if not as benefit club as votive sisterhood of some sort and it walked still The banded ones were all dressed in white gowns a gay survival from Old Style days when cheerfulness and May time were synonyms days before the habit of taking long views had reduced emotions to a monotonous average Their first exhibition of themselves was in a processional march of two and two round the parish Ideal and real clashed slightly as the sun lit up their figures against the green hedges and creeper laced house fronts for though the whole troop wore white garments no two whites were alike among them Some approached pure blanching some had a bluish pallor some worn by the older characters which had possibly lain by folded for many a year inclined to a cadaverous tint and to a Georgian style In addition to the distinction of a white frock every woman and girl carried in her right hand a peeled willow wand and in her left a bunch of white flowers The peeling of the former and the selection of the latter had been an operation of personal care There were a few middle aged and even elderly women in the train their silver wiry hair and wrinkled faces scourged by time and trouble having almost a grotesque certainly a pathetic appearance in such a jaunty situation In a true view perhaps there was more to be gathered and told of each anxious and experienced one to whom the years were drawing nigh when she should say I have no pleasure in them than of her juvenile comrades But let the elder be passed over here for those under whose bodices the life throbbed quick and warm The young girls formed indeed the majority of the band and their heads of luxuriant hair reflected in the sunshine every tone of gold and black and brown Some had beautiful eyes others a beautiful nose others a beautiful mouth and figure few if any had all A difficulty of arranging their lips in this crude exposure to public scrutiny an inability to balance their heads and to dissociate self consciousness from their features was apparent in them and showed that they were genuine country girls unaccustomed to many eyes And as each and all of them were warmed without by the sun so each had a private little sun for her soul to bask in some dream some affection some hobby at least some remote and distant hope which though perhaps starving to nothing still lived on as hopes will They were all cheerful and many of them merry They came round by The Pure Drop Inn and were turning out of the high road to pass through a wicket gate into the meadows when one of the women said The Load a Lord Why Tess Durbeyfield if there isn t thy father riding hwome in a carriage A young member of the band turned her head at the exclamation She was a fine and handsome girl not handsomer than some others possibly but her mobile peony mouth and large innocent eyes added eloquence to colour and shape She wore a red ribbon in her hair and was the only one of the white company who could boast of such a pronounced adornment As she looked round Durbeyfield was seen moving along the road in a chaise belonging to The Pure Drop driven by a frizzle headed brawny damsel with her gown sleeves rolled above her elbows This was the cheerful servant of that establishment who in her part of factotum turned groom and ostler at times Durbeyfield leaning back and with his eyes closed luxuriously was waving his hand above his head and singing in a slow recitative I ve got a gr t family vault at Kingsbere and knighted forefathers in lead coffins there The clubbists tittered except the girl called Tess in whom a slow heat seemed to rise at the sense that her father was making himself foolish in their eyes He s tired that s all she said hastily and he has got a lift home because our own horse has to rest to day Bless thy simplicity Tess said her companions He s got his market nitch Haw haw Look here I won t walk another inch with you if you say any jokes about him Tess cried and the colour upon her cheeks spread over her face and neck In a moment her eyes grew moist and her glance drooped to the ground Perceiving that they had really pained her they said no more and order again prevailed Tess s pride would not allow her to turn her head again to learn what her father s meaning was if he had any and thus she moved on with the whole body to the enclosure where there was to be dancing on the green By the time the spot was reached she has recovered her equanimity and tapped her neighbour with her wand and talked as usual Tess Durbeyfield at this time of her life was a mere vessel of emotion untinctured by experience The dialect was on her tongue to some extent despite the village school the characteristic intonation of that dialect for this district being the voicing approximately rendered by the syllable UR probably as rich an utterance as any to be found in human speech The pouted up deep red mouth to which this syllable was native had hardly as yet settled into its definite shape and her lower lip had a way of thrusting the middle of her top one upward when they closed together after a word Phases of her childhood lurked in her aspect still As she walked along to day for all her bouncing handsome womanliness you could sometimes see her twelfth year in her cheeks or her ninth sparkling from her eyes and even her fifth would flit over the curves of her mouth now and then Yet few knew and still fewer considered this A small minority mainly strangers would look long at her in casually passing by and grow momentarily fascinated by her freshness and wonder if they would ever see her again but to almost everybody she was a fine and picturesque country girl and no more Nothing was seen or heard further of Durbeyfield in his triumphal chariot under the conduct of the ostleress and the club having entered the allotted space dancing began As there were no men in the company the girls danced at first with each other but when the hour for the close of labour drew on the masculine inhabitants of the village together with other idlers and pedestrians gathered round the spot and appeared inclined to negotiate for a partner Among these on lookers were three young men of a superior class carrying small knapsacks strapped to their shoulders and stout sticks in their hands Their general likeness to each other and their consecutive ages would almost have suggested that they might be what in fact they were brothers The eldest wore the white tie high waistcoat and thin brimmed hat of the regulation curate the second was the normal undergraduate the appearance of the third and youngest would hardly have been sufficient to characterize him there was an uncribbed uncabined aspect in his eyes and attire implying that he had hardly as yet found the entrance to his professional groove That he was a desultory tentative student of something and everything might only have been predicted of him These three brethren told casual acquaintance that they were spending their Whitsun holidays in a walking tour through the Vale of Blackmoor their course being south westerly from the town of Shaston on the north east They leant over the gate by the highway and inquired as to the meaning of the dance and the white frocked maids The two elder of the brothers were plainly not intending to linger more than a moment but the spectacle of a bevy of girls dancing without male partners seemed to amuse the third and make him in no hurry to move on He unstrapped his knapsack put it with his stick on the hedge bank and opened the gate What are you going to do Angel asked the eldest I am inclined to go and have a fling with them Why not all of us just for a minute or two it will not detain us long No no nonsense said the first Dancing in public with a troop of country hoydens suppose we should be seen Come along or it will be dark before we get to Stourcastle and there s no place we can sleep at nearer than that besides we must get through another chapter of A Counterblast to Agnosticism before we turn in now I have taken the trouble to bring the book All right I ll overtake you and Cuthbert in five minutes don t stop I give my word that I will Felix The two elder reluctantly left him and walked on taking their brother s knapsack to relieve him in following and the youngest entered the field This is a thousand pities he said gallantly to two or three of the girls nearest him as soon as there was a pause in the dance Where are your partners my dears They ve not left off work yet answered one of the boldest They ll be here by and by Till then will you be one sir Certainly But what s one among so many Better than none Tis melancholy work facing and footing it to one of your own sort and no clipsing and colling at all Now pick and choose Ssh don t be so for ard said a shyer girl The young man thus invited glanced them over and attempted some discrimination but as the group were all so new to him he could not very well exercise it He took almost the first that came to hand which was not the speaker as she had expected nor did it happen to be Tess Durbeyfield Pedigree ancestral skeletons monumental record the d Urberville lineaments did not help Tess in her life s battle as yet even to the extent of attracting to her a dancing partner over the heads of the commonest peasantry So much for Norman blood unaided by Victorian lucre The name of the eclipsing girl whatever it was has not been handed down but she was envied by all as the first who enjoyed the luxury of a masculine partner that evening Yet such was the force of example that the village young men who had not hastened to enter the gate while no intruder was in the way now dropped in quickly and soon the couples became leavened with rustic youth to a marked extent till at length the plainest woman in the club was no longer compelled to foot it on the masculine side of the figure The church clock struck when suddenly the student said that he must leave he had been forgetting himself he had to join his companions As he fell out of the dance his eyes lighted on Tess Durbeyfield whose own large orbs wore to tell the truth the faintest aspect of reproach that he had not chosen her He too was sorry then that owing to her backwardness he had not observed her and with that in his mind he left the pasture On account of his long delay he started in a flying run down the lane westward and had soon passed the hollow and mounted the next rise He had not yet overtaken his brothers but he paused to get breath and looked back He could see the white figures of the girls in the green enclosure whirling about as they had whirled when he was among them They seemed to have quite forgotten him already All of them except perhaps one This white shape stood apart by the hedge alone From her position he knew it to be the pretty maiden with whom he had not danced Trifling as the matter was he yet instinctively felt that she was hurt by his oversight He wished that he had asked her he wished that he had inquired her name She was so modest so expressive she had looked so soft in her thin white gown that he felt he had acted stupidly However it could not be helped and turning and bending himself to a rapid walk he dismissed the subject from his mind III As for Tess Durbeyfield she did not so easily dislodge the incident from her consideration She had no spirit to dance again for a long time though she might have had plenty of partners but ah they did not speak so nicely as the strange young man had done It was not till the rays of the sun had absorbed the young stranger s retreating figure on the hill that she shook off her temporary sadness and answered her would be partner in the affirmative She remained with her comrades till dusk and participated with a certain zest in the dancing though being heart whole as yet she enjoyed treading a measure purely for its own sake little divining when she saw the soft torments the bitter sweets the pleasing pains and the agreeable distresses of those girls who had been wooed and won what she herself was capable of in that kind The struggles and wrangles of the lads for her hand in a jig were an amusement to her no more and when they became fierce she rebuked them She might have stayed even later but the incident of her father s odd appearance and manner returned upon the girl s mind to make her anxious and wondering what had become of him she dropped away from the dancers and bent her steps towards the end of the village at which the parental cottage lay While yet many score yards off other rhythmic sounds than those she had quitted became audible to her sounds that she knew well so well They were a regular series of thumpings from the interior of the house occasioned by the violent rocking of a cradle upon a stone floor to which movement a feminine voice kept time by singing in a vigorous gallopade the favourite ditty of The Spotted Cow I saw her lie do own in yon der green gro ove Come love and I ll tell you where The cradle rocking and the song would cease simultaneously for a moment and an exclamation at highest vocal pitch would take the place of the melody God bless thy diment eyes And thy waxen cheeks And thy cherry mouth And thy Cubit s thighs And every bit o thy blessed body After this invocation the rocking and the singing would recommence and the Spotted Cow proceed as before So matters stood when Tess opened the door and paused upon the mat within it surveying the scene The interior in spite of the melody struck upon the girl s senses with an unspeakable dreariness From the holiday gaieties of the field the white gowns the nosegays the willow wands the whirling movements on the green the flash of gentle sentiment towards the stranger to the yellow melancholy of this one candled spectacle what a step Besides the jar of contrast there came to her a chill self reproach that she had not returned sooner to help her mother in these domesticities instead of indulging herself out of doors There stood her mother amid the group of children as Tess had left her hanging over the Monday washing tub which had now as always lingered on to the end of the week Out of that tub had come the day before Tess felt it with a dreadful sting of remorse the very white frock upon her back which she had so carelessly greened about the skirt on the damping grass which had been wrung up and ironed by her mother s own hands As usual missus Durbeyfield was balanced on one foot beside the tub the other being engaged in the aforesaid business of rocking her youngest child The cradle rockers had done hard duty for so many years under the weight of so many children on that flagstone floor that they were worn nearly flat in consequence of which a huge jerk accompanied each swing of the cot flinging the baby from side to side like a weaver s shuttle as missus Durbeyfield excited by her song trod the rocker with all the spring that was left in her after a long day s seething in the suds Nick knock nick knock went the cradle the candle flame stretched itself tall and began jigging up and down the water dribbled from the matron s elbows and the song galloped on to the end of the verse missus Durbeyfield regarding her daughter the while Even now when burdened with a young family Joan Durbeyfield was a passionate lover of tune No ditty floated into Blackmoor Vale from the outer world but Tess s mother caught up its notation in a week There still faintly beamed from the woman s features something of the freshness and even the prettiness of her youth rendering it probable that the personal charms which Tess could boast of were in main part her mother s gift and therefore unknightly unhistorical I ll rock the cradle for ee mother said the daughter gently Or I ll take off my best frock and help you wring up I thought you had finished long ago Her mother bore Tess no ill will for leaving the housework to her single handed efforts for so long indeed Joan seldom upbraided her thereon at any time feeling but slightly the lack of Tess s assistance whilst her instinctive plan for relieving herself of her labours lay in postponing them To night however she was even in a blither mood than usual There was a dreaminess a pre occupation an exaltation in the maternal look which the girl could not understand Well I m glad you ve come her mother said as soon as the last note had passed out of her I want to go and fetch your father but what s more n that I want to tell ee what have happened Y ll be fess enough my poppet when th saint know missus Durbeyfield habitually spoke the dialect her daughter who had passed the Sixth Standard in the National School under a London trained mistress spoke two languages the dialect at home more or less ordinary English abroad and to persons of quality Since I ve been away Tess asked Ay Had it anything to do with father s making such a mommet of himself in thik carriage this afternoon Why did er I felt inclined to sink into the ground with shame That wer all a part of the larry We ve been found to be the greatest gentlefolk in the whole county reaching all back long before Oliver Grumble s time to the days of the Pagan Turks with monuments and vaults and crests and scutcheons and the Lord knows what all In Saint Charles s days we was made Knights o the Royal Oak our real name being d Urberville Don t that make your bosom plim Twas on this account that your father rode home in the vlee not because he d been drinking as people supposed I m glad of that Will it do us any good mother O yes Tis thoughted that great things may come o t No doubt a mampus of volk of our own rank will be down here in their carriages as soon as tis known Your father learnt it on his way hwome from Shaston and he has been telling me the whole pedigree of the matter Where is father now asked Tess suddenly Her mother gave irrelevant information by way of answer He called to see the doctor to day in Shaston It is not consumption at all it seems It is fat round his heart a says There it is like this Joan Durbeyfield as she spoke curved a sodden thumb and forefinger to the shape of the letter C and used the other forefinger as a pointer At the present moment he says to your father your heart is enclosed all round there and all round there this space is still open a says As soon as it do meet so missus Durbeyfield closed her fingers into a circle complete off you will go like a shadder mister Durbeyfield a says You mid last ten years you mid go off in ten months or ten days Tess looked alarmed Her father possibly to go behind the eternal cloud so soon notwithstanding this sudden greatness But where IS father she asked again Her mother put on a deprecating look Now don t you be bursting out angry The poor man he felt so rafted after his uplifting by the pa son s news that he went up to Rolliver s half an hour ago He do want to get up his strength for his journey to morrow with that load of beehives which must be delivered family or no He ll have to start shortly after twelve to night as the distance is so long Get up his strength said Tess impetuously the tears welling to her eyes O my God Go to a public house to get up his strength And you as well agreed as he mother Her rebuke and her mood seemed to fill the whole room and to impart a cowed look to the furniture and candle and children playing about and to her mother s face No said the latter touchily I be not agreed I have been waiting for ee to bide and keep house while I go fetch him I ll go O no Tess You see it would be no use Tess did not expostulate She knew what her mother s objection meant missus Durbeyfield s jacket and bonnet were already hanging slily upon a chair by her side in readiness for this contemplated jaunt the reason for which the matron deplored more than its necessity And take the Compleat Fortune Teller to the outhouse Joan continued rapidly wiping her hands and donning the garments The Compleat Fortune Teller was an old thick volume which lay on a table at her elbow so worn by pocketing that the margins had reached the edge of the type Tess took it up and her mother started This going to hunt up her shiftless husband at the inn was one of missus Durbeyfield s still extant enjoyments in the muck and muddle of rearing children To discover him at Rolliver s to sit there for an hour or two by his side and dismiss all thought and care of the children during the interval made her happy A sort of halo an occidental glow came over life then Troubles and other realities took on themselves a metaphysical impalpability sinking to mere mental phenomena for serene contemplation and no longer stood as pressing concretions which chafed body and soul The youngsters not immediately within sight seemed rather bright and desirable appurtenances than otherwise the incidents of daily life were not without humorousness and jollity in their aspect there She felt a little as she had used to feel when she sat by her now wedded husband in the same spot during his wooing shutting her eyes to his defects of character and regarding him only in his ideal presentation as lover Tess being left alone with the younger children went first to the outhouse with the fortune telling book and stuffed it into the thatch A curious fetishistic fear of this grimy volume on the part of her mother prevented her ever allowing it to stay in the house all night and hither it was brought back whenever it had been consulted Between the mother with her fast perishing lumber of superstitions folk lore dialect and orally transmitted ballads and the daughter with her trained National teachings and Standard knowledge under an infinitely Revised Code there was a gap of two hundred years as ordinarily understood When they were together the Jacobean and the Victorian ages were juxtaposed Returning along the garden path Tess mused on what the mother could have wished to ascertain from the book on this particular day She guessed the recent ancestral discovery to bear upon it but did not divine that it solely concerned herself Dismissing this however she busied herself with sprinkling the linen dried during the day time in company with her nine year old brother Abraham and her sister Eliza Louisa of twelve and a half called Liza Lu the youngest ones being put to bed There was an interval of four years and more between Tess and the next of the family the two who had filled the gap having died in their infancy and this lent her a deputy maternal attitude when she was alone with her juniors Next in juvenility to Abraham came two more girls Hope and Modesty then a boy of three and then the baby who had just completed his first year All these young souls were passengers in the Durbeyfield ship entirely dependent on the judgement of the two Durbeyfield adults for their pleasures their necessities their health even their existence If the heads of the Durbeyfield household chose to sail into difficulty disaster starvation disease degradation death thither were these half dozen little captives under hatches compelled to sail with them six helpless creatures who had never been asked if they wished for life on any terms much less if they wished for it on such hard conditions as were involved in being of the shiftless house of Durbeyfield Some people would like to know whence the poet whose philosophy is in these days deemed as profound and trustworthy as his song is breezy and pure gets his authority for speaking of Nature s holy plan It grew later and neither father nor mother reappeared Tess looked out of the door and took a mental journey through Marlott The village was shutting its eyes Candles and lamps were being put out everywhere she could inwardly behold the extinguisher and the extended hand Her mother s fetching simply meant one more to fetch Tess began to perceive that a man in indifferent health who proposed to start on a journey before one in the morning ought not to be at an inn at this late hour celebrating his ancient blood Abraham she said to her little brother do you put on your hat you bain t afraid and go up to Rolliver s and see what has gone wi father and mother The boy jumped promptly from his seat and opened the door and the night swallowed him up Half an hour passed yet again neither man woman nor child returned Abraham like his parents seemed to have been limed and caught by the ensnaring inn I must go myself she said Liza Lu then went to bed and Tess locking them all in started on her way up the dark and crooked lane or street not made for hasty progress a street laid out before inches of land had value and when one handed clocks sufficiently subdivided the day IV Rolliver s inn the single alehouse at this end of the long and broken village could only boast of an off licence hence as nobody could legally drink on the premises the amount of overt accommodation for consumers was strictly limited to a little board about six inches wide and two yards long fixed to the garden palings by pieces of wire so as to form a ledge On this board thirsty strangers deposited their cups as they stood in the road and drank and threw the dregs on the dusty ground to the pattern of Polynesia and wished they could have a restful seat inside Thus the strangers But there were also local customers who felt the same wish and where there s a will there s a way In a large bedroom upstairs the window of which was thickly curtained with a great woollen shawl lately discarded by the landlady missus Rolliver were gathered on this evening nearly a dozen persons all seeking beatitude all old inhabitants of the nearer end of Marlott and frequenters of this retreat Not only did the distance to the The Pure Drop the fully licensed tavern at the further part of the dispersed village render its accommodation practically unavailable for dwellers at this end but the far more serious question the quality of the liquor confirmed the prevalent opinion that it was better to drink with Rolliver in a corner of the housetop than with the other landlord in a wide house A gaunt four post bedstead which stood in the room afforded sitting space for several persons gathered round three of its sides a couple more men had elevated themselves on a chest of drawers another rested on the oak carved cwoffer two on the wash stand another on the stool and thus all were somehow seated at their ease The stage of mental comfort to which they had arrived at this hour was one wherein their souls expanded beyond their skins and spread their personalities warmly through the room In this process the chamber and its furniture grew more and more dignified and luxurious the shawl hanging at the window took upon itself the richness of tapestry the brass handles of the chest of drawers were as golden knockers and the carved bedposts seemed to have some kinship with the magnificent pillars of Solomon s temple missus Durbeyfield having quickly walked hitherward after parting from Tess opened the front door crossed the downstairs room which was in deep gloom and then unfastened the stair door like one whose fingers knew the tricks of the latches well Her ascent of the crooked staircase was a slower process and her face as it rose into the light above the last stair encountered the gaze of all the party assembled in the bedroom Being a few private friends I ve asked in to keep up club walking at my own expense the landlady exclaimed at the sound of footsteps as glibly as a child repeating the Catechism while she peered over the stairs Oh tis you missus Durbeyfield Lard how you frightened me I thought it might be some gaffer sent by Gover ment missus Durbeyfield was welcomed with glances and nods by the remainder of the conclave and turned to where her husband sat He was humming absently to himself in a low tone I be as good as some folks here and there I ve got a great family vault at Kingsbere sub Greenhill and finer skillentons than any man in Wessex I ve something to tell ee that s come into my head about that a grand projick whispered his cheerful wife Here John don t ee see me She nudged him while he looking through her as through a window pane went on with his recitative Hush Don t ee sing so loud my good man said the landlady in case any member of the Gover ment should be passing and take away my licends He s told ee what s happened to us I suppose asked missus Durbeyfield Yes in a way D ye think there s any money hanging by it Ah that s the secret said Joan Durbeyfield sagely However tis well to be kin to a coach even if you don t ride in en She dropped her public voice and continued in a low tone to her husband I ve been thinking since you brought the news that there s a great rich lady out by Trantridge on the edge o The Chase of the name of d Urberville Hey what s that said Sir John She repeated the information That lady must be our relation she said And my projick is to send Tess to claim kin There IS a lady of the name now you mention it said Durbeyfield Pa son Tringham didn t think of that But she s nothing beside we a junior branch of us no doubt hailing long since King Norman s day While this question was being discussed neither of the pair noticed in their preoccupation that little Abraham had crept into the room and was awaiting an opportunity of asking them to return She is rich and she d be sure to take notice o the maid continued missus Durbeyfield and twill be a very good thing I don t see why two branches o one family should not be on visiting terms Yes and we ll all claim kin said Abraham brightly from under the bedstead And we ll all go and see her when Tess has gone to live with her and we ll ride in her coach and wear black clothes How do you come here child What nonsense be ye talking Go away and play on the stairs till father and mother be ready Well Tess ought to go to this other member of our family She d be sure to win the lady Tess would and likely enough twould lead to some noble gentleman marrying her In short I know it How I tried her fate in the Fortune Teller and it brought out that very thing You should ha seen how pretty she looked to day her skin is as sumple as a duchess What says the maid herself to going I ve not asked her She don t know there is any such lady relation yet But it would certainly put her in the way of a grand marriage and she won t say nay to going Tess is queer But she s tractable at bottom Leave her to me Though this conversation had been private sufficient of its import reached the understandings of those around to suggest to them that the Durbeyfields had weightier concerns to talk of now than common folks had and that Tess their pretty eldest daughter had fine prospects in store Tess is a fine figure o fun as I said to myself to day when I zeed her vamping round parish with the rest observed one of the elderly boozers in an undertone But Joan Durbeyfield must mind that she don t get green malt in floor It was a local phrase which had a peculiar meaning and there was no reply The conversation became inclusive and presently other footsteps were heard crossing the room below Being a few private friends asked in to night to keep up club walking at my own expense The landlady had rapidly re used the formula she kept on hand for intruders before she recognized that the newcomer was Tess Even to her mother s gaze the girl s young features looked sadly out of place amid the alcoholic vapours which floated here as no unsuitable medium for wrinkled middle age and hardly was a reproachful flash from Tess s dark eyes needed to make her father and mother rise from their seats hastily finish their ale and descend the stairs behind her missus Rolliver s caution following their footsteps No noise please if ye ll be so good my dears or I mid lose my licends and be summons d and I don t know what all Night t ye They went home together Tess holding one arm of her father and missus Durbeyfield the other He had in truth drunk very little not a fourth of the quantity which a systematic tippler could carry to church on a Sunday afternoon without a hitch in his eastings or genuflections but the weakness of Sir John s constitution made mountains of his petty sins in this kind On reaching the fresh air he was sufficiently unsteady to incline the row of three at one moment as if they were marching to London and at another as if they were marching to Bath which produced a comical effect frequent enough in families on nocturnal homegoings and like most comical effects not quite so comic after all The two women valiantly disguised these forced excursions and countermarches as well as they could from Durbeyfield their cause and from Abraham and from themselves and so they approached by degrees their own door the head of the family bursting suddenly into his former refrain as he drew near as if to fortify his soul at sight of the smallness of his present residence I ve got a fam ily vault at Kingsbere Hush don t be so silly Jacky said his wife Yours is not the only family that was of count in wold days Look at the Anktells and Horseys and the Tringhams themselves gone to seed a most as much as you though you was bigger folks than they that s true Thank God I was never of no family and have nothing to be ashamed of in that way Don t you be so sure o that From you nater tis my belief you ve disgraced yourselves more than any o us and was kings and queens outright at one time Tess turned the subject by saying what was far more prominent in her own mind at the moment than thoughts of her ancestry I am afraid father won t be able to take the journey with the beehives to morrow so early I I shall be all right in an hour or two said Durbeyfield It was eleven o clock before the family were all in bed and two o clock next morning was the latest hour for starting with the beehives if they were to be delivered to the retailers in Casterbridge before the Saturday market began the way thither lying by bad roads over a distance of between twenty and thirty miles and the horse and waggon being of the slowest At half past one missus Durbeyfield came into the large bedroom where Tess and all her little brothers and sisters slept The poor man can t go she said to her eldest daughter whose great eyes had opened the moment her mother s hand touched the door Tess sat up in bed lost in a vague interspace between a dream and this information But somebody must go she replied It is late for the hives already Swarming will soon be over for the year and it we put off taking em till next week s market the call for em will be past and they ll be thrown on our hands missus Durbeyfield looked unequal to the emergency Some young feller perhaps would go One of them who were so much after dancing with ee yesterday she presently suggested O no I wouldn t have it for the world declared Tess proudly And letting everybody know the reason such a thing to be ashamed of I think I could go if Abraham could go with me to kip me company Her mother at length agreed to this arrangement Little Abraham was aroused from his deep sleep in a corner of the same apartment and made to put on his clothes while still mentally in the other world Meanwhile Tess had hastily dressed herself and the twain lighting a lantern went out to the stable The rickety little waggon was already laden and the girl led out the horse Prince only a degree less rickety than the vehicle The poor creature looked wonderingly round at the night at the lantern at their two figures as if he could not believe that at that hour when every living thing was intended to be in shelter and at rest he was called upon to go out and labour They put a stock of candle ends into the lantern hung the latter to the off side of the load and directed the horse onward walking at his shoulder at first during the uphill parts of the way in order not to overload an animal of so little vigour To cheer themselves as well as they could they made an artificial morning with the lantern some bread and butter and their own conversation the real morning being far from come Abraham as he more fully awoke for he had moved in a sort of trance so far began to talk of the strange shapes assumed by the various dark objects against the sky of this tree that looked like a raging tiger springing from a lair of that which resembled a giant s head When they had passed the little town of Stourcastle dumbly somnolent under its thick brown thatch they reached higher ground Still higher on their left the elevation called Bulbarrow or Bealbarrow well nigh the highest in South Wessex swelled into the sky engirdled by its earthen trenches From hereabout the long road was fairly level for some distance onward They mounted in front of the waggon and Abraham grew reflective Tess he said in a preparatory tone after a silence Yes Abraham Bain t you glad that we ve become gentlefolk Not particular glad But you be glad that you m going to marry a gentleman What said Tess lifting her face That our great relation will help ee to marry a gentleman I Our great relation We have no such relation What has put that into your head I heard em talking about it up at Rolliver s when I went to find father There s a rich lady of our family out at Trantridge and mother said that if you claimed kin with the lady she d put ee in the way of marrying a gentleman His sister became abruptly still and lapsed into a pondering silence Abraham talked on rather for the pleasure of utterance than for audition so that his sister s abstraction was of no account He leant back against the hives and with upturned face made observations on the stars whose cold pulses were beating amid the black hollows above in serene dissociation from these two wisps of human life He asked how far away those twinklers were and whether God was on the other side of them But ever and anon his childish prattle recurred to what impressed his imagination even more deeply than the wonders of creation If Tess were made rich by marrying a gentleman would she have money enough to buy a spyglass so large that it would draw the stars as near to her as Nettlecombe Tout The renewed subject which seemed to have impregnated the whole family filled Tess with impatience Never mind that now she exclaimed Did you say the stars were worlds Tess Yes All like ours I don t know but I think so They sometimes seem to be like the apples on our stubbard tree Most of them splendid and sound a few blighted Which do we live on a splendid one or a blighted one A blighted one Tis very unlucky that we didn t pitch on a sound one when there were so many more of em Yes Is it like that REALLY Tess said Abraham turning to her much impressed on reconsideration of this rare information How would it have been if we had pitched on a sound one Well father wouldn t have coughed and creeped about as he does and wouldn t have got too tipsy to go on this journey and mother wouldn t have been always washing and never getting finished And you would have been a rich lady ready made and not have had to be made rich by marrying a gentleman O Aby don t don t talk of that any more Left to his reflections Abraham soon grew drowsy Tess was not skilful in the management of a horse but she thought that she could take upon herself the entire conduct of the load for the present and allow Abraham to go to sleep if he wished to do so She made him a sort of nest in front of the hives in such a manner that he could not fall and taking the reins into her own hands jogged on as before Prince required but slight attention lacking energy for superfluous movements of any sort With no longer a companion to distract her Tess fell more deeply into reverie than ever her back leaning against the hives The mute procession past her shoulders of trees and hedges became attached to fantastic scenes outside reality and the occasional heave of the wind became the sigh of some immense sad soul conterminous with the universe in space and with history in time Then examining the mesh of events in her own life she seemed to see the vanity of her father s pride the gentlemanly suitor awaiting herself in her mother s fancy to see him as a grimacing personage laughing at her poverty and her shrouded knightly ancestry Everything grew more and more extravagant and she no longer knew how time passed A sudden jerk shook her in her seat and Tess awoke from the sleep into which she too had fallen They were a long way further on than when she had lost consciousness and the waggon had stopped A hollow groan unlike anything she had ever heard in her life came from the front followed by a shout of Hoi there The lantern hanging at her waggon had gone out but another was shining in her face much brighter than her own had been Something terrible had happened The harness was entangled with an object which blocked the way In consternation Tess jumped down and discovered the dreadful truth The groan had proceeded from her father s poor horse Prince The morning mail cart with its two noiseless wheels speeding along these lanes like an arrow as it always did had driven into her slow and unlighted equipage The pointed shaft of the cart had entered the breast of the unhappy Prince like a sword and from the wound his life s blood was spouting in a stream and falling with a hiss into the road In her despair Tess sprang forward and put her hand upon the hole with the only result that she became splashed from face to skirt with the crimson drops Then she stood helplessly looking on Prince also stood firm and motionless as long as he could till he suddenly sank down in a heap By this time the mail cart man had joined her and began dragging and unharnessing the hot form of Prince But he was already dead and seeing that nothing more could be done immediately the mail cart man returned to his own animal which was uninjured You was on the wrong side he said I am bound to go on with the mail bags so that the best thing for you to do is bide here with your load I ll send somebody to help you as soon as I can It is getting daylight and you have nothing to fear He mounted and sped on his way while Tess stood and waited The atmosphere turned pale the birds shook themselves in the hedges arose and twittered the lane showed all its white features and Tess showed hers still whiter The huge pool of blood in front of her was already assuming the iridescence of coagulation and when the sun rose a hundred prismatic hues were reflected from it Prince lay alongside still and stark his eyes half open the hole in his chest looking scarcely large enough to have let out all that had animated him Tis all my doing all mine the girl cried gazing at the spectacle No excuse for me none What will mother and father live on now Aby Aby She shook the child who had slept soundly through the whole disaster We can t go on with our load Prince is killed When Abraham realized all the furrows of fifty years were extemporized on his young face Why I danced and laughed only yesterday she went on to herself To think that I was such a fool Tis because we be on a blighted star and not a sound one isn t it Tess murmured Abraham through his tears In silence they waited through an interval which seemed endless At length a sound and an approaching object proved to them that the driver of the mail car had been as good as his word A farmer s man from near Stourcastle came up leading a strong cob He was harnessed to the waggon of beehives in the place of Prince and the load taken on towards Casterbridge The evening of the same day saw the empty waggon reach again the spot of the accident Prince had lain there in the ditch since the morning but the place of the blood pool was still visible in the middle of the road though scratched and scraped over by passing vehicles All that was left of Prince was now hoisted into the waggon he had formerly hauled and with his hoofs in the air and his shoes shining in the setting sunlight he retraced the eight or nine miles to Marlott Tess had gone back earlier How to break the news was more than she could think It was a relief to her tongue to find from the faces of her parents that they already knew of their loss though this did not lessen the self reproach which she continued to heap upon herself for her negligence But the very shiftlessness of the household rendered the misfortune a less terrifying one to them than it would have been to a thriving family though in the present case it meant ruin and in the other it would only have meant inconvenience In the Durbeyfield countenances there was nothing of the red wrath that would have burnt upon the girl from parents more ambitious for her welfare Nobody blamed Tess as she blamed herself When it was discovered that the knacker and tanner would give only a very few shillings for Prince s carcase because of his decrepitude Durbeyfield rose to the occasion No said he stoically I won t sell his old body When we d Urbervilles was knights in the land we didn t sell our chargers for cat s meat Let em keep their shillings He ve served me well in his lifetime and I won t part from him now He worked harder the next day in digging a grave for Prince in the garden than he had worked for months to grow a crop for his family When the hole was ready Durbeyfield and his wife tied a rope round the horse and dragged him up the path towards it the children following in funeral train Abraham and Liza Lu sobbed Hope and Modesty discharged their griefs in loud blares which echoed from the walls and when Prince was tumbled in they gathered round the grave The bread winner had been taken away from them what would they do Is he gone to heaven asked Abraham between the sobs Then Durbeyfield began to shovel in the earth and the children cried anew All except Tess Her face was dry and pale as though she regarded herself in the light of a murderess V The haggling business which had mainly depended on the horse became disorganized forthwith Distress if not penury loomed in the distance Durbeyfield was what was locally called a slack twisted fellow he had good strength to work at times but the times could not be relied on to coincide with the hours of requirement and having been unaccustomed to the regular toil of the day labourer he was not particularly persistent when they did so coincide Tess meanwhile as the one who had dragged her parents into this quagmire was silently wondering what she could do to help them out of it and then her mother broached her scheme We must take the ups wi the downs Tess said she and never could your high blood have been found out at a more called for moment You must try your friends Do ye know that there is a very rich missus d Urberville living on the outskirts o The Chase who must be our relation You must go to her and claim kin and ask for some help in our trouble I shouldn t care to do that says Tess If there is such a lady twould be enough for us if she were friendly not to expect her to give us help You could win her round to do anything my dear Besides perhaps there s more in it than you know of I ve heard what I ve heard good now The oppressive sense of the harm she had done led Tess to be more deferential than she might otherwise have been to the maternal wish but she could not understand why her mother should find such satisfaction in contemplating an enterprise of to her such doubtful profit Her mother might have made inquiries and have discovered that this missus d Urberville was a lady of unequalled virtues and charity But Tess s pride made the part of poor relation one of particular distaste to her I d rather try to get work she murmured Durbeyfield you can settle it said his wife turning to where he sat in the background If you say she ought to go she will go I don t like my children going and making themselves beholden to strange kin murmured he I m the head of the noblest branch o the family and I ought to live up to it His reasons for staying away were worse to Tess than her own objections to going Well as I killed the horse mother she said mournfully I suppose I ought to do something I don t mind going and seeing her but you must leave it to me about asking for help And don t go thinking about her making a match for me it is silly Very well said Tess observed her father sententiously Who said I had such a thought asked Joan I fancy it is in your mind mother But I ll go Rising early next day she walked to the hill town called Shaston and there took advantage of a van which twice in the week ran from Shaston eastward to Chaseborough passing near Trantridge the parish in which the vague and mysterious missus d Urberville had her residence Tess Durbeyfield s route on this memorable morning lay amid the north eastern undulations of the Vale in which she had been born and in which her life had unfolded The Vale of Blackmoor was to her the world and its inhabitants the races thereof From the gates and stiles of Marlott she had looked down its length in the wondering days of infancy and what had been mystery to her then was not much less than mystery to her now She had seen daily from her chamber window towers villages faint white mansions above all the town of Shaston standing majestically on its height its windows shining like lamps in the evening sun She had hardly ever visited the place only a small tract even of the Vale and its environs being known to her by close inspection Much less had she been far outside the valley Every contour of the surrounding hills was as personal to her as that of her relatives faces but for what lay beyond her judgment was dependent on the teaching of the village school where she had held a leading place at the time of her leaving a year or two before this date In those early days she had been much loved by others of her own sex and age and had used to be seen about the village as one of three all nearly of the same year walking home from school side by side Tess the middle one in a pink print pinafore of a finely reticulated pattern worn over a stuff frock that had lost its original colour for a nondescript tertiary marching on upon long stalky legs in tight stockings which had little ladder like holes at the knees torn by kneeling in the roads and banks in search of vegetable and mineral treasures her then earth coloured hair hanging like pot hooks the arms of the two outside girls resting round the waist of Tess her arms on the shoulders of the two supporters As Tess grew older and began to see how matters stood she felt quite a Malthusian towards her mother for thoughtlessly giving her so many little sisters and brothers when it was such a trouble to nurse and provide for them Her mother s intelligence was that of a happy child Joan Durbeyfield was simply an additional one and that not the eldest to her own long family of waiters on Providence However Tess became humanely beneficent towards the small ones and to help them as much as possible she used as soon as she left school to lend a hand at haymaking or harvesting on neighbouring farms or by preference at milking or butter making processes which she had learnt when her father had owned cows and being deft fingered it was a kind of work in which she excelled Every day seemed to throw upon her young shoulders more of the family burdens and that Tess should be the representative of the Durbeyfields at the d Urberville mansion came as a thing of course In this instance it must be admitted that the Durbeyfields were putting their fairest side outward She alighted from the van at Trantridge Cross and ascended on foot a hill in the direction of the district known as The Chase on the borders of which as she had been informed missus d Urberville s seat The Slopes would be found It was not a manorial home in the ordinary sense with fields and pastures and a grumbling farmer out of whom the owner had to squeeze an income for himself and his family by hook or by crook It was more far more a country house built for enjoyment pure and simple with not an acre of troublesome land attached to it beyond what was required for residential purposes and for a little fancy farm kept in hand by the owner and tended by a bailiff The crimson brick lodge came first in sight up to its eaves in dense evergreens Tess thought this was the mansion itself till passing through the side wicket with some trepidation and onward to a point at which the drive took a turn the house proper stood in full view It was of recent erection indeed almost new and of the same rich red colour that formed such a contrast with the evergreens of the lodge Far behind the corner of the house which rose like a geranium bloom against the subdued colours around stretched the soft azure landscape of The Chase a truly venerable tract of forest land one of the few remaining woodlands in England of undoubted primaeval date wherein Druidical mistletoe was still found on aged oaks and where enormous yew trees not planted by the hand of man grew as they had grown when they were pollarded for bows All this sylvan antiquity however though visible from The Slopes was outside the immediate boundaries of the estate Everything on this snug property was bright thriving and well kept acres of glass houses stretched down the inclines to the copses at their feet Everything looked like money like the last coin issued from the Mint The stables partly screened by Austrian pines and evergreen oaks and fitted with every late appliance were as dignified as Chapels of Ease On the extensive lawn stood an ornamental tent its door being towards her Simple Tess Durbeyfield stood at gaze in a half alarmed attitude on the edge of the gravel sweep Her feet had brought her onward to this point before she had quite realized where she was and now all was contrary to her expectation I thought we were an old family but this is all new she said in her artlessness She wished that she had not fallen in so readily with her mother s plans for claiming kin and had endeavoured to gain assistance nearer home The d Urbervilles or Stoke d Urbervilles as they at first called themselves who owned all this were a somewhat unusual family to find in such an old fashioned part of the country Parson Tringham had spoken truly when he said that our shambling John Durbeyfield was the only really lineal representative of the old d Urberville family existing in the county or near it he might have added what he knew very well that the Stoke d Urbervilles were no more d Urbervilles of the true tree then he was himself Yet it must be admitted that this family formed a very good stock whereon to regraft a name which sadly wanted such renovation When old mister Simon Stoke latterly deceased had made his fortune as an honest merchant some said money lender in the North he decided to settle as a county man in the South of England out of hail of his business district and in doing this he felt the necessity of recommencing with a name that would not too readily identify him with the smart tradesman of the past and that would be less commonplace than the original bald stark words Conning for an hour in the British Museum the pages of works devoted to extinct half extinct obscured and ruined families appertaining to the quarter of England in which he proposed to settle he considered that d Urberville looked and sounded as well as any of them and d Urberville accordingly was annexed to his own name for himself and his heirs eternally Yet he was not an extravagant minded man in this and in constructing his family tree on the new basis was duly reasonable in framing his inter marriages and aristocratic links never inserting a single title above a rank of strict moderation Of this work of imagination poor Tess and her parents were naturally in ignorance much to their discomfiture indeed the very possibility of such annexations was unknown to them who supposed that though to be well favoured might be the gift of fortune a family name came by nature Tess still stood hesitating like a bather about to make his plunge hardly knowing whether to retreat or to persevere when a figure came forth from the dark triangular door of the tent It was that of a tall young man smoking He had an almost swarthy complexion with full lips badly moulded though red and smooth above which was a well groomed black moustache with curled points though his age could not be more than three or four and twenty Despite the touches of barbarism in his contours there was a singular force in the gentleman s face and in his bold rolling eye Well my Beauty what can I do for you said he coming forward And perceiving that she stood quite confounded Never mind me I am mister d Urberville Have you come to see me or my mother This embodiment of a d Urberville and a namesake differed even more from what Tess had expected than the house and grounds had differed She had dreamed of an aged and dignified face the sublimation of all the d Urberville lineaments furrowed with incarnate memories representing in hieroglyphic the centuries of her family s and England s history But she screwed herself up to the work in hand since she could not get out of it and answered I came to see your mother sir I am afraid you cannot see her she is an invalid replied the present representative of the spurious house for this was mister Alec the only son of the lately deceased gentleman Cannot I answer your purpose What is the business you wish to see her about It isn t business it is I can hardly say what Pleasure Oh no Why sir if I tell you it will seem Tess s sense of a certain ludicrousness in her errand was now so strong that notwithstanding her awe of him and her general discomfort at being here her rosy lips curved towards a smile much to the attraction of the swarthy Alexander It is so very foolish she stammered I fear can t tell you Never mind I like foolish things Try again my dear said he kindly Mother asked me to come Tess continued and indeed I was in the mind to do so myself likewise But I did not think it would be like this I came sir to tell you that we are of the same family as you Ho Poor relations Yes Stokes No d Urbervilles Ay ay I mean d Urbervilles Our names are worn away to Durbeyfield but we have several proofs that we are d Urbervilles Antiquarians hold we are and and we have an old seal marked with a ramping lion on a shield and a castle over him And we have a very old silver spoon round in the bowl like a little ladle and marked with the same castle But it is so worn that mother uses it to stir the pea soup A castle argent is certainly my crest said he blandly And my arms a lion rampant And so mother said we ought to make ourselves beknown to you as we ve lost our horse by a bad accident and are the oldest branch o the family Very kind of your mother I m sure And I for one don t regret her step Alec looked at Tess as he spoke in a way that made her blush a little And so my pretty girl you ve come on a friendly visit to us as relations I suppose I have faltered Tess looking uncomfortable again Well there s no harm in it Where do you live What are you She gave him brief particulars and responding to further inquiries told him that she was intending to go back by the same carrier who had brought her It is a long while before he returns past Trantridge Cross Supposing we walk round the grounds to pass the time my pretty Coz Tess wished to abridge her visit as much as possible but the young man was pressing and she consented to accompany him He conducted her about the lawns and flower beds and conservatories and thence to the fruit garden and greenhouses where he asked her if she liked strawberries Yes said Tess when they come They are already here D Urberville began gathering specimens of the fruit for her handing them back to her as he stooped and presently selecting a specially fine product of the British Queen variety he stood up and held it by the stem to her mouth No no she said quickly putting her fingers between his hand and her lips I would rather take it in my own hand Nonsense he insisted and in a slight distress she parted her lips and took it in They had spent some time wandering desultorily thus Tess eating in a half pleased half reluctant state whatever d Urberville offered her When she could consume no more of the strawberries he filled her little basket with them and then the two passed round to the rose trees whence he gathered blossoms and gave her to put in her bosom She obeyed like one in a dream and when she could affix no more he himself tucked a bud or two into her hat and heaped her basket with others in the prodigality of his bounty At last looking at his watch he said Now by the time you have had something to eat it will be time for you to leave if you want to catch the carrier to Shaston Come here and I ll see what grub I can find Stoke d Urberville took her back to the lawn and into the tent where he left her soon reappearing with a basket of light luncheon which he put before her himself It was evidently the gentleman s wish not to be disturbed in this pleasant tete a tete by the servantry Do you mind my smoking he asked Oh not at all sir He watched her pretty and unconscious munching through the skeins of smoke that pervaded the tent and Tess Durbeyfield did not divine as she innocently looked down at the roses in her bosom that there behind the blue narcotic haze was potentially the tragic mischief of her drama one who stood fair to be the blood red ray in the spectrum of her young life She had an attribute which amounted to a disadvantage just now and it was this that caused Alec d Urberville s eyes to rivet themselves upon her It was a luxuriance of aspect a fulness of growth which made her appear more of a woman than she really was She had inherited the feature from her mother without the quality it denoted It had troubled her mind occasionally till her companions had said that it was a fault which time would cure She soon had finished her lunch Now I am going home sir she said rising And what do they call you he asked as he accompanied her along the drive till they were out of sight of the house Tess Durbeyfield down at Marlott And you say your people have lost their horse I killed him she answered her eyes filling with tears as she gave particulars of Prince s death And I don t know what to do for father on account of it I must think if I cannot do something My mother must find a berth for you But Tess no nonsense about d Urberville Durbeyfield only you know quite another name I wish for no better sir said she with something of dignity For a moment only for a moment when they were in the turning of the drive between the tall rhododendrons and conifers before the lodge became visible he inclined his face towards her as if but no he thought better of it and let her go Thus the thing began Had she perceived this meeting s import she might have asked why she was doomed to be seen and coveted that day by the wrong man and not

Nature does not often say See to her poor creature at a time when seeing can lead to happy doing or reply Here to a body s cry of Where till the hide and seek has become an irksome outworn game We may wonder whether at the acme and summit of the human progress these anachronisms will be corrected by a finer intuition a closer interaction of the social machinery than that which now jolts us round and along but such completeness is not to be prophesied or even conceived as possible Enough that in the present case as in millions it was not the two halves of a perfect whole that confronted each other at the perfect moment a missing counterpart wandered independently about the earth waiting in crass obtuseness till the late time came Out of which maladroit delay sprang anxieties disappointments shocks catastrophes and passing strange destinies When d Urberville got back to the tent he sat down astride on a chair reflecting with a pleased gleam in his face Then he broke into a loud laugh Well I m damned What a funny thing Ha ha ha And what a crumby girl VI Tess went down the hill to Trantridge Cross and inattentively waited to take her seat in the van returning from Chaseborough to Shaston 
1331-155890-0000	train-other-500	She did not know what the other occupants said to her as she entered though she answered them and when they had started anew she rode along with an inward and not an outward eye
1331-155890-0001	train-other-500	One among her fellow travellers addressed her more pointedly than any had spoken before Why you be quite a posy And such roses in early June
1331-155890-0002	train-other-500	Then she became aware of the spectacle she presented to their surprised vision roses at her breasts roses in her hat roses and strawberries in her basket to the brim She blushed
1331-155890-0003	train-other-500	and said confusedly that the flowers had been given to her When the passengers were not looking she stealthily removed the more prominent blooms from her hat and placed them in the basket where she covered them with her handkerchief
1331-155890-0004	train-other-500	Then she fell to reflecting again and in looking downwards a thorn of the rose remaining in her breast accidentally pricked her chin
none	none	 Like all the cottagers in Blackmoor Vale 
1331-155890-0005	train-other-500	Tess was steeped in fancies and prefigurative superstitions she thought this an ill omen the first she had noticed that day
none	none	 The van travelled only so far as Shaston 
1331-155890-0006	train-other-500	and there were several miles of pedestrian descent from that mountain town into the vale to Marlott Her mother had advised her to stay here for the night at the house of a cottage woman they knew if she should feel too tired to come on
1331-155890-0007	train-other-500	and this Tess did not descending to her home till the following afternoon When she entered the house she perceived in a moment from her mother s triumphant manner that something had occurred in the interim
none	none	 Oh yes I know all about it 
1331-155890-0008	train-other-500	I told ee it would be all right and now tis proved Since I ve been away What has said Tess rather wearily Her mother surveyed the girl up and down with arch approval and went on banteringly
1331-155890-0009	train-other-500	So you ve brought em round How do you know mother I ve had a letter Tess then remembered that there would have been time for this They say missus d Urberville says
1331-155890-0010	train-other-500	that she wants you to look after a little fowl farm which is her hobby But this is only her artful way of getting ee there without raising your hopes
none	none	 She s going to own ee as kin that s the meaning o t 
1331-155890-0011	train-other-500	But I didn t see her You zid somebody I suppose I saw her son And did he own ee Well he called me Coz
none	none	 An I knew it Jacky he called her Coz 
1331-155890-0012	train-other-500	cried Joan to her husband Well he spoke to his mother of course and she do want ee there But I don t know that I am apt at tending fowls said the dubious Tess
1331-155890-0013	train-other-500	Then I don t know who is apt You ve be n born in the business and brought up in it They that be born in a business always know more about it than any prentice Besides
1331-155890-0014	train-other-500	that s only just a show of something for you to do that you midn t feel beholden I don t altogether think I ought to go said Tess thoughtfully Who wrote the letter
none	none	 Will you let me look at it missus d Urberville wrote it Here it is 
1331-155890-0015	train-other-500	The letter was in the third person and briefly informed missus Durbeyfield that her daughter s services would be useful to that lady in the management of her poultry farm
1331-155890-0016	train-other-500	that a comfortable room would be provided for her if she could come and that the wages would be on a liberal scale if they liked her Oh that s all said Tess
none	none	 You couldn t expect her to throw her arms round ee an to kiss and to coll ee all at once 
1331-155890-0017	train-other-500	Tess looked out of the window I would rather stay here with father and you she said
none	none	 But why 
1331-155890-0018	train-other-500	I d rather not tell you why mother indeed I don t quite know why A week afterwards she came in one evening from an unavailing search for some light occupation in the immediate neighbourhood
1331-155890-0019	train-other-500	Her idea had been to get together sufficient money during the summer to purchase another horse Hardly had she crossed the threshold before one of the children danced across the room saying The gentleman s been here
1331-155890-0020	train-other-500	Her mother hastened to explain smiles breaking from every inch of her person missus d Urberville s son had called on horseback having been riding by chance in the direction of Marlott
1331-155890-0021	train-other-500	He had wished to know finally in the name of his mother if Tess could really come to manage the old lady s fowl farm or not
none	none	 the lad who had hitherto superintended the birds having proved untrustworthy 
1331-155890-0022	train-other-500	mister d Urberville says you must be a good girl if you are at all as you appear he knows you must be worth your weight in gold He is very much interested in ee truth to tell
none	none	 Tess seemed for the moment really pleased to hear that she had won such high opinion from a stranger when 
1331-155890-0023	train-other-500	in her own esteem she had sunk so low It is very good of him to think that she murmured and if I was quite sure how it would be living there I would go any when
1331-155890-0024	train-other-500	He is a mighty handsome man I don t think so said Tess coldly Well there s your chance whether or no and I m sure he wears a beautiful diamond ring
1331-155890-0025	train-other-500	Yes said little Abraham brightly from the window bench and I seed it and it did twinkle when he put his hand up to his mistarshers Mother
none	none	 why did our grand relation keep on putting his hand up to his mistarshers 
1331-155890-0026	train-other-500	Hark at that child cried missus Durbeyfield with parenthetic admiration
none	none	 Perhaps to show his diamond ring murmured Sir John dreamily from his chair 
1331-155890-0027	train-other-500	I ll think it over said Tess leaving the room Well she s made a conquest o the younger branch of us straight off continued the matron to her husband and she s a fool if she don t follow it up
1331-155890-0028	train-other-500	I don t quite like my children going away from home said the haggler As the head of the family the rest ought to come to me But do let her go Jacky
none	none	 coaxed his poor witless wife He s struck wi her 
1331-155890-0029	train-other-500	you can see that He called her Coz He ll marry her most likely and make a lady of her and then she ll be what her forefathers was John Durbeyfield had more conceit than energy or health
1331-155890-0030	train-other-500	and this supposition was pleasant to him Well perhaps that s what young mister d Urberville means he admitted and sure enough he mid have serious thoughts about improving his blood
none	none	 by linking on to the old line 
1331-155890-0031	train-other-500	Tess the little rogue And have she really paid em a visit to such an end as this Meanwhile Tess was walking thoughtfully among the gooseberry bushes in the garden and over Prince s grave
1331-155890-0032	train-other-500	When she came in her mother pursued her advantage Well what be you going to do she asked I wish I had seen missus d Urberville said Tess
none	none	 I think you mid as well settle it 
1331-155890-0033	train-other-500	Then you ll see her soon enough Her father coughed in his chair
none	none	 I don t know what to say answered the girl restlessly 
1331-155890-0034	train-other-500	It is for you to decide I killed the old horse and I suppose I ought to do something to get ye a new one
none	none	 But but I don t quite like mister d Urberville being there The children who had made use of this idea of Tess being taken up by their wealthy kinsfolk 
1331-155890-0035	train-other-500	which they imagined the other family to be as a species of dolorifuge after the death of the horse began to cry at Tess s reluctance and teased and reproached her for hesitating
1331-155890-0036	train-other-500	Tess won t go o o and be made a la a dy of no she says she wo o on t they wailed with square mouths And we shan t have a nice new horse
none	none	 and lots o golden money to buy fairlings 
1331-155890-0037	train-other-500	And Tess won t look pretty in her best cloze no mo o ore Her mother chimed in to the same tune
1331-155890-0038	train-other-500	a certain way she had of making her labours in the house seem heavier than they were by prolonging them indefinitely also weighed in the argument Her father alone preserved an attitude of neutrality
1331-155890-0039	train-other-500	I will go said Tess at last Her mother could not repress her consciousness of the nuptial vision conjured up by the girl s consent That s right
1331-155890-0040	train-other-500	For such a pretty maid as tis this is a fine chance Tess smiled crossly I hope it is a chance for earning money It is no other kind of chance
none	none	 You had better say nothing of that silly sort about parish 
1331-155890-0041	train-other-500	missus Durbeyfield did not promise She was not quite sure that she did not feel proud enough after the visitor s remarks to say a good deal Thus it was arranged
1331-155890-0042	train-other-500	and the young girl wrote agreeing to be ready to set out on any day on which she might be required She was duly informed that missus d Urberville was glad of her decision
1331-155890-0043	train-other-500	and that a spring cart should be sent to meet her and her luggage at the top of the Vale on the day after the morrow when she must hold herself prepared to start missus d Urberville s handwriting seemed rather masculine
none	none	 A cart murmured Joan Durbeyfield doubtingly 
1331-155890-0044	train-other-500	It might have been a carriage for her own kin Having at last taken her course Tess was less restless and abstracted
1331-155890-0045	train-other-500	going about her business with some self assurance in the thought of acquiring another horse for her father by an occupation which would not be onerous
none	none	 She had hoped to be a teacher at the school but the fates seemed to decide otherwise 
1331-155890-0046	train-other-500	Being mentally older than her mother she did not regard missus Durbeyfield s matrimonial hopes for her in a serious aspect for a moment
none	none	 The light minded woman had been discovering good matches for her daughter almost from the year of her birth VII 
1331-155891-0000	train-other-500	On the morning appointed for her departure Tess was awake before dawn at the marginal minute of the dark when the grove is still mute save for one prophetic bird who sings with a clear voiced conviction
1331-155891-0001	train-other-500	that he at least knows the correct time of day the rest preserving silence as if equally convinced that he is mistaken She remained upstairs packing till breakfast time
1331-155891-0002	train-other-500	and then came down in her ordinary week day clothes her Sunday apparel being carefully folded in her box Her mother expostulated
none	none	 You will never set out to see your folks without dressing up more the dand than that 
1331-155891-0003	train-other-500	But I am going to work said Tess Well yes said missus Durbeyfield and in a private tone at first there mid be a little pretence o t
none	none	 But I think it will be wiser of ee 
1331-155891-0004	train-other-500	to put your best side outward she added Very well I suppose you know best
none	none	 replied Tess with calm abandonment And to please her parent the girl put herself quite in Joan s hands 
1331-155891-0005	train-other-500	saying serenely Do what you like with me mother missus Durbeyfield was only too delighted at this tractability First she fetched a great basin
1331-155891-0006	train-other-500	and washed Tess s hair with such thoroughness that when dried and brushed it looked twice as much as at other times She tied it with a broader pink ribbon than usual
1331-155891-0007	train-other-500	Then she put upon her the white frock that Tess had worn at the club walking
none	none	 the airy fulness of which supplementing her enlarged coiffure imparted to her developing figure an amplitude which belied her age and might cause her to be estimated as a woman when she was not much more than a child 
1331-155891-0008	train-other-500	I declare there s a hole in my stocking heel said Tess
none	none	 Never mind holes in your stockings 
1331-155891-0009	train-other-500	they don t speak When I was a maid so long as I had a pretty bonnet the devil might ha found me in heels Her mother s pride in the girl s appearance led her to step back like a painter from his easel
1331-155891-0010	train-other-500	and survey her work as a whole You must zee yourself she cried
none	none	 It is much better than you was t other day 
1331-155891-0011	train-other-500	As the looking glass was only large enough to reflect a very small portion of Tess s person at one time missus Durbeyfield hung a black cloak outside the casement
none	none	 and so made a large reflector of the panes as it is the wont of bedecking cottagers to do After this she went downstairs to her husband who was sitting in the lower room 
1331-155891-0012	train-other-500	I ll tell ee what tis Durbeyfield
none	none	 said she exultingly 
1331-155891-0013	train-other-500	he ll never have the heart not to love her
none	none	 But whatever you do 
1331-155891-0014	train-other-500	don t zay too much to Tess of his fancy for her and this chance she has got She is such an odd maid that it mid zet her against him or against going there even now If all goes well
none	none	 I shall certainly be for making some return to pa son at Stagfoot Lane for telling us 
1331-155891-0015	train-other-500	dear good man However as the moment for the girl s setting out drew nigh when the first excitement of the dressing had passed off a slight misgiving found place in Joan Durbeyfield s mind
1331-155891-0016	train-other-500	It prompted the matron to say that she would walk a little way as far as to the point where the acclivity from the valley began its first steep ascent to the outer world At the top
none	none	 Tess was going to be met with the spring cart sent by the Stoke d Urbervilles 
1331-155891-0017	train-other-500	and her box had already been wheeled ahead towards this summit by a lad with trucks to be in readiness Seeing their mother put on her bonnet the younger children clamoured to go with her
1331-155891-0018	train-other-500	I do want to walk a little ways wi Sissy now she s going to marry our gentleman cousin and wear fine cloze Now said Tess flushing and turning quickly I ll hear no more o that Mother
1331-155891-0019	train-other-500	how could you ever put such stuff into their heads Going to work my dears for our rich relation
none	none	 and help get enough money for a new horse 
1331-155891-0020	train-other-500	said missus Durbeyfield pacifically Goodbye father said Tess with a lumpy throat
none	none	 Goodbye my maid 
1331-155891-0021	train-other-500	said Sir John raising his head from his breast as he suspended his nap induced by a slight excess this morning in honour of the occasion Well I hope my young friend will like such a comely sample of his own blood And tell n Tess
none	none	 that being sunk quite from our former grandeur 
1331-155891-0022	train-other-500	I ll sell him the title yes sell it and at no onreasonable figure Not for less than a thousand pound cried Lady Durbeyfield Tell n I ll take a thousand pound
1331-155891-0023	train-other-500	Well I ll take less when I come to think o t
none	none	 He ll adorn it better than a poor lammicken feller like myself can Tell n he shall hae it for a hundred 
1331-155891-0024	train-other-500	But I won t stand upon trifles
none	none	 tell n he shall hae it for fifty for twenty pound 
1331-155891-0025	train-other-500	Yes twenty pound that s the lowest Dammy family honour is family honour and I won t take a penny less Tess s eyes were too full and her voice too choked to utter the sentiments that were in her
1331-155891-0026	train-other-500	She turned quickly and went out So the girls and their mother all walked together a child on each side of Tess holding her hand
1331-155891-0027	train-other-500	and looking at her meditatively from time to time as at one who was about to do great things her mother just behind with the smallest the group forming a picture of honest beauty flanked by innocence
none	none	 and backed by simple souled vanity 
1331-155891-0028	train-other-500	They followed the way till they reached the beginning of the ascent on the crest of which the vehicle from Trantridge was to receive her this limit having been fixed to save the horse the labour of the last slope Far away behind the first hills
1331-155891-0029	train-other-500	the cliff like dwellings of Shaston broke the line of the ridge Nobody was visible in the elevated road which skirted the ascent save the lad whom they had sent on before them
1331-155891-0030	train-other-500	sitting on the handle of the barrow that contained all Tess s worldly possessions Bide here a bit and the cart will soon come no doubt said missus Durbeyfield
none	none	 Yes I see it yonder 
1331-155891-0031	train-other-500	It had come appearing suddenly from behind the forehead of the nearest upland and stopping beside the boy with the barrow Her mother and the children thereupon decided to go no farther and bidding them a hasty goodbye
1331-155891-0032	train-other-500	Tess bent her steps up the hill They saw her white shape draw near to the spring cart on which her box was already placed But before she had quite reached it another vehicle shot out from a clump of trees on the summit
1331-155891-0033	train-other-500	came round the bend of the road there passed the luggage cart and halted beside Tess who looked up as if in great surprise Her mother perceived for the first time
1331-155891-0034	train-other-500	that the second vehicle was not a humble conveyance like the first but a spick and span gig or dog cart highly varnished and equipped The driver was a young man of three or four and twenty with a cigar between his teeth
1331-155891-0035	train-other-500	wearing a dandy cap drab jacket breeches of the same hue white neckcloth stick up collar and brown driving gloves
none	none	 in short he was the handsome horsey young buck who had visited Joan a week or two before 
1331-155891-0036	train-other-500	to get her answer about Tess missus Durbeyfield clapped her hands like a child Then she looked down then stared again
none	none	 Could she be deceived as to the meaning of this Is dat the gentleman kinsman 
1331-155891-0037	train-other-500	who ll make Sissy a lady asked the youngest child Meanwhile the muslined form of Tess could be seen standing still undecided beside this turn out whose owner was talking to her Her seeming indecision was in fact
1331-155891-0038	train-other-500	more than indecision it was misgiving She would have preferred the humble cart The young man dismounted and appeared to urge her to ascend She turned her face down the hill to her relatives
1331-155891-0039	train-other-500	and regarded the little group Something seemed to quicken her to a determination possibly the thought that she had killed Prince She suddenly stepped up he mounted beside her and immediately whipped on the horse
1331-155891-0040	train-other-500	In a moment they had passed the slow cart with the box and disappeared behind the shoulder of the hill Directly Tess was out of sight and the interest of the matter as a drama was at an end
none	none	 the little ones eyes filled with tears 
1331-155891-0041	train-other-500	The youngest child said I wish poor poor Tess wasn t gone away to be a lady and lowering the corners of his lips burst out crying The new point of view was infectious
1331-155891-0042	train-other-500	and the next child did likewise and then the next till the whole three of them wailed loud There were tears also in Joan Durbeyfield s eyes as she turned to go home But by the time she had got back to the village
1331-155891-0043	train-other-500	she was passively trusting to the favour of accident However in bed that night she sighed and her husband asked her what was the matter Oh I don t know exactly she said
none	none	 I was thinking that perhaps it would ha been better if Tess had not gone 
1331-155891-0044	train-other-500	Oughtn t ye to have thought of that before Well tis a chance for the maid Still if twere the doing again I wouldn t let her go
none	none	 till I had found out whether the gentleman is really a good hearted young man 
1331-155891-0045	train-other-500	and choice over her as his kinswoman
none	none	 Yes you ought perhaps to ha done that 
1331-155891-0046	train-other-500	snored Sir John Joan Durbeyfield always managed to find consolation somewhere Well as one of the genuine stock she ought to make her way with en if she plays her trump card aright
none	none	 And if he don t marry her afore he will after For that he s all afire wi love for her any eye can see What s her trump card Her d Urberville blood you mean No stupid her face as twas mine VIII 
1331-155892-0000	train-other-500	Having mounted beside her Alec d Urberville drove rapidly along the crest of the first hill chatting compliments to Tess as they went the cart with her box being left far behind Rising still
1331-155892-0001	train-other-500	an immense landscape stretched around them on every side behind the green valley of her birth before a gray country of which she knew nothing except from her first brief visit to Trantridge
1331-155892-0002	train-other-500	Thus they reached the verge of an incline down which the road stretched in a long straight descent of nearly a mile Ever since the accident with her father s horse
none	none	 Tess Durbeyfield courageous as she naturally was 
1331-155892-0003	train-other-500	had been exceedingly timid on wheels the least irregularity of motion startled her She began to get uneasy at a certain recklessness in her conductor s driving
1331-155892-0004	train-other-500	You will go down slow sir I suppose she said with attempted unconcern D Urberville looked round upon her nipped his cigar with the tips of his large white centre teeth
1331-155892-0005	train-other-500	and allowed his lips to smile slowly of themselves Why Tess he answered after another whiff or two it isn t a brave bouncing girl like you who asks that
1331-155892-0006	train-other-500	Why I always go down at full gallop There s nothing like it for raising your spirits But perhaps you need not now Ah he said shaking his head there are two to be reckoned with
none	none	 It is not me alone 
1331-155892-0007	train-other-500	Tib has to be considered and she has a very queer temper Who Why this mare I fancy she looked round at me in a very grim way just then Didn t you notice it Don t try to frighten me sir
1331-155892-0008	train-other-500	said Tess stiffly Well I don t If any living man can manage this horse I can I won t say any living man can do it but if such has the power I am he Why do you have such a horse
1331-155892-0009	train-other-500	Ah well may you ask it It was my fate I suppose Tib has killed one chap and just after I bought her she nearly killed me And then take my word for it I nearly killed her
1331-155892-0010	train-other-500	But she s touchy still very touchy and one s life is hardly safe behind her sometimes They were just beginning to descend and it was evident that the horse whether of her own will or of his
1331-155892-0011	train-other-500	the latter being the more likely knew so well the reckless performance expected of her that she hardly required a hint from behind Down down they sped the wheels humming like a top
1331-155892-0012	train-other-500	the dog cart rocking right and left its axis acquiring a slightly oblique set in relation to the line of progress the figure of the horse rising and falling in undulations before them
1331-155892-0013	train-other-500	Sometimes a wheel was off the ground it seemed for many yards sometimes a stone was sent spinning over the hedge and flinty sparks from the horse s hoofs outshone the daylight
1331-155892-0014	train-other-500	The aspect of the straight road enlarged with their advance the two banks dividing like a splitting stick one rushing past at each shoulder The wind blew through Tess s white muslin to her very skin
1331-155892-0015	train-other-500	and her washed hair flew out behind She was determined to show no open fear but she clutched d Urberville s rein arm Don t touch my arm We shall be thrown out if you do Hold on round my waist
1331-155892-0016	train-other-500	She grasped his waist and so they reached the bottom Safe thank God in spite of your fooling said she her face on fire
none	none	 Tess fie that s temper 
1331-155892-0017	train-other-500	said d Urberville Tis truth
none	none	 Well you need not let go your hold of me so thanklessly the moment you feel yourself our of danger 
1331-155892-0018	train-other-500	She had not considered what she had been doing whether he were man or woman stick or stone in her involuntary hold on him Recovering her reserve she sat without replying
1331-155892-0019	train-other-500	and thus they reached the summit of another declivity Now then again said d Urberville No no said Tess Show more sense do please
none	none	 But when people find themselves on one of the highest points in the county 
1331-155892-0020	train-other-500	they must get down again he retorted He loosened rein and away they went a second time D Urberville turned his face to her as they rocked and said in playful raillery
1331-155892-0021	train-other-500	Now then put your arms round my waist again as you did before my Beauty Never said Tess independently holding on as well as she could without touching him Let me put one little kiss on those holmberry lips Tess
1331-155892-0022	train-other-500	or even on that warmed cheek and I ll stop on my honour I will Tess surprised beyond measure slid farther back still on her seat at which he urged the horse anew and rocked her the more
1331-155892-0023	train-other-500	Will nothing else do she cried at length in desperation her large eyes staring at him like those of a wild animal This dressing her up so prettily by her mother had apparently been to lamentable purpose
1331-155892-0024	train-other-500	Nothing dear Tess he replied Oh I don t know very well I don t mind she panted miserably He drew rein and as they slowed he was on the point of imprinting the desired salute
none	none	 when as if hardly yet aware of her own modesty 
1331-155892-0025	train-other-500	she dodged aside His arms being occupied with the reins there was left him no power to prevent her manoeuvre Now damn it I ll break both our necks swore her capriciously passionate companion
1331-155892-0026	train-other-500	So you can go from your word like that you young witch can you Very well said Tess I ll not move since you be so determined But I thought you would be kind to me and protect me as my kinsman
1331-155892-0027	train-other-500	Kinsman be hanged Now But I don t want anybody to kiss me sir she implored a big tear beginning to roll down her face
none	none	 and the corners of her mouth trembling in her attempts not to cry And I wouldn t ha come if I had known 
1331-155892-0028	train-other-500	He was inexorable and she sat still and d Urberville gave her the kiss of mastery No sooner had he done so than she flushed with shame took out her handkerchief
1331-155892-0029	train-other-500	and wiped the spot on her cheek that had been touched by his lips His ardour was nettled at the sight for the act on her part had been unconsciously done You are mighty sensitive for a cottage girl said the young man
1331-155892-0030	train-other-500	Tess made no reply to this remark of which indeed she did not quite comprehend the drift unheeding the snub she had administered by her instinctive rub upon her cheek She had in fact undone the kiss as far as such a thing was physically possible
1331-155892-0031	train-other-500	With a dim sense that he was vexed she looked steadily ahead as they trotted on near Melbury Down and Wingreen till she saw to her consternation that there was yet another descent to be undergone
none	none	 You shall be made sorry for that 
1331-155892-0032	train-other-500	he resumed his injured tone still remaining as he flourished the whip anew Unless that is you agree willingly to let me do it again and no handkerchief She sighed Very well sir she said
1331-155892-0033	train-other-500	Oh let me get my hat At the moment of speaking her hat had blown off into the road their present speed on the upland being by no means slow D Urberville pulled up and said he would get it for her
1331-155892-0034	train-other-500	but Tess was down on the other side She turned back and picked up the article You look prettier with it off upon my soul if that s possible he said contemplating her over the back of the vehicle Now then up again
1331-155892-0035	train-other-500	What s the matter The hat was in place and tied but Tess had not stepped forward No sir she said revealing the red and ivory of her mouth as her eye lit in defiant triumph not again
1331-155892-0036	train-other-500	if I know it What you won t get up beside me No I shall walk
none	none	 Tis five or six miles yet to Trantridge 
1331-155892-0037	train-other-500	I don t care if tis dozens Besides the cart is behind You artful hussy Now tell me didn t you make that hat blow off on purpose I ll swear you did Her strategic silence confirmed his suspicion
none	none	 Then d Urberville cursed and swore at her and called her everything he could think of for the trick Turning the horse suddenly he tried to drive back upon her and so hem her in between the gig and the hedge 
1331-155892-0038	train-other-500	But he could not do this short of injuring her You ought to be ashamed of yourself for using such wicked words cried Tess with spirit from the top of the hedge into which she had scrambled I don t like ee at all I hate and detest you
1331-155892-0039	train-other-500	I ll go back to mother I will D Urberville s bad temper cleared up at sight of hers and he laughed heartily Well I like you all the better he said Come let there be peace
1331-155892-0040	train-other-500	I ll never do it any more against your will My life upon it now
none	none	 Still Tess could not be induced to remount 
1331-155892-0041	train-other-500	She did not however object to his keeping his gig alongside her and in this manner at a slow pace they advanced towards the village of Trantridge From time to time d Urberville exhibited a sort of fierce distress
1331-155892-0042	train-other-500	at the sight of the tramping he had driven her to undertake by his misdemeanour She might in truth have safely trusted him now but he had forfeited her confidence for the time and she kept on the ground progressing thoughtfully
1331-155892-0043	train-other-500	as if wondering whether it would be wiser to return home Her resolve however had been taken
none	none	 and it seemed vacillating even to childishness to abandon it now 
1331-155892-0044	train-other-500	unless for graver reasons How could she face her parents get back her box and disconcert the whole scheme for the rehabilitation of her family on such sentimental grounds
none	none	 A few minutes later the chimneys of The Slopes appeared in view and in a snug nook to the right the poultry farm and cottage of Tess destination IX The community of fowls to which Tess had been appointed as supervisor purveyor nurse surgeon and friend made its headquarters in an old thatched cottage standing in an enclosure that had once been a garden but was now a trampled and sanded square The house was overrun with ivy its chimney being enlarged by the boughs of the parasite to the aspect of a ruined tower The lower rooms were entirely given over to the birds who walked about them with a proprietary air as though the place had been built by themselves and not by certain dusty copyholders who now lay east and west in the churchyard The descendants of these bygone owners felt it almost as a slight to their family when the house which had so much of their affection had cost so much of their forefathers money and had been in their possession for several generations before the d Urbervilles came and built here was indifferently turned into a fowl house by missus Stoke d Urberville as soon as the property fell into hand according to law Twas good enough for Christians in grandfather s time they said The rooms wherein dozens of infants had wailed at their nursing now resounded with the tapping of nascent chicks Distracted hens in coops occupied spots where formerly stood chairs supporting sedate agriculturists The chimney corner and once blazing hearth was now filled with inverted beehives in which the hens laid their eggs while out of doors the plots that each succeeding householder had carefully shaped with his spade were torn by the cocks in wildest fashion The garden in which the cottage stood was surrounded by a wall and could only be entered through a door When Tess had occupied herself about an hour the next morning in altering and improving the arrangements according to her skilled ideas as the daughter of a professed poulterer the door in the wall opened and a servant in white cap and apron entered She had come from the manor house missus d Urberville wants the fowls as usual she said but perceiving that Tess did not quite understand she explained Mis ess is a old lady and blind Blind said Tess Almost before her misgiving at the news could find time to shape itself she took under her companion s direction two of the most beautiful of the Hamburghs in her arms and followed the maid servant who had likewise taken two to the adjacent mansion which though ornate and imposing showed traces everywhere on this side that some occupant of its chambers could bend to the love of dumb creatures feathers floating within view of the front and hen coops standing on the grass In a sitting room on the ground floor ensconced in an armchair with her back to the light was the owner and mistress of the estate a white haired woman of not more than sixty or even less wearing a large cap She had the mobile face frequent in those whose sight has decayed by stages has been laboriously striven after and reluctantly let go rather than the stagnant mien apparent in persons long sightless or born blind Tess walked up to this lady with her feathered charges one sitting on each arm Ah you are the young woman come to look after my birds said missus d Urberville recognizing a new footstep I hope you will be kind to them My bailiff tells me you are quite the proper person Well where are they Ah this is Strut But he is hardly so lively to day is he He is alarmed at being handled by a stranger I suppose And Phena too yes they are a little frightened aren t you dears But they will soon get used to you While the old lady had been speaking Tess and the other maid in obedience to her gestures had placed the fowls severally in her lap and she had felt them over from head to tail examining their beaks their combs the manes of the cocks their wings and their claws Her touch enabled her to recognize them in a moment and to discover if a single feather were crippled or draggled She handled their crops and knew what they had eaten and if too little or too much her face enacting a vivid pantomime of the criticisms passing in her mind The birds that the two girls had brought in were duly returned to the yard and the process was repeated till all the pet cocks and hens had been submitted to the old woman Hamburghs Bantams Cochins Brahmas Dorkings and such other sorts as were in fashion just then her perception of each visitor being seldom at fault as she received the bird upon her knees It reminded Tess of a Confirmation in which missus d Urberville was the bishop the fowls the young people presented and herself and the maid servant the parson and curate of the parish bringing them up At the end of the ceremony missus d Urberville abruptly asked Tess wrinkling and twitching her face into undulations Can you whistle Whistle Ma am Yes whistle tunes Tess could whistle like most other country girls though the accomplishment was one which she did not care to profess in genteel company However she blandly admitted that such was the fact Then you will have to practise it every day I had a lad who did it very well but he has left I want you to whistle to my bullfinches as I cannot see them I like to hear them and we teach em airs that way Tell her where the cages are Elizabeth You must begin to morrow or they will go back in their piping They have been neglected these several days mister d Urberville whistled to em this morning ma am said Elizabeth He Pooh The old lady s face creased into furrows of repugnance and she made no further reply Thus the reception of Tess by her fancied kinswoman terminated and the birds were taken back to their quarters The girl s surprise at missus d Urberville s manner was not great for since seeing the size of the house she had expected no more But she was far from being aware that the old lady had never heard a word of the so called kinship She gathered that no great affection flowed between the blind woman and her son But in that too she was mistaken missus d Urberville was not the first mother compelled to love her offspring resentfully and to be bitterly fond In spite of the unpleasant initiation of the day before Tess inclined to the freedom and novelty of her new position in the morning when the sun shone now that she was once installed there and she was curious to test her powers in the unexpected direction asked of her so as to ascertain her chance of retaining her post As soon as she was alone within the walled garden she sat herself down on a coop and seriously screwed up her mouth for the long neglected practice She found her former ability to have degenerated to the production of a hollow rush of wind through the lips and no clear note at all She remained fruitlessly blowing and blowing wondering how she could have so grown out of the art which had come by nature till she became aware of a movement among the ivy boughs which cloaked the garden wall no less then the cottage Looking that way she beheld a form springing from the coping to the plot It was Alec d Urberville whom she had not set eyes on since he had conducted her the day before to the door of the gardener s cottage where she had lodgings Upon my honour cried he there was never before such a beautiful thing in Nature or Art as you look Cousin Tess Cousin had a faint ring of mockery I have been watching you from over the wall sitting like IM patience on a monument and pouting up that pretty red mouth to whistling shape and whooing and whooing and privately swearing and never being able to produce a note Why you are quite cross because you can t do it I may be cross but I didn t swear Ah I understand why you are trying those bullies My mother wants you to carry on their musical education How selfish of her As if attending to these curst cocks and hens here were not enough work for any girl I would flatly refuse if I were you But she wants me particularly to do it and to be ready by to morrow morning Does she Well then I ll give you a lesson or two Oh no you won t said Tess withdrawing towards the door Nonsense I don t want to touch you See I ll stand on this side of the wire netting and you can keep on the other so you may feel quite safe Now look here you screw up your lips too harshly There tis so He suited the action to the word and whistled a line of Take O take those lips away But the allusion was lost upon Tess Now try said d Urberville She attempted to look reserved her face put on a sculptural severity But he persisted in his demand and at last to get rid of him she did put up her lips as directed for producing a clear note laughing distressfully however and then blushing with vexation that she had laughed He encouraged her with Try again Tess was quite serious painfully serious by this time and she tried ultimately and unexpectedly emitting a real round sound The momentary pleasure of success got the better of her her eyes enlarged and she involuntarily smiled in his face That s it Now I have started you you ll go on beautifully There I said I would not come near you and in spite of such temptation as never before fell to mortal man I ll keep my word Tess do you think my mother a queer old soul I don t know much of her yet sir You ll find her so she must be to make you learn to whistle to her bullfinches I am rather out of her books just now but you will be quite in favour if you treat her live stock well Good morning If you meet with any difficulties and want help here don t go to the bailiff come to me It was in the economy of this regime that Tess Durbeyfield had undertaken to fill a place Her first day s experiences were fairly typical of those which followed through many succeeding days A familiarity with Alec d Urberville s presence which that young man carefully cultivated in her by playful dialogue and by jestingly calling her his cousin when they were alone removed much of her original shyness of him without however implanting any feeling which could engender shyness of a new and tenderer kind But she was more pliable under his hands than a mere companionship would have made her owing to her unavoidable dependence upon his mother and through that lady s comparative helplessness upon him She soon found that whistling to the bullfinches in missus d Urberville s room was no such onerous business when she had regained the art for she had caught from her musical mother numerous airs that suited those songsters admirably A far more satisfactory time than when she practised in the garden was this whistling by the cages each morning Unrestrained by the young man s presence she threw up her mouth put her lips near the bars and piped away in easeful grace to the attentive listeners missus d Urberville slept in a large four post bedstead hung with heavy damask curtains and the bullfinches occupied the same apartment where they flitted about freely at certain hours and made little white spots on the furniture and upholstery Once while Tess was at the window where the cages were ranged giving her lesson as usual she thought she heard a rustling behind the bed The old lady was not present and turning round the girl had an impression that the toes of a pair of boots were visible below the fringe of the curtains Thereupon her whistling became so disjointed that the listener if such there were must have discovered her suspicion of his presence She searched the curtains every morning after that but never found anybody within them Alec d Urberville had evidently thought better of his freak to terrify her by an ambush of that kind X Every village has its idiosyncrasy its constitution often its own code of morality The levity of some of the younger women in and about Trantridge was marked and was perhaps symptomatic of the choice spirit who ruled The Slopes in that vicinity The place had also a more abiding defect it drank hard The staple conversation on the farms around was on the uselessness of saving money and smock frocked arithmeticians leaning on their ploughs or hoes would enter into calculations of great nicety to prove that parish relief was a fuller provision for a man in his old age than any which could result from savings out of their wages during a whole lifetime The chief pleasure of these philosophers lay in going every Saturday night when work was done to Chaseborough a decayed market town two or three miles distant and returning in the small hours of the next morning to spend Sunday in sleeping off the dyspeptic effects of the curious compounds sold to them as beer by the monopolizers of the once independent inns For a long time Tess did not join in the weekly pilgrimages But under pressure from matrons not much older than herself for a field man s wages being as high at twenty one as at forty marriage was early here Tess at length consented to go Her first experience of the journey afforded her more enjoyment than she had expected the hilariousness of the others being quite contagious after her monotonous attention to the poultry farm all the week She went again and again Being graceful and interesting standing moreover on the momentary threshold of womanhood her appearance drew down upon her some sly regards from loungers in the streets of Chaseborough hence though sometimes her journey to the town was made independently she always searched for her fellows at nightfall to have the protection of their companionship homeward This had gone on for a month or two when there came a Saturday in September on which a fair and a market coincided and the pilgrims from Trantridge sought double delights at the inns on that account Tess s occupations made her late in setting out so that her comrades reached the town long before her It was a fine September evening just before sunset when yellow lights struggle with blue shades in hairlike lines and the atmosphere itself forms a prospect without aid from more solid objects except the innumerable winged insects that dance in it Through this low lit mistiness Tess walked leisurely along She did not discover the coincidence of the market with the fair till she had reached the place by which time it was close upon dusk Her limited marketing was soon completed and then as usual she began to look about for some of the Trantridge cottagers At first she could not find them and she was informed that most of them had gone to what they called a private little jig at the house of a hay trusser and peat dealer who had transactions with their farm He lived in an out of the way nook of the townlet and in trying to find her course thither her eyes fell upon mister d Urberville standing at a street corner What my Beauty You here so late he said She told him that she was simply waiting for company homeward I ll see you again said he over her shoulder as she went on down the back lane Approaching the hay trussers she could hear the fiddled notes of a reel proceeding from some building in the rear but no sound of dancing was audible an exceptional state of things for these parts where as a rule the stamping drowned the music The front door being open she could see straight through the house into the garden at the back as far as the shades of night would allow and nobody appearing to her knock she traversed the dwelling and went up the path to the outhouse whence the sound had attracted her It was a windowless erection used for storage and from the open door there floated into the obscurity a mist of yellow radiance which at first Tess thought to be illuminated smoke But on drawing nearer she perceived that it was a cloud of dust lit by candles within the outhouse whose beams upon the haze carried forward the outline of the doorway into the wide night of the garden When she came close and looked in she beheld indistinct forms racing up and down to the figure of the dance the silence of their footfalls arising from their being overshoe in scroff that is to say the powdery residuum from the storage of peat and other products the stirring of which by their turbulent feet created the nebulosity that involved the scene Through this floating fusty debris of peat and hay mixed with the perspirations and warmth of the dancers and forming together a sort of vegeto human pollen the muted fiddles feebly pushed their notes in marked contrast to the spirit with which the measure was trodden out They coughed as they danced and laughed as they coughed Of the rushing couples there could barely be discerned more than the high lights the indistinctness shaping them to satyrs clasping nymphs a multiplicity of Pans whirling a multiplicity of Syrinxes Lotis attempting to elude Priapus and always failing At intervals a couple would approach the doorway for air and the haze no longer veiling their features the demigods resolved themselves into the homely personalities of her own next door neighbours Could Trantridge in two or three short hours have metamorphosed itself thus madly Some Sileni of the throng sat on benches and hay trusses by the wall and one of them recognized her The maids don t think it respectable to dance at The Flower de Luce he explained They don t like to let everybody see which be their fancy men Besides the house sometimes shuts up just when their jints begin to get greased So we come here and send out for liquor But when be any of you going home asked Tess with some anxiety Now a most directly This is all but the last jig She waited The reel drew to a close and some of the party were in the mind of starting But others would not and another dance was formed This surely would end it thought Tess But it merged in yet another She became restless and uneasy yet having waited so long it was necessary to wait longer on account of the fair the roads were dotted with roving characters of possibly ill intent and though not fearful of measurable dangers she feared the unknown Had she been near Marlott she would have had less dread Don t ye be nervous my dear good soul expostulated between his coughs a young man with a wet face and his straw hat so far back upon his head that the brim encircled it like the nimbus of a saint What s yer hurry To morrow is Sunday thank God and we can sleep it off in church time Now have a turn with me She did not abhor dancing but she was not going to dance here The movement grew more passionate the fiddlers behind the luminous pillar of cloud now and then varied the air by playing on the wrong side of the bridge or with the back of the bow But it did not matter the panting shapes spun onwards They did not vary their partners if their inclination were to stick to previous ones Changing partners simply meant that a satisfactory choice had not as yet been arrived at by one or other of the pair and by this time every couple had been suitably matched It was then that the ecstasy and the dream began in which emotion was the matter of the universe and matter but an adventitious intrusion likely to hinder you from spinning where you wanted to spin Suddenly there was a dull thump on the ground a couple had fallen and lay in a mixed heap The next couple unable to check its progress came toppling over the obstacle An inner cloud of dust rose around the prostrate figures amid the general one of the room in which a twitching entanglement of arms and legs was discernible You shall catch it for this my gentleman when you get home burst in female accents from the human heap those of the unhappy partner of the man whose clumsiness had caused the mishap she happened also to be his recently married wife in which assortment there was nothing unusual at Trantridge as long as any affection remained between wedded couples and indeed it was not uncustomary in their later lives to avoid making odd lots of the single people between whom there might be a warm understanding A loud laugh from behind Tess s back in the shade of the garden united with the titter within the room She looked round and saw the red coal of a cigar Alec d Urberville was standing there alone He beckoned to her and she reluctantly retreated towards him Well my Beauty what are you doing here She was so tired after her long day and her walk that she confided her trouble to him that she had been waiting ever since he saw her to have their company home because the road at night was strange to her But it seems they will never leave off and I really think I will wait no longer Certainly do not I have only a saddle horse here to day but come to The Flower de Luce and I ll hire a trap and drive you home with me Tess though flattered had never quite got over her original mistrust of him and despite their tardiness she preferred to walk home with the work folk So she answered that she was much obliged to him but would not trouble him I have said that I will wait for em and they will expect me to now Very well Miss Independence Please yourself Then I shall not hurry My good Lord what a kick up they are having there He had not put himself forward into the light but some of them had perceived him and his presence led to a slight pause and a consideration of how the time was flying As soon as he had re lit a cigar and walked away the Trantridge people began to collect themselves from amid those who had come in from other farms and prepared to leave in a body Their bundles and baskets were gathered up and half an hour later when the clock chime sounded a quarter past eleven they were straggling along the lane which led up the hill towards their homes It was a three mile walk along a dry white road made whiter to night by the light of the moon Tess soon perceived as she walked in the flock sometimes with this one sometimes with that that the fresh night air was producing staggerings and serpentine courses among the men who had partaken too freely some of the more careless women also were wandering in their gait to wit a dark virago Car Darch dubbed Queen of Spades till lately a favourite of d Urberville s Nancy her sister nicknamed the Queen of Diamonds and the young married woman who had already tumbled down Yet however terrestrial and lumpy their appearance just now to the mean unglamoured eye to themselves the case was different They followed the road with a sensation that they were soaring along in a supporting medium possessed of original and profound thoughts themselves and surrounding nature forming an organism of which all the parts harmoniously and joyously interpenetrated each other They were as sublime as the moon and stars above them and the moon and stars were as ardent as they Tess however had undergone such painful experiences of this kind in her father s house that the discovery of their condition spoilt the pleasure she was beginning to feel in the moonlight journey Yet she stuck to the party for reasons above given In the open highway they had progressed in scattered order but now their route was through a field gate and the foremost finding a difficulty in opening it they closed up together This leading pedestrian was Car the Queen of Spades who carried a wicker basket containing her mother s groceries her own draperies and other purchases for the week The basket being large and heavy Car had placed it for convenience of porterage on the top of her head where it rode on in jeopardized balance as she walked with arms akimbo Well whatever is that a creeping down thy back Car Darch said one of the group suddenly All looked at Car Her gown was a light cotton print and from the back of her head a kind of rope could be seen descending to some distance below her waist like a Chinaman s queue Tis her hair falling down said another No it was not her hair it was a black stream of something oozing from her basket and it glistened like a slimy snake in the cold still rays of the moon Tis treacle said an observant matron Treacle it was Car s poor old grandmother had a weakness for the sweet stuff Honey she had in plenty out of her own hives but treacle was what her soul desired and Car had been about to give her a treat of surprise Hastily lowering the basket the dark girl found that the vessel containing the syrup had been smashed within By this time there had arisen a shout of laughter at the extraordinary appearance of Car s back which irritated the dark queen into getting rid of the disfigurement by the first sudden means available and independently of the help of the scoffers She rushed excitedly into the field they were about to cross and flinging herself flat on her back upon the grass began to wipe her gown as well as she could by spinning horizontally on the herbage and dragging herself over it upon her elbows The laughter rang louder they clung to the gate to the posts rested on their staves in the weakness engendered by their convulsions at the spectacle of Car Our heroine who had hitherto held her peace at this wild moment could not help joining in with the rest It was a misfortune in more ways than one No sooner did the dark queen hear the soberer richer note of Tess among those of the other work people than a long smouldering sense of rivalry inflamed her to madness She sprang to her feet and closely faced the object of her dislike How darest th laugh at me hussy she cried I couldn t really help it when t others did apologized Tess still tittering Ah th saint think th beest everybody dostn t because th beest first favourite with He just now But stop a bit my lady stop a bit I m as good as two of such Look here here s at ee To Tess s horror the dark queen began stripping off the bodice of her gown which for the added reason of its ridiculed condition she was only too glad to be free of till she had bared her plump neck shoulders and arms to the moonshine under which they looked as luminous and beautiful as some Praxitelean creation in their possession of the faultless rotundities of a lusty country girl She closed her fists and squared up at Tess Indeed then I shall not fight said the latter majestically and if I had know you was of that sort I wouldn t have so let myself down as to come with such a whorage as this is The rather too inclusive speech brought down a torrent of vituperation from other quarters upon fair Tess s unlucky head particularly from the Queen of Diamonds who having stood in the relations to d Urberville that Car had also been suspected of united with the latter against the common enemy Several other women also chimed in with an animus which none of them would have been so fatuous as to show but for the rollicking evening they had passed Thereupon finding Tess unfairly browbeaten the husbands and lovers tried to make peace by defending her but the result of that attempt was directly to increase the war Tess was indignant and ashamed She no longer minded the loneliness of the way and the lateness of the hour her one object was to get away from the whole crew as soon as possible She knew well enough that the better among them would repent of their passion next day They were all now inside the field and she was edging back to rush off alone when a horseman emerged almost silently from the corner of the hedge that screened the road and Alec d Urberville looked round upon them What the devil is all this row about work folk he asked The explanation was not readily forthcoming and in truth he did not require any Having heard their voices while yet some way off he had ridden creepingly forward and learnt enough to satisfy himself Tess was standing apart from the rest near the gate He bent over towards her Jump up behind me he whispered and we ll get shot of the screaming cats in a jiffy She felt almost ready to faint so vivid was her sense of the crisis At almost any other moment of her life she would have refused such proffered aid and company as she had refused them several times before and now the loneliness would not of itself have forced her to do otherwise But coming as the invitation did at the particular juncture when fear and indignation at these adversaries could be transformed by a spring of the foot into a triumph over them she abandoned herself to her impulse climbed the gate put her toe upon his instep and scrambled into the saddle behind him The pair were speeding away into the distant gray by the time that the contentious revellers became aware of what had happened The Queen of Spades forgot the stain on her bodice and stood beside the Queen of Diamonds and the new married staggering young woman all with a gaze of fixity in the direction in which the horse s tramp was diminishing into silence on the road What be ye looking at asked a man who had not observed the incident Ho ho ho laughed dark Car Hee hee hee laughed the tippling bride as she steadied herself on the arm of her fond husband Heu heu heu laughed dark Car s mother stroking her moustache as she explained laconically Out of the frying pan into the fire Then these children of the open air whom even excess of alcohol could scarce injure permanently betook themselves to the field path and as they went there moved onward with them around the shadow of each one s head a circle of opalized light formed by the moon s rays upon the glistening sheet of dew Each pedestrian could see no halo but his or her own which never deserted the head shadow whatever its vulgar unsteadiness might be but adhered to it and persistently beautified it till the erratic motions seemed an inherent part of the irradiation and the fumes of their breathing a component of the night s mist and the spirit of the scene and of the moonlight and of Nature seemed harmoniously to mingle with the spirit of wine XI The twain cantered along for some time without speech Tess as she clung to him still panting in her triumph yet in other respects dubious She had perceived that the horse was not the spirited one he sometimes rose and felt no alarm on that score though her seat was precarious enough despite her tight hold of him She begged him to slow the animal to a walk which Alec accordingly did Neatly done was it not dear Tess he said by and by Yes said she I am sure I ought to be much obliged to you And are you She did not reply Tess why do you always dislike my kissing you I suppose because I don t love you You are quite sure I am angry with you sometimes Ah I half feared as much Nevertheless Alec did not object to that confession He knew that anything was better then frigidity Why haven t you told me when I have made you angry You know very well why Because I cannot help myself here I haven t offended you often by love making You have sometimes How many times You know as well as I too many times Every time I have tried She was silent and the horse ambled along for a considerable distance till a faint luminous fog which had hung in the hollows all the evening became general and enveloped them It seemed to hold the moonlight in suspension rendering it more pervasive than in clear air Whether on this account or from absent mindedness or from sleepiness she did not perceive that they had long ago passed the point at which the lane to Trantridge branched from the highway and that her conductor had not taken the Trantridge track She was inexpressibly weary She had risen at five o clock every morning of that week had been on foot the whole of each day and on this evening had in addition walked the three miles to Chaseborough waited three hours for her neighbours without eating or drinking her impatience to start them preventing either she had then walked a mile of the way home and had undergone the excitement of the quarrel till with the slow progress of their steed it was now nearly one o clock Only once however was she overcome by actual drowsiness In that moment of oblivion her head sank gently against him D Urberville stopped the horse withdrew his feet from the stirrups turned sideways on the saddle and enclosed her waist with his arm to support her This immediately put her on the defensive and with one of those sudden impulses of reprisal to which she was liable she gave him a little push from her In his ticklish position he nearly lost his balance and only just avoided rolling over into the road the horse though a powerful one being fortunately the quietest he rode That is devilish unkind he said I mean no harm only to keep you from falling She pondered suspiciously till thinking that this might after all be true she relented and said quite humbly I beg your pardon sir I won t pardon you unless you show some confidence in me Good God he burst out what am I to be repulsed so by a mere chit like you For near three mortal months have you trifled with my feelings eluded me and snubbed me and I won t stand it I ll leave you to morrow sir No you will not leave me to morrow Will you I ask once more show your belief in me by letting me clasp you with my arm Come between us two and nobody else now We know each other well and you know that I love you and think you the prettiest girl in the world which you are Mayn t I treat you as a lover She drew a quick pettish breath of objection writhing uneasily on her seat looked far ahead and murmured I don t know I wish how can I say yes or no when He settled the matter by clasping his arm round her as he desired and Tess expressed no further negative Thus they sidled slowly onward till it struck her they had been advancing for an unconscionable time far longer than was usually occupied by the short journey from Chaseborough even at this walking pace and that they were no longer on hard road but in a mere trackway Why where be we she exclaimed Passing by a wood A wood what wood Surely we are quite out of the road A bit of The Chase the oldest wood in England It is a lovely night and why should we not prolong our ride a little How could you be so treacherous said Tess between archness and real dismay and getting rid of his arm by pulling open his fingers one by one though at the risk of slipping off herself Just when I ve been putting such trust in you and obliging you to please you because I thought I had wronged you by that push Please set me down and let me walk home You cannot walk home darling even if the air were clear We are miles away from Trantridge if I must tell you and in this growing fog you might wander for hours among these trees Never mind that she coaxed Put me down I beg you I don t mind where it is only let me get down sir please Very well then I will on one condition Having brought you here to this out of the way place I feel myself responsible for your safe conduct home whatever you may yourself feel about it As to your getting to Trantridge without assistance it is quite impossible for to tell the truth dear owing to this fog which so disguises everything I don t quite know where we are myself Now if you will promise to wait beside the horse while I walk through the bushes till I come to some road or house and ascertain exactly our whereabouts I ll deposit you here willingly When I come back I ll give you full directions and if you insist upon walking you may or you may ride at your pleasure She accepted these terms and slid off on the near side though not till he had stolen a cursory kiss He sprang down on the other side I suppose I must hold the horse said she Oh no it s not necessary replied Alec patting the panting creature He s had enough of it for to night He turned the horse s head into the bushes hitched him on to a bough and made a sort of couch or nest for her in the deep mass of dead leaves Now you sit there he said The leaves have not got damp as yet Just give an eye to the horse it will be quite sufficient He took a few steps away from her but returning said By the bye Tess your father has a new cob to day Somebody gave it to him Somebody You D Urberville nodded O how very good of you that is she exclaimed with a painful sense of the awkwardness of having to thank him just then And the children have some toys I didn t know you ever sent them anything she murmured much moved I almost wish you had not yes I almost wish it Why dear It hampers me so Tessy don t you love me ever so little now I m grateful she reluctantly admitted But I fear I do not The sudden vision of his passion for herself as a factor in this result so distressed her that beginning with one slow tear and then following with another she wept outright Don t cry dear dear one Now sit down here and wait till I come She passively sat down amid the leaves he had heaped and shivered slightly Are you cold he asked Not very a little He touched her with his fingers which sank into her as into down You have only that puffy muslin dress on how s that It s my best summer one Twas very warm when I started and I didn t know I was going to ride and that it would be night Nights grow chilly in September Let me see He pulled off a light overcoat that he had worn and put it round her tenderly That s it now you ll feel warmer he continued Now my pretty rest there I shall soon be back again Having buttoned the overcoat round her shoulders he plunged into the webs of vapour which by this time formed veils between the trees She could hear the rustling of the branches as he ascended the adjoining slope till his movements were no louder than the hopping of a bird and finally died away With the setting of the moon the pale light lessened and Tess became invisible as she fell into reverie upon the leaves where he had left her In the meantime Alec d Urberville had pushed on up the slope to clear his genuine doubt as to the quarter of The Chase they were in He had in fact ridden quite at random for over an hour taking any turning that came to hand in order to prolong companionship with her and giving far more attention to Tess s moonlit person than to any wayside object A little rest for the jaded animal being desirable he did not hasten his search for landmarks A clamber over the hill into the adjoining vale brought him to the fence of a highway whose contours he recognized which settled the question of their whereabouts D Urberville thereupon turned back but by this time the moon had quite gone down and partly on account of the fog The Chase was wrapped in thick darkness although morning was not far off He was obliged to advance with outstretched hands to avoid contact with the boughs and discovered that to hit the exact spot from which he had started was at first entirely beyond him Roaming up and down round and round he at length heard a slight movement of the horse close at hand and the sleeve of his overcoat unexpectedly caught his foot Tess said d Urberville There was no answer The obscurity was now so great that he could see absolutely nothing but a pale nebulousness at his feet which represented the white muslin figure he had left upon the dead leaves Everything else was blackness alike D Urberville stooped and heard a gentle regular breathing He knelt and bent lower till her breath warmed his face and in a moment his cheek was in contact with hers She was sleeping soundly and upon her eyelashes there lingered tears Darkness and silence ruled everywhere around Above them rose the primeval yews and oaks of The Chase in which there poised gentle roosting birds in their last nap and about them stole the hopping rabbits and hares But might some say where was Tess s guardian angel where was the providence of her simple faith Perhaps like that other god of whom the ironical Tishbite spoke he was talking or he was pursuing or he was in a journey or he was sleeping and not to be awaked Why it was that upon this beautiful feminine tissue sensitive as gossamer and practically blank as snow as yet there should have been traced such a coarse pattern as it was doomed to receive why so often the coarse appropriates the finer thus the wrong man the woman the wrong woman the man many thousand years of analytical philosophy have failed to explain to our sense of order One may indeed admit the possibility of a retribution lurking in the present catastrophe Doubtless some of Tess d Urberville s mailed ancestors rollicking home from a fray had dealt the same measure even more ruthlessly towards peasant girls of their time But though to visit the sins of the fathers upon the children may be a morality good enough for divinities it is scorned by average human nature and it therefore does not mend the matter As Tess s own people down in those retreats are never tired of saying among each other in their fatalistic way It was to be There lay the pity of it An immeasurable social chasm was to divide our heroine s personality thereafter from that previous self of hers who stepped from her mother s door to try her fortune at Trantridge poultry farm END OF PHASE THE FIRST Phase the Second Maiden No More XII The basket was heavy and the bundle was large but she lugged them along like a person who did not find her especial burden in material things Occasionally she stopped to rest in a mechanical way by some gate or post and then giving the baggage another hitch upon her full round arm went steadily on again It was a Sunday morning in late October about four months after Tess Durbeyfield s arrival at Trantridge and some few weeks subsequent to the night ride in The Chase The time was not long past daybreak and the yellow luminosity upon the horizon behind her back lighted the ridge towards which her face was set the barrier of the vale wherein she had of late been a stranger which she would have to climb over to reach her birthplace The ascent was gradual on this side and the soil and scenery differed much from those within Blakemore Vale Even the character and accent of the two peoples had shades of difference despite the amalgamating effects of a roundabout railway so that though less than twenty miles from the place of her sojourn at Trantridge her native village had seemed a far away spot The field folk shut in there traded northward and westward travelled courted and married northward and westward thought northward and westward those on this side mainly directed their energies and attention to the east and south The incline was the same down which d Urberville had driven her so wildly on that day in June Tess went up the remainder of its length without stopping and on reaching the edge of the escarpment gazed over the familiar green world beyond now half veiled in mist It was always beautiful from here it was terribly beautiful to Tess to day for since her eyes last fell upon it she had learnt that the serpent hisses where the sweet birds sing and her views of life had been totally changed for her by the lesson Verily another girl than the simple one she had been at home was she who bowed by thought stood still here and turned to look behind her She could not bear to look forward into the Vale Ascending by the long white road that Tess herself had just laboured up she saw a two wheeled vehicle beside which walked a man who held up his hand to attract her attention She obeyed the signal to wait for him with unspeculative repose and in a few minutes man and horse stopped beside her Why did you slip away by stealth like this said d Urberville with upbraiding breathlessness on a Sunday morning too when people were all in bed I only discovered it by accident and I have been driving like the deuce to overtake you Just look at the mare Why go off like this You know that nobody wished to hinder your going And how unnecessary it has been for you to toil along on foot and encumber yourself with this heavy load I have followed like a madman simply to drive you the rest of the distance if you won t come back I shan t come back said she I thought you wouldn t I said so Well then put up your basket and let me help you on She listlessly placed her basket and bundle within the dog cart and stepped up and they sat side by side She had no fear of him now and in the cause of her confidence her sorrow lay D Urberville mechanically lit a cigar and the journey was continued with broken unemotional conversation on the commonplace objects by the wayside He had quite forgotten his struggle to kiss her when in the early summer they had driven in the opposite direction along the same road But she had not and she sat now like a puppet replying to his remarks in monosyllables After some miles they came in view of the clump of trees beyond which the village of Marlott stood It was only then that her still face showed the least emotion a tear or two beginning to trickle down What are you crying for he coldly asked I was only thinking that I was born over there murmured Tess Well we must all be born somewhere I wish I had never been born there or anywhere else Pooh Well if you didn t wish to come to Trantridge why did you come She did not reply You didn t come for love of me that I ll swear Tis quite true If I had gone for love o you if I had ever sincerely loved you if I loved you still I should not so loathe and hate myself for my weakness as I do now My eyes were dazed by you for a little and that was all He shrugged his shoulders She resumed I didn t understand your meaning till it was too late That s what every woman says How can you dare to use such words she cried turning impetuously upon him her eyes flashing as the latent spirit of which he was to see more some day awoke in her My God I could knock you out of the gig Did it never strike your mind that what every woman says some women may feel Very well he said laughing I am sorry to wound you I did wrong I admit it He dropped into some little bitterness as he continued Only you needn t be so everlastingly flinging it in my face I am ready to pay to the uttermost farthing You know you need not work in the fields or the dairies again You know you may clothe yourself with the best instead of in the bald plain way you have lately affected as if you couldn t get a ribbon more than you earn Her lip lifted slightly though there was little scorn as a rule in her large and impulsive nature I have said I will not take anything more from you and I will not I cannot I SHOULD be your creature to go on doing that and I won t One would think you were a princess from your manner in addition to a true and original d Urberville ha ha Well Tess dear I can say no more I suppose I am a bad fellow a damn bad fellow I was born bad and I have lived bad and I shall die bad in all probability But upon my lost soul I won t be bad towards you again Tess And if certain circumstances should arise you understand in which you are in the least need the least difficulty send me one line and you shall have by return whatever you require I may not be at Trantridge I am going to London for a time I can t stand the old woman But all letters will be forwarded She said that she did not wish him to drive her further and they stopped just under the clump of trees D Urberville alighted and lifted her down bodily in his arms afterwards placing her articles on the ground beside her She bowed to him slightly her eye just lingering in his and then she turned to take the parcels for departure Alec d Urberville removed his cigar bent towards her and said You are not going to turn away like that dear Come If you wish she answered indifferently See how you ve mastered me She thereupon turned round and lifted her face to his and remained like a marble term while he imprinted a kiss upon her cheek half perfunctorily half as if zest had not yet quite died out Her eyes vaguely rested upon the remotest trees in the lane while the kiss was given as though she were nearly unconscious of what he did Now the other side for old acquaintance sake She turned her head in the same passive way as one might turn at the request of a sketcher or hairdresser and he kissed the other side his lips touching cheeks that were damp and smoothly chill as the skin of the mushrooms in the fields around You don t give me your mouth and kiss me back You never willingly do that you ll never love me I fear I have said so often It is true I have never really and truly loved you and I think I never can She added mournfully Perhaps of all things a lie on this thing would do the most good to me now but I have honour enough left little as tis not to tell that lie If I did love you I may have the best o causes for letting you know it But I don t He emitted a laboured breath as if the scene were getting rather oppressive to his heart or to his conscience or to his gentility Well you are absurdly melancholy Tess I have no reason for flattering you now and I can say plainly that you need not be so sad You can hold your own for beauty against any woman of these parts gentle or simple I say it to you as a practical man and well wisher If you are wise you will show it to the world more than you do before it fades And yet Tess will you come back to me Upon my soul I don t like to let you go like this Never never I made up my mind as soon as I saw what I ought to have seen sooner and I won t come Then good morning my four months cousin good bye He leapt up lightly arranged the reins and was gone between the tall red berried hedges Tess did not look after him but slowly wound along the crooked lane It was still early and though the sun s lower limb was just free of the hill his rays ungenial and peering addressed the eye rather than the touch as yet There was not a human soul near Sad October and her sadder self seemed the only two existences haunting that lane As she walked however some footsteps approached behind her the footsteps of a man and owing to the briskness of his advance he was close at her heels and had said Good morning before she had been long aware of his propinquity He appeared to be an artisan of some sort and carried a tin pot of red paint in his hand He asked in a business like manner if he should take her basket which she permitted him to do walking beside him It is early to be astir this Sabbath morn he said cheerfully Yes said Tess When most people are at rest from their week s work She also assented to this Though I do more real work to day than all the week besides Do you All the week I work for the glory of man and on Sunday for the glory of God That s more real than the other hey I have a little to do here at this stile The man turned as he spoke to an opening at the roadside leading into a pasture If you ll wait a moment he added I shall not be long As he had her basket she could not well do otherwise and she waited observing him He set down her basket and the tin pot and stirring the paint with the brush that was in it began painting large square letters on the middle board of the three composing the stile placing a comma after each word as if to give pause while that word was driven well home to the reader s heart THY DAMNATION SLUMBERETH NOT two Pet ii three Against the peaceful landscape the pale decaying tints of the copses the blue air of the horizon and the lichened stile boards these staring vermilion words shone forth They seemed to shout themselves out and make the atmosphere ring Some people might have cried Alas poor Theology at the hideous defacement the last grotesque phase of a creed which had served mankind well in its time But the words entered Tess with accusatory horror It was as if this man had known her recent history yet he was a total stranger Having finished his text he picked up her basket and she mechanically resumed her walk beside him Do you believe what you paint she asked in low tones Believe that tex Do I believe in my own existence But said she tremulously suppose your sin was not of your own seeking He shook his head I cannot split hairs on that burning query he said I have walked hundreds of miles this past summer painting these texes on every wall gate and stile the length and breadth of this district I leave their application to the hearts of the people who read em I think they are horrible said Tess Crushing Killing That s what they are meant to be he replied in a trade voice But you should read my hottest ones them I kips for slums and seaports They d make ye wriggle Not but what this is a very good tex for rural districts Ah there s a nice bit of blank wall up by that barn standing to waste I must put one there one that it will be good for dangerous young females like yerself to heed Will ye wait missy No said she and taking her basket Tess trudged on A little way forward she turned her head The old gray wall began to advertise a similar fiery lettering to the first with a strange and unwonted mien as if distressed at duties it had never before been called upon to perform It was with a sudden flush that she read and realized what was to be the inscription he was now halfway through THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT Her cheerful friend saw her looking stopped his brush and shouted If you want to ask for edification on these things of moment there s a very earnest good man going to preach a charity sermon to day in the parish you are going to mister Clare of Emminster I m not of his persuasion now but he s a good man and he ll expound as well as any parson I know Twas he began the work in me But Tess did not answer she throbbingly resumed her walk her eyes fixed on the ground Pooh I don t believe God said such things she murmured contemptuously when her flush had died away A plume of smoke soared up suddenly from her father s chimney the sight of which made her heart ache The aspect of the interior when she reached it made her heart ache more Her mother who had just come down stairs turned to greet her from the fireplace where she was kindling barked oak twigs under the breakfast kettle The young children were still above as was also her father it being Sunday morning when he felt justified in lying an additional half hour Well my dear Tess exclaimed her surprised mother jumping up and kissing the girl How be ye I didn t see you till you was in upon me Have you come home to be married No I have not come for that mother Then for a holiday Yes for a holiday for a long holiday said Tess What isn t your cousin going to do the handsome thing He s not my cousin and he s not going to marry me Her mother eyed her narrowly Come you have not told me all she said Then Tess went up to her mother put her face upon Joan s neck and told And yet th saint not got him to marry ee reiterated her mother Any woman would have done it but you after that Perhaps any woman would except me It would have been something like a story to come back with if you had continued missus Durbeyfield ready to burst into tears of vexation After all the talk about you and him which has reached us here who would have expected it to end like this Why didn t ye think of doing some good for your family instead o thinking only of yourself See how I ve got to teave and slave and your poor weak father with his heart clogged like a dripping pan I did hope for something to come out o this To see what a pretty pair you and he made that day when you drove away together four months ago See what he has given us all as we thought because we were his kin But if he s not it must have been done because of his love for ee And yet you ve not got him to marry Get Alec d Urberville in the mind to marry her He marry HER On matrimony he had never once said a word And what if he had How a convulsive snatching at social salvation might have impelled her to answer him she could not say But her poor foolish mother little knew her present feeling towards this man Perhaps it was unusual in the circumstances unlucky unaccountable but there it was and this as she had said was what made her detest herself She had never wholly cared for him she did not at all care for him now She had dreaded him winced before him succumbed to adroit advantages he took of her helplessness then temporarily blinded by his ardent manners had been stirred to confused surrender awhile had suddenly despised and disliked him and had run away That was all Hate him she did not quite but he was dust and ashes to her and even for her name s sake she scarcely wished to marry him You ought to have been more careful if you didn t mean to get him to make you his wife O mother my mother cried the agonized girl turning passionately upon her parent as if her poor heart would break How could I be expected to know I was a child when I left this house four months ago Why didn t you tell me there was danger in men folk Why didn t you warn me Ladies know what to fend hands against because they read novels that tell them of these tricks but I never had the chance o learning in that way and you did not help me Her mother was subdued I thought if I spoke of his fond feelings and what they might lead to you would be hontish wi him and lose your chance she murmured wiping her eyes with her apron Well we must make the best of it I suppose Tis nater after all and what do please God XIII The event of Tess Durbeyfield s return from the manor of her bogus kinsfolk was rumoured abroad if rumour be not too large a word for a space of a square mile In the afternoon several young girls of Marlott former schoolfellows and acquaintances of Tess called to see her arriving dressed in their best starched and ironed as became visitors to a person who had made a transcendent conquest as they supposed and sat round the room looking at her with great curiosity For the fact that it was this said thirty first cousin mister d Urberville who had fallen in love with her a gentleman not altogether local whose reputation as a reckless gallant and heartbreaker was beginning to spread beyond the immediate boundaries of Trantridge lent Tess s supposed position by its fearsomeness a far higher fascination that it would have exercised if unhazardous Their interest was so deep that the younger ones whispered when her back was turned How pretty she is and how that best frock do set her off I believe it cost an immense deal and that it was a gift from him Tess who was reaching up to get the tea things from the corner cupboard did not hear these commentaries If she had heard them she might soon have set her friends right on the matter But her mother heard and Joan s simple vanity having been denied the hope of a dashing marriage fed itself as well as it could upon the sensation of a dashing flirtation Upon the whole she felt gratified even though such a limited and evanescent triumph should involve her daughter s reputation it might end in marriage yet and in the warmth of her responsiveness to their admiration she invited her visitors to stay to tea Their chatter their laughter their good humoured innuendoes above all their flashes and flickerings of envy revived Tess s spirits also and as the evening wore on she caught the infection of their excitement and grew almost gay The marble hardness left her face she moved with something of her old bounding step and flushed in all her young beauty At moments in spite of thought she would reply to their inquiries with a manner of superiority as if recognizing that her experiences in the field of courtship had indeed been slightly enviable But so far was she from being in the words of Robert South in love with her own ruin that the illusion was transient as lightning cold reason came back to mock her spasmodic weakness the ghastliness of her momentary pride would convict her and recall her to reserved listlessness again And the despondency of the next morning s dawn when it was no longer Sunday but Monday and no best clothes and the laughing visitors were gone and she awoke alone in her old bed the innocent younger children breathing softly around her In place of the excitement of her return and the interest it had inspired she saw before her a long and stony highway which she had to tread without aid and with little sympathy Her depression was then terrible and she could have hidden herself in a tomb In the course of a few weeks Tess revived sufficiently to show herself so far as was necessary to get to church one Sunday morning She liked to hear the chanting such as it was and the old Psalms and to join in the Morning Hymn That innate love of melody which she had inherited from her ballad singing mother gave the simplest music a power over her which could well nigh drag her heart out of her bosom at times To be as much out of observation as possible for reasons of her own and to escape the gallantries of the young men she set out before the chiming began and took a back seat under the gallery close to the lumber where only old men and women came and where the bier stood on end among the churchyard tools Parishioners dropped in by twos and threes deposited themselves in rows before her rested three quarters of a minute on their foreheads as if they were praying though they were not then sat up and looked around When the chants came on one of her favourites happened to be chosen among the rest the old double chant Langdon but she did not know what it was called though she would much have liked to know She thought without exactly wording the thought how strange and god like was a composer s power who from the grave could lead through sequences of emotion which he alone had felt at first a girl like her who had never heard of his name and never would have a clue to his personality The people who had turned their heads turned them again as the service proceeded and at last observing her they whispered to each other She knew what their whispers were about grew sick at heart and felt that she could come to church no more The bedroom which she shared with some of the children formed her retreat more continually than ever Here under her few square yards of thatch she watched winds and snows and rains gorgeous sunsets and successive moons at their full So close kept she that at length almost everybody thought she had gone away The only exercise that Tess took at this time was after dark and it was then when out in the woods that she seemed least solitary She knew how to hit to a hair s breadth that moment of evening when the light and the darkness are so evenly balanced that the constraint of day and the suspense of night neutralize each other leaving absolute mental liberty It is then that the plight of being alive becomes attenuated to its least possible dimensions She had no fear of the shadows her sole idea seemed to be to shun mankind or rather that cold accretion called the world which so terrible in the mass is so unformidable even pitiable in its units On these lonely hills and dales her quiescent glide was of a piece with the element she moved in Her flexuous and stealthy figure became an integral part of the scene At times her whimsical fancy would intensify natural processes around her till they seemed a part of her own story Rather they became a part of it for the world is only a psychological phenomenon and what they seemed they were The midnight airs and gusts moaning amongst the tightly wrapped buds and bark of the winter twigs were formulae of bitter reproach A wet day was the expression of irremediable grief at her weakness in the mind of some vague ethical being whom she could not class definitely as the God of her childhood and could not comprehend as any other But this encompassment of her own characterization based on shreds of convention peopled by phantoms and voices antipathetic to her was a sorry and mistaken creation of Tess s fancy a cloud of moral hobgoblins by which she was terrified without reason It was they that were out of harmony with the actual world not she Walking among the sleeping birds in the hedges watching the skipping rabbits on a moonlit warren or standing under a pheasant laden bough she looked upon herself as a figure of Guilt intruding into the haunts of Innocence But all the while she was making a distinction where there was no difference Feeling herself in antagonism she was quite in accord She had been made to break an accepted social law but no law known to the environment in which she fancied herself such an anomaly XIV It was a hazy sunrise in August The denser nocturnal vapours attacked by the warm beams were dividing and shrinking into isolated fleeces within hollows and coverts where they waited till they should be dried away to nothing The sun on account of the mist had a curious sentient personal look demanding the masculine pronoun for its adequate expression His present aspect coupled with the lack of all human forms in the scene explained the old time heliolatries in a moment One could feel that a saner religion had never prevailed under the sky The luminary was a golden haired beaming mild eyed God like creature gazing down in the vigour and intentness of youth upon an earth that was brimming with interest for him His light a little later broke though chinks of cottage shutters throwing stripes like red hot pokers upon cupboards chests of drawers and other furniture within and awakening harvesters who were not already astir But of all ruddy things that morning the brightest were two broad arms of painted wood which rose from the margin of yellow cornfield hard by Marlott village They with two others below formed the revolving Maltese cross of the reaping machine which had been brought to the field on the previous evening to be ready for operations this day The paint with which they were smeared intensified in hue by the sunlight imparted to them a look of having been dipped in liquid fire The field had already been opened that is to say a lane a few feet wide had been hand cut through the wheat along the whole circumference of the field for the first passage of the horses and machine Two groups one of men and lads the other of women had come down the lane just at the hour when the shadows of the eastern hedge top struck the west hedge midway so that the heads of the groups were enjoying sunrise while their feet were still in the dawn They disappeared from the lane between the two stone posts which flanked the nearest field gate Presently there arose from within a ticking like the love making of the grasshopper The machine had begun and a moving concatenation of three horses and the aforesaid long rickety machine was visible over the gate a driver sitting upon one of the hauling horses and an attendant on the seat of the implement Along one side of the field the whole wain went the arms of the mechanical reaper revolving slowly till it passed down the hill quite out of sight In a minute it came up on the other side of the field at the same equable pace the glistening brass star in the forehead of the fore horse first catching the eye as it rose into view over the stubble then the bright arms and then the whole machine The narrow lane of stubble encompassing the field grew wider with each circuit and the standing corn was reduced to a smaller area as the morning wore on Rabbits hares snakes rats mice retreated inwards as into a fastness unaware of the ephemeral nature of their refuge and of the doom that awaited them later in the day when their covert shrinking to a more and more horrible narrowness they were huddled together friends and foes till the last few yards of upright wheat fell also under the teeth of the unerring reaper and they were every one put to death by the sticks and stones of the harvesters The reaping machine left the fallen corn behind it in little heaps each heap being of the quantity for a sheaf and upon these the active binders in the rear laid their hands mainly women but some of them men in print shirts and trousers supported round their waists by leather straps rendering useless the two buttons behind which twinkled and bristled with sunbeams at every movement of each wearer as if they were a pair of eyes in the small of his back But those of the other sex were the most interesting of this company of binders by reason of the charm which is acquired by woman when she becomes part and parcel of outdoor nature and is not merely an object set down therein as at ordinary times A field man is a personality afield a field woman is a portion of the field she had somehow lost her own margin imbibed the essence of her surrounding and assimilated herself with it The women or rather girls for they were mostly young wore drawn cotton bonnets with great flapping curtains to keep off the sun and gloves to prevent their hands being wounded by the stubble There was one wearing a pale pink jacket another in a cream coloured tight sleeved gown another in a petticoat as red as the arms of the reaping machine and others older in the brown rough wropper or over all the old established and most appropriate dress of the field woman which the young ones were abandoning This morning the eye returns involuntarily to the girl in the pink cotton jacket she being the most flexuous and finely drawn figure of them all But her bonnet is pulled so far over her brow that none of her face is disclosed while she binds though her complexion may be guessed from a stray twine or two of dark brown hair which extends below the curtain of her bonnet Perhaps one reason why she seduces casual attention is that she never courts it though the other women often gaze around them Her binding proceeds with clock like monotony From the sheaf last finished she draws a handful of ears patting their tips with her left palm to bring them even Then stooping low she moves forward gathering the corn with both hands against her knees and pushing her left gloved hand under the bundle to meet the right on the other side holding the corn in an embrace like that of a lover She brings the ends of the bond together and kneels on the sheaf while she ties it beating back her skirts now and then when lifted by the breeze A bit of her naked arm is visible between the buff leather of the gauntlet and the sleeve of her gown and as the day wears on its feminine smoothness becomes scarified by the stubble and bleeds At intervals she stands up to rest and to retie her disarranged apron or to pull her bonnet straight Then one can see the oval face of a handsome young woman with deep dark eyes and long heavy clinging tresses which seem to clasp in a beseeching way anything they fall against The cheeks are paler the teeth more regular the red lips thinner than is usual in a country bred girl It is Tess Durbeyfield otherwise d Urberville somewhat changed the same but not the same at the present stage of her existence living as a stranger and an alien here though it was no strange land that she was in After a long seclusion she had come to a resolve to undertake outdoor work in her native village the busiest season of the year in the agricultural world having arrived and nothing that she could do within the house being so remunerative for the time as harvesting in the fields The movements of the other women were more or less similar to Tess s the whole bevy of them drawing together like dancers in a quadrille at the completion of a sheaf by each every one placing her sheaf on end against those of the rest till a shock or stitch as it was here called of ten or a dozen was formed They went to breakfast and came again and the work proceeded as before As the hour of eleven drew near a person watching her might have noticed that every now and then Tess s glance flitted wistfully to the brow of the hill though she did not pause in her sheafing On the verge of the hour the heads of a group of children of ages ranging from six to fourteen rose over the stubbly convexity of the hill The face of Tess flushed slightly but still she did not pause The eldest of the comers a girl who wore a triangular shawl its corner draggling on the stubble carried in her arms what at first sight seemed to be a doll but proved to be an infant in long clothes Another brought some lunch The harvesters ceased working took their provisions and sat down against one of the shocks Here they fell to the men plying a stone jar freely and passing round a cup Tess Durbeyfield had been one of the last to suspend her labours She sat down at the end of the shock her face turned somewhat away from her companions When she had deposited herself a man in a rabbit skin cap and with a red handkerchief tucked into his belt held the cup of ale over the top of the shock for her to drink But she did not accept his offer As soon as her lunch was spread she called up the big girl her sister and took the baby of her who glad to be relieved of the burden went away to the next shock and joined the other children playing there Tess with a curiously stealthy yet courageous movement and with a still rising colour unfastened her frock and began suckling the child The men who sat nearest considerately turned their faces towards the other end of the field some of them beginning to smoke one with absent minded fondness regretfully stroking the jar that would no longer yield a stream All the women but Tess fell into animated talk and adjusted the disarranged knots of their hair When the infant had taken its fill the young mother sat it upright in her lap and looking into the far distance dandled it with a gloomy indifference that was almost dislike then all of a sudden she fell to violently kissing it some dozens of times as if she could never leave off the child crying at the vehemence of an onset which strangely combined passionateness with contempt She s fond of that there child though she mid pretend to hate en and say she wishes the baby and her too were in the churchyard observed the woman in the red petticoat She ll soon leave off saying that replied the one in buff Lord tis wonderful what a body can get used to o that sort in time A little more than persuading had to do wi the coming o t I reckon There were they that heard a sobbing one night last year in The Chase and it mid ha gone hard wi a certain party if folks had come along Well a little more or a little less twas a thousand pities that it should have happened to she of all others But tis always the comeliest The plain ones be as safe as churches hey Jenny The speaker turned to one of the group who certainly was not ill defined as plain It was a thousand pities indeed it was impossible for even an enemy to feel otherwise on looking at Tess as she sat there with her flower like mouth and large tender eyes neither black nor blue nor grey nor violet rather all those shades together and a hundred others which could be seen if one looked into their irises shade behind shade tint beyond tint around pupils that had no bottom an almost standard woman but for the slight incautiousness of character inherited from her race A resolution which had surprised herself had brought her into the fields this week for the first time during many months After wearing and wasting her palpitating heart with every engine of regret that lonely inexperience could devise common sense had illuminated her She felt that she would do well to be useful again to taste anew sweet independence at any price The past was past whatever it had been it was no more at hand Whatever its consequences time would close over them they would all in a few years be as if they had never been and she herself grassed down and forgotten Meanwhile the trees were just as green as before the birds sang and the sun shone as clearly now as ever The familiar surroundings had not darkened because of her grief nor sickened because of her pain She might have seen that what had bowed her head so profoundly the thought of the world s concern at her situation was founded on an illusion She was not an existence an experience a passion a structure of sensations to anybody but herself To all humankind besides Tess was only a passing thought Even to friends she was no more than a frequently passing thought If she made herself miserable the livelong night and day it was only this much to them Ah she makes herself unhappy If she tried to be cheerful to dismiss all care to take pleasure in the daylight the flowers the baby she could only be this idea to them Ah she bears it very well Moreover alone in a desert island would she have been wretched at what had happened to her Not greatly If she could have been but just created to discover herself as a spouseless mother with no experience of life except as the parent of a nameless child would the position have caused her to despair No she would have taken it calmly and found pleasure therein Most of the misery had been generated by her conventional aspect and not by her innate sensations Whatever Tess s reasoning some spirit had induced her to dress herself up neatly as she had formerly done and come out into the fields harvest hands being greatly in demand just then This was why she had borne herself with dignity and had looked people calmly in the face at times even when holding the baby in her arms The harvest men rose from the shock of corn and stretched their limbs and extinguished their pipes The horses which had been unharnessed and fed were again attached to the scarlet machine Tess having quickly eaten her own meal beckoned to her eldest sister to come and take away the baby fastened her dress put on the buff gloves again and stooped anew to draw a bond from the last completed sheaf for the tying of the next In the afternoon and evening the proceedings of the morning were continued Tess staying on till dusk with the body of harvesters Then they all rode home in one of the largest wagons in the company of a broad tarnished moon that had risen from the ground to the eastwards its face resembling the outworn gold leaf halo of some worm eaten Tuscan saint Tess s female companions sang songs and showed themselves very sympathetic and glad at her reappearance out of doors though they could not refrain from mischievously throwing in a few verses of the ballad about the maid who went to the merry green wood and came back a changed state There are counterpoises and compensations in life and the event which had made of her a social warning had also for the moment made her the most interesting personage in the village to many Their friendliness won her still farther away from herself their lively spirits were contagious and she became almost gay But now that her moral sorrows were passing away a fresh one arose on the natural side of her which knew no social law When she reached home it was to learn to her grief that the baby had been suddenly taken ill since the afternoon Some such collapse had been probable so tender and puny was its frame but the event came as a shock nevertheless The baby s offence against society in coming into the world was forgotten by the girl mother her soul s desire was to continue that offence by preserving the life of the child However it soon grew clear that the hour of emancipation for that little prisoner of the flesh was to arrive earlier than her worst misgiving had conjectured And when she had discovered this she was plunged into a misery which transcended that of the child s simple loss Her baby had not been baptized Tess had drifted into a frame of mind which accepted passively the consideration that if she should have to burn for what she had done burn she must and there was an end of it Like all village girls she was well grounded in the Holy Scriptures and had dutifully studied the histories of Aholah and Aholibah and knew the inferences to be drawn therefrom But when the same question arose with regard to the baby it had a very different colour Her darling was about to die and no salvation It was nearly bedtime but she rushed downstairs and asked if she might send for the parson The moment happened to be one at which her father s sense of the antique nobility of his family was highest and his sensitiveness to the smudge which Tess had set upon that nobility most pronounced for he had just returned from his weekly booze at Rolliver s Inn No parson should come inside his door he declared prying into his affairs just then when by her shame it had become more necessary than ever to hide them He locked the door and put the key in his pocket The household went to bed and distressed beyond measure Tess retired also She was continually waking as she lay and in the middle of the night found that the baby was still worse It was obviously dying quietly and painlessly but none the less surely In her misery she rocked herself upon the bed The clock struck the solemn hour of one that hour when fancy stalks outside reason and malignant possibilities stand rock firm as facts She thought of the child consigned to the nethermost corner of hell as its double doom for lack of baptism and lack of legitimacy saw the arch fiend tossing it with his three pronged fork like the one they used for heating the oven on baking days to which picture she added many other quaint and curious details of torment sometimes taught the young in this Christian country The lurid presentment so powerfully affected her imagination in the silence of the sleeping house that her nightgown became damp with perspiration and the bedstead shook with each throb of her heart The infant s breathing grew more difficult and the mother s mental tension increased It was useless to devour the little thing with kisses she could stay in bed no longer and walked feverishly about the room O merciful God have pity have pity upon my poor baby she cried Heap as much anger as you want to upon me and welcome but pity the child She leant against the chest of drawers and murmured incoherent supplications for a long while till she suddenly started up Ah perhaps baby can be saved Perhaps it will be just the same She spoke so brightly that it seemed as though her face might have shone in the gloom surrounding her She lit a candle and went to a second and a third bed under the wall where she awoke her young sisters and brothers all of whom occupied the same room Pulling out the washing stand so that she could get behind it she poured some water from a jug and made them kneel around putting their hands together with fingers exactly vertical While the children scarcely awake awe stricken at her manner their eyes growing larger and larger remained in this position she took the baby from her bed a child s child so immature as scarce to seem a sufficient personality to endow its producer with the maternal title Tess then stood erect with the infant on her arm beside the basin the next sister held the Prayer Book open before her as the clerk at church held it before the parson and thus the girl set about baptizing her child Her figure looked singularly tall and imposing as she stood in her long white nightgown a thick cable of twisted dark hair hanging straight down her back to her waist The kindly dimness of the weak candle abstracted from her form and features the little blemishes which sunlight might have revealed the stubble scratches upon her wrists and the weariness of her eyes her high enthusiasm having a transfiguring effect upon the face which had been her undoing showing it as a thing of immaculate beauty with a touch of dignity which was almost regal The little ones kneeling round their sleepy eyes blinking and red awaited her preparations full of a suspended wonder which their physical heaviness at that hour would not allow to become active The most impressed of them said Be you really going to christen him Tess The girl mother replied in a grave affirmative What s his name going to be She had not thought of that but a name suggested by a phrase in the book of Genesis came into her head as she proceeded with the baptismal service and now she pronounced it SORROW I baptize thee in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost She sprinkled the water and there was silence Say Amen children The tiny voices piped in obedient response Amen Tess went on We receive this child and so forth and do sign him with the sign of the Cross Here she dipped her hand into the basin and fervently drew an immense cross upon the baby with her forefinger continuing with the customary sentences as to his manfully fighting against sin the world and the devil and being a faithful soldier and servant unto his life s end She duly went on with the Lord s Prayer the children lisping it after her in a thin gnat like wail till at the conclusion raising their voices to clerk s pitch they again piped into silence Amen Then their sister with much augmented confidence in the efficacy of the sacrament poured forth from the bottom of her heart the thanksgiving that follows uttering it boldly and triumphantly in the stopt diapason note which her voice acquired when her heart was in her speech and which will never be forgotten by those who knew her The ecstasy of faith almost apotheosized her it set upon her face a glowing irradiation and brought a red spot into the middle of each cheek while the miniature candle flame inverted in her eye pupils shone like a diamond The children gazed up at her with more and more reverence and no longer had a will for questioning She did not look like Sissy to them now but as a being large towering and awful a divine personage with whom they had nothing in common Poor Sorrow s campaign against sin the world and the devil was doomed to be of limited brilliancy luckily perhaps for himself considering his beginnings In the blue of the morning that fragile soldier and servant breathed his last and when the other children awoke they cried bitterly and begged Sissy to have another pretty baby The calmness which had possessed Tess since the christening remained with her in the infant s loss In the daylight indeed she felt her terrors about his soul to have been somewhat exaggerated whether well founded or not she had no uneasiness now reasoning that if Providence would not ratify such an act of approximation she for one did not value the kind of heaven lost by the irregularity either for herself or for her child So passed away Sorrow the Undesired that intrusive creature that bastard gift of shameless Nature who respects not the social law a waif to whom eternal Time had been a matter of days merely who knew not that such things as years and centuries ever were to whom the cottage interior was the universe the week s weather climate new born babyhood human existence and the instinct to suck human knowledge Tess who mused on the christening a good deal wondered if it were doctrinally sufficient to secure a Christian burial for the child Nobody could tell this but the parson of the parish and he was a new comer and did not know her She went to his house after dusk and stood by the gate but could not summon courage to go in The enterprise would have been abandoned if she had not by accident met him coming homeward as she turned away In the gloom she did not mind speaking freely I should like to ask you something sir He expressed his willingness to listen and she told the story of the baby s illness and the extemporized ordinance And now sir she added earnestly can you tell me this will it be just the same for him as if you had baptized him Having the natural feelings of a tradesman at finding that a job he should have been called in for had been unskilfully botched by his customers among themselves he was disposed to say no Yet the dignity of the girl the strange tenderness in her voice combined to affect his nobler impulses or rather those that he had left in him after ten years of endeavour to graft technical belief on actual scepticism The man and the ecclesiastic fought within him and the victory fell to the man My dear girl he said it will be just the same Then will you give him a Christian burial she asked quickly The Vicar felt himself cornered Hearing of the baby s illness he had conscientiously gone to the house after nightfall to perform the rite and unaware that the refusal to admit him had come from Tess s father and not from Tess he could not allow the plea of necessity for its irregular administration Ah that s another matter he said Another matter why asked Tess rather warmly Well I would willingly do so if only we two were concerned But I must not for certain reasons Just for once sir Really I must not O sir She seized his hand as she spoke He withdrew it shaking his head Then I don t like you she burst out and I ll never come to your church no more Don t talk so rashly Perhaps it will be just the same to him if you don t Will it be just the same Don t for God s sake speak as saint to sinner but as you yourself to me myself poor me How the Vicar reconciled his answer with the strict notions he supposed himself to hold on these subjects it is beyond a layman s power to tell though not to excuse Somewhat moved he said in this case also It will be just the same So the baby was carried in a small deal box under an ancient woman s shawl to the churchyard that night and buried by lantern light at the cost of a shilling and a pint of beer to the sexton in that shabby corner of God s allotment where He lets the nettles grow and where all unbaptized infants notorious drunkards suicides and others of the conjecturally damned are laid In spite of the untoward surroundings however Tess bravely made a little cross of two laths and a piece of string and having bound it with flowers she stuck it up at the head of the grave one evening when she could enter the churchyard without being seen putting at the foot also a bunch of the same flowers in a little jar of water to keep them alive What matter was it that on the outside of the jar the eye of mere observation noted the words Keelwell s Marmalade The eye of maternal affection did not see them in its vision of higher things XV By experience says Roger Ascham we find out a short way by a long wandering Not seldom that long wandering unfits us for further travel and of what use is our experience to us then Tess Durbeyfield s experience was of this incapacitating kind At last she had learned what to do but who would now accept her doing If before going to the d Urbervilles she had vigorously moved under the guidance of sundry gnomic texts and phrases known to her and to the world in general no doubt she would never have been imposed on But it had not been in Tess s power nor is it in anybody s power to feel the whole truth of golden opinions while it is possible to profit by them She and how many more might have ironically said to God with Saint Augustine Thou hast counselled a better course than Thou hast permitted She remained at her father s house during the winter months plucking fowls or cramming turkeys and geese or making clothes for her sisters and brothers out of some finery which d Urberville had given her and she had put by with contempt Apply to him she would not But she would often clasp her hands behind her head and muse when she was supposed to be working hard She philosophically noted dates as they came past in the revolution of the year the disastrous night of her undoing at Trantridge with its dark background of The Chase also the dates of the baby s birth and death also her own birthday and every other day individualized by incidents in which she had taken some share She suddenly thought one afternoon when looking in the glass at her fairness that there was yet another date of greater importance to her than those that of her own death when all these charms would have disappeared a day which lay sly and unseen among all the other days of the year giving no sign or sound when she annually passed over it but not the less surely there When was it Why did she not feel the chill of each yearly encounter with such a cold relation She had Jeremy Taylor s thought that some time in the future those who had known her would say It is the th the day that poor Tess Durbeyfield died and there would be nothing singular to their minds in the statement Of that day doomed to be her terminus in time through all the ages she did not know the place in month week season or year Almost at a leap Tess thus changed from simple girl to complex woman Symbols of reflectiveness passed into her face and a note of tragedy at times into her voice Her eyes grew larger and more eloquent She became what would have been called a fine creature her aspect was fair and arresting her soul that of a woman whom the turbulent experiences of the last year or two had quite failed to demoralize But for the world s opinion those experiences would have been simply a liberal education She had held so aloof of late that her trouble never generally known was nearly forgotten in Marlott But it became evident to her that she could never be really comfortable again in a place which had seen the collapse of her family s attempt to claim kin and through her even closer union with the rich d Urbervilles At least she could not be comfortable there till long years should have obliterated her keen consciousness of it Yet even now Tess felt the pulse of hopeful life still warm within her she might be happy in some nook which had no memories To escape the past and all that appertained thereto was to annihilate it and to do that she would have to get away Was once lost always lost really true of chastity she would ask herself She might prove it false if she could veil bygones The recuperative power which pervaded organic nature was surely not denied to maidenhood alone She waited a long time without finding opportunity for a new departure A particularly fine spring came round and the stir of germination was almost audible in the buds it moved her as it moved the wild animals and made her passionate to go At last one day in early May a letter reached her from a former friend of her mother s to whom she had addressed inquiries long before a person whom she had never seen that a skilful milkmaid was required at a dairy house many miles to the southward and that the dairyman would be glad to have her for the summer months It was not quite so far off as could have been wished but it was probably far enough her radius of movement and repute having been so small To persons of limited spheres miles are as geographical degrees parishes as counties counties as provinces and kingdoms On one point she was resolved there should be no more d Urberville air castles in the dreams and deeds of her new life She would be the dairymaid Tess and nothing more Her mother knew Tess s feeling on this point so well though no words had passed between them on the subject that she never alluded to the knightly ancestry now Yet such is human inconsistency that one of the interests of the new place to her was the accidental virtues of its lying near her forefathers country for they were not Blakemore men though her mother was Blakemore to the bone The dairy called Talbothays for which she was bound stood not remotely from some of the former estates of the d Urbervilles near the great family vaults of her granddames and their powerful husbands She would be able to look at them and think not only that d Urberville like Babylon had fallen but that the individual innocence of a humble descendant could lapse as silently All the while she wondered if any strange good thing might come of her being in her ancestral land and some spirit within her rose automatically as the sap in the twigs It was unexpected youth surging up anew after its temporary check and bringing with it hope and the invincible instinct towards self delight END OF PHASE THE SECOND Phase the Third The Rally XVI On a thyme scented bird hatching morning in May between two and three years after the return from Trantridge silent reconstructive years for Tess Durbeyfield she left her home for the second time Having packed up her luggage so that it could be sent to her later she started in a hired trap for the little town of Stourcastle through which it was necessary to pass on her journey now in a direction almost opposite to that of her first adventuring On the curve of the nearest hill she looked back regretfully at Marlott and her father s house although she had been so anxious to get away Her kindred dwelling there would probably continue their daily lives as heretofore with no great diminution of pleasure in their consciousness although she would be far off and they deprived of her smile In a few days the children would engage in their games as merrily as ever without the sense of any gap left by her departure This leaving of the younger children she had decided to be for the best were she to remain they would probably gain less good by her precepts than harm by her example She went through Stourcastle without pausing and onward to a junction of highways where she could await a carrier s van that ran to the south west for the railways which engirdled this interior tract of country had never yet struck across it While waiting however there came along a farmer in his spring cart driving approximately in the direction that she wished to pursue Though he was a stranger to her she accepted his offer of a seat beside him ignoring that its motive was a mere tribute to her countenance He was going to Weatherbury and by accompanying him thither she could walk the remainder of the distance instead of travelling in the van by way of Casterbridge Tess did not stop at Weatherbury after this long drive further than to make a slight nondescript meal at noon at a cottage to which the farmer recommended her Thence she started on foot basket in hand to reach the wide upland of heath dividing this district from the low lying meads of a further valley in which the dairy stood that was the aim and end of her day s pilgrimage Tess had never before visited this part of the country and yet she felt akin to the landscape Not so very far to the left of her she could discern a dark patch in the scenery which inquiry confirmed her in supposing to be trees marking the environs of Kingsbere in the church of which parish the bones of her ancestors her useless ancestors lay entombed She had no admiration for them now she almost hated them for the dance they had led her not a thing of all that had been theirs did she retain but the old seal and spoon Pooh I have as much of mother as father in me she said All my prettiness comes from her and she was only a dairymaid The journey over the intervening uplands and lowlands of Egdon when she reached them was a more troublesome walk than she had anticipated the distance being actually but a few miles It was two hours owing to sundry wrong turnings ere she found herself on a summit commanding the long sought for vale the Valley of the Great Dairies the valley in which milk and butter grew to rankness and were produced more profusely if less delicately than at her home the verdant plain so well watered by the river Var or Froom It was intrinsically different from the Vale of Little Dairies Blackmoor Vale which save during her disastrous sojourn at Trantridge she had exclusively known till now The world was drawn to a larger pattern here The enclosures numbered fifty acres instead of ten the farmsteads were more extended the groups of cattle formed tribes hereabout there only families These myriads of cows stretching under her eyes from the far east to the far west outnumbered any she had ever seen at one glance before The green lea was speckled as thickly with them as a canvas by Van Alsloot or Sallaert with burghers The ripe hue of the red and dun kine absorbed the evening sunlight which the white coated animals returned to the eye in rays almost dazzling even at the distant elevation on which she stood The bird s eye perspective before her was not so luxuriantly beautiful perhaps as that other one which she knew so well yet it was more cheering It lacked the intensely blue atmosphere of the rival vale and its heavy soils and scents the new air was clear bracing ethereal The river itself which nourished the grass and cows of these renowned dairies flowed not like the streams in Blackmoor Those were slow silent often turbid flowing over beds of mud into which the incautious wader might sink and vanish unawares The Froom waters were clear as the pure River of Life shown to the Evangelist rapid as the shadow of a cloud with pebbly shallows that prattled to the sky all day long There the water flower was the lily the crow foot here Either the change in the quality of the air from heavy to light or the sense of being amid new scenes where there were no invidious eyes upon her sent up her spirits wonderfully Her hopes mingled with the sunshine in an ideal photosphere which surrounded her as she bounded along against the soft south wind She heard a pleasant voice in every breeze and in every bird s note seemed to lurk a joy Her face had latterly changed with changing states of mind continually fluctuating between beauty and ordinariness according as the thoughts were gay or grave One day she was pink and flawless another pale and tragical When she was pink she was feeling less than when pale her more perfect beauty accorded with her less elevated mood her more intense mood with her less perfect beauty It was her best face physically that was now set against the south wind The irresistible universal automatic tendency to find sweet pleasure somewhere which pervades all life from the meanest to the highest had at length mastered Tess Being even now only a young woman of twenty one who mentally and sentimentally had not finished growing it was impossible that any event should have left upon her an impression that was not in time capable of transmutation And thus her spirits and her thankfulness and her hopes rose higher and higher She tried several ballads but found them inadequate till recollecting the psalter that her eyes had so often wandered over of a Sunday morning before she had eaten of the tree of knowledge she chanted O ye Sun and Moon O ye Stars ye Green Things upon the Earth ye Fowls of the Air Beasts and Cattle Children of Men bless ye the Lord praise Him and magnify Him for ever She suddenly stopped and murmured But perhaps I don t quite know the Lord as yet And probably the half unconscious rhapsody was a Fetishistic utterance in a Monotheistic setting women whose chief companions are the forms and forces of outdoor Nature retain in their souls far more of the Pagan fantasy of their remote forefathers than of the systematized religion taught their race at later date However Tess found at least approximate expression for her feelings in the old Benedicite that she had lisped from infancy and it was enough Such high contentment with such a slight initial performance as that of having started towards a means of independent living was a part of the Durbeyfield temperament Tess really wished to walk uprightly while her father did nothing of the kind but she resembled him in being content with immediate and small achievements and in having no mind for laborious effort towards such petty social advancement as could alone be effected by a family so heavily handicapped as the once powerful d Urbervilles were now There was it might be said the energy of her mother s unexpended family as well as the natural energy of Tess s years rekindled after the experience which had so overwhelmed her for the time Let the truth be told women do as a rule live through such humiliations and regain their spirits and again look about them with an interested eye While there s life there s hope is a conviction not so entirely unknown to the betrayed as some amiable theorists would have us believe Tess Durbeyfield then in good heart and full of zest for life descended the Egdon slopes lower and lower towards the dairy of her pilgrimage The marked difference in the final particular between the rival vales now showed itself The secret of Blackmoor was best discovered from the heights around to read aright the valley before her it was necessary to descend into its midst When Tess had accomplished this feat she found herself to be standing on a carpeted level which stretched to the east and west as far as the eye could reach The river had stolen from the higher tracts and brought in particles to the vale all this horizontal land and now exhausted aged and attenuated lay serpentining along through the midst of its former spoils Not quite sure of her direction Tess stood still upon the hemmed expanse of verdant flatness like a fly on a billiard table of indefinite length and of no more consequence to the surroundings than that fly The sole effect of her presence upon the placid valley so far had been to excite the mind of a solitary heron which after descending to the ground not far from her path stood with neck erect looking at her Suddenly there arose from all parts of the lowland a prolonged and repeated call Waow waow waow From the furthest east to the furthest west the cries spread as if by contagion accompanied in some cases by the barking of a dog It was not the expression of the valley s consciousness that beautiful Tess had arrived but the ordinary announcement of milking time half past four o clock when the dairymen set about getting in the cows The red and white herd nearest at hand which had been phlegmatically waiting for the call now trooped towards the steading in the background their great bags of milk swinging under them as they walked Tess followed slowly in their rear and entered the barton by the open gate through which they had entered before her Long thatched sheds stretched round the enclosure their slopes encrusted with vivid green moss and their eaves supported by wooden posts rubbed to a glossy smoothness by the flanks of infinite cows and calves of bygone years now passed to an oblivion almost inconceivable in its profundity Between the post were ranged the milchers each exhibiting herself at the present moment to a whimsical eye in the rear as a circle on two stalks down the centre of which a switch moved pendulum wise while the sun lowering itself behind this patient row threw their shadows accurately inwards upon the wall Thus it threw shadows of these obscure and homely figures every evening with as much care over each contour as if it had been the profile of a court beauty on a palace wall copied them as diligently as it had copied Olympian shapes on marble facades long ago or the outline of Alexander Caesar and the Pharaohs They were the less restful cows that were stalled Those that would stand still of their own will were milked in the middle of the yard where many of such better behaved ones stood waiting now all prime milchers such as were seldom seen out of this valley and not always within it nourished by the succulent feed which the water meads supplied at this prime season of the year Those of them that were spotted with white reflected the sunshine in dazzling brilliancy and the polished brass knobs of their horns glittered with something of military display Their large veined udders hung ponderous as sandbags the teats sticking out like the legs of a gipsy s crock and as each animal lingered for her turn to arrive the milk oozed forth and fell in drops to the ground XVII The dairymaids and men had flocked down from their cottages and out of the dairy house with the arrival of the cows from the meads the maids walking in pattens not on account of the weather but to keep their shoes above the mulch of the barton Each girl sat down on her three legged stool her face sideways her right cheek resting against the cow and looked musingly along the animal s flank at Tess as she approached The male milkers with hat brims turned down resting flat on their foreheads and gazing on the ground did not observe her One of these was a sturdy middle aged man whose long white pinner was somewhat finer and cleaner than the wraps of the others and whose jacket underneath had a presentable marketing aspect the master dairyman of whom she was in quest his double character as a working milker and butter maker here during six days and on the seventh as a man in shining broad cloth in his family pew at church being so marked as to have inspired a rhyme Dairyman Dick All the week On Sundays Mister Richard Crick Seeing Tess standing at gaze he went across to her The majority of dairymen have a cross manner at milking time but it happened that mister Crick was glad to get a new hand for the days were busy ones now and he received her warmly inquiring for her mother and the rest of the family though this as a matter of form merely for in reality he had not been aware of missus Durbeyfield s existence till apprised of the fact by a brief business letter about Tess Oh ay as a lad I knowed your part o the country very well he said terminatively Though I ve never been there since And a aged woman of ninety that use to live nigh here but is dead and gone long ago told me that a family of some such name as yours in Blackmoor Vale came originally from these parts and that twere a old ancient race that had all but perished off the earth though the new generations didn t know it But Lord I took no notice of the old woman s ramblings not I Oh no it is nothing said Tess Then the talk was of business only You can milk em clean my maidy I don t want my cows going azew at this time o year She reassured him on that point and he surveyed her up and down She had been staying indoors a good deal and her complexion had grown delicate Quite sure you can stand it Tis comfortable enough here for rough folk but we don t live in a cowcumber frame She declared that she could stand it and her zest and willingness seemed to win him over Well I suppose you ll want a dish o tay or victuals of some sort hey Not yet Well do as ye like about it But faith if twas I I should be as dry as a kex wi travelling so far I ll begin milking now to get my hand in said Tess She drank a little milk as temporary refreshment to the surprise indeed slight contempt of Dairyman Crick to whose mind it had apparently never occurred that milk was good as a beverage Oh if ye can swaller that be it so he said indifferently while holding up the pail that she sipped from Tis what I hain t touched for years not I Rot the stuff it would lie in my innerds like lead You can try your hand upon she he pursued nodding to the nearest cow Not but what she do milk rather hard We ve hard ones and we ve easy ones like other folks However you ll find out that soon enough When Tess had changed her bonnet for a hood and was really on her stool under the cow and the milk was squirting from her fists into the pail she appeared to feel that she really had laid a new foundation for her future The conviction bred serenity her pulse slowed and she was able to look about her The milkers formed quite a little battalion of men and maids the men operating on the hard teated animals the maids on the kindlier natures It was a large dairy There were nearly a hundred milchers under Crick s management all told and of the herd the master dairyman milked six or eight with his own hands unless away from home These were the cows that milked hardest of all for his journey milkmen being more or less casually hired he would not entrust this half dozen to their treatment lest from indifference they should not milk them fully nor to the maids lest they should fail in the same way for lack of finger grip with the result that in course of time the cows would go azew that is dry up It was not the loss for the moment that made slack milking so serious but that with the decline of demand there came decline and ultimately cessation of supply After Tess had settled down to her cow there was for a time no talk in the barton and not a sound interfered with the purr of the milk jets into the numerous pails except a momentary exclamation to one or other of the beasts requesting her to turn round or stand still The only movements were those of the milkers hands up and down and the swing of the cows tails Thus they all worked on encompassed by the vast flat mead which extended to either slope of the valley a level landscape compounded of old landscapes long forgotten and no doubt differing in character very greatly from the landscape they composed now To my thinking said the dairyman rising suddenly from a cow he had just finished off snatching up his three legged stool in one hand and the pail in the other and moving on to the next hard yielder in his vicinity to my thinking the cows don t gie down their milk to day as usual Upon my life if Winker do begin keeping back like this she ll not be worth going under by midsummer Tis because there s a new hand come among us said Jonathan Kail I ve noticed such things afore To be sure It may be so I didn t think o t I ve been told that it goes up into their horns at such times said a dairymaid Well as to going up into their horns replied Dairyman Crick dubiously as though even witchcraft might be limited by anatomical possibilities I couldn t say I certainly could not But as nott cows will keep it back as well as the horned ones I don t quite agree to it Do ye know that riddle about the nott cows Jonathan Why do nott cows give less milk in a year than horned I don t interposed the milkmaid Why do they Because there bain t so many of em said the dairyman Howsomever these gam sters do certainly keep back their milk to day Folks we must lift up a stave or two that s the only cure for t Songs were often resorted to in dairies hereabout as an enticement to the cows when they showed signs of withholding their usual yield and the band of milkers at this request burst into melody in purely business like tones it is true and with no great spontaneity the result according to their own belief being a decided improvement during the song s continuance When they had gone through fourteen or fifteen verses of a cheerful ballad about a murderer who was afraid to go to bed in the dark because he saw certain brimstone flames around him one of the male milkers said I wish singing on the stoop didn t use up so much of a man s wind You should get your harp sir not but what a fiddle is best Tess who had given ear to this thought the words were addressed to the dairyman but she was wrong A reply in the shape of Why came as it were out of the belly of a dun cow in the stalls it had been spoken by a milker behind the animal whom she had not hitherto perceived Oh yes there s nothing like a fiddle said the dairyman Though I do think that bulls are more moved by a tune than cows at least that s my experience Once there was an old aged man over at Mellstock William Dewy by name one of the family that used to do a good deal of business as tranters over there Jonathan do ye mind I knowed the man by sight as well as I know my own brother in a manner of speaking Well this man was a coming home along from a wedding where he had been playing his fiddle one fine moonlight night and for shortness sake he took a cut across Forty acres a field lying that way where a bull was out to grass The bull seed William and took after him horns aground begad and though William runned his best and hadn t MUCH drink in him considering twas a wedding and the folks well off he found he d never reach the fence and get over in time to save himself Well as a last thought he pulled out his fiddle as he runned and struck up a jig turning to the bull and backing towards the corner The bull softened down and stood still looking hard at William Dewy who fiddled on and on till a sort of a smile stole over the bull s face But no sooner did William stop his playing and turn to get over hedge than the bull would stop his smiling and lower his horns towards the seat of William s breeches Well William had to turn about and play on willy nilly and twas only three o clock in the world and a knowed that nobody would come that way for hours and he so leery and tired that a didn t know what to do When he had scraped till about four o clock he felt that he verily would have to give over soon and he said to himself There s only this last tune between me and eternal welfare Heaven save me or I m a done man Well then he called to mind how he d seen the cattle kneel o Christmas Eves in the dead o night It was not Christmas Eve then but it came into his head to play a trick upon the bull So he broke into the Tivity Hymm just as at Christmas carol singing when lo and behold down went the bull on his bended knees in his ignorance just as if twere the true Tivity night and hour As soon as his horned friend were down William turned clinked off like a long dog and jumped safe over hedge before the praying bull had got on his feet again to take after him William used to say that he d seen a man look a fool a good many times but never such a fool as that bull looked when he found his pious feelings had been played upon and twas not Christmas Eve Yes William Dewy that was the man s name and I can tell you to a foot where s he a lying in Mellstock Churchyard at this very moment just between the second yew tree and the north aisle It s a curious story it carries us back to medieval times when faith was a living thing The remark singular for a dairy yard was murmured by the voice behind the dun cow but as nobody understood the reference no notice was taken except that the narrator seemed to think it might imply scepticism as to his tale Well tis quite true sir whether or no I knowed the man well Oh yes I have no doubt of it said the person behind the dun cow Tess s attention was thus attracted to the dairyman s interlocutor of whom she could see but the merest patch owing to his burying his head so persistently in the flank of the milcher She could not understand why he should be addressed as sir even by the dairyman himself But no explanation was discernible he remained under the cow long enough to have milked three uttering a private ejaculation now and then as if he could not get on Take it gentle sir take it gentle said the dairyman Tis knack not strength that does it So I find said the other standing up at last and stretching his arms I think I have finished her however though she made my fingers ache Tess could then see him at full length He wore the ordinary white pinner and leather leggings of a dairy farmer when milking and his boots were clogged with the mulch of the yard but this was all his local livery Beneath it was something educated reserved subtle sad differing But the details of his aspect were temporarily thrust aside by the discovery that he was one whom she had seen before Such vicissitudes had Tess passed through since that time that for a moment she could not remember where she had met him and then it flashed upon her that he was the pedestrian who had joined in the club dance at Marlott the passing stranger who had come she knew not whence had danced with others but not with her and slightingly left her and gone on his way with his friends The flood of memories brought back by this revival of an incident anterior to her troubles produced a momentary dismay lest recognizing her also he should by some means discover her story But it passed away when she found no sign of remembrance in him She saw by degrees that since their first and only encounter his mobile face had grown more thoughtful and had acquired a young man s shapely moustache and beard the latter of the palest straw colour where it began upon his cheeks and deepening to a warm brown farther from its root Under his linen milking pinner he wore a dark velveteen jacket cord breeches and gaiters and a starched white shirt Without the milking gear nobody could have guessed what he was He might with equal probability have been an eccentric landowner or a gentlemanly ploughman That he was but a novice at dairy work she had realized in a moment from the time he had spent upon the milking of one cow Meanwhile many of the milkmaids had said to one another of the newcomer How pretty she is with something of real generosity and admiration though with a half hope that the auditors would qualify the assertion which strictly speaking they might have done prettiness being an inexact definition of what struck the eye in Tess When the milking was finished for the evening they straggled indoors where missus Crick the dairyman s wife who was too respectable to go out milking herself and wore a hot stuff gown in warm weather because the dairymaids wore prints was giving an eye to the leads and things Only two or three of the maids Tess learnt slept in the dairy house besides herself most of the helpers going to their homes She saw nothing at supper time of the superior milker who had commented on the story and asked no questions about him the remainder of the evening being occupied in arranging her place in the bed chamber It was a large room over the milk house some thirty feet long the sleeping cots of the other three indoor milkmaids being in the same apartment They were blooming young women and except one rather older than herself By bedtime Tess was thoroughly tired and fell asleep immediately But one of the girls who occupied an adjoining bed was more wakeful than Tess and would insist upon relating to the latter various particulars of the homestead into which she had just entered The girl s whispered words mingled with the shades and to Tess s drowsy mind they seemed to be generated by the darkness in which they floated mister Angel Clare he that is learning milking and that plays the harp never says much to us He is a pa son s son and is too much taken up wi his own thoughts to notice girls He is the dairyman s pupil learning farming in all its branches He has learnt sheep farming at another place and he s now mastering dairy work Yes he is quite the gentleman born His father is the Reverent mister Clare at Emminster a good many miles from here Oh I have heard of him said her companion now awake A very earnest clergyman is he not Yes that he is the earnestest man in all Wessex they say the last of the old Low Church sort they tell me for all about here be what they call High All his sons except our mister Clare be made pa sons too Tess had not at this hour the curiosity to ask why the present mister Clare was not made a parson like his brethren and gradually fell asleep again the words of her informant coming to her along with the smell of the cheeses in the adjoining cheeseloft and the measured dripping of the whey from the wrings downstairs XVIII Angel Clare rises out of the past not altogether as a distinct figure but as an appreciative voice a long regard of fixed abstracted eyes and a mobility of mouth somewhat too small and delicately lined for a man s though with an unexpectedly firm close of the lower lip now and then enough to do away with any inference of indecision Nevertheless something nebulous preoccupied vague in his bearing and regard marked him as one who probably had no very definite aim or concern about his material future Yet as a lad people had said of him that he was one who might do anything if he tried He was the youngest son of his father a poor parson at the other end of the county and had arrived at Talbothays Dairy as a six months pupil after going the round of some other farms his object being to acquire a practical skill in the various processes of farming with a view either to the Colonies or the tenure of a home farm as circumstances might decide His entry into the ranks of the agriculturists and breeders was a step in the young man s career which had been anticipated neither by himself nor by others mister Clare the elder whose first wife had died and left him a daughter married a second late in life This lady had somewhat unexpectedly brought him three sons so that between Angel the youngest and his father the Vicar there seemed to be almost a missing generation Of these boys the aforesaid Angel the child of his old age was the only son who had not taken a University degree though he was the single one of them whose early promise might have done full justice to an academical training Some two or three years before Angel s appearance at the Marlott dance on a day when he had left school and was pursuing his studies at home a parcel came to the Vicarage from the local bookseller s directed to the Reverend James Clare The Vicar having opened it and found it to contain a book read a few pages whereupon he jumped up from his seat and went straight to the shop with the book under his arm Why has this been sent to my house he asked peremptorily holding up the volume It was ordered sir Not by me or any one belonging to me I am happy to say The shopkeeper looked into his order book Oh it has been misdirected sir he said It was ordered by mister Angel Clare and should have been sent to him mister Clare winced as if he had been struck He went home pale and dejected and called Angel into his study Look into this book my boy he said What do you know about it I ordered it said Angel simply What for To read How can you think of reading it How can I Why it is a system of philosophy There is no more moral or even religious work published Yes moral enough I don t deny that But religious and for YOU who intend to be a minister of the Gospel Since you have alluded to the matter father said the son with anxious thought upon his face I should like to say once for all that I should prefer not to take Orders I fear I could not conscientiously do so I love the Church as one loves a parent I shall always have the warmest affection for her There is no institution for whose history I have a deeper admiration but I cannot honestly be ordained her minister as my brothers are while she refuses to liberate her mind from an untenable redemptive theolatry It had never occurred to the straightforward and simple minded Vicar that one of his own flesh and blood could come to this He was stultified shocked paralysed And if Angel were not going to enter the Church what was the use of sending him to Cambridge The University as a step to anything but ordination seemed to this man of fixed ideas a preface without a volume He was a man not merely religious but devout a firm believer not as the phrase is now elusively construed by theological thimble riggers in the Church and out of it but in the old and ardent sense of the Evangelical school one who could Indeed opine That the Eternal and Divine Did eighteen centuries ago In very truth Angel s father tried argument persuasion entreaty No father I cannot underwrite Article Four leave alone the rest taking it in the literal and grammatical sense as required by the Declaration and therefore I can t be a parson in the present state of affairs said Angel My whole instinct in matters of religion is towards reconstruction to quote your favorite Epistle to the Hebrews the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain His father grieved so deeply that it made Angel quite ill to see him What is the good of your mother and me economizing and stinting ourselves to give you a University education if it is not to be used for the honour and glory of God his father repeated Why that it may be used for the honour and glory of man father Perhaps if Angel had persevered he might have gone to Cambridge like his brothers But the Vicar s view of that seat of learning as a stepping stone to Orders alone was quite a family tradition and so rooted was the idea in his mind that perseverance began to appear to the sensitive son akin to an intent to misappropriate a trust and wrong the pious heads of the household who had been and were as his father had hinted compelled to exercise much thrift to carry out this uniform plan of education for the three young men I will do without Cambridge said Angel at last I feel that I have no right to go there in the circumstances The effects of this decisive debate were not long in showing themselves He spent years and years in desultory studies undertakings and meditations he began to evince considerable indifference to social forms and observances The material distinctions of rank and wealth he increasingly despised Even the good old family to use a favourite phrase of a late local worthy had no aroma for him unless there were good new resolutions in its representatives As a balance to these austerities when he went to live in London to see what the world was like and with a view to practising a profession or business there he was carried off his head and nearly entrapped by a woman much older than himself though luckily he escaped not greatly the worse for the experience Early association with country solitudes had bred in him an unconquerable and almost unreasonable aversion to modern town life and shut him out from such success as he might have aspired to by following a mundane calling in the impracticability of the spiritual one But something had to be done he had wasted many valuable years and having an acquaintance who was starting on a thriving life as a Colonial farmer it occurred to Angel that this might be a lead in the right direction Farming either in the Colonies America or at home farming at any rate after becoming well qualified for the business by a careful apprenticeship that was a vocation which would probably afford an independence without the sacrifice of what he valued even more than a competency intellectual liberty So we find Angel Clare at six and twenty here at Talbothays as a student of kine and as there were no houses near at hand in which he could get a comfortable lodging a boarder at the dairyman s His room was an immense attic which ran the whole length of the dairy house It could only be reached by a ladder from the cheese loft and had been closed up for a long time till he arrived and selected it as his retreat Here Clare had plenty of space and could often be heard by the dairy folk pacing up and down when the household had gone to rest A portion was divided off at one end by a curtain behind which was his bed the outer part being furnished as a homely sitting room At first he lived up above entirely reading a good deal and strumming upon an old harp which he had bought at a sale saying when in a bitter humour that he might have to get his living by it in the streets some day But he soon preferred to read human nature by taking his meals downstairs in the general dining kitchen with the dairyman and his wife and the maids and men who all together formed a lively assembly for though but few milking hands slept in the house several joined the family at meals The longer Clare resided here the less objection had he to his company and the more did he like to share quarters with them in common Much to his surprise he took indeed a real delight in their companionship The conventional farm folk of his imagination personified in the newspaper press by the pitiable dummy known as Hodge were obliterated after a few days residence At close quarters no Hodge was to be seen At first it is true when Clare s intelligence was fresh from a contrasting society these friends with whom he now hobnobbed seemed a little strange Sitting down as a level member of the dairyman s household seemed at the outset an undignified proceeding The ideas the modes the surroundings appeared retrogressive and unmeaning But with living on there day after day the acute sojourner became conscious of a new aspect in the spectacle Without any objective change whatever variety had taken the place of monotonousness His host and his host s household his men and his maids as they became intimately known to Clare began to differentiate themselves as in a chemical process The thought of Pascal s was brought home to him A mesure qu on a plus d esprit on trouve qu il y a plus d hommes originaux Les gens du commun ne trouvent pas de difference entre les hommes The typical and unvarying Hodge ceased to exist He had been disintegrated into a number of varied fellow creatures beings of many minds beings infinite in difference some happy many serene a few depressed one here and there bright even to genius some stupid others wanton others austere some mutely Miltonic some potentially Cromwellian into men who had private views of each other as he had of his friends who could applaud or condemn each other amuse or sadden themselves by the contemplation of each other s foibles or vices men every one of whom walked in his own individual way the road to dusty death Unexpectedly he began to like the outdoor life for its own sake and for what it brought apart from its bearing on his own proposed career Considering his position he became wonderfully free from the chronic melancholy which is taking hold of the civilized races with the decline of belief in a beneficent Power For the first time of late years he could read as his musings inclined him without any eye to cramming for a profession since the few farming handbooks which he deemed it desirable to master occupied him but little time He grew away from old associations and saw something new in life and humanity Secondarily he made close acquaintance with phenomena which he had before known but darkly the seasons in their moods morning and evening night and noon winds in their different tempers trees waters and mists shades and silences and the voices of inanimate things The early mornings were still sufficiently cool to render a fire acceptable in the large room wherein they breakfasted and by missus Crick s orders who held that he was too genteel to mess at their table it was Angel Clare s custom to sit in the yawning chimney corner during the meal his cup and saucer and plate being placed on a hinged flap at his elbow The light from the long wide mullioned window opposite shone in upon his nook and assisted by a secondary light of cold blue quality which shone down the chimney enabled him to read there easily whenever disposed to do so Between Clare and the window was the table at which his companions sat their munching profiles rising sharp against the panes while to the side was the milk house door through which were visible the rectangular leads in rows full to the brim with the morning s milk At the further end the great churn could be seen revolving and its slip slopping heard the moving power being discernible through the window in the form of a spiritless horse walking in a circle and driven by a boy For several days after Tess s arrival Clare sitting abstractedly reading from some book periodical or piece of music just come by post hardly noticed that she was present at table She talked so little and the other maids talked so much that the babble did not strike him as possessing a new note and he was ever in the habit of neglecting the particulars of an outward scene for the general impression One day however when he had been conning one of his music scores and by force of imagination was hearing the tune in his head he lapsed into listlessness and the music sheet rolled to the hearth He looked at the fire of logs with its one flame pirouetting on the top in a dying dance after the breakfast cooking and boiling and it seemed to jig to his inward tune also at the two chimney crooks dangling down from the cotterel or cross bar plumed with soot which quivered to the same melody also at the half empty kettle whining an accompaniment The conversation at the table mixed in with his phantasmal orchestra till he thought What a fluty voice one of those milkmaids has I suppose it is the new one Clare looked round upon her seated with the others She was not looking towards him Indeed owing to his long silence his presence in the room was almost forgotten I don t know about ghosts she was saying but I do know that our souls can be made to go outside our bodies when we are alive The dairyman turned to her with his mouth full his eyes charged with serious inquiry and his great knife and fork breakfasts were breakfasts here planted erect on the table like the beginning of a gallows What really now And is it so maidy he said A very easy way to feel em go continued Tess is to lie on the grass at night and look straight up at some big bright star and by fixing your mind upon it you will soon find that you are hundreds and hundreds o miles away from your body which you don t seem to want at all The dairyman removed his hard gaze from Tess and fixed it on his wife Now that s a rum thing Christianer hey To think o the miles I ve vamped o starlight nights these last thirty year courting or trading or for doctor or for nurse and yet never had the least notion o that till now or feeled my soul rise so much as an inch above my shirt collar The general attention being drawn to her including that of the dairyman s pupil Tess flushed and remarking evasively that it was only a fancy resumed her breakfast Clare continued to observe her She soon finished her eating and having a consciousness that Clare was regarding her began to trace imaginary patterns on the tablecloth with her forefinger with the constraint of a domestic animal that perceives itself to be watched What a fresh and virginal daughter of Nature that milkmaid is he said to himself And then he seemed to discern in her something that was familiar something which carried him back into a joyous and unforeseeing past before the necessity of taking thought had made the heavens gray He concluded that he had beheld her before where he could not tell A casual encounter during some country ramble it certainly had been and he was not greatly curious about it But the circumstance was sufficient to lead him to select Tess in preference to the other pretty milkmaids when he wished to contemplate contiguous womankind XIX In general the cows were milked as they presented themselves without fancy or choice But certain cows will show a fondness for a particular pair of hands sometimes carrying this predilection so far as to refuse to stand at all except to their favourite the pail of a stranger being unceremoniously kicked over It was Dairyman Crick s rule to insist on breaking down these partialities and aversions by constant interchange since otherwise in the event of a milkman or maid going away from the dairy he was placed in a difficulty The maids private aims however were the reverse of the dairyman s rule the daily selection by each damsel of the eight or ten cows to which she had grown accustomed rendering the operation on their willing udders surprisingly easy and effortless Tess like her compeers soon discovered which of the cows had a preference for her style of manipulation and her fingers having become delicate from the long domiciliary imprisonments to which she had subjected herself at intervals during the last two or three years she would have been glad to meet the milchers views in this respect Out of the whole ninety five there were eight in particular Dumpling Fancy Lofty Mist Old Pretty Young Pretty Tidy and Loud who though the teats of one or two were as hard as carrots gave down to her with a readiness that made her work on them a mere touch of the fingers Knowing however the dairyman s wish she endeavoured conscientiously to take the animals just as they came excepting the very hard yielders which she could not yet manage But she soon found a curious correspondence between the ostensibly chance position of the cows and her wishes in this matter till she felt that their order could not be the result of accident The dairyman s pupil had lent a hand in getting the cows together of late and at the fifth or sixth time she turned her eyes as she rested against the cow full of sly inquiry upon him mister Clare you have ranged the cows she said blushing and in making the accusation symptoms of a smile gently lifted her upper lip in spite of her so as to show the tips of her teeth the lower lip remaining severely still Well it makes no difference said he You will always be here to milk them Do you think so I HOPE I shall But I don t KNOW She was angry with herself afterwards thinking that he unaware of her grave reasons for liking this seclusion might have mistaken her meaning She had spoken so earnestly to him as if his presence were somehow a factor in her wish Her misgiving was such that at dusk when the milking was over she walked in the garden alone to continue her regrets that she had disclosed to him her discovery of his considerateness It was a typical summer evening in June the atmosphere being in such delicate equilibrium and so transmissive that inanimate objects seemed endowed with two or three senses if not five There was no distinction between the near and the far and an auditor felt close to everything within the horizon The soundlessness impressed her as a positive entity rather than as the mere negation of noise It was broken by the strumming of strings Tess had heard those notes in the attic above her head Dim flattened constrained by their confinement they had never appealed to her as now when they wandered in the still air with a stark quality like that of nudity To speak absolutely both instrument and execution were poor but the relative is all and as she listened Tess like a fascinated bird could not leave the spot Far from leaving she drew up towards the performer keeping behind the hedge that he might not guess her presence The outskirt of the garden in which Tess found herself had been left uncultivated for some years and was now damp and rank with juicy grass which sent up mists of pollen at a touch and with tall blooming weeds emitting offensive smells weeds whose red and yellow and purple hues formed a polychrome as dazzling as that of cultivated flowers She went stealthily as a cat through this profusion of growth gathering cuckoo spittle on her skirts cracking snails that were underfoot staining her hands with thistle milk and slug slime and rubbing off upon her naked arms sticky blights which though snow white on the apple tree trunks made madder stains on her skin thus she drew quite near to Clare still unobserved of him Tess was conscious of neither time nor space The exaltation which she had described as being producible at will by gazing at a star came now without any determination of hers she undulated upon the thin notes of the second hand harp and their harmonies passed like breezes through her bringing tears into her eyes The floating pollen seemed to be his notes made visible and the dampness of the garden the weeping of the garden s sensibility Though near nightfall the rank smelling weed flowers glowed as if they would not close for intentness and the waves of colour mixed with the waves of sound The light which still shone was derived mainly from a large hole in the western bank of cloud it was like a piece of day left behind by accident dusk having closed in elsewhere He concluded his plaintive melody a very simple performance demanding no great skill and she waited thinking another might be begun But tired of playing he had desultorily come round the fence and was rambling up behind her Tess her cheeks on fire moved away furtively as if hardly moving at all Angel however saw her light summer gown and he spoke his low tones reaching her though he was some distance off What makes you draw off in that way Tess said he Are you afraid Oh no sir not of outdoor things especially just now when the apple blooth is falling and everything is so green But you have your indoor fears eh Well yes sir What of I couldn t quite say The milk turning sour No Life in general Yes sir Ah so have I very often This hobble of being alive is rather serious don t you think so It is now you put it that way All the same I shouldn t have expected a young girl like you to see it so just yet How is it you do She maintained a hesitating silence Come Tess tell me in confidence She thought that he meant what were the aspects of things to her and replied shyly The trees have inquisitive eyes haven t they that is seem as if they had And the river says Why do ye trouble me with your looks And you seem to see numbers of to morrows just all in a line the first of them the biggest and clearest the others getting smaller and smaller as they stand farther away but they all seem very fierce and cruel and as if they said I m coming Beware of me Beware of me But YOU sir can raise up dreams with your music and drive all such horrid fancies away He was surprised to find this young woman who though but a milkmaid had just that touch of rarity about her which might make her the envied of her housemates shaping such sad imaginings She was expressing in her own native phrases assisted a little by her Sixth Standard training feelings which might almost have been called those of the age the ache of modernism The perception arrested him less when he reflected that what are called advanced ideas are really in great part but the latest fashion in definition a more accurate expression by words in logy and ism of sensations which men and women have vaguely grasped for centuries Still it was strange that they should have come to her while yet so young more than strange it was impressive interesting pathetic Not guessing the cause there was nothing to remind him that experience is as to intensity and not as to duration Tess s passing corporeal blight had been her mental harvest Tess on her part could not understand why a man of clerical family and good education and above physical want should look upon it as a mishap to be alive For the unhappy pilgrim herself there was very good reason But how could this admirable and poetic man ever have descended into the Valley of Humiliation have felt with the man of Uz as she herself had felt two or three years ago My soul chooseth strangling and death rather than my life I loathe it I would not live alway It was true that he was at present out of his class But she knew that was only because like Peter the Great in a shipwright s yard he was studying what he wanted to know He did not milk cows because he was obliged to milk cows but because he was learning to be a rich and prosperous dairyman landowner agriculturist and breeder of cattle He would become an American or Australian Abraham commanding like a monarch his flocks and his herds his spotted and his ring straked his men servants and his maids At times nevertheless it did seem unaccountable to her that a decidedly bookish musical thinking young man should have chosen deliberately to be a farmer and not a clergyman like his father and brothers Thus neither having the clue to the other s secret they were respectively puzzled at what each revealed and awaited new knowledge of each other s character and mood without attempting to pry into each other s history Every day every hour brought to him one more little stroke of her nature and to her one more of his Tess was trying to lead a repressed life but she little divined the strength of her own vitality At first Tess seemed to regard Angel Clare as an intelligence rather than as a man As such she compared him with herself and at every discovery of the abundance of his illuminations of the distance between her own modest mental standpoint and the unmeasurable Andean altitude of his she became quite dejected disheartened from all further effort on her own part whatever He observed her dejection one day when he had casually mentioned something to her about pastoral life in ancient Greece She was gathering the buds called lords and ladies from the bank while he spoke Why do you look so woebegone all of a sudden he asked Oh tis only about my own self she said with a frail laugh of sadness fitfully beginning to peel a lady meanwhile Just a sense of what might have been with me My life looks as if it had been wasted for want of chances When I see what you know what you have read and seen and thought I feel what a nothing I am I m like the poor Queen of Sheba who lived in the Bible There is no more spirit in me Bless my soul don t go troubling about that Why he said with some enthusiasm I should be only too glad my dear Tess to help you to anything in the way of history or any line of reading you would like to take up It is a lady again interrupted she holding out the bud she had peeled What I meant that there are always more ladies than lords when you come to peel them Never mind about the lords and ladies Would you like to take up any course of study history for example Sometimes I feel I don t want to know anything more about it than I know already Why not Because what s the use of learning that I am one of a long row only finding out that there is set down in some old book somebody just like me and to know that I shall only act her part making me sad that s all The best is not to remember that your nature and your past doings have been just like thousands and thousands and that your coming life and doings ll be like thousands s and thousands What really then you don t want to learn anything I shouldn t mind learning why why the sun do shine on the just and the unjust alike she answered with a slight quaver in her voice But that s what books will not tell me Tess fie for such bitterness Of course he spoke with a conventional sense of duty only for that sort of wondering had not been unknown to himself in bygone days And as he looked at the unpracticed mouth and lips he thought that such a daughter of the soil could only have caught up the sentiment by rote She went on peeling the lords and ladies till Clare regarding for a moment the wave like curl of her lashes as they dropped with her bent gaze on her soft cheek lingeringly went away When he was gone she stood awhile thoughtfully peeling the last bud and then awakening from her reverie flung it and all the crowd of floral nobility impatiently on the ground in an ebullition of displeasure with herself for her niaiserie and with a quickening warmth in her heart of hearts How stupid he must think her In an access of hunger for his good opinion she bethought herself of what she had latterly endeavoured to forget so unpleasant had been its issues the identity of her family with that of the knightly d Urbervilles Barren attribute as it was disastrous as its discovery had been in many ways to her perhaps mister Clare as a gentleman and a student of history would respect her sufficiently to forget her childish conduct with the lords and ladies if he knew that those Purbeck marble and alabaster people in Kingsbere Church really represented her own lineal forefathers that she was no spurious d Urberville compounded of money and ambition like those at Trantridge but true d Urberville to the bone But before venturing to make the revelation dubious Tess indirectly sounded the dairyman as to its possible effect upon mister Clare by asking the former if mister Clare had any great respect for old county families when they had lost all their money and land mister Clare said the dairyman emphatically is one of the most rebellest rozums you ever knowed not a bit like the rest of his family and if there s one thing that he do hate more than another tis the notion of what s called a old family He says that it stands to reason that old families have done their spurt of work in past days and can t have anything left in em now There s the Billets and the Drenkhards and the Greys and the saint Quintins and the Hardys and the Goulds who used to own the lands for miles down this valley you could buy em all up now for an old song a most Why our little Retty Priddle here you know is one of the Paridelles the old family that used to own lots o the lands out by King s Hintock now owned by the Earl o Wessex afore even he or his was heard of Well mister Clare found this out and spoke quite scornful to the poor girl for days Ah he says to her you ll never make a good dairymaid All your skill was used up ages ago in Palestine and you must lie fallow for a thousand years to git strength for more deeds A boy came here t other day asking for a job and said his name was Matt and when we asked him his surname he said he d never heard that a had any surname and when we asked why he said he supposed his folks hadn t been stablished long enough Ah you re the very boy I want says mister Clare jumping up and shaking hands wi en I ve great hopes of you and gave him half a crown O no he can t stomach old families After hearing this caricature of Clare s opinion poor Tess was glad that she had not said a word in a weak moment about her family even though it was so unusually old almost to have gone round the circle and become a new one Besides another diary girl was as good as she it seemed in that respect She held her tongue about the d Urberville vault and the Knight of the Conqueror whose name she bore The insight afforded into Clare s character suggested to her that it was largely owing to her supposed untraditional newness that she had won interest in his eyes XX The season developed and matured Another year s instalment of flowers leaves nightingales thrushes finches and such ephemeral creatures took up their positions where only a year ago others had stood in their place when these were nothing more than germs and inorganic particles Rays from the sunrise drew forth the buds and stretched them into long stalks lifted up sap in noiseless streams opened petals and sucked out scents in invisible jets and breathings Dairyman Crick s household of maids and men lived on comfortably placidly even merrily Their position was perhaps the happiest of all positions in the social scale being above the line at which neediness ends and below the line at which the convenances begin to cramp natural feelings and the stress of threadbare modishness makes too little of enough Thus passed the leafy time when arborescence seems to be the one thing aimed at out of doors Tess and Clare unconsciously studied each other ever balanced on the edge of a passion yet apparently keeping out of it All the while they were converging under an irresistible law as surely as two streams in one vale Tess had never in her recent life been so happy as she was now possibly never would be so happy again She was for one thing physically and mentally suited among these new surroundings The sapling which had rooted down to a poisonous stratum on the spot of its sowing had been transplanted to a deeper soil Moreover she and Clare also stood as yet on the debatable land between predilection and love where no profundities have been reached no reflections have set in awkwardly inquiring Whither does this new current tend to carry me What does it mean to my future How does it stand towards my past Tess was the merest stray phenomenon to Angel Clare as yet a rosy warming apparition which had only just acquired the attribute of persistence in his consciousness So he allowed his mind to be occupied with her deeming his preoccupation to be no more than a philosopher s regard of an exceedingly novel fresh and interesting specimen of womankind They met continually they could not help it They met daily in that strange and solemn interval the twilight of the morning in the violet or pink dawn for it was necessary to rise early so very early here Milking was done betimes and before the milking came the skimming which began at a little past three It usually fell to the lot of some one or other of them to wake the rest the first being aroused by an alarm clock and as Tess was the latest arrival and they soon discovered that she could be depended upon not to sleep though the alarm as others did this task was thrust most frequently upon her No sooner had the hour of three struck and whizzed than she left her room and ran to the dairyman s door then up the ladder to Angel s calling him in a loud whisper then woke her fellow milkmaids By the time that Tess was dressed Clare was downstairs and out in the humid air The remaining maids and the dairyman usually gave themselves another turn on the pillow and did not appear till a quarter of an hour later The gray half tones of daybreak are not the gray half tones of the day s close though the degree of their shade may be the same In the twilight of the morning light seems active darkness passive in the twilight of evening it is the darkness which is active and crescent and the light which is the drowsy reverse Being so often possibly not always by chance the first two persons to get up at the dairy house they seemed to themselves the first persons up of all the world In these early days of her residence here Tess did not skim but went out of doors at once after rising where he was generally awaiting her The spectral half compounded aqueous light which pervaded the open mead impressed them with a feeling of isolation as if they were Adam and Eve At this dim inceptive stage of the day Tess seemed to Clare to exhibit a dignified largeness both of disposition and physique an almost regnant power possibly because he knew that at that preternatural time hardly any woman so well endowed in person as she was likely to be walking in the open air within the boundaries of his horizon very few in all England Fair women are usually asleep at mid summer dawns She was close at hand and the rest were nowhere The mixed singular luminous gloom in which they walked along together to the spot where the cows lay often made him think of the Resurrection hour He little thought that the Magdalen might be at his side Whilst all the landscape was in neutral shade his companion s face which was the focus of his eyes rising above the mist stratum seemed to have a sort of phosphorescence upon it She looked ghostly as if she were merely a soul at large In reality her face without appearing to do so had caught the cold gleam of day from the north east his own face though he did not think of it wore the same aspect to her It was then as has been said that she impressed him most deeply She was no longer the milkmaid but a visionary essence of woman a whole sex condensed into one typical form He called her Artemis Demeter and other fanciful names half teasingly which she did not like because she did not understand them Call me Tess she would say askance and he did Then it would grow lighter and her features would become simply feminine they had changed from those of a divinity who could confer bliss to those of a being who craved it At these non human hours they could get quite close to the waterfowl Herons came with a great bold noise as of opening doors and shutters out of the boughs of a plantation which they frequented at the side of the mead or if already on the spot hardily maintained their standing in the water as the pair walked by watching them by moving their heads round in a slow horizontal passionless wheel like the turn of puppets by clockwork They could then see the faint summer fogs in layers woolly level and apparently no thicker than counterpanes spread about the meadows in detached remnants of small extent On the gray moisture of the grass were marks where the cows had lain through the night dark green islands of dry herbage the size of their carcasses in the general sea of dew From each island proceeded a serpentine trail by which the cow had rambled away to feed after getting up at the end of which trail they found her the snoring puff from her nostrils when she recognized them making an intenser little fog of her own amid the prevailing one Then they drove the animals back to the barton or sat down to milk them on the spot as the case might require Or perhaps the summer fog was more general and the meadows lay like a white sea out of which the scattered trees rose like dangerous rocks Birds would soar through it into the upper radiance and hang on the wing sunning themselves or alight on the wet rails subdividing the mead which now shone like glass rods Minute diamonds of moisture from the mist hung too upon Tess s eyelashes and drops upon her hair like seed pearls When the day grew quite strong and commonplace these dried off her moreover Tess then lost her strange and ethereal beauty her teeth lips and eyes scintillated in the sunbeams and she was again the dazzlingly fair dairymaid only who had to hold her own against the other women of the world About this time they would hear Dairyman Crick s voice lecturing the non resident milkers for arriving late and speaking sharply to old Deborah Fyander for not washing her hands For Heaven s sake pop thy hands under the pump Deb Upon my soul if the London folk only knowed of thee and thy slovenly ways they d swaller their milk and butter more mincing than they do a ready and that s saying a good deal The milking progressed till towards the end Tess and Clare in common with the rest could hear the heavy breakfast table dragged out from the wall in the kitchen by missus Crick this being the invariable preliminary to each meal the same horrible scrape accompanying its return journey when the table had been cleared XXI There was a great stir in the milk house just after breakfast The churn revolved as usual but the butter would not come Whenever this happened the dairy was paralyzed Squish squash echoed the milk in the great cylinder but never arose the sound they waited for Dairyman Crick and his wife the milkmaids Tess Marian Retty Priddle Izz Huett and the married ones from the cottages also mister Clare Jonathan Kail old Deborah and the rest stood gazing hopelessly at the churn and the boy who kept the horse going outside put on moon like eyes to show his sense of the situation Even the melancholy horse himself seemed to look in at the window in inquiring despair at each walk round Tis years since I went to Conjuror Trendle s son in Egdon years said the dairyman bitterly And he was nothing to what his father had been I have said fifty times if I have said once that I DON T believe in en though a do cast folks waters very true But I shall have to go to n if he s alive O yes I shall have to go to n if this sort of thing continnys Even mister Clare began to feel tragical at the dairyman s desperation Conjuror Fall t other side of Casterbridge that they used to call Wide O was a very good man when I was a boy said Jonathan Kail But he s rotten as touchwood by now My grandfather used to go to Conjuror Mynterne out at Owlscombe and a clever man a were so I ve heard grandf er say continued mister Crick But there s no such genuine folk about nowadays missus Crick s mind kept nearer to the matter in hand Perhaps somebody in the house is in love she said tentatively I ve heard tell in my younger days that that will cause it Why Crick that maid we had years ago do ye mind and how the butter didn t come then Ah yes yes but that isn t the rights o t It had nothing to do with the love making I can mind all about it twas the damage to the churn He turned to Clare Jack Dollop a hore s bird of a fellow we had here as milker at one time sir courted a young woman over at Mellstock and deceived her as he had deceived many afore But he had another sort o woman to reckon wi this time and it was not the girl herself One Holy Thursday of all days in the almanack we was here as we mid be now only there was no churning in hand when we zid the girl s mother coming up to the door wi a great brass mounted umbrella in her hand that would ha felled an ox and saying Do Jack Dollop work here because I want him I have a big bone to pick with he I can assure n And some way behind her mother walked Jack s young woman crying bitterly into her handkercher O Lard here s a time said Jack looking out o winder at em She ll murder me Where shall I get where shall I Don t tell her where I be And with that he scrambled into the churn through the trap door and shut himself inside just as the young woman s mother busted into the milk house The villain where is he says she I ll claw his face for n let me only catch him Well she hunted about everywhere ballyragging Jack by side and by seam Jack lying a most stifled inside the churn and the poor maid or young woman rather standing at the door crying her eyes out I shall never forget it never Twould have melted a marble stone But she couldn t find him nowhere at all The dairyman paused and one or two words of comment came from the listeners Dairyman Crick s stories often seemed to be ended when they were not really so and strangers were betrayed into premature interjections of finality though old friends knew better The narrator went on Well how the old woman should have had the wit to guess it I could never tell but she found out that he was inside that there churn Without saying a word she took hold of the winch it was turned by handpower then and round she swung him and Jack began to flop about inside O Lard stop the churn let me out says he popping out his head I shall be churned into a pummy He was a cowardly chap in his heart as such men mostly be Not till ye make amends for ravaging her virgin innocence says the old woman Stop the churn you old witch screams he You call me old witch do ye you deceiver says she when ye ought to ha been calling me mother law these last five months And on went the churn and Jack s bones rattled round again Well none of us ventured to interfere and at last a promised to make it right wi her Yes I ll be as good as my word he said And so it ended that day While the listeners were smiling their comments there was a quick movement behind their backs and they looked round Tess pale faced had gone to the door How warm tis to day she said almost inaudibly It was warm and none of them connected her withdrawal with the reminiscences of the dairyman He went forward and opened the door for her saying with tender raillery Why maidy he frequently with unconscious irony gave her this pet name the prettiest milker I ve got in my dairy you mustn t get so fagged as this at the first breath of summer weather or we shall be finely put to for want of ee by dog days shan t we mister Clare I was faint and I think I am better out o doors she said mechanically and disappeared outside Fortunately for her the milk in the revolving churn at that moment changed its squashing for a decided flick flack Tis coming cried missus Crick and the attention of all was called off from Tess That fair sufferer soon recovered herself externally but she remained much depressed all the afternoon When the evening milking was done she did not care to be with the rest of them and went out of doors wandering along she knew not whither She was wretched O so wretched at the perception that to her companions the dairyman s story had been rather a humorous narration than otherwise none of them but herself seemed to see the sorrow of it to a certainty not one knew how cruelly it touched the tender place in her experience The evening sun was now ugly to her like a great inflamed wound in the sky Only a solitary cracked voice reed sparrow greeted her from the bushes by the river in a sad machine made tone resembling that of a past friend whose friendship she had outworn In these long June days the milkmaids and indeed most of the household went to bed at sunset or sooner the morning work before milking being so early and heavy at a time of full pails Tess usually accompanied her fellows upstairs To night however she was the first to go to their common chamber and she had dozed when the other girls came in She saw them undressing in the orange light of the vanished sun which flushed their forms with its colour she dozed again but she was reawakened by their voices and quietly turned her eyes towards them Neither of her three chamber companions had got into bed They were standing in a group in their nightgowns barefooted at the window the last red rays of the west still warming their faces and necks and the walls around them All were watching somebody in the garden with deep interest their three faces close together a jovial and round one a pale one with dark hair and a fair one whose tresses were auburn Don t push You can see as well as I said Retty the auburn haired and youngest girl without removing her eyes from the window Tis no use for you to be in love with him any more than me Retty Priddle said jolly faced Marian the eldest slily His thoughts be of other cheeks than thine Retty Priddle still looked and the others looked again There he is again cried Izz Huett the pale girl with dark damp hair and keenly cut lips You needn t say anything Izz answered Retty For I zid you kissing his shade WHAT did you see her doing asked Marian Why he was standing over the whey tub to let off the whey and the shade of his face came upon the wall behind close to Izz who was standing there filling a vat She put her mouth against the wall and kissed the shade of his mouth I zid her though he didn t O Izz Huett said Marian A rosy spot came into the middle of Izz Huett s cheek Well there was no harm in it she declared with attempted coolness And if I be in love wi en so is Retty too and so be you Marian come to that Marian s full face could not blush past its chronic pinkness I she said What a tale Ah there he is again Dear eyes dear face dear mister Clare There you ve owned it So have you so have we all said Marian with the dry frankness of complete indifference to opinion It is silly to pretend otherwise amongst ourselves though we need not own it to other folks I would just marry n to morrow So would I and more murmured Izz Huett And I too whispered the more timid Retty The listener grew warm We can t all marry him said Izz We shan t either of us which is worse still said the eldest There he is again They all three blew him a silent kiss Why asked Retty quickly Because he likes Tess Durbeyfield best said Marian lowering her voice I have watched him every day and have found it out There was a reflective silence But she don t care anything for n at length breathed Retty Well I sometimes think that too But how silly all this is said Izz Huett impatiently Of course he won t marry any one of us or Tess either a gentleman s son who s going to be a great landowner and farmer abroad More likely to ask us to come wi en as farm hands at so much a year One sighed and another sighed and Marian s plump figure sighed biggest of all Somebody in bed hard by sighed too Tears came into the eyes of Retty Priddle the pretty red haired youngest the last bud of the Paridelles so important in the county annals They watched silently a little longer their three faces still close together as before and the triple hues of their hair mingling But the unconscious mister Clare had gone indoors and they saw him no more and the shades beginning to deepen they crept into their beds In a few minutes they heard him ascend the ladder to his own room Marian was soon snoring but Izz did not drop into forgetfulness for a long time Retty Priddle cried herself to sleep The deeper passioned Tess was very far from sleeping even then This conversation was another of the bitter pills she had been obliged to swallow that day Scarce the least feeling of jealousy arose in her breast For that matter she knew herself to have the preference Being more finely formed better educated and though the youngest except Retty more woman than either she perceived that only the slightest ordinary care was necessary for holding her own in Angel Clare s heart against these her candid friends But the grave question was ought she to do this There was to be sure hardly a ghost of a chance for either of them in a serious sense but there was or had been a chance of one or the other inspiring him with a passing fancy for her and enjoying the pleasure of his attentions while he stayed here Such unequal attachments had led to marriage and she had heard from missus Crick that mister Clare had one day asked in a laughing way what would be the use of his marrying a fine lady and all the while ten thousand acres of Colonial pasture to feed and cattle to rear and corn to reap A farm woman would be the only sensible kind of wife for him But whether mister Clare had spoken seriously or not why should she who could never conscientiously allow any man to marry her now and who had religiously determined that she never would be tempted to do so draw off mister Clare s attention from other women for the brief happiness of sunning herself in his eyes while he remained at Talbothays XXII They came downstairs yawning next morning but skimming and milking were proceeded with as usual and they went indoors to breakfast Dairyman Crick was discovered stamping about the house He had received a letter in which a customer had complained that the butter had a twang And begad so t have said the dairyman who held in his left hand a wooden slice on which a lump of butter was stuck Yes taste for yourself Several of them gathered round him and mister Clare tasted Tess tasted also the other indoor milkmaids one or two of the milking men and last of all missus Crick who came out from the waiting breakfast table There certainly was a twang The dairyman who had thrown himself into abstraction to better realize the taste and so divine the particular species of noxious weed to which it appertained suddenly exclaimed Tis garlic and I thought there wasn t a blade left in that mead Then all the old hands remembered that a certain dry mead into which a few of the cows had been admitted of late had in years gone by spoilt the butter in the same way The dairyman had not recognized the taste at that time and thought the butter bewitched We must overhaul that mead he resumed this mustn t continny All having armed themselves with old pointed knives they went out together As the inimical plant could only be present in very microscopic dimensions to have escaped ordinary observation to find it seemed rather a hopeless attempt in the stretch of rich grass before them However they formed themselves into line all assisting owing to the importance of the search the dairyman at the upper end with mister Clare who had volunteered to help then Tess Marian Izz Huett and Retty then Bill Lewell Jonathan and the married dairywomen Beck Knibbs with her wooly black hair and rolling eyes and flaxen Frances consumptive from the winter damps of the water meads who lived in their respective cottages With eyes fixed upon the ground they crept slowly across a strip of the field returning a little further down in such a manner that when they should have finished not a single inch of the pasture but would have fallen under the eye of some one of them It was a most tedious business not more than half a dozen shoots of garlic being discoverable in the whole field yet such was the herb s pungency that probably one bite of it by one cow had been sufficient to season the whole dairy s produce for the day Differing one from another in natures and moods so greatly as they did they yet formed bending a curiously uniform row automatic noiseless and an alien observer passing down the neighbouring lane might well have been excused for massing them as Hodge As they crept along stooping low to discern the plant a soft yellow gleam was reflected from the buttercups into their shaded faces giving them an elfish moonlit aspect though the sun was pouring upon their backs in all the strength of noon Angel Clare who communistically stuck to his rule of taking part with the rest in everything glanced up now and then It was not of course by accident that he walked next to Tess Well how are you he murmured Very well thank you sir she replied demurely As they had been discussing a score of personal matters only half an hour before the introductory style seemed a little superfluous But they got no further in speech just then They crept and crept the hem of her petticoat just touching his gaiter and his elbow sometimes brushing hers At last the dairyman who came next could stand it no longer Upon my soul and body this here stooping do fairly make my back open and shut he exclaimed straightening himself slowly with an excruciated look till quite upright And you maidy Tess you wasn t well a day or two ago this will make your head ache finely Don t do any more if you feel fainty leave the rest to finish it Dairyman Crick withdrew and Tess dropped behind mister Clare also stepped out of line and began privateering about for the weed When she found him near her her very tension at what she had heard the night before made her the first to speak Don t they look pretty she said Who Izzy Huett and Retty Tess had moodily decided that either of these maidens would make a good farmer s wife and that she ought to recommend them and obscure her own wretched charms Pretty Well yes they are pretty girls fresh looking I have often thought so Though poor dears prettiness won t last long O no unfortunately They are excellent dairywomen Yes though not better than you They skim better than I Do they Clare remained observing them not without their observing him She is colouring up continued Tess heroically Who Retty Priddle Oh Why it that Because you are looking at her Self sacrificing as her mood might be Tess could not well go further and cry Marry one of them if you really do want a dairywoman and not a lady and don t think of marrying me She followed Dairyman Crick and had the mournful satisfaction of seeing that Clare remained behind From this day she forced herself to take pains to avoid him never allowing herself as formerly to remain long in his company even if their juxtaposition were purely accidental She gave the other three every chance Tess was woman enough to realize from their avowals to herself that Angel Clare had the honour of all the dairymaids in his keeping and her perception of his care to avoid compromising the happiness of either in the least degree bred a tender respect in Tess for what she deemed rightly or wrongly the self controlling sense of duty shown by him a quality which she had never expected to find in one of the opposite sex and in the absence of which more than one of the simple hearts who were his house mates might have gone weeping on her pilgrimage XXIII The hot weather of July had crept upon them unawares and the atmosphere of the flat vale hung heavy as an opiate over the dairy folk the cows and the trees Hot steaming rains fell frequently making the grass where the cows fed yet more rank and hindering the late hay making in the other meads It was Sunday morning the milking was done the outdoor milkers had gone home Tess and the other three were dressing themselves rapidly the whole bevy having agreed to go together to Mellstock Church which lay some three or four miles distant from the dairy house She had now been two months at Talbothays and this was her first excursion All the preceding afternoon and night heavy thunderstorms had hissed down upon the meads and washed some of the hay into the river but this morning the sun shone out all the more brilliantly for the deluge and the air was balmy and clear The crooked lane leading from their own parish to Mellstock ran along the lowest levels in a portion of its length and when the girls reached the most depressed spot they found that the result of the rain had been to flood the lane over shoe to a distance of some fifty yards This would have been no serious hindrance on a week day they would have clicked through it in their high pattens and boots quite unconcerned but on this day of vanity this Sun s day when flesh went forth to coquet with flesh while hypocritically affecting business with spiritual things on this occasion for wearing their white stockings and thin shoes and their pink white and lilac gowns on which every mud spot would be visible the pool was an awkward impediment They could hear the church bell calling as yet nearly a mile off Who would have expected such a rise in the river in summer time said Marian from the top of the roadside bank on which they had climbed and were maintaining a precarious footing in the hope of creeping along its slope till they were past the pool We can t get there anyhow without walking right through it or else going round the Turnpike way and that would make us so very late said Retty pausing hopelessly And I do colour up so hot walking into church late and all the people staring round said Marian that I hardly cool down again till we get into the That it may please Thees While they stood clinging to the bank they heard a splashing round the bend of the road and presently appeared Angel Clare advancing along the lane towards them through the water Four hearts gave a big throb simultaneously His aspect was probably as un Sabbatarian a one as a dogmatic parson s son often presented his attire being his dairy clothes long wading boots a cabbage leaf inside his hat to keep his head cool with a thistle spud to finish him off He s not going to church said Marian No I wish he was murmured Tess Angel in fact rightly or wrongly to adopt the safe phrase of evasive controversialists preferred sermons in stones to sermons in churches and chapels on fine summer days This morning moreover he had gone out to see if the damage to the hay by the flood was considerable or not On his walk he observed the girls from a long distance though they had been so occupied with their difficulties of passage as not to notice him He knew that the water had risen at that spot and that it would quite check their progress So he had hastened on with a dim idea of how he could help them one of them in particular The rosy cheeked bright eyed quartet looked so charming in their light summer attire clinging to the roadside bank like pigeons on a roof slope that he stopped a moment to regard them before coming close Their gauzy skirts had brushed up from the grass innumerable flies and butterflies which unable to escape remained caged in the transparent tissue as in an aviary Angel s eye at last fell upon Tess the hindmost of the four she being full of suppressed laughter at their dilemma could not help meeting his glance radiantly He came beneath them in the water which did not rise over his long boots and stood looking at the entrapped flies and butterflies Are you trying to get to church he said to Marian who was in front including the next two in his remark but avoiding Tess Yes sir and tis getting late and my colour do come up so I ll carry you through the pool every Jill of you The whole four flushed as if one heart beat through them I think you can t sir said Marian It is the only way for you to get past Stand still Nonsense you are not too heavy I d carry you all four together Now Marian attend he continued and put your arms round my shoulders so Now Hold on That s well done Marian had lowered herself upon his arm and shoulder as directed and Angel strode off with her his slim figure as viewed from behind looking like the mere stem to the great nosegay suggested by hers They disappeared round the curve of the road and only his sousing footsteps and the top ribbon of Marian s bonnet told where they were In a few minutes he reappeared Izz Huett was the next in order upon the bank Here he comes she murmured and they could hear that her lips were dry with emotion And I have to put my arms round his neck and look into his face as Marian did There s nothing in that said Tess quickly There s a time for everything continued Izz unheeding A time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing the first is now going to be mine Fie it is Scripture Izz Yes said Izz I ve always a ear at church for pretty verses Angel Clare to whom three quarters of this performance was a commonplace act of kindness now approached Izz She quietly and dreamily lowered herself into his arms and Angel methodically marched off with her When he was heard returning for the third time Retty s throbbing heart could be almost seen to shake her He went up to the red haired girl and while he was seizing her he glanced at Tess His lips could not have pronounced more plainly It will soon be you and I Her comprehension appeared in her face she could not help it There was an understanding between them Poor little Retty though by far the lightest weight was the most troublesome of Clare s burdens Marian had been like a sack of meal a dead weight of plumpness under which he has literally staggered Izz had ridden sensibly and calmly Retty was a bunch of hysterics However he got through with the disquieted creature deposited her and returned Tess could see over the hedge the distant three in a group standing as he had placed them on the next rising ground It was now her turn She was embarrassed to discover that excitement at the proximity of mister Clare s breath and eyes which she had contemned in her companions was intensified in herself and as if fearful of betraying her secret she paltered with him at the last moment I may be able to clim along the bank perhaps I can clim better than they You must be so tired mister Clare No no Tess said he quickly And almost before she was aware she was seated in his arms and resting against his shoulder Three Leahs to get one Rachel he whispered They are better women than I she replied magnanimously sticking to her resolve Not to me said Angel He saw her grow warm at this and they went some steps in silence I hope I am not too heavy she said timidly O no You should lift Marian Such a lump You are like an undulating billow warmed by the sun And all this fluff of muslin about you is the froth It is very pretty if I seem like that to you Do you know that I have undergone three quarters of this labour entirely for the sake of the fourth quarter No I did not expect such an event to day Nor I The water came up so sudden That the rise in the water was what she understood him to refer to the state of breathing belied Clare stood still and inclinced his face towards hers O Tessy he exclaimed The girl s cheeks burned to the breeze and she could not look into his eyes for her emotion It reminded Angel that he was somewhat unfairly taking advantage of an accidental position and he went no further with it No definite words of love had crossed their lips as yet and suspension at this point was desirable now However he walked slowly to make the remainder of the distance as long as possible but at last they came to the bend and the rest of their progress was in full view of the other three The dry land was reached and he set her down Her friends were looking with round thoughtful eyes at her and him and she could see that they had been talking of her He hastily bade them farewell and splashed back along the stretch of submerged road The four moved on together as before till Marian broke the silence by saying No in all truth we have no chance against her She looked joylessly at Tess What do you mean asked the latter He likes ee best the very best We could see it as he brought ee He would have kissed ee if you had encouraged him to do it ever so little No no said she The gaiety with which they had set out had somehow vanished and yet there was no enmity or malice between them They were generous young souls they had been reared in the lonely country nooks where fatalism is a strong sentiment and they did not blame her Such supplanting was to be Tess s heart ached There was no concealing from herself the fact that she loved Angel Clare perhaps all the more passionately from knowing that the others had also lost their hearts to him There is contagion in this sentiment especially among women And yet that same hungry nature had fought against this but too feebly and the natural result had followed I will never stand in your way nor in the way of either of you she declared to Retty that night in the bedroom her tears running down I can t help this my dear I don t think marrying is in his mind at all but if he were ever to ask me I should refuse him as I should refuse any man Oh would you Why said wondering Retty It cannot be But I will be plain Putting myself quite on one side I don t think he will choose either of you I have never expected it thought of it moaned Retty But O I wish I was dead The poor child torn by a feeling which she hardly understood turned to the other two girls who came upstairs just then We be friends with her again she said to them She thinks no more of his choosing her than we do So the reserve went off and they were confiding and warm I don t seem to care what I do now said Marian whose mood was turned to its lowest bass I was going to marry a dairyman at Stickleford who s asked me twice but my soul I would put an end to myself rather n be his wife now Why don t ye speak Izz To confess then murmured Izz I made sure to day that he was going to kiss me as he held me and I lay still against his breast hoping and hoping and never moved at all But he did not I don t like biding here at Talbothays any longer I shall go hwome The air of the sleeping chamber seemed to palpitate with the hopeless passion of the girls They writhed feverishly under the oppressiveness of an emotion thrust on them by cruel Nature s law an emotion which they had neither expected nor desired The incident of the day had fanned the flame that was burning the inside of their hearts out and the torture was almost more than they could endure The differences which distinguished them as individuals were abstracted by this passion and each was but portion of one organism called sex There was so much frankness and so little jealousy because there was no hope Each one was a girl of fair common sense and she did not delude herself with any vain conceits or deny her love or give herself airs in the idea of outshining the others The full recognition of the futility of their infatuation from a social point of view its purposeless beginning its self bounded outlook its lack of everything to justify its existence in the eye of civilization while lacking nothing in the eye of Nature the one fact that it did exist ecstasizing them to a killing joy all this imparted to them a resignation a dignity which a practical and sordid expectation of winning him as a husband would have destroyed They tossed and turned on their little beds and the cheese wring dripped monotonously downstairs B you awake Tess whispered one half an hour later It was Izz Huett s voice Tess replied in the affirmative whereupon also Retty and Marian suddenly flung the bedclothes off them and sighed So be we I wonder what she is like the lady they say his family have looked out for him I wonder said Izz Some lady looked out for him gasped Tess starting I have never heard o that O yes tis whispered a young lady of his own rank chosen by his family a Doctor of Divinity s daughter near his father s parish of Emminster he don t much care for her they say But he is sure to marry her They had heard so very little of this yet it was enough to build up wretched dolorous dreams upon there in the shade of the night They pictured all the details of his being won round to consent of the wedding preparations of the bride s happiness of her dress and veil of her blissful home with him when oblivion would have fallen upon themselves as far as he and their love were concerned Thus they talked and ached and wept till sleep charmed their sorrow away After this disclosure Tess nourished no further foolish thought that there lurked any grave and deliberate import in Clare s attentions to her It was a passing summer love of her face for love s own temporary sake nothing more And the thorny crown of this sad conception was that she whom he really did prefer in a cursory way to the rest she who knew herself to be more impassioned in nature cleverer more beautiful than they was in the eyes of propriety far less worthy of him than the homelier ones whom he ignored XXIV Amid the oozing fatness and warm ferments of the Froom Vale at a season when the rush of juices could almost be heard below the hiss of fertilization it was impossible that the most fanciful love should not grow passionate The ready bosoms existing there were impregnated by their surroundings July passed over their heads and the Thermidorean weather which came in its wake seemed an effort on the part of Nature to match the state of hearts at Talbothays Dairy The air of the place so fresh in the spring and early summer was stagnant and enervating now Its heavy scents weighed upon them and at mid day the landscape seemed lying in a swoon Ethiopic scorchings browned the upper slopes of the pastures but there was still bright green herbage here where the watercourses purled And as Clare was oppressed by the outward heats so was he burdened inwardly by waxing fervour of passion for the soft and silent Tess The rains having passed the uplands were dry The wheels of the dairyman s spring cart as he sped home from market licked up the pulverized surface of the highway and were followed by white ribands of dust as if they had set a thin powder train on fire The cows jumped wildly over the five barred barton gate maddened by the gad fly Dairyman Crick kept his shirt sleeves permanently rolled up from Monday to Saturday open windows had no effect in ventilation without open doors and in the dairy garden the blackbirds and thrushes crept about under the currant bushes rather in the manner of quadrupeds than of winged creatures The flies in the kitchen were lazy teasing and familiar crawling about in the unwonted places on the floors into drawers and over the backs of the milkmaids hands Conversations were concerning sunstroke while butter making and still more butter keeping was a despair They milked entirely in the meads for coolness and convenience without driving in the cows During the day the animals obsequiously followed the shadow of the smallest tree as it moved round the stem with the diurnal roll and when the milkers came they could hardly stand still for the flies On one of these afternoons four or five unmilked cows chanced to stand apart from the general herd behind the corner of a hedge among them being Dumpling and Old Pretty who loved Tess s hands above those of any other maid When she rose from her stool under a finished cow Angel Clare who had been observing her for some time asked her if she would take the aforesaid creatures next She silently assented and with her stool at arm s length and the pail against her knee went round to where they stood Soon the sound of Old Pretty s milk fizzing into the pail came through the hedge and then Angel felt inclined to go round the corner also to finish off a hard yielding milcher who had strayed there he being now as capable of this as the dairyman himself All the men and some of the women when milking dug their foreheads into the cows and gazed into the pail But a few mainly the younger ones rested their heads sideways This was Tess Durbeyfield s habit her temple pressing the milcher s flank her eyes fixed on the far end of the meadow with the quiet of one lost in meditation She was milking Old Pretty thus and the sun chancing to be on the milking side it shone flat upon her pink gowned form and her white curtain bonnet and upon her profile rendering it keen as a cameo cut from the dun background of the cow She did not know that Clare had followed her round and that he sat under his cow watching her The stillness of her head and features was remarkable she might have been in a trance her eyes open yet unseeing Nothing in the picture moved but Old Pretty s tail and Tess s pink hands the latter so gently as to be a rhythmic pulsation only as if they were obeying a reflex stimulus like a beating heart How very lovable her face was to him Yet there was nothing ethereal about it all was real vitality real warmth real incarnation And it was in her mouth that this culminated Eyes almost as deep and speaking he had seen before and cheeks perhaps as fair brows as arched a chin and throat almost as shapely her mouth he had seen nothing to equal on the face of the earth To a young man with the least fire in him that little upward lift in the middle of her red top lip was distracting infatuating maddening He had never before seen a woman s lips and teeth which forced upon his mind with such persistent iteration the old Elizabethan simile of roses filled with snow Perfect he as a lover might have called them off hand But no they were not perfect And it was the touch of the imperfect upon the would be perfect that gave the sweetness because it was that which gave the humanity Clare had studied the curves of those lips so many times that he could reproduce them mentally with ease and now as they again confronted him clothed with colour and life they sent an aura over his flesh a breeze through his nerves which well nigh produced a qualm and actually produced by some mysterious physiological process a prosaic sneeze She then became conscious that he was observing her but she would not show it by any change of position though the curious dream like fixity disappeared and a close eye might easily have discerned that the rosiness of her face deepened and then faded till only a tinge of it was left The influence that had passed into Clare like an excitation from the sky did not die down Resolutions reticences prudences fears fell back like a defeated battalion He jumped up from his seat and leaving his pail to be kicked over if the milcher had such a mind went quickly towards the desire of his eyes and kneeling down beside her clasped her in his arms Tess was taken completely by surprise and she yielded to his embrace with unreflecting inevitableness Having seen that it was really her lover who had advanced and no one else her lips parted and she sank upon him in her momentary joy with something very like an ecstatic cry He had been on the point of kissing that too tempting mouth but he checked himself for tender conscience sake Forgive me Tess dear he whispered I ought to have asked I did not know what I was doing I do not mean it as a liberty I am devoted to you Tessy dearest in all sincerity Old Pretty by this time had looked round puzzled and seeing two people crouching under her where by immemorial custom there should have been only one lifted her hind leg crossly She is angry she doesn t know what we mean she ll kick over the milk exclaimed Tess gently striving to free herself her eyes concerned with the quadruped s actions her heart more deeply concerned with herself and Clare She slipped up from her seat and they stood together his arm still encircling her Tess s eyes fixed on distance began to fill Why do you cry my darling he said O I don t know she murmured As she saw and felt more clearly the position she was in she became agitated and tried to withdraw Well I have betrayed my feeling Tess at last said he with a curious sigh of desperation signifying unconsciously that his heart had outrun his judgement That I love you dearly and truly I need not say But I it shall go no further now it distresses you I am as surprised as you are You will not think I have presumed upon your defencelessness been too quick and unreflecting will you N I can t tell He had allowed her to free herself and in a minute or two the milking of each was resumed Nobody had beheld the gravitation of the two into one and when the dairyman came round by that screened nook a few minutes later there was not a sign to reveal that the markedly sundered pair were more to each other than mere acquaintance Yet in the interval since Crick s last view of them something had occurred which changed the pivot of the universe for their two natures something which had he known its quality the dairyman would have despised as a practical man yet which was based upon a more stubborn and resistless tendency than a whole heap of so called practicalities A veil had been whisked aside the tract of each one s outlook was to have a new horizon thenceforward for a short time or for a long END OF PHASE THE THIRD Phase the Fourth The Consequence XXV Clare restless went out into the dusk when evening drew on she who had won him having retired to her chamber The night was as sultry as the day There was no coolness after dark unless on the grass Roads garden paths the house fronts the barton walls were warm as hearths and reflected the noontime temperature into the noctambulist s face He sat on the east gate of the dairy yard and knew not what to think of himself Feeling had indeed smothered judgement that day Since the sudden embrace three hours before the twain had kept apart She seemed stilled almost alarmed at what had occurred while the novelty unpremeditation mastery of circumstance disquieted him palpitating contemplative being that he was He could hardly realize their true relations to each other as yet and what their mutual bearing should be before third parties thenceforward Angel had come as pupil to this dairy in the idea that his temporary existence here was to be the merest episode in his life soon passed through and early forgotten he had come as to a place from which as from a screened alcove he could calmly view the absorbing world without and apostrophizing it with Walt Whitman Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes How curious you are to me resolve upon a plan for plunging into that world anew But behold the absorbing scene had been imported hither What had been the engrossing world had dissolved into an uninteresting outer dumb show while here in this apparently dim and unimpassioned place novelty had volcanically started up as it had never for him started up elsewhere Every window of the house being open Clare could hear across the yard each trivial sound of the retiring household The dairy house so humble so insignificant so purely to him a place of constrained sojourn that he had never hitherto deemed it of sufficient importance to be reconnoitred as an object of any quality whatever in the landscape what was it now The aged and lichened brick gables breathed forth Stay The windows smiled the door coaxed and beckoned the creeper blushed confederacy A personality within it was so far reaching in her influence as to spread into and make the bricks mortar and whole overhanging sky throb with a burning sensibility Whose was this mighty personality A milkmaid s It was amazing indeed to find how great a matter the life of the obscure dairy had become to him And though new love was to be held partly responsible for this it was not solely so Many besides Angel have learnt that the magnitude of lives is not as to their external displacements but as to their subjective experiences The impressionable peasant leads a larger fuller more dramatic life than the pachydermatous king Looking at it thus he found that life was to be seen of the same magnitude here as elsewhere Despite his heterodoxy faults and weaknesses Clare was a man with a conscience Tess was no insignificant creature to toy with and dismiss but a woman living her precious life a life which to herself who endured or enjoyed it possessed as great a dimension as the life of the mightiest to himself Upon her sensations the whole world depended to Tess through her existence all her fellow creatures existed to her The universe itself only came into being for Tess on the particular day in the particular year in which she was born This consciousness upon which he had intruded was the single opportunity of existence ever vouchsafed to Tess by an unsympathetic First Cause her all her every and only chance How then should he look upon her as of less consequence than himself as a pretty trifle to caress and grow weary of and not deal in the greatest seriousness with the affection which he knew that he had awakened in her so fervid and so impressionable as she was under her reserve in order that it might not agonize and wreck her To encounter her daily in the accustomed manner would be to develop what had begun Living in such close relations to meet meant to fall into endearment flesh and blood could not resist it and having arrived at no conclusion as to the issue of such a tendency he decided to hold aloof for the present from occupations in which they would be mutually engaged As yet the harm done was small But it was not easy to carry out the resolution never to approach her He was driven towards her by every heave of his pulse He thought he would go and see his friends It might be possible to sound them upon this In less than five months his term here would have ended and after a few additional months spent upon other farms he would be fully equipped in agricultural knowledge and in a position to start on his own account Would not a farmer want a wife and should a farmer s wife be a drawing room wax figure or a woman who understood farming Notwithstanding the pleasing answer returned to him by the silence he resolved to go his journey One morning when they sat down to breakfast at Talbothays Dairy some maid observed that she had not seen anything of mister Clare that day O no said Dairyman Crick mister Clare has gone hwome to Emminster to spend a few days wi his kinsfolk For four impassioned ones around that table the sunshine of the morning went out at a stroke and the birds muffled their song But neither girl by word or gesture revealed her blankness He s getting on towards the end of his time wi me added the dairyman with a phlegm which unconsciously was brutal and so I suppose he is beginning to see about his plans elsewhere How much longer is he to bide here asked Izz Huett the only one of the gloom stricken bevy who could trust her voice with the question The others waited for the dairyman s answer as if their lives hung upon it Retty with parted lips gazing on the tablecloth Marian with heat added to her redness Tess throbbing and looking out at the meads Well I can t mind the exact day without looking at my memorandum book replied Crick with the same intolerable unconcern And even that may be altered a bit He ll bide to get a little practice in the calving out at the straw yard for certain He ll hang on till the end of the year I should say Four months or so of torturing ecstasy in his society of pleasure girdled about with pain After that the blackness of unutterable night At this moment of the morning Angel Clare was riding along a narrow lane ten miles distant from the breakfasters in the direction of his father s Vicarage at Emminster carrying as well as he could a little basket which contained some black puddings and a bottle of mead sent by missus Crick with her kind respects to his parents The white lane stretched before him and his eyes were upon it but they were staring into next year and not at the lane He loved her ought he to marry her Dared he to marry her What would his mother and his brothers say What would he himself say a couple of years after the event That would depend upon whether the germs of staunch comradeship underlay the temporary emotion or whether it were a sensuous joy in her form only with no substratum of everlastingness His father s hill surrounded little town the Tudor church tower of red stone the clump of trees near the Vicarage came at last into view beneath him and he rode down towards the well known gate Casting a glance in the direction of the church before entering his home he beheld standing by the vestry door a group of girls of ages between twelve and sixteen apparently awaiting the arrival of some other one who in a moment became visible a figure somewhat older than the school girls wearing a broad brimmed hat and highly starched cambric morning gown with a couple of books in her hand Clare knew her well He could not be sure that she observed him he hoped she did not so as to render it unnecessary that he should go and speak to her blameless creature that she was An overpowering reluctance to greet her made him decide that she had not seen him The young lady was Miss Mercy Chant the only daughter of his father s neighbour and friend whom it was his parents quiet hope that he might wed some day She was great at Antinomianism and Bible classes and was plainly going to hold a class now Clare s mind flew to the impassioned summer steeped heathens in the Var Vale their rosy faces court patched with cow droppings and to one the most impassioned of them all It was on the impulse of the moment that he had resolved to trot over to Emminster and hence had not written to apprise his mother and father aiming however to arrive about the breakfast hour before they should have gone out to their parish duties He was a little late and they had already sat down to the morning meal The group at the table jumped up to welcome him as soon as he entered They were his father and mother his brother the Reverend Felix curate at a town in the adjoining county home for the inside of a fortnight and his other brother the Reverend Cuthbert the classical scholar and Fellow and Dean of his College down from Cambridge for the long vacation His mother appeared in a cap and silver spectacles and his father looked what in fact he was an earnest God fearing man somewhat gaunt in years about sixty five his pale face lined with thought and purpose Over their heads hung the picture of Angel s sister the eldest of the family sixteen years his senior who had married a missionary and gone out to Africa Old mister Clare was a clergyman of a type which within the last twenty years has well nigh dropped out of contemporary life A spiritual descendant in the direct line from Wycliff Huss Luther Calvin an Evangelical of the Evangelicals a Conversionist a man of Apostolic simplicity in life and thought he had in his raw youth made up his mind once for all in the deeper questions of existence and admitted no further reasoning on them thenceforward He was regarded even by those of his own date and school of thinking as extreme while on the other hand those totally opposed to him were unwillingly won to admiration for his thoroughness and for the remarkable power he showed in dismissing all question as to principles in his energy for applying them He loved Paul of Tarsus liked saint John hated saint James as much as he dared and regarded with mixed feelings Timothy Titus and Philemon The New Testament was less a Christiad then a Pauliad to his intelligence less an argument than an intoxication His creed of determinism was such that it almost amounted to a vice and quite amounted on its negative side to a renunciative philosophy which had cousinship with that of Schopenhauer and Leopardi He despised the Canons and Rubric swore by the Articles and deemed himself consistent through the whole category which in a way he might have been One thing he certainly was sincere To the aesthetic sensuous pagan pleasure in natural life and lush womanhood which his son Angel had lately been experiencing in Var Vale his temper would have been antipathetic in a high degree had he either by inquiry or imagination been able to apprehend it Once upon a time Angel had been so unlucky as to say to his father in a moment of irritation that it might have resulted far better for mankind if Greece had been the source of the religion of modern civilization and not Palestine and his father s grief was of that blank description which could not realize that there might lurk a thousandth part of a truth much less a half truth or a whole truth in such a proposition He had simply preached austerely at Angel for some time after But the kindness of his heart was such that he never resented anything for long and welcomed his son to day with a smile which was as candidly sweet as a child s Angel sat down and the place felt like home yet he did not so much as formerly feel himself one of the family gathered there Every time that he returned hither he was conscious of this divergence and since he had last shared in the Vicarage life it had grown even more distinctly foreign to his own than usual Its transcendental aspirations still unconsciously based on the geocentric view of things a zenithal paradise a nadiral hell were as foreign to his own as if they had been the dreams of people on another planet Latterly he had seen only Life felt only the great passionate pulse of existence unwarped uncontorted untrammelled by those creeds which futilely attempt to check what wisdom would be content to regulate On their part they saw a great difference in him a growing divergence from the Angel Clare of former times It was chiefly a difference in his manner that they noticed just now particularly his brothers He was getting to behave like a farmer he flung his legs about the muscles of his face had grown more expressive his eyes looked as much information as his tongue spoke and more The manner of the scholar had nearly disappeared still more the manner of the drawing room young man A prig would have said that he had lost culture and a prude that he had become coarse Such was the contagion of domiciliary fellowship with the Talbothays nymphs and swains After breakfast he walked with his two brothers non evangelical well educated hall marked young men correct to their remotest fibre such unimpeachable models as are turned out yearly by the lathe of a systematic tuition They were both somewhat short sighted and when it was the custom to wear a single eyeglass and string they wore a single eyeglass and string when it was the custom to wear a double glass they wore a double glass when it was the custom to wear spectacles they wore spectacles straightway all without reference to the particular variety of defect in their own vision When Wordsworth was enthroned they carried pocket copies and when Shelley was belittled they allowed him to grow dusty on their shelves When Correggio s Holy Families were admired they admired Correggio s Holy Families when he was decried in favour of Velasquez they sedulously followed suit without any personal objection If these two noticed Angel s growing social ineptness he noticed their growing mental limitations Felix seemed to him all Church Cuthbert all College His Diocesan Synod and Visitations were the mainsprings of the world to the one Cambridge to the other Each brother candidly recognized that there were a few unimportant score of millions of outsiders in civilized society persons who were neither University men nor churchmen but they were to be tolerated rather than reckoned with and respected They were both dutiful and attentive sons and were regular in their visits to their parents Felix though an offshoot from a far more recent point in the devolution of theology than his father was less self sacrificing and disinterested More tolerant than his father of a contradictory opinion in its aspect as a danger to its holder he was less ready than his father to pardon it as a slight to his own teaching Cuthbert was upon the whole the more liberal minded though with greater subtlety he had not so much heart As they walked along the hillside Angel s former feeling revived in him that whatever their advantages by comparison with himself neither saw or set forth life as it really was lived Perhaps as with many men their opportunities of observation were not so good as their opportunities of expression Neither had an adequate conception of the complicated forces at work outside the smooth and gentle current in which they and their associates floated Neither saw the difference between local truth and universal truth that what the inner world said in their clerical and academic hearing was quite a different thing from what the outer world was thinking I suppose it is farming or nothing for you now my dear fellow Felix was saying among other things to his youngest brother as he looked through his spectacles at the distant fields with sad austerity And therefore we must make the best of it But I do entreat you to endeavour to keep as much as possible in touch with moral ideals Farming of course means roughing it externally but high thinking may go with plain living nevertheless Of course it may said Angel Was it not proved nineteen hundred years ago if I may trespass upon your domain a little Why should you think Felix that I am likely to drop my high thinking and my moral ideals Well I fancied from the tone of your letters and our conversation it may be fancy only that you were somehow losing intellectual grasp Hasn t it struck you Cuthbert Now Felix said Angel drily we are very good friends you know each of us treading our allotted circles but if it comes to intellectual grasp I think you as a contented dogmatist had better leave mine alone and inquire what has become of yours They returned down the hill to dinner which was fixed at any time at which their father s and mother s morning work in the parish usually concluded Convenience as regarded afternoon callers was the last thing to enter into the consideration of unselfish mister and missus Clare though the three sons were sufficiently in unison on this matter to wish that their parents would conform a little to modern notions The walk had made them hungry Angel in particular who was now an outdoor man accustomed to the profuse dapes inemptae of the dairyman s somewhat coarsely laden table But neither of the old people had arrived and it was not till the sons were almost tired of waiting that their parents entered The self denying pair had been occupied in coaxing the appetites of some of their sick parishioners whom they somewhat inconsistently tried to keep imprisoned in the flesh their own appetites being quite forgotten The family sat down to table and a frugal meal of cold viands was deposited before them Angel looked round for missus Crick s black puddings which he had directed to be nicely grilled as they did them at the dairy and of which he wished his father and mother to appreciate the marvellous herbal savours as highly as he did himself Ah you are looking for the black puddings my dear boy observed Clare s mother But I am sure you will not mind doing without them as I am sure your father and I shall not when you know the reason I suggested to him that we should take missus Crick s kind present to the children of the man who can earn nothing just now because of his attacks of delirium tremens and he agreed that it would be a great pleasure to them so we did Of course said Angel cheerfully looking round for the mead I found the mead so extremely alcoholic continued his mother that it was quite unfit for use as a beverage but as valuable as rum or brandy in an emergency so I have put it in my medicine closet We never drink spirits at this table on principle added his father But what shall I tell the dairyman s wife said Angel The truth of course said his father I rather wanted to say we enjoyed the mead and the black puddings very much She is a kind jolly sort of body and is sure to ask me directly I return You cannot if we did not mister Clare answered lucidly Ah no though that mead was a drop of pretty tipple A what said Cuthbert and Felix both Oh tis an expression they use down at Talbothays replied Angel blushing He felt that his parents were right in their practice if wrong in their want of sentiment and said no more XXVI It was not till the evening after family prayers that Angel found opportunity of broaching to his father one or two subjects near his heart He had strung himself up to the purpose while kneeling behind his brothers on the carpet studying the little nails in the heels of their walking boots When the service was over they went out of the room with their mother and mister Clare and himself were left alone The young man first discussed with the elder his plans for the attainment of his position as a farmer on an extensive scale either in England or in the Colonies His father then told him that as he had not been put to the expense of sending Angel up to Cambridge he had felt it his duty to set by a sum of money every year towards the purchase or lease of land for him some day that he might not feel himself unduly slighted As far as worldly wealth goes continued his father you will no doubt stand far superior to your brothers in a few years This considerateness on old mister Clare s part led Angel onward to the other and dearer subject He observed to his father that he was then six and twenty and that when he should start in the farming business he would require eyes in the back of his head to see to all matters some one would be necessary to superintend the domestic labours of his establishment whilst he was afield Would it not be well therefore for him to marry His father seemed to think this idea not unreasonable and then Angel put the question What kind of wife do you think would be best for me as a thrifty hard working farmer A truly Christian woman who will be a help and a comfort to you in your goings out and your comings in Beyond that it really matters little Such an one can be found indeed my earnest minded friend and neighbour doctor Chant But ought she not primarily to be able to milk cows churn good butter make immense cheeses know how to sit hens and turkeys and rear chickens to direct a field of labourers in an emergency and estimate the value of sheep and calves Yes a farmer s wife yes certainly It would be desirable mister Clare the elder had plainly never thought of these points before I was going to add he said that for a pure and saintly woman you will not find one more to your true advantage and certainly not more to your mother s mind and my own than your friend Mercy whom you used to show a certain interest in It is true that my neighbour Chant s daughter had lately caught up the fashion of the younger clergy round about us for decorating the Communion table altar as I was shocked to hear her call it one day with flowers and other stuff on festival occasions But her father who is quite as opposed to such flummery as I says that can be cured It is a mere girlish outbreak which I am sure will not be permanent Yes yes Mercy is good and devout I know But father don t you think that a young woman equally pure and virtuous as Miss Chant but one who in place of that lady s ecclesiastical accomplishments understands the duties of farm life as well as a farmer himself would suit me infinitely better His father persisted in his conviction that a knowledge of a farmer s wife s duties came second to a Pauline view of humanity and the impulsive Angel wishing to honour his father s feelings and to advance the cause of his heart at the same time grew specious He said that fate or Providence had thrown in his way a woman who possessed every qualification to be the helpmate of an agriculturist and was decidedly of a serious turn of mind He would not say whether or not she had attached herself to the sound Low Church School of his father but she would probably be open to conviction on that point she was a regular church goer of simple faith honest hearted receptive intelligent graceful to a degree chaste as a vestal and in personal appearance exceptionally beautiful Is she of a family such as you would care to marry into a lady in short asked his startled mother who had come softly into the study during the conversation She is not what in common parlance is called a lady said Angel unflinchingly for she is a cottager s daughter as I am proud to say But she IS a lady nevertheless in feeling and nature Mercy Chant is of a very good family Pooh what s the advantage of that mother said Angel quickly How is family to avail the wife of a man who has to rough it as I have and shall have to do Mercy is accomplished And accomplishments have their charm returned his mother looking at him through her silver spectacles As to external accomplishments what will be the use of them in the life I am going to lead while as to her reading I can take that in hand She ll be apt pupil enough as you would say if you knew her She s brim full of poetry actualized poetry if I may use the expression She LIVES what paper poets only write And she is an unimpeachable Christian I am sure perhaps of the very tribe genus and species you desire to propagate O Angel you are mocking Mother I beg pardon But as she really does attend Church almost every Sunday morning and is a good Christian girl I am sure you will tolerate any social shortcomings for the sake of that quality and feel that I may do worse than choose her Angel waxed quite earnest on that rather automatic orthodoxy in his beloved Tess which never dreaming that it might stand him in such good stead he had been prone to slight when observing it practised by her and the other milkmaids because of its obvious unreality amid beliefs essentially naturalistic In their sad doubts as to whether their son had himself any right whatever to the title he claimed for the unknown young woman mister and missus Clare began to feel it as an advantage not to be overlooked that she at least was sound in her views especially as the conjunction of the pair must have arisen by an act of Providence for Angel never would have made orthodoxy a condition of his choice They said finally that it was better not to act in a hurry but that they would not object to see her Angel therefore refrained from declaring more particulars now He felt that single minded and self sacrificing as his parents were there yet existed certain latent prejudices of theirs as middle class people which it would require some tact to overcome For though legally at liberty to do as he chose and though their daughter in law s qualifications could make no practical difference to their lives in the probability of her living far away from them he wished for affection s sake not to wound their sentiment in the most important decision of his life He observed his own inconsistencies in dwelling upon accidents in Tess s life as if they were vital features It was for herself that he loved Tess her soul her heart her substance not for her skill in the dairy her aptness as his scholar and certainly not for her simple formal faith professions Her unsophisticated open air existence required no varnish of conventionality to make it palatable to him He held that education had as yet but little affected the beats of emotion and impulse on which domestic happiness depends It was probable that in the lapse of ages improved systems of moral and intellectual training would appreciably perhaps considerably elevate the involuntary and even the unconscious instincts of human nature but up to the present day culture as far as he could see might be said to have affected only the mental epiderm of those lives which had been brought under its influence This belief was confirmed by his experience of women which having latterly been extended from the cultivated middle class into the rural community had taught him how much less was the intrinsic difference between the good and wise woman of one social stratum and the good and wise woman of another social stratum than between the good and bad the wise and the foolish of the same stratum or class It was the morning of his departure His brothers had already left the Vicarage to proceed on a walking tour in the north whence one was to return to his college and the other to his curacy Angel might have accompanied them but preferred to rejoin his sweetheart at Talbothays He would have been an awkward member of the party for though the most appreciative humanist the most ideal religionist even the best versed Christologist of the three there was alienation in the standing consciousness that his squareness would not fit the round hole that had been prepared for him To neither Felix nor Cuthbert had he ventured to mention Tess His mother made him sandwiches and his father accompanied him on his own mare a little way along the road Having fairly well advanced his own affairs Angel listened in a willing silence as they jogged on together through the shady lanes to his father s account of his parish difficulties and the coldness of brother clergymen whom he loved because of his strict interpretations of the New Testament by the light of what they deemed a pernicious Calvinistic doctrine Pernicious said mister Clare with genial scorn and he proceeded to recount experiences which would show the absurdity of that idea He told of wondrous conversions of evil livers of which he had been the instrument not only amongst the poor but amongst the rich and well to do and he also candidly admitted many failures As an instance of the latter he mentioned the case of a young upstart squire named d Urberville living some forty miles off in the neighbourhood of Trantridge Not one of the ancient d Urbervilles of Kingsbere and other places asked his son That curiously historic worn out family with its ghostly legend of the coach and four O no The original d Urbervilles decayed and disappeared sixty or eighty years ago at least I believe so This seems to be a new family which had taken the name for the credit of the former knightly line I hope they are spurious I m sure But it is odd to hear you express interest in old families I thought you set less store by them even than I You misapprehend me father you often do said Angel with a little impatience Politically I am sceptical as to the virtue of their being old Some of the wise even among themselves exclaim against their own succession as Hamlet puts it but lyrically dramatically and even historically I am tenderly attached to them This distinction though by no means a subtle one was yet too subtle for mister Clare the elder and he went on with the story he had been about to relate which was that after the death of the senior so called d Urberville the young man developed the most culpable passions though he had a blind mother whose condition should have made him know better A knowledge of his career having come to the ears of mister Clare when he was in that part of the country preaching missionary sermons he boldly took occasion to speak to the delinquent on his spiritual state Though he was a stranger occupying another s pulpit he had felt this to be his duty and took for his text the words from saint Luke Thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee The young man much resented this directness of attack and in the war of words which followed when they met he did not scruple publicly to insult mister Clare without respect for his gray hairs Angel flushed with distress Dear father he said sadly I wish you would not expose yourself to such gratuitous pain from scoundrels Pain said his father his rugged face shining in the ardour of self abnegation The only pain to me was pain on his account poor foolish young man Do you suppose his incensed words could give me any pain or even his blows Being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we entreat we are made as the filth of the world and as the offscouring of all things unto this day Those ancient and noble words to the Corinthians are strictly true at this present hour Not blows father He did not proceed to blows No he did not Though I have borne blows from men in a mad state of intoxication No A dozen times my boy What then I have saved them from the guilt of murdering their own flesh and blood thereby and they have lived to thank me and praise God May this young man do the same said Angel fervently But I fear otherwise from what you say We ll hope nevertheless said mister Clare And I continue to pray for him though on this side of the grave we shall probably never meet again But after all one of those poor words of mine may spring up in his heart as a good seed some day Now as always Clare s father was sanguine as a child and though the younger could not accept his parent s narrow dogma he revered his practice and recognized the hero under the pietist Perhaps he revered his father s practice even more now than ever seeing that in the question of making Tessy his wife his father had not once thought of inquiring whether she were well provided or penniless The same unworldliness was what had necessitated Angel s getting a living as a farmer and would probably keep his brothers in the position of poor parsons for the term of their activities yet Angel admired it none the less Indeed despite his own heterodoxy Angel often felt that he was nearer to his father on the human side than was either of his brethren XXVII An up hill and down hill ride of twenty odd miles through a garish mid day atmosphere brought him in the afternoon to a detached knoll a mile or two west of Talbothays whence he again looked into that green trough of sappiness and humidity the valley of the Var or Froom Immediately he began to descend from the upland to the fat alluvial soil below the atmosphere grew heavier the languid perfume of the summer fruits the mists the hay the flowers formed therein a vast pool of odour which at this hour seemed to make the animals the very bees and butterflies drowsy Clare was now so familiar with the spot that he knew the individual cows by their names when a long distance off he saw them dotted about the meads It was with a sense of luxury that he recognized his power of viewing life here from its inner side in a way that had been quite foreign to him in his student days and much as he loved his parents he could not help being aware that to come here as now after an experience of home life affected him like throwing off splints and bandages even the one customary curb on the humours of English rural societies being absent in this place Talbothays having no resident landlord Not a human being was out of doors at the dairy The denizens were all enjoying the usual afternoon nap of an hour or so which the exceedingly early hours kept in summer time rendered a necessity At the door the wood hooped pails sodden and bleached by infinite scrubbings hung like hats on a stand upon the forked and peeled limb of an oak fixed there for that purpose all of them ready and dry for the evening milking Angel entered and went through the silent passages of the house to the back quarters where he listened for a moment Sustained snores came from the cart house where some of the men were lying down the grunt and squeal of sweltering pigs arose from the still further distance The large leaved rhubarb and cabbage plants slept too their broad limp surfaces hanging in the sun like half closed umbrellas He unbridled and fed his horse and as he re entered the house the clock struck three Three was the afternoon skimming hour and with the stroke Clare heard the creaking of the floor boards above and then the touch of a descending foot on the stairs It was Tess s who in another moment came down before his eyes She had not heard him enter and hardly realized his presence there She was yawning and he saw the red interior of her mouth as if it had been a snake s She had stretched one arm so high above her coiled up cable of hair that he could see its satin delicacy above the sunburn her face was flushed with sleep and her eyelids hung heavy over their pupils The brim fulness of her nature breathed from her It was a moment when a woman s soul is more incarnate than at any other time when the most spiritual beauty bespeaks itself flesh and sex takes the outside place in the presentation Then those eyes flashed brightly through their filmy heaviness before the remainder of her face was well awake With an oddly compounded look of gladness shyness and surprise she exclaimed O mister Clare How you frightened me I There had not at first been time for her to think of the changed relations which his declaration had introduced but the full sense of the matter rose up in her face when she encountered Clare s tender look as he stepped forward to the bottom stair Dear darling Tessy he whispered putting his arm round her and his face to her flushed cheek Don t for Heaven s sake Mister me any more I have hastened back so soon because of you Tess s excitable heart beat against his by way of reply and there they stood upon the red brick floor of the entry the sun slanting in by the window upon his back as he held her tightly to his breast upon her inclining face upon the blue veins of her temple upon her naked arm and her neck and into the depths of her hair Having been lying down in her clothes she was warm as a sunned cat At first she would not look straight up at him but her eyes soon lifted and his plumbed the deepness of the ever varying pupils with their radiating fibrils of blue and black and gray and violet while she regarded him as Eve at her second waking might have regarded Adam I ve got to go a skimming she pleaded and I have on y old Deb to help me to day missus Crick is gone to market with mister Crick and Retty is not well and the others are gone out somewhere and won t be home till milking As they retreated to the milk house Deborah Fyander appeared on the stairs I have come back Deborah said mister Clare upwards So I can help Tess with the skimming and as you are very tired I am sure you needn t come down till milking time Possibly the Talbothays milk was not very thoroughly skimmed that afternoon Tess was in a dream wherein familiar objects appeared as having light and shade and position but no particular outline Every time she held the skimmer under the pump to cool it for the work her hand trembled the ardour of his affection being so palpable that she seemed to flinch under it like a plant in too burning a sun Then he pressed her again to his side and when she had done running her forefinger round the leads to cut off the cream edge he cleaned it in nature s way for the unconstrained manners of Talbothays dairy came convenient now I may as well say it now as later dearest he resumed gently I wish to ask you something of a very practical nature which I have been thinking of ever since that day last week in the meads I shall soon want to marry and being a farmer you see I shall require for my wife a woman who knows all about the management of farms Will you be that woman Tessy He put it that way that she might not think he had yielded to an impulse of which his head would disapprove She turned quite careworn She had bowed to the inevitable result of proximity the necessity of loving him but she had not calculated upon this sudden corollary which indeed Clare had put before her without quite meaning himself to do it so soon With pain that was like the bitterness of dissolution she murmured the words of her indispensable and sworn answer as an honourable woman O mister Clare I cannot be your wife I cannot be The sound of her own decision seemed to break Tess s very heart and she bowed her face in her grief But Tess he said amazed at her reply and holding her still more greedily close Do you say no Surely you love me O yes yes And I would rather be yours than anybody s in the world returned the sweet and honest voice of the distressed girl But I CANNOT marry you Tess he said holding her at arm s length you are engaged to marry some one else No no Then why do you refuse me I don t want to marry I have not thought of doing it I cannot I only want to love you But why Driven to subterfuge she stammered Your father is a parson and your mother wouldn like you to marry such as me She will want you to marry a lady Nonsense I have spoken to them both That was partly why I went home I feel I cannot never never she echoed Is it too sudden to be asked thus my Pretty Yes I did not expect it If you will let it pass please Tessy I will give you time he said It was very abrupt to come home and speak to you all at once I ll not allude to it again for a while She again took up the shining skimmer held it beneath the pump and began anew But she could not as at other times hit the exact under surface of the cream with the delicate dexterity required try as she might sometimes she was cutting down into the milk sometimes in the air She could hardly see her eyes having filled with two blurring tears drawn forth by a grief which to this her best friend and dear advocate she could never explain I can t skim I can t she said turning away from him Not to agitate and hinder her longer the considerate Clare began talking in a more general way You quite misapprehend my parents They are the most simple mannered people alive and quite unambitious They are two of the few remaining Evangelical school Tessy are you an Evangelical I don t know You go to church very regularly and our parson here is not very High they tell me Tess s ideas on the views of the parish clergyman whom she heard every week seemed to be rather more vague than Clare s who had never heard him at all I wish I could fix my mind on what I hear there more firmly than I do she remarked as a safe generality It is often a great sorrow to me She spoke so unaffectedly that Angel was sure in his heart that his father could not object to her on religious grounds even though she did not know whether her principles were High Low or Broad He himself knew that in reality the confused beliefs which she held apparently imbibed in childhood were if anything Tractarian as to phraseology and Pantheistic as to essence Confused or otherwise to disturb them was his last desire Leave thou thy sister when she prays Her early Heaven her happy views Nor thou with shadow d hint confuse A life that leads melodious days He had occasionally thought the counsel less honest than musical but he gladly conformed to it now He spoke further of the incidents of his visit of his father s mode of life of his zeal for his principles she grew serener and the undulations disappeared from her skimming as she finished one lead after another he followed her and drew the plugs for letting down the milk I fancied you looked a little downcast when you came in she ventured to observe anxious to keep away from the subject of herself Yes well my father had been talking a good deal to me of his troubles and difficulties and the subject always tends to depress me He is so zealous that he gets many snubs and buffetings from people of a different way of thinking from himself and I don t like to hear of such humiliations to a man of his age the more particularly as I don t think earnestness does any good when carried so far He has been telling me of a very unpleasant scene in which he took part quite recently He went as the deputy of some missionary society to preach in the neighbourhood of Trantridge a place forty miles from here and made it his business to expostulate with a lax young cynic he met with somewhere about there son of some landowner up that way and who has a mother afflicted with blindness My father addressed himself to the gentleman point blank and there was quite a disturbance It was very foolish of my father I must say to intrude his conversation upon a stranger when the probabilities were so obvious that it would be useless But whatever he thinks to be his duty that he ll do in season or out of season and of course he makes many enemies not only among the absolutely vicious but among the easy going who hate being bothered He says he glories in what happened and that good may be done indirectly but I wish he would not wear himself out now he is getting old and would leave such pigs to their wallowing Tess s look had grown hard and worn and her ripe mouth tragical but she no longer showed any tremulousness Clare s revived thoughts of his father prevented his noticing her particularly and so they went on down the white row of liquid rectangles till they had finished and drained them off when the other maids returned and took their pails and Deb came to scald out the leads for the new milk As Tess withdrew to go afield to the cows he said to her softly And my question Tessy O no no replied she with grave hopelessness as one who had heard anew the turmoil of her own past in the allusion to Alec d Urberville It CAN T be She went out towards the mead joining the other milkmaids with a bound as if trying to make the open air drive away her sad constraint All the girls drew onward to the spot where the cows were grazing in the farther mead the bevy advancing with the bold grace of wild animals the reckless unchastened motion of women accustomed to unlimited space in which they abandoned themselves to the air as a swimmer to the wave It seemed natural enough to him now that Tess was again in sight to choose a mate from unconstrained Nature and not from the abodes of Art XXVIII Her refusal though unexpected did not permanently daunt Clare His experience of women was great enough for him to be aware that the negative often meant nothing more than the preface to the affirmative and it was little enough for him not to know that in the manner of the present negative there lay a great exception to the dallyings of coyness That she had already permitted him to make love to her he read as an additional assurance not fully trowing that in the fields and pastures to sigh gratis is by no means deemed waste love making being here more often accepted inconsiderately and for its own sweet sake than in the carking anxious homes of the ambitious where a girl s craving for an establishment paralyzes her healthy thought of a passion as an end Tess why did you say no in such a positive way he asked her in the course of a few days She started Don t ask me I told you why partly I am not good enough not worthy enough How Not fine lady enough Yes something like that murmured she Your friends would scorn me Indeed you mistake them my father and mother As for my brothers I don t care He clasped his fingers behind her back to keep her from slipping away Now you did not mean it sweet I am sure you did not You have made me so restless that I cannot read or play or do anything I am in no hurry Tess but I want to know to hear from your own warm lips that you will some day be mine any time you may choose but some day She could only shake her head and look away from him Clare regarded her attentively conned the characters of her face as if they had been hieroglyphics The denial seemed real Then I ought not to hold you in this way ought I I have no right to you no right to seek out where you are or walk with you Honestly Tess do you love any other man How can you ask she said with continued self suppression I almost know that you do not But then why do you repulse me I don t repulse you I like you to tell me you love me and you may always tell me so as you go about with me and never offend me But you will not accept me as a husband Ah that s different it is for your good indeed my dearest O believe me it is only for your sake I don t like to give myself the great happiness o promising to be yours in that way because because I am SURE I ought not to do it But you will make me happy Ah you think so but you don t know At such times as this apprehending the grounds of her refusal to be her modest sense of incompetence in matters social and polite he would say that she was wonderfully well informed and versatile which was certainly true her natural quickness and her admiration for him having led her to pick up his vocabulary his accent and fragments of his knowledge to a surprising extent After these tender contests and her victory she would go away by herself under the remotest cow if at milking time or into the sedge or into her room if at a leisure interval and mourn silently not a minute after an apparently phlegmatic negative The struggle was so fearful her own heart was so strongly on the side of his two ardent hearts against one poor little conscience that she tried to fortify her resolution by every means in her power She had come to Talbothays with a made up mind On no account could she agree to a step which might afterwards cause bitter rueing to her husband for his blindness in wedding her And she held that what her conscience had decided for her when her mind was unbiassed ought not to be overruled now Why don t somebody tell him all about me she said It was only forty miles off why hasn t it reached here Somebody must know Yet nobody seemed to know nobody told him For two or three days no more was said She guessed from the sad countenances of her chamber companions that they regarded her not only as the favourite but as the chosen but they could see for themselves that she did not put herself in his way Tess had never before known a time in which the thread of her life was so distinctly twisted of two strands positive pleasure and positive pain At the next cheese making the pair were again left alone together The dairyman himself had been lending a hand but mister Crick as well as his wife seemed latterly to have acquired a suspicion of mutual interest between these two though they walked so circumspectly that suspicion was but of the faintest Anyhow the dairyman left them to themselves They were breaking up the masses of curd before putting them into the vats The operation resembled the act of crumbling bread on a large scale and amid the immaculate whiteness of the curds Tess Durbeyfield s hands showed themselves of the pinkness of the rose Angel who was filling the vats with his handful suddenly ceased and laid his hands flat upon hers Her sleeves were rolled far above the elbow and bending lower he kissed the inside vein of her soft arm Although the early September weather was sultry her arm from her dabbling in the curds was as cold and damp to his mouth as a new gathered mushroom and tasted of the whey But she was such a sheaf of susceptibilities that her pulse was accelerated by the touch her blood driven to her finder ends and the cool arms flushed hot Then as though her heart had said Is coyness longer necessary Truth is truth between man and woman as between man and man she lifted her eyes and they beamed devotedly into his as her lip rose in a tender half smile Do you know why I did that Tess he said Because you love me very much Yes and as a preliminary to a new entreaty Not AGAIN She looked a sudden fear that her resistance might break down under her own desire O Tessy he went on I CANNOT think why you are so tantalizing Why do you disappoint me so You seem almost like a coquette upon my life you do a coquette of the first urban water They blow hot and blow cold just as you do and it is the very last sort of thing to expect to find in a retreat like Talbothays And yet dearest he quickly added observing now the remark had cut her I know you to be the most honest spotless creature that ever lived So how can I suppose you a flirt Tess why don t you like the idea of being my wife if you love me as you seem to do I have never said I don t like the idea and I never could say it because it isn t true The stress now getting beyond endurance her lip quivered and she was obliged to go away Clare was so pained and perplexed that he ran after and caught her in the passage Tell me tell me he said passionately clasping her in forgetfulness of his curdy hands do tell me that you won t belong to anybody but me I will I will tell you she exclaimed And I will give you a complete answer if you will let me go now I will tell you my experiences all about myself all Your experiences dear yes certainly any number He expressed assent in loving satire looking into her face My Tess no doubt almost as many experiences as that wild convolvulus out there on the garden hedge that opened itself this morning for the first time Tell me anything but don t use that wretched expression any more about not being worthy of me I will try not And I ll give you my reasons to morrow next week Say on Sunday Yes on Sunday At last she got away and did not stop in her retreat till she was in the thicket of pollard willows at the lower side of the barton where she could be quite unseen Here Tess flung herself down upon the rustling undergrowth of spear grass as upon a bed and remained crouching in palpitating misery broken by momentary shoots of joy which her fears about the ending could not altogether suppress In reality she was drifting into acquiescence Every see saw of her breath every wave of her blood every pulse singing in her ears was a voice that joined with nature in revolt against her scrupulousness Reckless inconsiderate acceptance of him to close with him at the altar revealing nothing and chancing discovery to snatch ripe pleasure before the iron teeth of pain could have time to shut upon her that was what love counselled and in almost a terror of ecstasy Tess divined that despite her many months of lonely self chastisement wrestlings communings schemes to lead a future of austere isolation love s counsel would prevail The afternoon advanced and still she remained among the willows She heard the rattle of taking down the pails from the forked stands the waow waow which accompanied the getting together of the cows But she did not go to the milking They would see her agitation and the dairyman thinking the cause to be love alone would good naturedly tease her and that harassment could not be borne Her lover must have guessed her overwrought state and invented some excuse for her non appearance for no inquiries were made or calls given At half past six the sun settled down upon the levels with the aspect of a great forge in the heavens and presently a monstrous pumpkin like moon arose on the other hand The pollard willows tortured out of their natural shape by incessant choppings became spiny haired monsters as they stood up against it She went in and upstairs without a light It was now Wednesday Thursday came and Angel looked thoughtfully at her from a distance but intruded in no way upon her The indoor milkmaids Marian and the rest seemed to guess that something definite was afoot for they did not force any remarks upon her in the bedchamber Friday passed Saturday To morrow was the day I shall give way I shall say yes I shall let myself marry him I cannot help it she jealously panted with her hot face to the pillow that night on hearing one of the other girls sigh his name in her sleep I can t bear to let anybody have him but me Yet it is a wrong to him and may kill him when he knows O my heart O O O XXIX Now who mid ye think I ve heard news o this morning said Dairyman Crick as he sat down to breakfast next day with a riddling gaze round upon the munching men and maids Now just who mid ye think One guessed and another guessed missus Crick did not guess because she knew already Well said the dairyman tis that slack twisted hore s bird of a feller Jack Dollop He s lately got married to a widow woman Not Jack Dollop A villain to think o that said a milker The name entered quickly into Tess Durbeyfield s consciousness for it was the name of the lover who had wronged his sweetheart and had afterwards been so roughly used by the young woman s mother in the butter churn And had he married the valiant matron s daughter as he promised asked Angel Clare absently as he turned over the newspaper he was reading at the little table to which he was always banished by missus Crick in her sense of his gentility Not he sir Never meant to replied the dairyman As I say tis a widow woman and she had money it seems fifty poun a year or so and that was all he was after They were married in a great hurry and then she told him that by marrying she had lost her fifty poun a year Just fancy the state o my gentleman s mind at that news Never such a cat and dog life as they ve been leading ever since Serves him well beright But onluckily the poor woman gets the worst o t Well the silly body should have told en sooner that the ghost of her first man would trouble him said missus Crick Ay ay responded the dairyman indecisively Still you can see exactly how twas She wanted a home and didn t like to run the risk of losing him Don t ye think that was something like it maidens He glanced towards the row of girls She ought to ha told him just before they went to church when he could hardly have backed out exclaimed Marian Yes she ought agreed Izz She must have seen what he was after and should ha refused him cried Retty spasmodically And what do you say my dear asked the dairyman of Tess I think she ought to have told him the true state of things or else refused him I don t know replied Tess the bread and butter choking her Be cust if I d have done either o t said Beck Knibbs a married helper from one of the cottages All s fair in love and war I d ha married en just as she did and if he d said two words to me about not telling him beforehand anything whatsomdever about my first chap that I hadn t chose to tell I d ha knocked him down wi the rolling pin a scram little feller like he Any woman could do it The laughter which followed this sally was supplemented only by a sorry smile for form s sake from Tess What was comedy to them was tragedy to her and she could hardly bear their mirth She soon rose from table and with an impression that Clare would soon follow her went along a little wriggling path now stepping to one side of the irrigating channels and now to the other till she stood by the main stream of the Var Men had been cutting the water weeds higher up the river and masses of them were floating past her moving islands of green crow foot whereon she might almost have ridden long locks of which weed had lodged against the piles driven to keep the cows from crossing Yes there was the pain of it This question of a woman telling her story the heaviest of crosses to herself seemed but amusement to others It was as if people should laugh at martyrdom Tessy came from behind her and Clare sprang across the gully alighting beside her feet My wife soon No no I cannot For your sake O mister Clare for your sake I say no Tess Still I say no she repeated Not expecting this he had put his arm lightly round her waist the moment after speaking beneath her hanging tail of hair The younger dairymaids including Tess breakfasted with their hair loose on Sunday mornings before building it up extra high for attending church a style they could not adopt when milking with their heads against the cows If she had said Yes instead of No he would have kissed her it had evidently been his intention but her determined negative deterred his scrupulous heart Their condition of domiciliary comradeship put her as the woman to such disadvantage by its enforced intercourse that he felt it unfair to her to exercise any pressure of blandishment which he might have honestly employed had she been better able to avoid him He released her momentarily imprisoned waist and withheld the kiss It all turned on that release What had given her strength to refuse him this time was solely the tale of the widow told by the dairyman and that would have been overcome in another moment But Angel said no more his face was perplexed he went away Day after day they met somewhat less constantly than before and thus two or three weeks went by The end of September drew near and she could see in his eye that he might ask her again His plan of procedure was different now as though he had made up his mind that her negatives were after all only coyness and youth startled by the novelty of the proposal The fitful evasiveness of her manner when the subject was under discussion countenanced the idea So he played a more coaxing game and while never going beyond words or attempting the renewal of caresses he did his utmost orally In this way Clare persistently wooed her in undertones like that of the purling milk at the cow s side at skimmings at butter makings at cheese makings among broody poultry and among farrowing pigs as no milkmaid was ever wooed before by such a man Tess knew that she must break down Neither a religious sense of a certain moral validity in the previous union nor a conscientious wish for candour could hold out against it much longer She loved him so passionately and he was so godlike in her eyes and being though untrained instinctively refined her nature cried for his tutelary guidance And thus though Tess kept repeating to herself I can never be his wife the words were vain A proof of her weakness lay in the very utterance of what calm strength would not have taken the trouble to formulate Every sound of his voice beginning on the old subject stirred her with a terrifying bliss and she coveted the recantation she feared His manner was what man s is not so much that of one who would love and cherish and defend her under any conditions changes charges or revelations that her gloom lessened as she basked in it The season meanwhile was drawing onward to the equinox and though it was still fine the days were much shorter The dairy had again worked by morning candlelight for a long time and a fresh renewal of Clare s pleading occurred one morning between three and four She had run up in her bedgown to his door to call him as usual then had gone back to dress and call the others and in ten minutes was walking to the head of the stairs with the candle in her hand At the same moment he came down his steps from above in his shirt sleeves and put his arm across the stairway Now Miss Flirt before you go down he said peremptorily It is a fortnight since I spoke and this won t do any longer You MUST tell me what you mean or I shall have to leave this house My door was ajar just now and I saw you For your own safety I must go You don t know Well Is it to be yes at last I am only just up mister Clare and it is too early to take me to task she pouted You need not call me Flirt Tis cruel and untrue Wait till by and by Please wait till by and by I will really think seriously about it between now and then Let me go downstairs She looked a little like what he said she was as holding the candle sideways she tried to smile away the seriousness of her words Call me Angel then and not mister Clare Angel Angel dearest why not Twould mean that I agree wouldn t it It would only mean that you love me even if you cannot marry me and you were so good as to own that long ago Very well then Angel dearest if I MUST she murmured looking at her candle a roguish curl coming upon her mouth notwithstanding her suspense Clare had resolved never to kiss her until he had obtained her promise but somehow as Tess stood there in her prettily tucked up milking gown her hair carelessly heaped upon her head till there should be leisure to arrange it when skimming and milking were done he broke his resolve and brought his lips to her cheek for one moment She passed downstairs very quickly never looking back at him or saying another word The other maids were already down and the subject was not pursued Except Marian they all looked wistfully and suspiciously at the pair in the sad yellow rays which the morning candles emitted in contrast with the first cold signals of the dawn without When skimming was done which as the milk diminished with the approach of autumn was a lessening process day by day Retty and the rest went out The lovers followed them Our tremulous lives are so different from theirs are they not he musingly observed to her as he regarded the three figures tripping before him through the frigid pallor of opening day Not so very different I think she said Why do you think that There are very few women s lives that are not tremulous Tess replied pausing over the new word as if it impressed her There s more in those three than you think What is in them Almost either of em she began would make perhaps would make a properer wife than I And perhaps they love you as well as I almost O Tessy There were signs that it was an exquisite relief to her to hear the impatient exclamation though she had resolved so intrepidly to let generosity make one bid against herself That was now done and she had not the power to attempt self immolation a second time then They were joined by a milker from one of the cottages and no more was said on that which concerned them so deeply But Tess knew that this day would decide it In the afternoon several of the dairyman s household and assistants went down to the meads as usual a long way from the dairy where many of the cows were milked without being driven home The supply was getting less as the animals advanced in calf and the supernumerary milkers of the lush green season had been dismissed The work progressed leisurely Each pailful was poured into tall cans that stood in a large spring waggon which had been brought upon the scene and when they were milked the cows trailed away Dairyman Crick who was there with the rest his wrapper gleaming miraculously white against a leaden evening sky suddenly looked at his heavy watch Why tis later than I thought he said Begad We shan t be soon enough with this milk at the station if we don t mind There s no time to day to take it home and mix it with the bulk afore sending off It must go to station straight from here Who ll drive it across mister Clare volunteered to do so though it was none of his business asking Tess to accompany him The evening though sunless had been warm and muggy for the season and Tess had come out with her milking hood only naked armed and jacketless certainly not dressed for a drive She therefore replied by glancing over her scant habiliments but Clare gently urged her She assented by relinquishing her pail and stool to the dairyman to take home and mounted the spring waggon beside Clare XXX In the diminishing daylight they went along the level roadway through the meads which stretched away into gray miles and were backed in the extreme edge of distance by the swarthy and abrupt slopes of Egdon Heath On its summit stood clumps and stretches of fir trees whose notched tips appeared like battlemented towers crowning black fronted castles of enchantment They were so absorbed in the sense of being close to each other that they did not begin talking for a long while the silence being broken only by the clucking of the milk in the tall cans behind them The lane they followed was so solitary that the hazel nuts had remained on the boughs till they slipped from their shells and the blackberries hung in heavy clusters Every now and then Angel would fling the lash of his whip round one of these pluck it off and give it to his companion The dull sky soon began to tell its meaning by sending down herald drops of rain and the stagnant air of the day changed into a fitful breeze which played about their faces The quick silvery glaze on the rivers and pools vanished from broad mirrors of light they changed to lustreless sheets of lead with a surface like a rasp But that spectacle did not affect her preoccupation Her countenance a natural carnation slightly embrowned by the season had deepened its tinge with the beating of the rain drops and her hair which the pressure of the cows flanks had as usual caused to tumble down from its fastenings and stray beyond the curtain of her calico bonnet was made clammy by the moisture till it hardly was better than seaweed I ought not to have come I suppose she murmured looking at the sky I am sorry for the rain said he But how glad I am to have you here Remote Egdon disappeared by degree behind the liquid gauze The evening grew darker and the roads being crossed by gates it was not safe to drive faster than at a walking pace The air was rather chill I am so afraid you will get cold with nothing upon your arms and shoulders he said Creep close to me and perhaps the drizzle won t hurt you much I should be sorrier still if I did not think that the rain might be helping me She imperceptibly crept closer and he wrapped round them both a large piece of sail cloth which was sometimes used to keep the sun off the milk cans Tess held it from slipping off him as well as herself Clare s hands being occupied Now we are all right again Ah no we are not It runs down into my neck a little and it must still more into yours That s better Your arms are like wet marble Tess Wipe them in the cloth Now if you stay quiet you will not get another drop Well dear about that question of mine that long standing question The only reply that he could hear for a little while was the smack of the horse s hoofs on the moistening road and the cluck of the milk in the cans behind them Do you remember what you said I do she replied Before we get home mind I ll try He said no more then As they drove on the fragment of an old manor house of Caroline date rose against the sky and was in due course passed and left behind That he observed to entertain her is an interesting old place one of the several seats which belonged to an ancient Norman family formerly of great influence in this county the d Urbervilles I never pass one of their residences without thinking of them There is something very sad in the extinction of a family of renown even if it was fierce domineering feudal renown Yes said Tess They crept along towards a point in the expanse of shade just at hand at which a feeble light was beginning to assert its presence a spot where by day a fitful white streak of steam at intervals upon the dark green background denoted intermittent moments of contact between their secluded world and modern life Modern life stretched out its steam feeler to this point three or four times a day touched the native existences and quickly withdrew its feeler again as if what it touched had been uncongenial They reached the feeble light which came from the smoky lamp of a little railway station a poor enough terrestrial star yet in one sense of more importance to Talbothays Dairy and mankind than the celestial ones to which it stood in such humiliating contrast The cans of new milk were unladen in the rain Tess getting a little shelter from a neighbouring holly tree Then there was the hissing of a train which drew up almost silently upon the wet rails and the milk was rapidly swung can by can into the truck The light of the engine flashed for a second upon Tess Durbeyfield s figure motionless under the great holly tree No object could have looked more foreign to the gleaming cranks and wheels than this unsophisticated girl with the round bare arms the rainy face and hair the suspended attitude of a friendly leopard at pause the print gown of no date or fashion and the cotton bonnet drooping on her brow She mounted again beside her lover with a mute obedience characteristic of impassioned natures at times and when they had wrapped themselves up over head and ears in the sailcloth again they plunged back into the now thick night Tess was so receptive that the few minutes of contact with the whirl of material progress lingered in her thought Londoners will drink it at their breakfasts to morrow won t they she asked Strange people that we have never seen Yes I suppose they will Though not as we send it When its strength has been lowered so that it may not get up into their heads Noble men and noble women ambassadors and centurions ladies and tradeswomen and babies who have never seen a cow Well yes perhaps particularly centurions Who don t know anything of us and where it comes from or think how we two drove miles across the moor to night in the rain that it might reach em in time We did not drive entirely on account of these precious Londoners we drove a little on our own on account of that anxious matter which you will I am sure set at rest dear Tess Now permit me to put it in this way You belong to me already you know your heart I mean Does it not You know as well as I O yes yes Then if your heart does why not your hand My only reason was on account of you on account of a question I have something to tell you But suppose it to be entirely for my happiness and my worldly convenience also O yes if it is for your happiness and worldly convenience But my life before I came here I want Well it is for my convenience as well as my happiness If I have a very large farm either English or colonial you will be invaluable as a wife to me better than a woman out of the largest mansion in the country So please please dear Tessy disabuse your mind of the feeling that you will stand in my way But my history I want you to know it you must let me tell you you will not like me so well Tell it if you wish to dearest This precious history then Yes I was born at so and so Anno Domini I was born at Marlott she said catching at his words as a help lightly as they were spoken And I grew up there And I was in the Sixth Standard when I left school and they said I had great aptness and should make a good teacher so it was settled that I should be one But there was trouble in my family father was not very industrious and he drank a little Yes yes Poor child Nothing new He pressed her more closely to his side And then there is something very unusual about it about me I I was Tess s breath quickened Yes dearest Never mind I I am not a Durbeyfield but a d Urberville a descendant of the same family as those that owned the old house we passed And we are all gone to nothing A d Urberville Indeed And is that all the trouble dear Tess Yes she answered faintly Well why should I love you less after knowing this I was told by the dairyman that you hated old families He laughed Well it is true in one sense I do hate the aristocratic principle of blood before everything and do think that as reasoners the only pedigrees we ought to respect are those spiritual ones of the wise and virtuous without regard to corporal paternity But I am extremely interested in this news you can have no idea how interested I am Are you not interested yourself in being one of that well known line No I have thought it sad especially since coming here and knowing that many of the hills and fields I see once belonged to my father s people But other hills and field belonged to Retty s people and perhaps others to Marian s so that I don t value it particularly Yes it is surprising how many of the present tillers of the soil were once owners of it and I sometimes wonder that a certain school of politicians don t make capital of the circumstance but they don t seem to know it I wonder that I did not see the resemblance of your name to d Urberville and trace the manifest corruption And this was the carking secret She had not told At the last moment her courage had failed her she feared his blame for not telling him sooner and her instinct of self preservation was stronger than her candour Of course continued the unwitting Clare I should have been glad to know you to be descended exclusively from the long suffering dumb unrecorded rank and file of the English nation and not from the self seeking few who made themselves powerful at the expense of the rest But I am corrupted away from that by my affection for you Tess he laughed as he spoke and made selfish likewise For your own sake I rejoice in your descent Society is hopelessly snobbish and this fact of your extraction may make an appreciable difference to its acceptance of you as my wife after I have made you the well read woman that I mean to make you My mother too poor soul will think so much better of you on account of it Tess you must spell your name correctly d Urberville from this very day I like the other way rather best But you MUST dearest Good heavens why dozens of mushroom millionaires would jump at such a possession By the bye there s one of that kidney who has taken the name where have I heard of him Up in the neighbourhood of The Chase I think Why he is the very man who had that rumpus with my father I told you of What an odd coincidence Angel I think I would rather not take the name It is unlucky perhaps She was agitated Now then Mistress Teresa d Urberville I have you Take my name and so you will escape yours The secret is out so why should you any longer refuse me If it is SURE to make you happy to have me as your wife and you feel that you do wish to marry me VERY VERY much I do dearest of course I mean that it is only your wanting me very much and being hardly able to keep alive without me whatever my offences that would make me feel I ought to say I will You will you do say it I know You will be mine for ever and ever He clasped her close and kissed her Yes She had no sooner said it than she burst into a dry hard sobbing so violent that it seemed to rend her Tess was not a hysterical girl by any means and he was surprised Why do you cry dearest I can t tell quite I am so glad to think of being yours and making you happy But this does not seem very much like gladness my Tessy I mean I cry because I have broken down in my vow I said I would die unmarried But if you love me you would like me to be your husband Yes yes yes But O I sometimes wish I had never been born Now my dear Tess if I did not know that you are very much excited and very inexperienced I should say that remark was not very complimentary How came you to wish that if you care for me Do you care for me I wish you would prove it in some way How can I prove it more than I have done she cried in a distraction of tenderness Will this prove it more She clasped his neck and for the first time Clare learnt what an impassioned woman s kisses were like upon the lips of one whom she loved with all her heart and soul as Tess loved him There now do you believe she asked flushed and wiping her eyes Yes I never really doubted never never So they drove on through the gloom forming one bundle inside the sail cloth the horse going as he would and the rain driving against them She had consented She might as well have agreed at first The appetite for joy which pervades all creation that tremendous force which sways humanity to its purpose as the tide sways the helpless weed was not to be controlled by vague lucubrations over the social rubric I must write to my mother she said You don t mind my doing that Of course not dear child You are a child to me Tess not to know how very proper it is to write to your mother at such a time and how wrong it would be in me to object Where does she live At the same place Marlott On the further side of Blackmoor Vale Ah then I HAVE seen you before this summer Yes at that dance on the green but you would not dance with me O I hope that is of no ill omen for us now XXXI Tess wrote a most touching and urgent letter to her mother the very next day and by the end of the week a response to her communication arrived in Joan Durbeyfield s wandering last century hand DEAR TESS J write these few lines Hoping they will find you well as they leave me at Present thank God for it Dear Tess we are all glad to Hear that you are going really to be married soon But with respect to your question Tess J say between ourselves quite private but very strong that on no account do you say a word of your Bygone Trouble to him J did not tell everything to your Father he being so Proud on account of his Respectability which perhaps your Intended is the same Many a woman some of the Highest in the Land have had a Trouble in their time and why should you Trumpet yours when others don t Trumpet theirs No girl would be such a Fool specially as it is so long ago and not your Fault at all J shall answer the same if you ask me fifty times Besides you must bear in mind that knowing it to be your Childish Nature to tell all that s in your heart so simple J made you promise me never to let it out by Word or Deed having your Welfare in my Mind and you most solemnly did promise it going from this Door J have not named either that Question or your coming marriage to your Father as he would blab it everywhere poor Simple Man Dear Tess keep up your Spirits and we mean to send you a Hogshead of Cyder for you Wedding knowing there is not much in your parts and thin Sour Stuff what there is So no more at present and with kind love to your Young Man From your affectte Mother J DURBEYFIELD O mother mother murmured Tess She was recognizing how light was the touch of events the most oppressive upon missus Durbeyfield s elastic spirit Her mother did not see life as Tess saw it That haunting episode of bygone days was to her mother but a passing accident But perhaps her mother was right as to the course to be followed whatever she might be in her reasons Silence seemed on the face of it best for her adored one s happiness silence it should be Thus steadied by a command from the only person in the world who had any shadow of right to control her action Tess grew calmer The responsibility was shifted and her heart was lighter than it had been for weeks The days of declining autumn which followed her assent beginning with the month of October formed a season through which she lived in spiritual altitudes more nearly approaching ecstasy than any other period of her life There was hardly a touch of earth in her love for Clare To her sublime trustfulness he was all that goodness could be knew all that a guide philosopher and friend should know She thought every line in the contour of his person the perfection of masculine beauty his soul the soul of a saint his intellect that of a seer The wisdom of her love for him as love sustained her dignity she seemed to be wearing a crown The compassion of his love for her as she saw it made her lift up her heart to him in devotion He would sometimes catch her large worshipful eyes that had no bottom to them looking at him from their depths as if she saw something immortal before her She dismissed the past trod upon it and put it out as one treads on a coal that is smouldering and dangerous She had not known that men could be so disinterested chivalrous protective in their love for women as he Angel Clare was far from all that she thought him in this respect absurdly far indeed but he was in truth more spiritual than animal he had himself well in hand and was singularly free from grossness Though not cold natured he was rather bright than hot less Byronic than Shelleyan could love desperately but with a love more especially inclined to the imaginative and ethereal it was a fastidious emotion which could jealously guard the loved one against his very self This amazed and enraptured Tess whose slight experiences had been so infelicitous till now and in her reaction from indignation against the male sex she swerved to excess of honour for Clare They unaffectedly sought each other s company in her honest faith she did not disguise her desire to be with him The sum of her instincts on this matter if clearly stated would have been that the elusive quality of her sex which attracts men in general might be distasteful to so perfect a man after an avowal of love since it must in its very nature carry with it a suspicion of art The country custom of unreserved comradeship out of doors during betrothal was the only custom she knew and to her it had no strangeness though it seemed oddly anticipative to Clare till he saw how normal a thing she in common with all the other dairy folk regarded it Thus during this October month of wonderful afternoons they roved along the meads by creeping paths which followed the brinks of trickling tributary brooks hopping across by little wooden bridges to the other side and back again They were never out of the sound of some purling weir whose buzz accompanied their own murmuring while the beams of the sun almost as horizontal as the mead itself formed a pollen of radiance over the landscape They saw tiny blue fogs in the shadows of trees and hedges all the time that there was bright sunshine elsewhere The sun was so near the ground and the sward so flat that the shadows of Clare and Tess would stretch a quarter of a mile ahead of them like two long fingers pointing afar to where the green alluvial reaches abutted against the sloping sides of the vale Men were at work here and there for it was the season for taking up the meadows or digging the little waterways clear for the winter irrigation and mending their banks where trodden down by the cows The shovelfuls of loam black as jet brought there by the river when it was as wide as the whole valley were an essence of soils pounded champaigns of the past steeped refined and subtilized to extraordinary richness out of which came all the fertility of the mead and of the cattle grazing there Clare hardily kept his arm round her waist in sight of these watermen with the air of a man who was accustomed to public dalliance though actually as shy as she who with lips parted and eyes askance on the labourers wore the look of a wary animal the while You are not ashamed of owning me as yours before them she said gladly O no But if it should reach the ears of your friends at Emminster that you are walking about like this with me a milkmaid The most bewitching milkmaid ever seen They might feel it a hurt to their dignity My dear girl a d Urberville hurt the dignity of a Clare It is a grand card to play that of your belonging to such a family and I am reserving it for a grand effect when we are married and have the proofs of your descent from Parson Tringham Apart from that my future is to be totally foreign to my family it will not affect even the surface of their lives We shall leave this part of England perhaps England itself and what does it matter how people regard us here You will like going will you not She could answer no more than a bare affirmative so great was the emotion aroused in her at the thought of going through the world with him as his own familiar friend Her feelings almost filled her ears like a babble of waves and surged up to her eyes She put her hand in his and thus they went on to a place where the reflected sun glared up from the river under a bridge with a molten metallic glow that dazzled their eyes though the sun itself was hidden by the bridge They stood still whereupon little furred and feathered heads popped up from the smooth surface of the water but finding that the disturbing presences had paused and not passed by they disappeared again Upon this river brink they lingered till the fog began to close round them which was very early in the evening at this time of the year settling on the lashes of her eyes where it rested like crystals and on his brows and hair They walked later on Sundays when it was quite dark Some of the dairy people who were also out of doors on the first Sunday evening after their engagement heard her impulsive speeches ecstasized to fragments though they were too far off to hear the words discoursed noted the spasmodic catch in her remarks broken into syllables by the leapings of her heart as she walked leaning on his arm her contented pauses the occasional little laugh upon which her soul seemed to ride the laugh of a woman in company with the man she loves and has won from all other women unlike anything else in nature They marked the buoyancy of her tread like the skim of a bird which has not quite alighted Her affection for him was now the breath and life of Tess s being it enveloped her as a photosphere irradiated her into forgetfulness of her past sorrows keeping back the gloomy spectres that would persist in their attempts to touch her doubt fear moodiness care shame She knew that they were waiting like wolves just outside the circumscribing light but she had long spells of power to keep them in hungry subjection there A spiritual forgetfulness company existed with an intellectual remembrance She walked in brightness but she knew that in the background those shapes of darkness were always spread They might be receding or they might be approaching one or the other a little every day One evening Tess and Clare were obliged to sit indoors keeping house all the other occupants of the domicile being away As they talked she looked thoughtfully up at him and met his two appreciative eyes I am not worthy of you no I am not she burst out jumping up from her low stool as though appalled at his homage and the fulness of her own joy thereat Clare deeming the whole basis of her excitement to be that which was only the smaller part of it said I won t have you speak like it dear Tess Distinction does not consist in the facile use of a contemptible set of conventions but in being numbered among those who are true and honest and just and pure and lovely and of good report as you are my Tess She struggled with the sob in her throat How often had that string of excellences made her young heart ache in church of late years and how strange that he should have cited them now Why didn t you stay and love me when I was sixteen living with my little sisters and brothers and you danced on the green O why didn t you why didn t you she said impetuously clasping her hands Angel began to comfort and reassure her thinking to himself truly enough what a creature of moods she was and how careful he would have to be of her when she depended for her happiness entirely on him Ah why didn t I stay he said That is just what I feel If I had only known But you must not be so bitter in your regret why should you be With the woman s instinct to hide she diverged hastily I should have had four years more of your heart than I can ever have now Then I should not have wasted my time as I have done I should have had so much longer happiness It was no mature woman with a long dark vista of intrigue behind her who was tormented thus but a girl of simple life not yet one and twenty who had been caught during her days of immaturity like a bird in a springe To calm herself the more completely she rose from her little stool and left the room overturning the stool with her skirts as she went He sat on by the cheerful firelight thrown from a bundle of green ash sticks laid across the dogs the sticks snapped pleasantly and hissed out bubbles of sap from their ends When she came back she was herself again Do you not think you are just a wee bit capricious fitful Tess he said good humouredly as he spread a cushion for her on the stool and seated himself in the settle beside her I wanted to ask you something and just then you ran away Yes perhaps I am capricious she murmured She suddenly approached him and put a hand upon each of his arms No Angel I am not really so by nature I mean The more particularly to assure him that she was not she placed herself close to him in the settle and allowed her head to find a resting place against Clare s shoulder What did you want to ask me I am sure I will answer it she continued humbly Well you love me and have agreed to marry me and hence there follows a thirdly When shall the day be I like living like this But I must think of starting in business on my own hook with the new year or a little later And before I get involved in the multifarious details of my new position I should like to have secured my partner But she timidly answered to talk quite practically wouldn t it be best not to marry till after all that Though I can t bear the thought o your going away and leaving me here Of course you cannot and it is not best in this case I want you to help me in many ways in making my start When shall it be Why not a fortnight from now No she said becoming grave I have so many things to think of first But He drew her gently nearer to him The reality of marriage was startling when it loomed so near Before discussion of the question had proceeded further there walked round the corner of the settle into the full firelight of the apartment mister Dairyman Crick missus Crick and two of the milkmaids Tess sprang like an elastic ball from his side to her feet while her face flushed and her eyes shone in the firelight I knew how it would be if I sat so close to him she cried with vexation I said to myself they are sure to come and catch us But I wasn t really sitting on his knee though it might ha seemed as if I was almost Well if so be you hadn t told us I am sure we shouldn t ha noticed that ye had been sitting anywhere at all in this light replied the dairyman He continued to his wife with the stolid mien of a man who understood nothing of the emotions relating to matrimony Now Christianer that shows that folks should never fancy other folks be supposing things when they bain t O no I should never ha thought a word of where she was a sitting to if she hadn t told me not I We are going to be married soon said Clare with improvised phlegm Ah and be ye Well I am truly glad to hear it sir I ve thought you mid do such a thing for some time She s too good for a dairymaid I said so the very first day I zid her and a prize for any man and what s more a wonderful woman for a gentleman farmer s wife he won t be at the mercy of his baily wi her at his side Somehow Tess disappeared She had been even more struck with the look of the girls who followed Crick than abashed by Crick s blunt praise After supper when she reached her bedroom they were all present A light was burning and each damsel was sitting up whitely in her bed awaiting Tess the whole like a row of avenging ghosts But she saw in a few moments that there was no malice in their mood They could scarcely feel as a loss what they had never expected to have Their condition was objective contemplative He s going to marry her murmured Retty never taking eyes off Tess How her face do show it You BE going to marry him asked Marian Yes said Tess When Some day They thought that this was evasiveness only YES going to MARRY him a gentleman repeated Izz Huett And by a sort of fascination the three girls one after another crept out of their beds and came and stood barefooted round Tess Retty put her hands upon Tess s shoulders as if to realize her friend s corporeality after such a miracle and the other two laid their arms round her waist all looking into her face How it do seem Almost more than I can think of said Izz Huett Marian kissed Tess Yes she murmured as she withdrew her lips Was that because of love for her or because other lips have touched there by now continued Izz drily to Marian I wasn t thinking o that said Marian simply I was on y feeling all the strangeness o t that she is to be his wife and nobody else I don t say nay to it nor either of us because we did not think of it only loved him Still nobody else is to marry n in the world no fine lady nobody in silks and satins but she who do live like we Are you sure you don t dislike me for it said Tess in a low voice They hung about her in their white nightgowns before replying as if they considered their answer might lie in her look I don t know I don t know murmured Retty Priddle I want to hate ee but I cannot That s how I feel echoed Izz and Marian I can t hate her Somehow she hinders me He ought to marry one of you murmured Tess Why You are all better than I We better than you said the girls in a low slow whisper No no dear Tess You are she contradicted impetuously And suddenly tearing away from their clinging arms she burst into a hysterical fit of tears bowing herself on the chest of drawers and repeating incessantly O yes yes yes Having once given way she could not stop her weeping He ought to have had one of you she cried I think I ought to make him even now You would be better for him than I don t know what I m saying O O They went up to her and clasped her round but still her sobs tore her Get some water said Marian She s upset by us poor thing poor thing They gently led her back to the side of her bed where they kissed her warmly You are best for n said Marian More ladylike and a better scholar than we especially since he had taught ee so much But even you ought to be proud You BE proud I m sure Yes I am she said and I am ashamed at so breaking down When they were all in bed and the light was out Marian whispered across to her You will think of us when you be his wife Tess and of how we told ee that we loved him and how we tried not to hate you and did not hate you and could not hate you because you were his choice and we never hoped to be chose by him They were not aware that at these words salt stinging tears trickled down upon Tess s pillow anew and how she resolved with a bursting heart to tell all her history to Angel Clare despite her mother s command to let him for whom she lived and breathed despise her if he would and her mother regard her as a fool rather then preserve a silence which might be deemed a treachery to him and which somehow seemed a wrong to these XXXII This penitential mood kept her from naming the wedding day The beginning of November found its date still in abeyance though he asked her at the most tempting times But Tess s desire seemed to be for a perpetual betrothal in which everything should remain as it was then The meads were changing now but it was still warm enough in early afternoons before milking to idle there awhile and the state of dairy work at this time of year allowed a spare hour for idling Looking over the damp sod in the direction of the sun a glistening ripple of gossamer webs was visible to their eyes under the luminary like the track of moonlight on the sea Gnats knowing nothing of their brief glorification wandered across the shimmer of this pathway irradiated as if they bore fire within them then passed out of its line and were quite extinct In the presence of these things he would remind her that the date was still the question Or he would ask her at night when he accompanied her on some mission invented by missus Crick to give him the opportunity This was mostly a journey to the farmhouse on the slopes above the vale to inquire how the advanced cows were getting on in the straw barton to which they were relegated For it was a time of the year that brought great changes to the world of kine Batches of the animals were sent away daily to this lying in hospital where they lived on straw till their calves were born after which event and as soon as the calf could walk mother and offspring were driven back to the dairy In the interval which elapsed before the calves were sold there was of course little milking to be done but as soon as the calf had been taken away the milkmaids would have to set to work as usual Returning from one of these dark walks they reached a great gravel cliff immediately over the levels where they stood still and listened The water was now high in the streams squirting through the weirs and tinkling under culverts the smallest gullies were all full there was no taking short cuts anywhere and foot passengers were compelled to follow the permanent ways From the whole extent of the invisible vale came a multitudinous intonation it forced upon their fancy that a great city lay below them and that the murmur was the vociferation of its populace It seems like tens of thousands of them said Tess holding public meetings in their market places arguing preaching quarrelling sobbing groaning praying and cursing Clare was not particularly heeding Did Crick speak to you to day dear about his not wanting much assistance during the winter months No The cows are going dry rapidly Yes Six or seven went to the straw barton yesterday and three the day before making nearly twenty in the straw already Ah is it that the farmer don t want my help for the calving O I am not wanted here any more And I have tried so hard to Crick didn t exactly say that he would no longer require you But knowing what our relations were he said in the most good natured and respectful manner possible that he supposed on my leaving at Christmas I should take you with me and on my asking what he would do without you he merely observed that as a matter of fact it was a time of year when he could do with a very little female help I am afraid I was sinner enough to feel rather glad that he was in this way forcing your hand I don t think you ought to have felt glad Angel Because tis always mournful not to be wanted even if at the same time tis convenient Well it is convenient you have admitted that He put his finger upon her cheek Ah he said What I feel the red rising up at her having been caught But why should I trifle so We will not trifle life is too serious It is Perhaps I saw that before you did She was seeing it then To decline to marry him after all in obedience to her emotion of last night and leave the dairy meant to go to some strange place not a dairy for milkmaids were not in request now calving time was coming on to go to some arable farm where no divine being like Angel Clare was She hated the thought and she hated more the thought of going home So that seriously dearest Tess he continued since you will probably have to leave at Christmas it is in every way desirable and convenient that I should carry you off then as my property Besides if you were not the most uncalculating girl in the world you would know that we could not go on like this for ever I wish we could That it would always be summer and autumn and you always courting me and always thinking as much of me as you have done through the past summer time I always shall O I know you will she cried with a sudden fervour of faith in him Angel I will fix the day when I will become yours for always Thus at last it was arranged between them during that dark walk home amid the myriads of liquid voices on the right and left When they reached the dairy mister and missus Crick were promptly told with injunctions of secrecy for each of the lovers was desirous that the marriage should be kept as private as possible The dairyman though he had thought of dismissing her soon now made a great concern about losing her What should he do about his skimming Who would make the ornamental butter pats for the Anglebury and Sandbourne ladies missus Crick congratulated Tess on the shilly shallying having at last come to an end and said that directly she set eyes on Tess she divined that she was to be the chosen one of somebody who was no common outdoor man Tess had looked so superior as she walked across the barton on that afternoon of her arrival that she was of a good family she could have sworn In point of fact missus Crick did remember thinking that Tess was graceful and good looking as she approached but the superiority might have been a growth of the imagination aided by subsequent knowledge Tess was now carried along upon the wings of the hours without the sense of a will The word had been given the number of the day written down Her naturally bright intelligence had begun to admit the fatalistic convictions common to field folk and those who associate more extensively with natural phenomena than with their fellow creatures and she accordingly drifted into that passive responsiveness to all things her lover suggested characteristic of the frame of mind But she wrote anew to her mother ostensibly to notify the wedding day really to again implore her advice It was a gentleman who had chosen her which perhaps her mother had not sufficiently considered A post nuptial explanation which might be accepted with a light heart by a rougher man might not be received with the same feeling by him But this communication brought no reply from missus Durbeyfield Despite Angel Clare s plausible representation to himself and to Tess of the practical need for their immediate marriage there was in truth an element of precipitancy in the step as became apparent at a later date He loved her dearly though perhaps rather ideally and fancifully than with the impassioned thoroughness of her feeling for him He had entertained no notion when doomed as he had thought to an unintellectual bucolic life that such charms as he beheld in this idyllic creature would be found behind the scenes Unsophistication was a thing to talk of but he had not known how it really struck one until he came here Yet he was very far from seeing his future track clearly and it might be a year or two before he would be able to consider himself fairly started in life The secret lay in the tinge of recklessness imparted to his career and character by the sense that he had been made to miss his true destiny through the prejudices of his family Don t you think twould have been better for us to wait till you were quite settled in your midland farm she once asked timidly A midland farm was the idea just then To tell the truth my Tess I don t like you to be left anywhere away from my protection and sympathy The reason was a good one so far as it went His influence over her had been so marked that she had caught his manner and habits his speech and phrases his likings and his aversions And to leave her in farmland would be to let her slip back again out of accord with him He wished to have her under his charge for another reason His parents had naturally desired to see her once at least before he carried her off to a distant settlement English or colonial and as no opinion of theirs was to be allowed to change his intention he judged that a couple of months life with him in lodgings whilst seeking for an advantageous opening would be of some social assistance to her at what she might feel to be a trying ordeal her presentation to his mother at the Vicarage Next he wished to see a little of the working of a flour mill having an idea that he might combine the use of one with corn growing The proprietor of a large old water mill at Wellbridge once the mill of an Abbey had offered him the inspection of his time honoured mode of procedure and a hand in the operations for a few days whenever he should choose to come Clare paid a visit to the place some few miles distant one day at this time to inquire particulars and returned to Talbothays in the evening She found him determined to spend a short time at the Wellbridge flour mills And what had determined him Less the opportunity of an insight into grinding and bolting than the casual fact that lodgings were to be obtained in that very farmhouse which before its mutilation had been the mansion of a branch of the d Urberville family This was always how Clare settled practical questions by a sentiment which had nothing to do with them They decided to go immediately after the wedding and remain for a fortnight instead of journeying to towns and inns Then we will start off to examine some farms on the other side of London that I have heard of he said and by March or April we will pay a visit to my father and mother Questions of procedure such as these arose and passed and the day the incredible day on which she was to become his loomed large in the near future The thirty first of December New Year s Eve was the date His wife she said to herself Could it ever be Their two selves together nothing to divide them every incident shared by them why not And yet why One Sunday morning Izz Huett returned from church and spoke privately to Tess You was not called home this morning What It should ha been the first time of asking to day she answered looking quietly at Tess You meant to be married New Year s Eve deary The other returned a quick affirmative And there must be three times of asking And now there be only two Sundays left between Tess felt her cheek paling Izz was right of course there must be three Perhaps he had forgotten If so there must be a week s postponement and that was unlucky How could she remind her lover She who had been so backward was suddenly fired with impatience and alarm lest she should lose her dear prize A natural incident relieved her anxiety Izz mentioned the omission of the banns to missus Crick and missus Crick assumed a matron s privilege of speaking to Angel on the point Have ye forgot em mister Clare The banns I mean No I have not forgot em says Clare As soon as he caught Tess alone he assured her Don t let them tease you about the banns A licence will be quieter for us and I have decided on a licence without consulting you So if you go to church on Sunday morning you will not hear your own name if you wished to I didn t wish to hear it dearest she said proudly But to know that things were in train was an immense relief to Tess notwithstanding who had well nigh feared that somebody would stand up and forbid the banns on the ground of her history How events were favouring her I don t quite feel easy she said to herself All this good fortune may be scourged out of me afterwards by a lot of ill That s how Heaven mostly does I wish I could have had common banns But everything went smoothly She wondered whether he would like her to be married in her present best white frock or if she ought to buy a new one The question was set at rest by his forethought disclosed by the arrival of some large packages addressed to her Inside them she found a whole stock of clothing from bonnet to shoes including a perfect morning costume such as would well suit the simple wedding they planned He entered the house shortly after the arrival of the packages and heard her upstairs undoing them A minute later she came down with a flush on her face and tears in her eyes How thoughtful you ve been she murmured her cheek upon his shoulder Even to the gloves and handkerchief My own love how good how kind No no Tess just an order to a tradeswoman in London nothing more And to divert her from thinking too highly of him he told her to go upstairs and take her time and see if it all fitted and if not to get the village sempstress to make a few alterations She did return upstairs and put on the gown Alone she stood for a moment before the glass looking at the effect of her silk attire and then there came into her head her mother s ballad of the mystic robe That never would become that wife That had once done amiss which missus Durbeyfield had used to sing to her as a child so blithely and so archly her foot on the cradle which she rocked to the tune Suppose this robe should betray her by changing colour as her robe had betrayed Queen Guinevere Since she had been at the dairy she had not once thought of the lines till now XXXIII Angel felt that he would like to spend a day with her before the wedding somewhere away from the dairy as a last jaunt in her company while there were yet mere lover and mistress a romantic day in circumstances that would never be repeated with that other and greater day beaming close ahead of them During the preceding week therefore he suggested making a few purchases in the nearest town and they started together Clare s life at the dairy had been that of a recluse in respect the world of his own class For months he had never gone near a town and requiring no vehicle had never kept one hiring the dairyman s cob or gig if he rode or drove They went in the gig that day And then for the first time in their lives they shopped as partners in one concern It was Christmas Eve with its loads a holly and mistletoe and the town was very full of strangers who had come in from all parts of the country on account of the day Tess paid the penalty of walking about with happiness superadded to beauty on her countenance by being much stared at as she moved amid them on his arm In the evening they returned to the inn at which they had put up and Tess waited in the entry while Angel went to see the horse and gig brought to the door The general sitting room was full of guests who were continually going in and out As the door opened and shut each time for the passage of these the light within the parlour fell full upon Tess s face Two men came out and passed by her among the rest One of them had stared her up and down in surprise and she fancied he was a Trantridge man though that village lay so many miles off that Trantridge folk were rarities here A comely maid that said the other True comely enough But unless I make a great mistake And he negatived the remainder of the definition forthwith Clare had just returned from the stable yard and confronting the man on the threshold heard the words and saw the shrinking of Tess The insult to her stung him to the quick and before he had considered anything at all he struck the man on the chin with the full force of his fist sending him staggering backwards into the passage The man recovered himself and seemed inclined to come on and Clare stepping outside the door put himself in a posture of defence But his opponent began to think better of the matter He looked anew at Tess as he passed her and said to Clare I beg pardon sir twas a complete mistake I thought she was another woman forty miles from here Clare feeling then that he had been too hasty and that he was moreover to blame for leaving her standing in an inn passage did what he usually did in such cases gave the man five shillings to plaster the blow and thus they parted bidding each other a pacific good night As soon as Clare had taken the reins from the ostler and the young couple had driven off the two men went in the other direction And was it a mistake said the second one Not a bit of it But I didn t want to hurt the gentleman s feelings not I In the meantime the lovers were driving onward Could we put off our wedding till a little later Tess asked in a dry dull voice I mean if we wished No my love Calm yourself Do you mean that the fellow may have time to summon me for assault he asked good humouredly No I only meant if it should have to be put off What she meant was not very clear and he directed her to dismiss such fancies from her mind which she obediently did as well as she could But she was grave very grave all the way home till she thought We shall go away a very long distance hundreds of miles from these parts and such as this can never happen again and no ghost of the past reach there They parted tenderly that night on the landing and Clare ascended to his attic Tess sat up getting on with some little requisites lest the few remaining days should not afford sufficient time While she sat she heard a noise in Angel s room overhead a sound of thumping and struggling Everybody else in the house was asleep and in her anxiety lest Clare should be ill she ran up and knocked at his door and asked him what was the matter Oh nothing dear he said from within I am so sorry I disturbed you But the reason is rather an amusing one I fell asleep and dreamt that I was fighting that fellow again who insulted you and the noise you heard was my pummelling away with my fists at my portmanteau which I pulled out to day for packing I am occasionally liable to these freaks in my sleep Go to bed and think of it no more This was the last drachm required to turn the scale of her indecision Declare the past to him by word of mouth she could not but there was another way She sat down and wrote on the four pages of a note sheet a succinct narrative of those events of three or four years ago put it into an envelope and directed it to Clare Then lest the flesh should again be weak she crept upstairs without any shoes and slipped the note under his door Her night was a broken one as it well might be and she listened for the first faint noise overhead It came as usual he descended as usual She descended He met her at the bottom of the stairs and kissed her Surely it was as warmly as ever He looked a little disturbed and worn she thought But he said not a word to her about her revelation even when they were alone Could he have had it Unless he began the subject she felt that she could say nothing So the day passed and it was evident that whatever he thought he meant to keep to himself Yet he was frank and affectionate as before Could it be that her doubts were childish that he forgave her that he loved her for what she was just as she was and smiled at her disquiet as at a foolish nightmare Had he really received her note She glanced into his room and could see nothing of it It might be that he forgave her But even if he had not received it she had a sudden enthusiastic trust that he surely would forgive her Every morning and night he was the same and thus New Year s Eve broke the wedding day The lovers did not rise at milking time having through the whole of this last week of their sojourn at the dairy been accorded something of the position of guests Tess being honoured with a room of her own When they arrived downstairs at breakfast time they were surprised to see what effects had been produced in the large kitchen for their glory since they had last beheld it At some unnatural hour of the morning the dairyman had caused the yawning chimney corner to be whitened and the brick hearth reddened and a blazing yellow damask blower to be hung across the arch in place of the old grimy blue cotton one with a black sprig pattern which had formerly done duty there This renovated aspect of what was the focus indeed of the room on a full winter morning threw a smiling demeanour over the whole apartment I was determined to do summat in honour o t said the dairyman And as you wouldn t hear of my gieing a rattling good randy wi fiddles and bass viols complete as we should ha done in old times this was all I could think o as a noiseless thing Tess s friends lived so far off that none could conveniently have been present at the ceremony even had any been asked but as a fact nobody was invited from Marlott As for Angel s family he had written and duly informed them of the time and assured them that he would be glad to see one at least of them there for the day if he would like to come His brothers had not replied at all seeming to be indignant with him while his father and mother had written a rather sad letter deploring his precipitancy in rushing into marriage but making the best of the matter by saying that though a dairywoman was the last daughter in law they could have expected their son had arrived at an age which he might be supposed to be the best judge This coolness in his relations distressed Clare less than it would have done had he been without the grand card with which he meant to surprise them ere long To produce Tess fresh from the dairy as a d Urberville and a lady he had felt to be temerarious and risky hence he had concealed her lineage till such time as familiarized with worldly ways by a few months travel and reading with him he could take her on a visit to his parents and impart the knowledge while triumphantly producing her as worthy of such an ancient line It was a pretty lover s dream if no more Perhaps Tess s lineage had more value for himself than for anybody in the world beside Her perception that Angel s bearing towards her still remained in no whit altered by her own communication rendered Tess guiltily doubtful if he could have received it She rose from breakfast before he had finished and hastened upstairs It had occurred to her to look once more into the queer gaunt room which had been Clare s den or rather eyrie for so long and climbing the ladder she stood at the open door of the apartment regarding and pondering She stooped to the threshold of the doorway where she had pushed in the note two or three days earlier in such excitement The carpet reached close to the sill and under the edge of the carpet she discerned the faint white margin of the envelope containing her letter to him which he obviously had never seen owing to her having in her haste thrust it beneath the carpet as well as beneath the door With a feeling of faintness she withdrew the letter There it was sealed up just as it had left her hands The mountain had not yet been removed She could not let him read it now the house being in full bustle of preparation and descending to her own room she destroyed the letter there She was so pale when he saw her again that he felt quite anxious The incident of the misplaced letter she had jumped at as if it prevented a confession but she knew in her conscience that it need not there was still time Yet everything was in a stir there was coming and going all had to dress the dairyman and missus Crick having been asked to accompany them as witnesses and reflection or deliberate talk was well nigh impossible The only minute Tess could get to be alone with Clare was when they met upon the landing I am so anxious to talk to you I want to confess all my faults and blunders she said with attempted lightness No no we can t have faults talked of you must be deemed perfect to day at least my Sweet he cried We shall have plenty of time hereafter I hope to talk over our failings I will confess mine at the same time But it would be better for me to do it now I think so that you could not say Well my quixotic one you shall tell me anything say as soon as we are settled in our lodging not now I too will tell you my faults then But do not let us spoil the day with them they will be excellent matter for a dull time Then you don t wish me to dearest I do not Tessy really The hurry of dressing and starting left no time for more than this Those words of his seemed to reassure her on further reflection She was whirled onward through the next couple of critical hours by the mastering tide of her devotion to him which closed up further meditation Her one desire so long resisted to make herself his to call him her lord her own then if necessary to die had at last lifted her up from her plodding reflective pathway In dressing she moved about in a mental cloud of many coloured idealities which eclipsed all sinister contingencies by its brightness The church was a long way off and they were obliged to drive particularly as it was winter A closed carriage was ordered from a roadside inn a vehicle which had been kept there ever since the old days of post chaise travelling It had stout wheel spokes and heavy felloes a great curved bed immense straps and springs and a pole like a battering ram The postilion was a venerable boy of sixty a martyr to rheumatic gout the result of excessive exposure in youth counter acted by strong liquors who had stood at inn doors doing nothing for the whole five and twenty years that had elapsed since he had no longer been required to ride professionally as if expecting the old times to come back again He had a permanent running wound on the outside of his right leg originated by the constant bruisings of aristocratic carriage poles during the many years that he had been in regular employ at the King s Arms Casterbridge Inside this cumbrous and creaking structure and behind this decayed conductor the partie carree took their seats the bride and bridegroom and mister and missus Crick Angel would have liked one at least of his brothers to be present as groomsman but their silence after his gentle hint to that effect by letter had signified that they did not care to come They disapproved of the marriage and could not be expected to countenance it Perhaps it was as well that they could not be present They were not worldly young fellows but fraternizing with dairy folk would have struck unpleasantly upon their biased niceness apart from their views of the match Upheld by the momentum of the time Tess knew nothing of this did not see anything did not know the road they were taking to the church She knew that Angel was close to her all the rest was a luminous mist She was a sort of celestial person who owed her being to poetry one of those classical divinities Clare was accustomed to talk to her about when they took their walks together The marriage being by licence there were only a dozen or so of people in the church had there been a thousand they would have produced no more effect upon her They were at stellar distances from her present world In the ecstatic solemnity with which she swore her faith to him the ordinary sensibilities of sex seemed a flippancy At a pause in the service while they were kneeling together she unconsciously inclined herself towards him so that her shoulder touched his arm she had been frightened by a passing thought and the movement had been automatic to assure herself that he was really there and to fortify her belief that his fidelity would be proof against all things Clare knew that she loved him every curve of her form showed that but he did not know at that time the full depth of her devotion its single mindedness its meekness what long suffering it guaranteed what honesty what endurance what good faith As they came out of church the ringers swung the bells off their rests and a modest peal of three notes broke forth that limited amount of expression having been deemed sufficient by the church builders for the joys of such a small parish Passing by the tower with her husband on the path to the gate she could feel the vibrant air humming round them from the louvred belfry in the circle of sound and it matched the highly charged mental atmosphere in which she was living This condition of mind wherein she felt glorified by an irradiation not her own like the angel whom saint John saw in the sun lasted till the sound of the church bells had died away and the emotions of the wedding service had calmed down Her eyes could dwell upon details more clearly now and mister and missus Crick having directed their own gig to be sent for them to leave the carriage to the young couple she observed the build and character of that conveyance for the first time Sitting in silence she regarded it long I fancy you seem oppressed Tessy said Clare Yes she answered putting her hand to her brow I tremble at many things It is all so serious Angel Among other things I seem to have seen this carriage before to be very well acquainted with it It is very odd I must have seen it in a dream Oh you have heard the legend of the d Urberville Coach that well known superstition of this county about your family when they were very popular here and this lumbering old thing reminds you of it I have never heard of it to my knowledge said she What is the legend may I know it Well I would rather not tell it in detail just now A certain d Urberville of the sixteenth or seventeenth century committed a dreadful crime in his family coach and since that time members of the family see or hear the old coach whenever But I ll tell you another day it is rather gloomy Evidently some dim knowledge of it has been brought back to your mind by the sight of this venerable caravan I don t remember hearing it before she murmured Is it when we are going to die Angel that members of my family see it or is it when we have committed a crime Now Tess He silenced her by a kiss By the time they reached home she was contrite and spiritless She was missus Angel Clare indeed but had she any moral right to the name Was she not more truly missus Alexander d Urberville Could intensity of love justify what might be considered in upright souls as culpable reticence She knew not what was expected of women in such cases and she had no counsellor However when she found herself alone in her room for a few minutes the last day this on which she was ever to enter it she knelt down and prayed She tried to pray to God but it was her husband who really had her supplication Her idolatry of this man was such that she herself almost feared it to be ill omened She was conscious of the notion expressed by Friar Laurence These violent delights have violent ends It might be too desperate for human conditions too rank to wild too deadly O my love why do I love you so she whispered there alone for she you love is not my real self but one in my image the one I might have been Afternoon came and with it the hour for departure They had decided to fulfil the plan of going for a few days to the lodgings in the old farmhouse near Wellbridge Mill at which he meant to reside during his investigation of flour processes At two o clock there was nothing left to do but to start All the servantry of the dairy were standing in the red brick entry to see them go out the dairyman and his wife following to the door Tess saw her three chamber mates in a row against the wall pensively inclining their heads She had much questioned if they would appear at the parting moment but there they were stoical and staunch to the last She knew why the delicate Retty looked so fragile and Izz so tragically sorrowful and Marian so blank and she forgot her own dogging shadow for a moment in contemplating theirs She impulsively whispered to him Will you kiss em all once poor things for the first and last time Clare had not the least objection to such a farewell formality which was all that it was to him and as he passed them he kissed them in succession where they stood saying Goodbye to each as he did so When they reached the door Tess femininely glanced back to discern the effect of that kiss of charity there was no triumph in her glance as there might have been If there had it would have disappeared when she saw how moved the girls all were The kiss had obviously done harm by awakening feelings they were trying to subdue Of all this Clare was unconscious Passing on to the wicket gate he shook hands with the dairyman and his wife and expressed his last thanks to them for their attentions after which there was a moment of silence before they had moved off It was interrupted by the crowing of a cock The white one with the rose comb had come and settled on the palings in front of the house within a few yards of them and his notes thrilled their ears through dwindling away like echoes down a valley of rocks Oh said missus Crick An afternoon crow Two men were standing by the yard gate holding it open That s bad one murmured to the other not thinking that the words could be heard by the group at the door wicket The cock crew again straight towards Clare Well said the dairyman I don t like to hear him said Tess to her husband Tell the man to drive on Goodbye goodbye The cock crew again Hoosh Just you be off sir or I ll twist your neck said the dairyman with some irritation turning to the bird and driving him away And to his wife as they went indoors Now to think o that just to day I ve not heard his crow of an afternoon all the year afore It only means a change in the weather said she not what you think tis impossible XXXIV They drove by the level road along the valley to a distance of a few miles and reaching Wellbridge turned away from the village to the left and over the great Elizabethan bridge which gives the place half its name Immediately behind it stood the house wherein they had engaged lodgings whose exterior features are so well known to all travellers through the Froom Valley once portion of a fine manorial residence and the property and seat of a d Urberville but since its partial demolition a farmhouse Welcome to one of your ancestral mansions said Clare as he handed her down But he regretted the pleasantry it was too near a satire On entering they found that though they had only engaged a couple of rooms the farmer had taken advantage of their proposed presence during the coming days to pay a New Year s visit to some friends leaving a woman from a neighbouring cottage to minister to their few wants The absoluteness of possession pleased them and they realized it as the first moment of their experience under their own exclusive roof tree But he found that the mouldy old habitation somewhat depressed his bride When the carriage was gone they ascended the stairs to wash their hands the charwoman showing the way On the landing Tess stopped and started What s the matter said he Those horrid women she answered with a smile How they frightened me He looked up and perceived two life size portraits on panels built into the masonry As all visitors to the mansion are aware these paintings represent women of middle age of a date some two hundred years ago whose lineaments once seen can never be forgotten The long pointed features narrow eye and smirk of the one so suggestive of merciless treachery the bill hook nose large teeth and bold eye of the other suggesting arrogance to the point of ferocity haunt the beholder afterwards in his dreams Whose portraits are those asked Clare of the charwoman I have been told by old folk that they were ladies of the d Urberville family the ancient lords of this manor she said Owing to their being builded into the wall they can t be moved away The unpleasantness of the matter was that in addition to their effect upon Tess her fine features were unquestionably traceable in these exaggerated forms He said nothing of this however and regretting that he had gone out of his way to choose the house for their bridal time went on into the adjoining room The place having been rather hastily prepared for them they washed their hands in one basin Clare touched hers under the water Which are my fingers and which are yours he said looking up They are very much mixed They are all yours said she very prettily and endeavoured to be gayer than she was He had not been displeased with her thoughtfulness on such an occasion it was what every sensible woman would show but Tess knew that she had been thoughtful to excess and struggled against it The sun was so low on that short last afternoon of the year that it shone in through a small opening and formed a golden staff which stretched across to her skirt where it made a spot like a paint mark set upon her They went into the ancient parlour to tea and here they shared their first common meal alone Such was their childishness or rather his that he found it interesting to use the same bread and butter plate as herself and to brush crumbs from her lips with his own He wondered a little that she did not enter into these frivolities with his own zest Looking at her silently for a long time She is a dear dear Tess he thought to himself as one deciding on the true construction of a difficult passage Do I realize solemnly enough how utterly and irretrievably this little womanly thing is the creature of my good or bad faith and fortune I think not I think I could not unless I were a woman myself What I am in worldly estate she is What I become she must become What I cannot be she cannot be And shall I ever neglect her or hurt her or even forget to consider her God forbid such a crime They sat on over the tea table waiting for their luggage which the dairyman had promised to send before it grew dark But evening began to close in and the luggage did not arrive and they had brought nothing more than they stood in With the departure of the sun the calm mood of the winter day changed Out of doors there began noises as of silk smartly rubbed the restful dead leaves of the preceding autumn were stirred to irritated resurrection and whirled about unwillingly and tapped against the shutters It soon began to rain That cock knew the weather was going to change said Clare The woman who had attended upon them had gone home for the night but she had placed candles upon the table and now they lit them Each candle flame drew towards the fireplace These old houses are so draughty continued Angel looking at the flames and at the grease guttering down the sides I wonder where that luggage is We haven t even a brush and comb I don t know she answered absent minded Tess you are not a bit cheerful this evening not at all as you used to be Those harridans on the panels upstairs have unsettled you I am sorry I brought you here I wonder if you really love me after all He knew that she did and the words had no serious intent but she was surcharged with emotion and winced like a wounded animal Though she tried not to shed tears she could not help showing one or two I did not mean it said he sorry You are worried at not having your things I know I cannot think why old Jonathan has not come with them Why it is seven o clock Ah there he is A knock had come to the door and there being nobody else to answer it Clare went out He returned to the room with a small package in his hand It is not Jonathan after all he said How vexing said Tess The packet had been brought by a special messenger who had arrived at Talbothays from Emminster Vicarage immediately after the departure of the married couple and had followed them hither being under injunction to deliver it into nobody s hands but theirs Clare brought it to the light It was less than a foot long sewed up in canvas sealed in red wax with his father s seal and directed in his father s hand to missus Angel Clare It is a little wedding present for you Tess said he handing it to her How thoughtful they are Tess looked a little flustered as she took it I think I would rather have you open it dearest said she turning over the parcel I don t like to break those great seals they look so serious Please open it for me He undid the parcel Inside was a case of morocco leather on the top of which lay a note and a key The note was for Clare in the following words MY DEAR SON Possibly you have forgotten that on the death of your godmother missus Pitney when you were a lad she vain kind woman that she was left to me a portion of the contents of her jewel case in trust for your wife if you should ever have one as a mark of her affection for you and whomsoever you should choose This trust I have fulfilled and the diamonds have been locked up at my banker s ever since Though I feel it to be a somewhat incongruous act in the circumstances I am as you will see bound to hand over the articles to the woman to whom the use of them for her lifetime will now rightly belong and they are therefore promptly sent They become I believe heirlooms strictly speaking according to the terms of your godmother s will The precise words of the clause that refers to this matter are enclosed I do remember said Clare but I had quite forgotten Unlocking the case they found it to contain a necklace with pendant bracelets and ear rings and also some other small ornaments Tess seemed afraid to touch them at first but her eyes sparkled for a moment as much as the stones when Clare spread out the set Are they mine she asked incredulously They are certainly said he He looked into the fire He remembered how when he was a lad of fifteen his godmother the Squire s wife the only rich person with whom he had ever come in contact had pinned her faith to his success had prophesied a wondrous career for him There had seemed nothing at all out of keeping with such a conjectured career in the storing up of these showy ornaments for his wife and the wives of her descendants They gleamed somewhat ironically now Yet why he asked himself It was but a question of vanity throughout and if that were admitted into one side of the equation it should be admitted into the other His wife was a d Urberville whom could they become better than her Suddenly he said with enthusiasm Tess put them on put them on And he turned from the fire to help her But as if by magic she had already donned them necklace ear rings bracelets and all But the gown isn t right Tess said Clare It ought to be a low one for a set of brilliants like that Ought it said Tess Yes said he He suggested to her how to tuck in the upper edge of her bodice so as to make it roughly approximate to the cut for evening wear and when she had done this and the pendant to the necklace hung isolated amid the whiteness of her throat as it was designed to do he stepped back to survey her My heavens said Clare how beautiful you are As everybody knows fine feathers make fine birds a peasant girl but very moderately prepossessing to the casual observer in her simple condition and attire will bloom as an amazing beauty if clothed as a woman of fashion with the aids that Art can render while the beauty of the midnight crush would often cut but a sorry figure if placed inside the field woman s wrapper upon a monotonous acreage of turnips on a dull day He had never till now estimated the artistic excellence of Tess s limbs and features If you were only to appear in a ball room he said But no no dearest I think I love you best in the wing bonnet and cotton frock yes better than in this well as you support these dignities Tess s sense of her striking appearance had given her a flush of excitement which was yet not happiness I ll take them off she said in case Jonathan should see me They are not fit for me are they They must be sold I suppose Let them stay a few minutes longer Sell them Never It would be a breach of faith Influenced by a second thought she readily obeyed She had something to tell and there might be help in these She sat down with the jewels upon her and they again indulged in conjectures as to where Jonathan could possibly be with their baggage The ale they had poured out for his consumption when he came had gone flat with long standing Shortly after this they began supper which was already laid on a side table Ere they had finished there was a jerk in the fire smoke the rising skein of which bulged out into the room as if some giant had laid his hand on the chimney top for a moment It had been caused by the opening of the outer door A heavy step was now heard in the passage and Angel went out I couldn make nobody hear at all by knocking apologized Jonathan Kail for it was he at last and as t was raining out I opened the door I ve brought the things sir I am very glad to see them But you are very late Well yes sir There was something subdued in Jonathan Kail s tone which had not been there in the day and lines of concern were ploughed upon his forehead in addition to the lines of years He continued We ve all been gallied at the dairy at what might ha been a most terrible affliction since you and your Mis ess so to name her now left us this a ternoon Perhaps you ha nt forgot the cock s afternoon crow Dear me what Well some says it do mane one thing and some another but what s happened is that poor little Retty Priddle hev tried to drown herself No Really Why she bade us goodbye with the rest Yes Well sir when you and your Mis ess so to name what she lawful is when you two drove away as I say Retty and Marian put on their bonnets and went out and as there is not much doing now being New Year s Eve and folks mops and brooms from what s inside em nobody took much notice They went on to Lew Everard where they had summut to drink and then on they vamped to Dree armed Cross and there they seemed to have parted Retty striking across the water meads as if for home and Marian going on to the next village where there s another public house Nothing more was zeed or heard o Retty till the waterman on his way home noticed something by the Great Pool twas her bonnet and shawl packed up In the water he found her He and another man brought her home thinking a was dead but she fetched round by degrees Angel suddenly recollecting that Tess was overhearing this gloomy tale went to shut the door between the passage and the ante room to the inner parlour where she was but his wife flinging a shawl round her had come to the outer room and was listening to the man s narrative her eyes resting absently on the luggage and the drops of rain glistening upon it And more than this there s Marian she s been found dead drunk by the withy bed a girl who hev never been known to touch anything before except shilling ale though to be sure a was always a good trencher woman as her face showed It seems as if the maids had all gone out o their minds And Izz asked Tess Izz is about house as usual but a do say a can guess how it happened and she seems to be very low in mind about it poor maid as well she mid be And so you see sir as all this happened just when we was packing your few traps and your Mis ess s night rail and dressing things into the cart why it belated me Yes Well Jonathan will you get the trunks upstairs and drink a cup of ale and hasten back as soon as you can in case you should be wanted Tess had gone back to the inner parlour and sat down by the fire looking wistfully into it She heard Jonathan Kail s heavy footsteps up and down the stairs till he had done placing the luggage and heard him express his thanks for the ale her husband took out to him and for the gratuity he received Jonathan s footsteps then died from the door and his cart creaked away Angel slid forward the massive oak bar which secured the door and coming in to where she sat over the hearth pressed her cheeks between his hands from behind He expected her to jump up gaily and unpack the toilet gear that she had been so anxious about but as she did not rise he sat down with her in the firelight the candles on the supper table being too thin and glimmering to interfere with its glow I am so sorry you should have heard this sad story about the girls he said Still don t let it depress you Retty was naturally morbid you know Without the least cause said Tess While they who have cause to be hide it and pretend they are not This incident had turned the scale for her They were simple and innocent girls on whom the unhappiness of unrequited love had fallen they had deserved better at the hands of Fate She had deserved worse yet she was the chosen one It was wicked of her to take all without paying She would pay to the uttermost farthing she would tell there and then This final determination she came to when she looked into the fire he holding her hand A steady glare from the now flameless embers painted the sides and back of the fireplace with its colour and the well polished andirons and the old brass tongs that would not meet The underside of the mantel shelf was flushed with the high coloured light and the legs of the table nearest the fire Tess s face and neck reflected the same warmth which each gem turned into an Aldebaran or a Sirius a constellation of white red and green flashes that interchanged their hues with her every pulsation Do you remember what we said to each other this morning about telling our faults he asked abruptly finding that she still remained immovable We spoke lightly perhaps and you may well have done so But for me it was no light promise I want to make a confession to you Love This from him so unexpectedly apposite had the effect upon her of a Providential interposition You have to confess something she said quickly and even with gladness and relief You did not expect it Ah you thought too highly of me Now listen Put your head there because I want you to forgive me and not to be indignant with me for not telling you before as perhaps I ought to have done How strange it was He seemed to be her double She did not speak and Clare went on I did not mention it because I was afraid of endangering my chance of you darling the great prize of my life my Fellowship I call you My brother s Fellowship was won at his college mine at Talbothays Dairy Well I would not risk it I was going to tell you a month ago at the time you agreed to be mine but I could not I thought it might frighten you away from me I put it off then I thought I would tell you yesterday to give you a chance at least of escaping me But I did not And I did not this morning when you proposed our confessing our faults on the landing the sinner that I was But I must now I see you sitting there so solemnly I wonder if you will forgive me O yes I am sure that Well I hope so But wait a minute You don t know To begin at the beginning Though I imagine my poor father fears that I am one of the eternally lost for my doctrines I am of course a believer in good morals Tess as much as you I used to wish to be a teacher of men and it was a great disappointment to me when I found I could not enter the Church I admired spotlessness even though I could lay no claim to it and hated impurity as I hope I do now Whatever one may think of plenary inspiration one must heartily subscribe to these words of Paul Be thou an example in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity It is the only safeguard for us poor human beings Integer vitae says a Roman poet who is strange company for saint Paul The man of upright life from frailties free Stands not in need of Moorish spear or bow Well a certain place is paved with good intentions and having felt all that so strongly you will see what a terrible remorse it bred in me when in the midst of my fine aims for other people I myself fell He then told her of that time of his life to which allusion has been made when tossed about by doubts and difficulties in London like a cork on the waves he plunged into eight and forty hours dissipation with a stranger Happily I awoke almost immediately to a sense of my folly he continued I would have no more to say to her and I came home I have never repeated the offence But I felt I should like to treat you with perfect frankness and honour and I could not do so without telling this Do you forgive me She pressed his hand tightly for an answer Then we will dismiss it at once and for ever too painful as it is for the occasion and talk of something lighter O Angel I am almost glad because now YOU can forgive ME I have not made my confession I have a confession too remember I said so Ah to be sure Now then for it wicked little one Perhaps although you smile it is as serious as yours or more so It can hardly be more serious dearest It cannot O no it cannot She jumped up joyfully at the hope No it cannot be more serious certainly she cried because tis just the same I will tell you now She sat down again Their hands were still joined The ashes under the grate were lit by the fire vertically like a torrid waste Imagination might have beheld a Last Day luridness in this red coaled glow which fell on his face and hand and on hers peering into the loose hair about her brow and firing the delicate skin underneath A large shadow of her shape rose upon the wall and ceiling She bent forward at which each diamond on her neck gave a sinister wink like a toad s and pressing her forehead against his temple she entered on her story of her acquaintance with Alec d Urberville and its results murmuring the words without flinching and with her eyelids drooping down END OF PHASE THE FOURTH Phase the Fifth The Woman Pays XXXV Her narrative ended even its re assertions and secondary explanations were done Tess s voice throughout had hardly risen higher than its opening tone there had been no exculpatory phrase of any kind and she had not wept But the complexion even of external things seemed to suffer transmutation as her announcement progressed The fire in the grate looked impish demoniacally funny as if it did not care in the least about her strait The fender grinned idly as if it too did not care The light from the water bottle was merely engaged in a chromatic problem All material objects around announced their irresponsibility with terrible iteration And yet nothing had changed since the moments when he had been kissing her or rather nothing in the substance of things But the essence of things had changed When she ceased the auricular impressions from their previous endearments seemed to hustle away into the corner of their brains repeating themselves as echoes from a time of supremely purblind foolishness Clare performed the irrelevant act of stirring the fire the intelligence had not even yet got to the bottom of him After stirring the embers he rose to his feet all the force of her disclosure had imparted itself now His face had withered In the strenuousness of his concentration he treadled fitfully on the floor He could not by any contrivance think closely enough that was the meaning of his vague movement When he spoke it was in the most inadequate commonplace voice of the many varied tones she had heard from him Tess Yes dearest Am I to believe this From your manner I am to take it as true O you cannot be out of your mind You ought to be Yet you are not My wife my Tess nothing in you warrants such a supposition as that I am not out of my mind she said And yet He looked vacantly at her to resume with dazed senses Why didn t you tell me before Ah yes you would have told me in a way but I hindered you I remember These and other of his words were nothing but the perfunctory babble of the surface while the depths remained paralyzed He turned away and bent over a chair Tess followed him to the middle of the room where he was and stood there staring at him with eyes that did not weep Presently she slid down upon her knees beside his foot and from this position she crouched in a heap In the name of our love forgive me she whispered with a dry mouth I have forgiven you for the same And as he did not answer she said again Forgive me as you are forgiven I forgive YOU Angel You yes you do But you do not forgive me O Tess forgiveness does not apply to the case You were one person now you are another My God how can forgiveness meet such a grotesque prestidigitation as that He paused contemplating this definition then suddenly broke into horrible laughter as unnatural and ghastly as a laugh in hell Don t don t It kills me quite that she shrieked O have mercy upon me have mercy He did not answer and sickly white she jumped up Angel Angel what do you mean by that laugh she cried out Do you know what this is to me He shook his head I have been hoping longing praying to make you happy I have thought what joy it will be to do it what an unworthy wife I shall be if I do not That s what I have felt Angel I know that I thought Angel that you loved me me my very self If it is I you do love O how can it be that you look and speak so It frightens me Having begun to love you I love you for ever in all changes in all disgraces because you are yourself I ask no more Then how can you O my own husband stop loving me I repeat the woman I have been loving is not you But who Another woman in your shape She perceived in his words the realization of her own apprehensive foreboding in former times He looked upon her as a species of imposter a guilty woman in the guise of an innocent one Terror was upon her white face as she saw it her cheek was flaccid and her mouth had almost the aspect of a round little hole The horrible sense of his view of her so deadened her that she staggered and he stepped forward thinking she was going to fall Sit down sit down he said gently You are ill and it is natural that you should be She did sit down without knowing where she was that strained look still upon her face and her eyes such as to make his flesh creep I don t belong to you any more then do I Angel she asked helplessly It is not me but another woman like me that he loved he says The image raised caused her to take pity upon herself as one who was ill used Her eyes filled as she regarded her position further she turned round and burst into a flood of self sympathetic tears Clare was relieved at this change for the effect on her of what had happened was beginning to be a trouble to him only less than the woe of the disclosure itself He waited patiently apathetically till the violence of her grief had worn itself out and her rush of weeping had lessened to a catching gasp at intervals Angel she said suddenly in her natural tones the insane dry voice of terror having left her now Angel am I too wicked for you and me to live together I have not been able to think what we can do I shan t ask you to let me live with you Angel because I have no right to I shall not write to mother and sisters to say we be married as I said I would do and I shan t finish the good hussif I cut out and meant to make while we were in lodgings Shan t you No I shan t do anything unless you order me to and if you go away from me I shall not follow ee and if you never speak to me any more I shall not ask why unless you tell me I may And if I order you to do anything I will obey you like your wretched slave even if it is to lie down and die You are very good But it strikes me that there is a want of harmony between your present mood of self sacrifice and your past mood of self preservation These were the first words of antagonism To fling elaborate sarcasms at Tess however was much like flinging them at a dog or cat The charms of their subtlety passed by her unappreciated and she only received them as inimical sounds which meant that anger ruled She remained mute not knowing that he was smothering his affection for her She hardly observed that a tear descended slowly upon his cheek a tear so large that it magnified the pores of the skin over which it rolled like the object lens of a microscope Meanwhile reillumination as to the terrible and total change that her confession had wrought in his life in his universe returned to him and he tried desperately to advance among the new conditions in which he stood Some consequent action was necessary yet what Tess he said as gently as he could speak I cannot stay in this room just now I will walk out a little way He quietly left the room and the two glasses of wine that he had poured out for their supper one for her one for him remained on the table untasted This was what their agape had come to At tea two or three hours earlier they had in the freakishness of affection drunk from one cup The closing of the door behind him gently as it had been pulled to roused Tess from her stupor He was gone she could not stay Hastily flinging her cloak around her she opened the door and followed putting out the candles as if she were never coming back The rain was over and the night was now clear She was soon close at his heels for Clare walked slowly and without purpose His form beside her light gray figure looked black sinister and forbidding and she felt as sarcasm the touch of the jewels of which she had been momentarily so proud Clare turned at hearing her footsteps but his recognition of her presence seemed to make no difference to him and he went on over the five yawning arches of the great bridge in front of the house The cow and horse tracks in the road were full of water the rain having been enough to charge them but not enough to wash them away Across these minute pools the reflected stars flitted in a quick transit as she passed she would not have known they were shining overhead if she had not seen them there the vastest things of the universe imaged in objects so mean The place to which they had travelled to day was in the same valley as Talbothays but some miles lower down the river and the surroundings being open she kept easily in sight of him Away from the house the road wound through the meads and along these she followed Clare without any attempt to come up with him or to attract him but with dumb and vacant fidelity At last however her listless walk brought her up alongside him and still he said nothing The cruelty of fooled honesty is often great after enlightenment and it was mighty in Clare now The outdoor air had apparently taken away from him all tendency to act on impulse she knew that he saw her without irradiation in all her bareness that Time was chanting his satiric psalm at her then Behold when thy face is made bare he that loved thee shall hate Thy face shall be no more fair at the fall of thy fate For thy life shall fall as a leaf and be shed as the rain And the veil of thine head shall be grief and the crown shall be pain He was still intently thinking and her companionship had now insufficient power to break or divert the strain of thought What a weak thing her presence must have become to him She could not help addressing Clare What have I done what HAVE I done I have not told of anything that interferes with or belies my love for you You don t think I planned it do you It is in your own mind what you are angry at Angel it is not in me O it is not in me and I am not that deceitful woman you think me H m well Not deceitful my wife but not the same No not the same But do not make me reproach you I have sworn that I will not and I will do everything to avoid it But she went on pleading in her distraction and perhaps said things that would have been better left to silence Angel Angel I was a child a child when it happened I knew nothing of men You were more sinned against than sinning that I admit Then will you not forgive me I do forgive you but forgiveness is not all And love me To this question he did not answer O Angel my mother says that it sometimes happens so she knows several cases where they were worse than I and the husband has not minded it much has got over it at least And yet the woman had not loved him as I do you Don t Tess don t argue Different societies different manners You almost make me say you are an unapprehending peasant woman who have never been initiated into the proportions of social things You don t know what you say I am only a peasant by position not by nature She spoke with an impulse to anger but it went as it came So much the worse for you I think that parson who unearthed your pedigree would have done better if he had held his tongue I cannot help associating your decline as a family with this other fact of your want of firmness Decrepit families imply decrepit wills decrepit conduct Heaven why did you give me a handle for despising you more by informing me of your descent Here was I thinking you a new sprung child of nature there were you the belated seedling of an effete aristocracy Lots of families are as bad as mine in that Retty s family were once large landowners and so were Dairyman Billett s And the Debbyhouses who now are carters were once the De Bayeux family You find such as I everywhere tis a feature of our county and I can t help it So much the worse for the county She took these reproaches in their bulk simply not in their particulars he did not love her as he had loved her hitherto and to all else she was indifferent They wandered on again in silence It was said afterwards that a cottager of Wellbridge who went out late that night for a doctor met two lovers in the pastures walking very slowly without converse one behind the other as in a funeral procession and the glimpse that he obtained of their faces seemed to denote that they were anxious and sad Returning later he passed them again in the same field progressing just as slowly and as regardless of the hour and of the cheerless night as before It was only on account of his preoccupation with his own affairs and the illness in his house that he did not bear in mind the curious incident which however he recalled a long while after During the interval of the cottager s going and coming she had said to her husband I don t see how I can help being the cause of much misery to you all your life The river is down there I can put an end to myself in it I am not afraid I don t wish to add murder to my other follies he said I will leave something to show that I did it myself on account of my shame They will not blame you then Don t speak so absurdly I wish not to hear it It is nonsense to have such thoughts in this kind of case which is rather one for satirical laughter than for tragedy You don t in the least understand the quality of the mishap It would be viewed in the light of a joke by nine tenths of the world if it were known Please oblige me by returning to the house and going to bed I will said she dutifully They had rambled round by a road which led to the well known ruins of the Cistercian abbey behind the mill the latter having in centuries past been attached to the monastic establishment The mill still worked on food being a perennial necessity the abbey had perished creeds being transient One continually sees the ministration of the temporary outlasting the ministration of the eternal Their walk having been circuitous they were still not far from the house and in obeying his direction she only had to reach the large stone bridge across the main river and follow the road for a few yards When she got back everything remained as she had left it the fire being still burning She did not stay downstairs for more than a minute but proceeded to her chamber whither the luggage had been taken Here she sat down on the edge of the bed looking blankly around and presently began to undress In removing the light towards the bedstead its rays fell upon the tester of white dimity something was hanging beneath it and she lifted the candle to see what it was A bough of mistletoe Angel had put it there she knew that in an instant This was the explanation of that mysterious parcel which it had been so difficult to pack and bring whose contents he would not explain to her saying that time would soon show her the purpose thereof In his zest and his gaiety he had hung it there How foolish and inopportune that mistletoe looked now Having nothing more to fear having scarce anything to hope for that he would relent there seemed no promise whatever she lay down dully When sorrow ceases to be speculative sleep sees her opportunity Among so many happier moods which forbid repose this was a mood which welcomed it and in a few minutes the lonely Tess forgot existence surrounded by the aromatic stillness of the chamber that had once possibly been the bride chamber of her own ancestry Later on that night Clare also retraced his steps to the house Entering softly to the sitting room he obtained a light and with the manner of one who had considered his course he spread his rugs upon the old horse hair sofa which stood there and roughly shaped it to a sleeping couch Before lying down he crept shoeless upstairs and listened at the door of her apartment Her measured breathing told that she was sleeping profoundly Thank God murmured Clare and yet he was conscious of a pang of bitterness at the thought approximately true though not wholly so that having shifted the burden of her life to his shoulders she was now reposing without care He turned away to descend then irresolute faced round to her door again In the act he caught sight of one of the d Urberville dames whose portrait was immediately over the entrance to Tess s bedchamber In the candlelight the painting was more than unpleasant Sinister design lurked in the woman s features a concentrated purpose of revenge on the other sex so it seemed to him then The Caroline bodice of the portrait was low precisely as Tess s had been when he tucked it in to show the necklace and again he experienced the distressing sensation of a resemblance between them The check was sufficient He resumed his retreat and descended His air remained calm and cold his small compressed mouth indexing his powers of self control his face wearing still that terrible sterile expression which had spread thereon since her disclosure It was the face of a man who was no longer passion s slave yet who found no advantage in his enfranchisement He was simply regarding the harrowing contingencies of human experience the unexpectedness of things Nothing so pure so sweet so virginal as Tess had seemed possible all the long while that he had adored her up to an hour ago but The little less and what worlds away He argued erroneously when he said to himself that her heart was not indexed in the honest freshness of her face but Tess had no advocate to set him right Could it be possible he continued that eyes which as they gazed never expressed any divergence from what the tongue was telling were yet ever seeing another world behind her ostensible one discordant and contrasting He reclined on his couch in the sitting room and extinguished the light The night came in and took up its place there unconcerned and indifferent the night which had already swallowed up his happiness and was now digesting it listlessly and was ready to swallow up the happiness of a thousand other people with as little disturbance or change of mien XXXVI Clare arose in the light of a dawn that was ashy and furtive as though associated with crime The fireplace confronted him with its extinct embers the spread supper table whereon stood the two full glasses of untasted wine now flat and filmy her vacated seat and his own the other articles of furniture with their eternal look of not being able to help it their intolerable inquiry what was to be done From above there was no sound but in a few minutes there came a knock at the door He remembered that it would be the neighbouring cottager s wife who was to minister to their wants while they remained here The presence of a third person in the house would be extremely awkward just now and being already dressed he opened the window and informed her that they could manage to shift for themselves that morning She had a milk can in her hand which he told her to leave at the door When the dame had gone away he searched in the back quarters of the house for fuel and speedily lit a fire There was plenty of eggs butter bread and so on in the larder and Clare soon had breakfast laid his experiences at the dairy having rendered him facile in domestic preparations The smoke of the kindled wood rose from the chimney without like a lotus headed column local people who were passing by saw it and thought of the newly married couple and envied their happiness Angel cast a final glance round and then going to the foot of the stairs called in a conventional voice Breakfast is ready He opened the front door and took a few steps in the morning air When after a short space he came back she was already in the sitting room mechanically readjusting the breakfast things As she was fully attired and the interval since his calling her had been but two or three minutes she must have been dressed or nearly so before he went to summon her Her hair was twisted up in a large round mass at the back of her head and she had put on one of the new frocks a pale blue woollen garment with neck frillings of white Her hands and face appeared to be cold and she had possibly been sitting dressed in the bedroom a long time without any fire The marked civility of Clare s tone in calling her seemed to have inspired her for the moment with a new glimmer of hope But it soon died when she looked at him The pair were in truth but the ashes of their former fires To the hot sorrow of the previous night had succeeded heaviness it seemed as if nothing could kindle either of them to fervour of sensation any more He spoke gently to her and she replied with a like undemonstrativeness At last she came up to him looking in his sharply defined face as one who had no consciousness that her own formed a visible object also Angel she said and paused touching him with her fingers lightly as a breeze as though she could hardly believe to be there in the flesh the man who was once her lover Her eyes were bright her pale cheek still showed its wonted roundness though half dried tears had left glistening traces thereon and the usually ripe red mouth was almost as pale as her cheek Throbbingly alive as she was still under the stress of her mental grief the life beat so brokenly that a little further pull upon it would cause real illness dull her characteristic eyes and make her mouth thin She looked absolutely pure Nature in her fantastic trickery had set such a seal of maidenhood upon Tess s countenance that he gazed at her with a stupefied air Tess Say it is not true No it is not true It is true Every word Every word He looked at her imploringly as if he would willingly have taken a lie from her lips knowing it to be one and have made of it by some sort of sophistry a valid denial However she only repeated It is true Is he living Angel then asked The baby died But the man He is alive A last despair passed over Clare s face Is he in England Yes He took a few vague steps My position is this he said abruptly I thought any man would have thought that by giving up all ambition to win a wife with social standing with fortune with knowledge of the world I should secure rustic innocence as surely as I should secure pink cheeks but However I am no man to reproach you and I will not Tess felt his position so entirely that the remainder had not been needed Therein lay just the distress of it she saw that he had lost all round Angel I should not have let it go on to marriage with you if I had not known that after all there was a last way out of it for you though I hoped you would never Her voice grew husky A last way I mean to get rid of me You CAN get rid of me How By divorcing me Good heavens how can you be so simple How can I divorce you Can t you now I have told you I thought my confession would give you grounds for that O Tess you are too too childish unformed crude I suppose I don t know what you are You don t understand the law you don t understand What you cannot Indeed I cannot A quick shame mixed with the misery upon his listener s face I thought I thought she whispered O now I see how wicked I seem to you Believe me believe me on my soul I never thought but that you could I hoped you would not yet I believed without a doubt that you could cast me off if you were determined and didn t love me at at all You were mistaken he said O then I ought to have done it to have done it last night But I hadn t the courage That s just like me The courage to do what As she did not answer he took her by the hand What were you thinking of doing he inquired Of putting an end to myself When She writhed under this inquisitorial manner of his Last night she answered Where Under your mistletoe My good How he asked sternly I ll tell you if you won t be angry with me she said shrinking It was with the cord of my box But I could not do the last thing I was afraid that it might cause a scandal to your name The unexpected quality of this confession wrung from her and not volunteered shook him perceptibly But he still held her and letting his glance fall from her face downwards he said Now listen to this You must not dare to think of such a horrible thing How could you You will promise me as your husband to attempt that no more I am ready to promise I saw how wicked it was Wicked The idea was unworthy of you beyond description But Angel she pleaded enlarging her eyes in calm unconcern upon him it was thought of entirely on your account to set you free without the scandal of the divorce that I thought you would have to get I should never have dreamt of doing it on mine However to do it with my own hand is too good for me after all It is you my ruined husband who ought to strike the blow I think I should love you more if that were possible if you could bring yourself to do it since there s no other way of escape for ee I feel I am so utterly worthless So very greatly in the way Ssh Well since you say no I won t I have no wish opposed to yours He knew this to be true enough Since the desperation of the night her activities had dropped to zero and there was no further rashness to be feared Tess tried to busy herself again over the breakfast table with more or less success and they sat down both on the same side so that their glances did not meet There was at first something awkward in hearing each other eat and drink but this could not be escaped moreover the amount of eating done was small on both sides Breakfast over he rose and telling her the hour at which he might be expected to dinner went off to the miller s in a mechanical pursuance of the plan of studying that business which had been his only practical reason for coming here When he was gone Tess stood at the window and presently saw his form crossing the great stone bridge which conducted to the mill premises He sank behind it crossed the railway beyond and disappeared Then without a sigh she turned her attention to the room and began clearing the table and setting it in order The charwoman soon came Her presence was at first a strain upon Tess but afterwards an alleviation At half past twelve she left her assistant alone in the kitchen and returning to the sitting room waited for the reappearance of Angel s form behind the bridge About one he showed himself Her face flushed although he was a quarter of a mile off She ran to the kitchen to get the dinner served by the time he should enter He went first to the room where they had washed their hands together the day before and as he entered the sitting room the dish covers rose from the dishes as if by his own motion How punctual he said Yes I saw you coming over the bridge said she The meal was passed in commonplace talk of what he had been doing during the morning at the Abbey Mill of the methods of bolting and the old fashioned machinery which he feared would not enlighten him greatly on modern improved methods some of it seeming to have been in use ever since the days it ground for the monks in the adjoining conventual buildings now a heap of ruins He left the house again in the course of an hour coming home at dusk and occupying himself through the evening with his papers She feared she was in the way and when the old woman was gone retired to the kitchen where she made herself busy as well as she could for more than an hour Clare s shape appeared at the door You must not work like this he said You are not my servant you are my wife She raised her eyes and brightened somewhat I may think myself that indeed she murmured in piteous raillery You mean in name Well I don t want to be anything more You MAY think so Tess You are What do you mean I don t know she said hastily with tears in her accents I thought I because I am not respectable I mean I told you I thought I was not respectable enough long ago and on that account I didn t want to marry you only only you urged me She broke into sobs and turned her back to him It would almost have won round any man but Angel Clare Within the remote depths of his constitution so gentle and affectionate as he was in general there lay hidden a hard logical deposit like a vein of metal in a soft loam which turned the edge of everything that attempted to traverse it It had blocked his acceptance of the Church it blocked his acceptance of Tess Moreover his affection itself was less fire than radiance and with regard to the other sex when he ceased to believe he ceased to follow contrasting in this with many impressionable natures who remain sensuously infatuated with what they intellectually despise He waited till her sobbing ceased I wish half the women in England were as respectable as you he said in an ebullition of bitterness against womankind in general It isn t a question of respectability but one of principle He spoke such things as these and more of a kindred sort to her being still swayed by the antipathetic wave which warps direct souls with such persistence when once their vision finds itself mocked by appearances There was it is true underneath a back current of sympathy through which a woman of the world might have conquered him But Tess did not think of this she took everything as her deserts and hardly opened her mouth The firmness of her devotion to him was indeed almost pitiful quick tempered as she naturally was nothing that he could say made her unseemly she sought not her own was not provoked thought no evil of his treatment of her She might just now have been Apostolic Charity herself returned to a self seeking modern world This evening night and morning were passed precisely as the preceding ones had been passed On one and only one occasion did she the formerly free and independent Tess venture to make any advances It was on the third occasion of his starting after a meal to go out to the flour mill As he was leaving the table he said Goodbye and she replied in the same words at the same time inclining her mouth in the way of his He did not avail himself of the invitation saying as he turned hastily aside I shall be home punctually Tess shrank into herself as if she had been struck Often enough had he tried to reach those lips against her consent often had he said gaily that her mouth and breath tasted of the butter and eggs and milk and honey on which she mainly lived that he drew sustenance from them and other follies of that sort But he did not care for them now He observed her sudden shrinking and said gently You know I have to think of a course It was imperative that we should stay together a little while to avoid the scandal to you that would have resulted from our immediate parting But you must see it is only for form s sake Yes said Tess absently He went out and on his way to the mill stood still and wished for a moment that he had responded yet more kindly and kissed her once at least Thus they lived through this despairing day or two in the same house truly but more widely apart than before they were lovers It was evident to her that he was as he had said living with paralyzed activities in his endeavour to think of a plan of procedure She was awe stricken to discover such determination under such apparent flexibility His consistency was indeed too cruel She no longer expected forgiveness now More than once she thought of going away from him during his absence at the mill but she feared that this instead of benefiting him might be the means of hampering and humiliating him yet more if it should become known Meanwhile Clare was meditating verily His thought had been unsuspended he was becoming ill with thinking eaten out with thinking withered by thinking scourged out of all his former pulsating flexuous domesticity He walked about saying to himself What s to be done what s to be done and by chance she overheard him It caused her to break the reserve about their future which had hitherto prevailed I suppose you are not going to live with me long are you Angel she asked the sunk corners of her mouth betraying how purely mechanical were the means by which she retained that expression of chastened calm upon her face I cannot he said without despising myself and what is worse perhaps despising you I mean of course cannot live with you in the ordinary sense At present whatever I feel I do not despise you And let me speak plainly or you may not see all my difficulties How can we live together while that man lives he being your husband in nature and not I If he were dead it might be different Besides that s not all the difficulty it lies in another consideration one bearing upon the future of other people than ourselves Think of years to come and children being born to us and this past matter getting known for it must get known There is not an uttermost part of the earth but somebody comes from it or goes to it from elsewhere Well think of wretches of our flesh and blood growing up under a taunt which they will gradually get to feel the full force of with their expanding years What an awakening for them What a prospect Can you honestly say Remain after contemplating this contingency Don t you think we had better endure the ills we have than fly to others Her eyelids weighted with trouble continued drooping as before I cannot say Remain she answered I cannot I had not thought so far Tess s feminine hope shall we confess it had been so obstinately recuperative as to revive in her surreptitious visions of a domiciliary intimacy continued long enough to break down his coldness even against his judgement Though unsophisticated in the usual sense she was not incomplete and it would have denoted deficiency of womanhood if she had not instinctively known what an argument lies in propinquity Nothing else would serve her she knew if this failed It was wrong to hope in what was of the nature of strategy she said to herself yet that sort of hope she could not extinguish His last representation had now been made and it was as she said a new view She had truly never thought so far as that and his lucid picture of possible offspring who would scorn her was one that brought deadly convictions to an honest heart which was humanitarian to its centre Sheer experience had already taught her that in some circumstances there was one thing better than to lead a good life and that was to be saved from leading any life whatever Like all who have been previsioned by suffering she could in the words of M Sully Prudhomme hear a penal sentence in the fiat You shall be born particularly if addressed to potential issue of hers Yet such is the vulpine slyness of Dame Nature that till now Tess had been hoodwinked by her love for Clare into forgetting it might result in vitalizations that would inflict upon others what she had bewailed as misfortune to herself She therefore could not withstand his argument But with the self combating proclivity of the supersensitive an answer thereto arose in Clare s own mind and he almost feared it It was based on her exceptional physical nature and she might have used it promisingly She might have added besides On an Australian upland or Texan plain who is to know or care about my misfortunes or to reproach me or you Yet like the majority of women she accepted the momentary presentment as if it were the inevitable And she may have been right The intuitive heart of woman knoweth not only its own bitterness but its husband s and even if these assumed reproaches were not likely to be addressed to him or to his by strangers they might have reached his ears from his own fastidious brain It was the third day of the estrangement Some might risk the odd paradox that with more animalism he would have been the nobler man We do not say it Yet Clare s love was doubtless ethereal to a fault imaginative to impracticability With these natures corporal presence is something less appealing than corporal absence the latter creating an ideal presence that conveniently drops the defects of the real She found that her personality did not plead her cause so forcibly as she had anticipated The figurative phrase was true she was another woman than the one who had excited his desire I have thought over what you say she remarked to him moving her forefinger over the tablecloth her other hand which bore the ring that mocked them both supporting her forehead It is quite true all of it it must be You must go away from me But what can you do I can go home Clare had not thought of that Are you sure he inquired Quite sure We ought to part and we may as well get it past and done You once said that I was apt to win men against their better judgement and if I am constantly before your eyes I may cause you to change your plans in opposition to your reason and wish and afterwards your repentance and my sorrow will be terrible And you would like to go home he asked I want to leave you and go home Then it shall be so Though she did not look up at him she started There was a difference between the proposition and the covenant which she had felt only too quickly I feared it would come to this she murmured her countenance meekly fixed I don t complain Angel I I think it best What you said has quite convinced me Yes though nobody else should reproach me if we should stay together yet somewhen years hence you might get angry with me for any ordinary matter and knowing what you do of my bygones you yourself might be tempted to say words and they might be overheard perhaps by my own children O what only hurts me now would torture and kill me then I will go to morrow And I shall not stay here Though I didn t like to initiate it I have seen that it was advisable we should part at least for a while till I can better see the shape that things have taken and can write to you Tess stole a glance at her husband He was pale even tremulous but as before she was appalled by the determination revealed in the depths of this gentle being she had married the will to subdue the grosser to the subtler emotion the substance to the conception the flesh to the spirit Propensities tendencies habits were as dead leaves upon the tyrannous wind of his imaginative ascendency He may have observed her look for he explained I think of people more kindly when I am away from them adding cynically God knows perhaps we will shake down together some day for weariness thousands have done it That day he began to pack up and she went upstairs and began to pack also Both knew that it was in their two minds that they might part the next morning for ever despite the gloss of assuaging conjectures thrown over their proceeding because they were of the sort to whom any parting which has an air of finality is a torture He knew and she knew that though the fascination which each had exercised over the other on her part independently of accomplishments would probably in the first days of their separation be even more potent than ever time must attenuate that effect the practical arguments against accepting her as a housemate might pronounce themselves more strongly in the boreal light of a remoter view Moreover when two people are once parted have abandoned a common domicile and a common environment new growths insensibly bud upward to fill each vacated place unforeseen accidents hinder intentions and old plans are forgotten XXXVII Midnight came and passed silently for there was nothing to announce it in the Valley of the Froom Not long after one o clock there was a slight creak in the darkened farmhouse once the mansion of the d Urbervilles Tess who used the upper chamber heard it and awoke It had come from the corner step of the staircase which as usual was loosely nailed She saw the door of her bedroom open and the figure of her husband crossed the stream of moonlight with a curiously careful tread He was in his shirt and trousers only and her first flush of joy died when she perceived that his eyes were fixed in an unnatural stare on vacancy When he reached the middle of the room he stood still and murmured in tones of indescribable sadness Dead dead dead Under the influence of any strongly disturbing force Clare would occasionally walk in his sleep and even perform strange feats such as he had done on the night of their return from market just before their marriage when he re enacted in his bedroom his combat with the man who had insulted her Tess saw that continued mental distress had wrought him into that somnambulistic state now Her loyal confidence in him lay so deep down in her heart that awake or asleep he inspired her with no sort of personal fear If he had entered with a pistol in his hand he would scarcely have disturbed her trust in his protectiveness Clare came close and bent over her Dead dead dead he murmured After fixedly regarding her for some moments with the same gaze of unmeasurable woe he bent lower enclosed her in his arms and rolled her in the sheet as in a shroud Then lifting her from the bed with as much respect as one would show to a dead body he carried her across the room murmuring My poor poor Tess my dearest darling Tess So sweet so good so true The words of endearment withheld so severely in his waking hours were inexpressibly sweet to her forlorn and hungry heart If it had been to save her weary life she would not by moving or struggling have put an end to the position she found herself in Thus she lay in absolute stillness scarcely venturing to breathe and wondering what he was going to do with her suffered herself to be borne out upon the landing My wife dead dead he said He paused in his labours for a moment to lean with her against the banister Was he going to throw her down Self solicitude was near extinction in her and in the knowledge that he had planned to depart on the morrow possibly for always she lay in his arms in this precarious position with a sense rather of luxury than of terror If they could only fall together and both be dashed to pieces how fit how desirable However he did not let her fall but took advantage of the support of the handrail to imprint a kiss upon her lips lips in the day time scorned Then he clasped her with a renewed firmness of hold and descended the staircase The creak of the loose stair did not awaken him and they reached the ground floor safely Freeing one of his hands from his grasp of her for a moment he slid back the door bar and passed out slightly striking his stockinged toe against the edge of the door But this he seemed not to mind and having room for extension in the open air he lifted her against his shoulder so that he could carry her with ease the absence of clothes taking much from his burden Thus he bore her off the premises in the direction of the river a few yards distant His ultimate intention if he had any she had not yet divined and she found herself conjecturing on the matter as a third person might have done So easefully had she delivered her whole being up to him that it pleased her to think he was regarding her as his absolute possession to dispose of as he should choose It was consoling under the hovering terror of to morrow s separation to feel that he really recognized her now as his wife Tess and did not cast her off even if in that recognition he went so far as to arrogate to himself the right of harming her Ah now she knew what he was dreaming of that Sunday morning when he had borne her along through the water with the other dairymaids who had loved him nearly as much as she if that were possible which Tess could hardly admit Clare did not cross the bridge with her but proceeding several paces on the same side towards the adjoining mill at length stood still on the brink of the river Its waters in creeping down these miles of meadowland frequently divided serpentining in purposeless curves looping themselves around little islands that had no name returning and re embodying themselves as a broad main stream further on Opposite the spot to which he had brought her was such a general confluence and the river was proportionately voluminous and deep Across it was a narrow foot bridge but now the autumn flood had washed the handrail away leaving the bare plank only which lying a few inches above the speeding current formed a giddy pathway for even steady heads and Tess had noticed from the window of the house in the day time young men walking across upon it as a feat in balancing Her husband had possibly observed the same performance anyhow he now mounted the plank and sliding one foot forward advanced along it Was he going to drown her Probably he was The spot was lonely the river deep and wide enough to make such a purpose easy of accomplishment He might drown her if he would it would be better than parting to morrow to lead severed lives The swift stream raced and gyrated under them tossing distorting and splitting the moon s reflected face Spots of froth travelled past and intercepted weeds waved behind the piles If they could both fall together into the current now their arms would be so tightly clasped together that they could not be saved they would go out of the world almost painlessly and there would be no more reproach to her or to him for marrying her His last half hour with her would have been a loving one while if they lived till he awoke his day time aversion would return and this hour would remain to be contemplated only as a transient dream The impulse stirred in her yet she dared not indulge it to make a movement that would have precipitated them both into the gulf How she valued her own life had been proved but his she had no right to tamper with it He reached the other side with her in safety Here they were within a plantation which formed the Abbey grounds and taking a new hold of her he went onward a few steps till they reached the ruined choir of the Abbey church Against the north wall was the empty stone coffin of an abbot in which every tourist with a turn for grim humour was accustomed to stretch himself In this Clare carefully laid Tess Having kissed her lips a second time he breathed deeply as if a greatly desired end were attained Clare then lay down on the ground alongside when he immediately fell into the deep dead slumber of exhaustion and remained motionless as a log The spurt of mental excitement which had produced the effort was now over Tess sat up in the coffin The night though dry and mild for the season was more than sufficiently cold to make it dangerous for him to remain here long in his half clothed state If he were left to himself he would in all probability stay there till the morning and be chilled to certain death She had heard of such deaths after sleep walking But how could she dare to awaken him and let him know what he had been doing when it would mortify him to discover his folly in respect of her Tess however stepping out of her stone confine shook him slightly but was unable to arouse him without being violent It was indispensable to do something for she was beginning to shiver the sheet being but a poor protection Her excitement had in a measure kept her warm during the few minutes adventure but that beatific interval was over It suddenly occurred to her to try persuasion and accordingly she whispered in his ear with as much firmness and decision as she could summon Let us walk on darling at the same time taking him suggestively by the arm To her relief he unresistingly acquiesced her words had apparently thrown him back into his dream which thenceforward seemed to enter on a new phase wherein he fancied she had risen as a spirit and was leading him to Heaven Thus she conducted him by the arm to the stone bridge in front of their residence crossing which they stood at the manor house door Tess s feet were quite bare and the stones hurt her and chilled her to the bone but Clare was in his woollen stockings and appeared to feel no discomfort There was no further difficulty She induced him to lie down on his own sofa bed and covered him up warmly lighting a temporary fire of wood to dry any dampness out of him The noise of these attentions she thought might awaken him and secretly wished that they might But the exhaustion of his mind and body was such that he remained undisturbed As soon as they met the next morning Tess divined that Angel knew little or nothing of how far she had been concerned in the night s excursion though as regarded himself he may have been aware that he had not lain still In truth he had awakened that morning from a sleep deep as annihilation and during those first few moments in which the brain like a Samson shaking himself is trying its strength he had some dim notion of an unusual nocturnal proceeding But the realities of his situation soon displaced conjecture on the other subject He waited in expectancy to discern some mental pointing he knew that if any intention of his concluded over night did not vanish in the light of morning it stood on a basis approximating to one of pure reason even if initiated by impulse of feeling that it was so far therefore to be trusted He thus beheld in the pale morning light the resolve to separate from her not as a hot and indignant instinct but denuded of the passionateness which had made it scorch and burn standing in its bones nothing but a skeleton but none the less there Clare no longer hesitated At breakfast and while they were packing the few remaining articles he showed his weariness from the night s effort so unmistakeably that Tess was on the point of revealing all that had happened but the reflection that it would anger him grieve him stultify him to know that he had instinctively manifested a fondness for her of which his common sense did not approve that his inclination had compromised his dignity when reason slept again deterred her It was too much like laughing at a man when sober for his erratic deeds during intoxication It just crossed her mind too that he might have a faint recollection of his tender vagary and was disinclined to allude to it from a conviction that she would take amatory advantage of the opportunity it gave her of appealing to him anew not to go He had ordered by letter a vehicle from the nearest town and soon after breakfast it arrived She saw in it the beginning of the end the temporary end at least for the revelation of his tenderness by the incident of the night raised dreams of a possible future with him The luggage was put on the top and the man drove them off the miller and the old waiting woman expressing some surprise at their precipitate departure which Clare attributed to his discovery that the mill work was not of the modern kind which he wished to investigate a statement that was true so far as it went Beyond this there was nothing in the manner of their leaving to suggest a fiasco or that they were not going together to visit friends Their route lay near the dairy from which they had started with such solemn joy in each other a few days back and as Clare wished to wind up his business with mister Crick Tess could hardly avoid paying missus Crick a call at the same time unless she would excite suspicion of their unhappy state To make the call as unobtrusive as possible they left the carriage by the wicket leading down from the high road to the dairy house and descended the track on foot side by side The withy bed had been cut and they could see over the stumps the spot to which Clare had followed her when he pressed her to be his wife to the left the enclosure in which she had been fascinated by his harp and far away behind the cow stalls the mead which had been the scene of their first embrace The gold of the summer picture was now gray the colours mean the rich soil mud and the river cold Over the barton gate the dairyman saw them and came forward throwing into his face the kind of jocularity deemed appropriate in Talbothays and its vicinity on the re appearance of the newly married Then missus Crick emerged from the house and several others of their old acquaintance though Marian and Retty did not seem to be there Tess valiantly bore their sly attacks and friendly humours which affected her far otherwise than they supposed In the tacit agreement of husband and wife to keep their estrangement a secret they behaved as would have been ordinary And then although she would rather there had been no word spoken on the subject Tess had to hear in detail the story of Marian and Retty The later had gone home to her father s and Marian had left to look for employment elsewhere They feared she would come to no good To dissipate the sadness of this recital Tess went and bade all her favourite cows goodbye touching each of them with her hand and as she and Clare stood side by side at leaving as if united body and soul there would have been something peculiarly sorry in their aspect to one who should have seen it truly two limbs of one life as they outwardly were his arm touching hers her skirts touching him facing one way as against all the dairy facing the other speaking in their adieux as we and yet sundered like the poles Perhaps something unusually stiff and embarrassed in their attitude some awkwardness in acting up to their profession of unity different from the natural shyness of young couples may have been apparent for when they were gone missus Crick said to her husband How onnatural the brightness of her eyes did seem and how they stood like waxen images and talked as if they were in a dream Didn t it strike ee that twas so Tess had always sommat strange in her and she s not now quite like the proud young bride of a well be doing man They re entered the vehicle and were driven along the roads towards Weatherbury and Stagfoot Lane till they reached the Lane inn where Clare dismissed the fly and man They rested here a while and entering the Vale were next driven onward towards her home by a stranger who did not know their relations At a midway point when Nuttlebury had been passed and where there were cross roads Clare stopped the conveyance and said to Tess that if she meant to return to her mother s house it was here that he would leave her As they could not talk with freedom in the driver s presence he asked her to accompany him for a few steps on foot along one of the branch roads she assented and directing the man to wait a few minutes they strolled away Now let us understand each other he said gently There is no anger between us though there is that which I cannot endure at present I will try to bring myself to endure it I will let you know where I go to as soon as I know myself And if I can bring myself to bear it if it is desirable possible I will come to you But until I come to you it will be better that you should not try to come to me The severity of the decree seemed deadly to Tess she saw his view of her clearly enough he could regard her in no other light than that of one who had practised gross deceit upon him Yet could a woman who had done even what she had done deserve all this But she could contest the point with him no further She simply repeated after him his own words Until you come to me I must not try to come to you Just so May I write to you O yes if you are ill or want anything at all I hope that will not be the case so that it may happen that I write first to you I agree to the conditions Angel because you know best what my punishment ought to be only only don t make it more than I can bear That was all she said on the matter If Tess had been artful had she made a scene fainted wept hysterically in that lonely lane notwithstanding the fury of fastidiousness with which he was possessed he would probably not have withstood her But her mood of long suffering made his way easy for him and she herself was his best advocate Pride too entered into her submission which perhaps was a symptom of that reckless acquiescence in chance too apparent in the whole d Urberville family and the many effective chords which she could have stirred by an appeal were left untouched The remainder of their discourse was on practical matters only He now handed her a packet containing a fairly good sum of money which he had obtained from his bankers for the purpose The brilliants the interest in which seemed to be Tess s for her life only if he understood the wording of the will he advised her to let him send to a bank for safety and to this she readily agreed These things arranged he walked with Tess back to the carriage and handed her in The coachman was paid and told where to drive her Taking next his own bag and umbrella the sole articles he had brought with him hitherwards he bade her goodbye and they parted there and then The fly moved creepingly up a hill and Clare watched it go with an unpremeditated hope that Tess would look out of the window for one moment But that she never thought of doing would not have ventured to do lying in a half dead faint inside Thus he beheld her recede and in the anguish of his heart quoted a line from a poet with peculiar emendations of his own God s NOT in his heaven All s WRONG with the world When Tess had passed over the crest of the hill he turned to go his own way and hardly knew that he loved her still XXXVIII As she drove on through Blackmoor Vale and the landscape of her youth began to open around her Tess aroused herself from her stupor Her first thought was how would she be able to face her parents She reached a turnpike gate which stood upon the highway to the village It was thrown open by a stranger not by the old man who had kept it for many years and to whom she had been known he had probably left on New Year s Day the date when such changes were made Having received no intelligence lately from her home she asked the turnpike keeper for news Oh nothing miss he answered Marlott is Marlott still Folks have died and that John Durbeyfield too hev had a daughter married this week to a gentleman farmer not from John s own house you know they was married elsewhere the gentleman being of that high standing that John s own folk was not considered well be doing enough to have any part in it the bridegroom seeming not to know how t have been discovered that John is a old and ancient nobleman himself by blood with family skillentons in their own vaults to this day but done out of his property in the time o the Romans However Sir John as we call n now kept up the wedding day as well as he could and stood treat to everybody in the parish and John s wife sung songs at The Pure Drop till past eleven o clock Hearing this Tess felt so sick at heart that she could not decide to go home publicly in the fly with her luggage and belongings She asked the turnpike keeper if she might deposit her things at his house for a while and on his offering no objection she dismissed her carriage and went on to the village alone by a back lane At sight of her father s chimney she asked herself how she could possibly enter the house Inside that cottage her relations were calmly supposing her far away on a wedding tour with a comparatively rich man who was to conduct her to bouncing prosperity while here she was friendless creeping up to the old door quite by herself with no better place to go to in the world She did not reach the house unobserved Just by the garden hedge she was met by a girl who knew her one of the two or three with whom she had been intimate at school After making a few inquiries as to how Tess came there her friend unheeding her tragic look interrupted with But where s thy gentleman Tess Tess hastily explained that he had been called away on business and leaving her interlocutor clambered over the garden hedge and thus made her way to the house As she went up the garden path she heard her mother singing by the back door coming in sight of which she perceived missus Durbeyfield on the doorstep in the act of wringing a sheet Having performed this without observing Tess she went indoors and her daughter followed her The washing tub stood in the same old place on the same old quarter hogshead and her mother having thrown the sheet aside was about to plunge her arms in anew Why Tess my chil I thought you was married married really and truly this time we sent the cider Yes mother so I am Going to be No I am married Married Then where s thy husband Oh he s gone away for a time Gone away When was you married then The day you said Yes Tuesday mother And now tis on y Saturday and he gone away Yes he s gone What s the meaning o that Nation seize such husbands as you seem to get say I Mother Tess went across to Joan Durbeyfield laid her face upon the matron s bosom and burst into sobs I don t know how to tell ee mother You said to me and wrote to me that I was not to tell him But I did tell him I couldn t help it and he went away O you little fool you little fool burst out missus Durbeyfield splashing Tess and herself in her agitation My good God that ever I should ha lived to say it but I say it again you little fool Tess was convulsed with weeping the tension of so many days having relaxed at last I know it I know I know she gasped through her sobs But O my mother I could not help it He was so good and I felt the wickedness of trying to blind him as to what had happened If if it were to be done again I should do the same I could not I dared not so sin against him But you sinned enough to marry him first Yes yes that s where my misery do lie But I thought he could get rid o me by law if he were determined not to overlook it And O if you knew if you could only half know how I loved him how anxious I was to have him and how wrung I was between caring so much for him and my wish to be fair to him Tess was so shaken that she could get no further and sank a helpless thing into a chair Well well what s done can t be undone I m sure I don t know why children o my bringing forth should all be bigger simpletons than other people s not to know better than to blab such a thing as that when he couldn t ha found it out till too late Here missus Durbeyfield began shedding tears on her own account as a mother to be pitied What your father will say I don t know she continued for he s been talking about the wedding up at Rolliver s and The Pure Drop every day since and about his family getting back to their rightful position through you poor silly man and now you ve made this mess of it The Lord a Lord As if to bring matters to a focus Tess s father was heard approaching at that moment He did not however enter immediately and missus Durbeyfield said that she would break the bad news to him herself Tess keeping out of sight for the present After her first burst of disappointment Joan began to take the mishap as she had taken Tess s original trouble as she would have taken a wet holiday or failure in the potato crop as a thing which had come upon them irrespective of desert or folly a chance external impingement to be borne with not a lesson Tess retreated upstairs and beheld casually that the beds had been shifted and new arrangements made Her old bed had been adapted for two younger children There was no place here for her now The room below being unceiled she could hear most of what went on there Presently her father entered apparently carrying in a live hen He was a foot haggler now having been obliged to sell his second horse and he travelled with his basket on his arm The hen had been carried about this morning as it was often carried to show people that he was in his work though it had lain with its legs tied under the table at Rolliver s for more than an hour We ve just had up a story about Durbeyfield began and thereupon related in detail to his wife a discussion which had arisen at the inn about the clergy originated by the fact of his daughter having married into a clerical family They was formerly styled sir like my own ancestry he said though nowadays their true style strictly speaking is clerk only As Tess had wished that no great publicity should be given to the event he had mentioned no particulars He hoped she would remove that prohibition soon He proposed that the couple should take Tess s own name d Urberville as uncorrupted It was better than her husbands s He asked if any letter had come from her that day Then missus Durbeyfield informed him that no letter had come but Tess unfortunately had come herself When at length the collapse was explained to him a sullen mortification not usual with Durbeyfield overpowered the influence of the cheering glass Yet the intrinsic quality of the event moved his touchy sensitiveness less than its conjectured effect upon the minds of others To think now that this was to be the end o t said Sir John And I with a family vault under that there church of Kingsbere as big as Squire Jollard s ale cellar and my folk lying there in sixes and sevens as genuine county bones and marrow as any recorded in history And now to be sure what they fellers at Rolliver s and The Pure Drop will say to me How they ll squint and glane and say This is yer mighty match is it this is yer getting back to the true level of yer forefathers in King Norman s time I feel this is too much Joan I shall put an end to myself title and all I can bear it no longer But she can make him keep her if he s married her Why yes But she won t think o doing that D ye think he really have married her or is it like the first Poor Tess who had heard as far as this could not bear to hear more The perception that her word could be doubted even here in her own parental house set her mind against the spot as nothing else could have done How unexpected were the attacks of destiny And if her father doubted her a little would not neighbours and acquaintance doubt her much O she could not live long at home A few days accordingly were all that she allowed herself here at the end of which time she received a short note from Clare informing her that he had gone to the North of England to look at a farm In her craving for the lustre of her true position as his wife and to hide from her parents the vast extent of the division between them she made use of this letter as her reason for again departing leaving them under the impression that she was setting out to join him Still further to screen her husband from any imputation of unkindness to her she took twenty five of the fifty pounds Clare had given her and handed the sum over to her mother as if the wife of a man like Angel Clare could well afford it saying that it was a slight return for the trouble and humiliation she had brought upon them in years past With this assertion of her dignity she bade them farewell and after that there were lively doings in the Durbeyfield household for some time on the strength of Tess s bounty her mother saying and indeed believing that the rupture which had arisen between the young husband and wife had adjusted itself under their strong feeling that they could not live apart from each other XXXIX It was three weeks after the marriage that Clare found himself descending the hill which led to the well known parsonage of his father With his downward course the tower of the church rose into the evening sky in a manner of inquiry as to why he had come and no living person in the twilighted town seemed to notice him still less to expect him He was arriving like a ghost and the sound of his own footsteps was almost an encumbrance to be got rid of The picture of life had changed for him Before this time he had known it but speculatively now he thought he knew it as a practical man though perhaps he did not even yet Nevertheless humanity stood before him no longer in the pensive sweetness of Italian art but in the staring and ghastly attitudes of a Wiertz Museum and with the leer of a study by Van Beers His conduct during these first weeks had been desultory beyond description After mechanically attempting to pursue his agricultural plans as though nothing unusual had happened in the manner recommended by the great and wise men of all ages he concluded that very few of those great and wise men had ever gone so far outside themselves as to test the feasibility of their counsel This is the chief thing be not perturbed said the Pagan moralist That was just Clare s own opinion But he was perturbed Let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid said the Nazarene Clare chimed in cordially but his heart was troubled all the same How he would have liked to confront those two great thinkers and earnestly appeal to them as fellow man to fellow men and ask them to tell him their method His mood transmuted itself into a dogged indifference till at length he fancied he was looking on his own existence with the passive interest of an outsider He was embittered by the conviction that all this desolation had been brought about by the accident of her being a d Urberville When he found that Tess came of that exhausted ancient line and was not of the new tribes from below as he had fondly dreamed why had he not stoically abandoned her in fidelity to his principles This was what he had got by apostasy and his punishment was deserved Then he became weary and anxious and his anxiety increased He wondered if he had treated her unfairly He ate without knowing that he ate and drank without tasting As the hours dropped past as the motive of each act in the long series of bygone days presented itself to his view he perceived how intimately the notion of having Tess as a dear possession was mixed up with all his schemes and words and ways In going hither and thither he observed in the outskirts of a small town a red and blue placard setting forth the great advantages of the Empire of Brazil as a field for the emigrating agriculturist Land was offered there on exceptionally advantageous terms Brazil somewhat attracted him as a new idea Tess could eventually join him there and perhaps in that country of contrasting scenes and notions and habits the conventions would not be so operative which made life with her seem impracticable to him here In brief he was strongly inclined to try Brazil especially as the season for going thither was just at hand With this view he was returning to Emminster to disclose his plan to his parents and to make the best explanation he could make of arriving without Tess short of revealing what had actually separated them As he reached the door the new moon shone upon his face just as the old one had done in the small hours of that morning when he had carried his wife in his arms across the river to the graveyard of the monks but his face was thinner now Clare had given his parents no warning of his visit and his arrival stirred the atmosphere of the Vicarage as the dive of the kingfisher stirs a quiet pool His father and mother were both in the drawing room but neither of his brothers was now at home Angel entered and closed the door quietly behind him But where s your wife dear Angel cried his mother How you surprise us She is at her mother s temporarily I have come home rather in a hurry because I ve decided to go to Brazil Brazil Why they are all Roman Catholics there surely Are they I hadn t thought of that But even the novelty and painfulness of his going to a Papistical land could not displace for long mister and missus Clare s natural interest in their son s marriage We had your brief note three weeks ago announcing that it had taken place said missus Clare and your father sent your godmother s gift to her as you know Of course it was best that none of us should be present especially as you preferred to marry her from the dairy and not at her home wherever that may be It would have embarrassed you and given us no pleasure Your bothers felt that very strongly Now it is done we do not complain particularly if she suits you for the business you have chosen to follow instead of the ministry of the Gospel Yet I wish I could have seen her first Angel or have known a little more about her We sent her no present of our own not knowing what would best give her pleasure but you must suppose it only delayed Angel there is no irritation in my mind or your father s against you for this marriage but we have thought it much better to reserve our liking for your wife till we could see her And now you have not brought her It seems strange What has happened He replied that it had been thought best by them that she should to go her parents home for the present whilst he came there I don t mind telling you dear mother he said that I always meant to keep her away from this house till I should feel she could come with credit to you But this idea of Brazil is quite a recent one If I do go it will be unadvisable for me to take her on this my first journey She will remain at her mother s till I come back And I shall not see her before you start He was afraid they would not His original plan had been as he had said to refrain from bringing her there for some little while not to wound their prejudices feelings in any way and for other reasons he had adhered to it He would have to visit home in the course of a year if he went out at once and it would be possible for them to see her before he started a second time with her A hastily prepared supper was brought in and Clare made further exposition of his plans His mother s disappointment at not seeing the bride still remained with her Clare s late enthusiasm for Tess had infected her through her maternal sympathies till she had almost fancied that a good thing could come out of Nazareth a charming woman out of Talbothays Dairy She watched her son as he ate Cannot you describe her I am sure she is very pretty Angel Of that there can be no question he said with a zest which covered its bitterness And that she is pure and virtuous goes without question Pure and virtuous of course she is I can see her quite distinctly You said the other day that she was fine in figure roundly built had deep red lips like Cupid s bow dark eyelashes and brows an immense rope of hair like a ship s cable and large eyes violety bluey blackish I did mother I quite see her And living in such seclusion she naturally had scarce ever seen any young man from the world without till she saw you Scarcely You were her first love Of course There are worse wives than these simple rosy mouthed robust girls of the farm Certainly I could have wished well since my son is to be an agriculturist it is perhaps but proper that his wife should have been accustomed to an outdoor life His father was less inquisitive but when the time came for the chapter from the Bible which was always read before evening prayers the Vicar observed to missus Clare I think since Angel has come that it will be more appropriate to read the thirty first of Proverbs than the chapter which we should have had in the usual course of our reading Yes certainly said missus Clare The words of King Lemuel she could cite chapter and verse as well as her husband My dear son your father has decided to read us the chapter in Proverbs in praise of a virtuous wife We shall not need to be reminded to apply the words to the absent one May Heaven shield her in all her ways A lump rose in Clare s throat The portable lectern was taken out from the corner and set in the middle of the fireplace the two old servants came in and Angel s father began to read at the tenth verse of the aforesaid chapter Who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies She riseth while it is yet night and giveth meat to her household She girdeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms She perceiveth that her merchandise is good her candle goeth not out by night She looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness Her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her Many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all When prayers were over his mother said I could not help thinking how very aptly that chapter your dear father read applied in some of its particulars to the woman you have chosen The perfect woman you see was a working woman not an idler not a fine lady but one who used her hands and her head and her heart for the good of others Her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her Many daughters have done virtuously but she excelleth them all Well I wish I could have seen her Angel Since she is pure and chaste she would have been refined enough for me Clare could bear this no longer His eyes were full of tears which seemed like drops of molten lead He bade a quick good night to these sincere and simple souls whom he loved so well who knew neither the world the flesh nor the devil in their own hearts only as something vague and external to themselves He went to his own chamber His mother followed him and tapped at his door Clare opened it to discover her standing without with anxious eyes Angel she asked is there something wrong that you go away so soon I am quite sure you are not yourself I am not quite mother said he About her Now my son I know it is that I know it is about her Have you quarrelled in these three weeks We have not exactly quarrelled he said But we have had a difference Angel is she a young woman whose history will bear investigation With a mother s instinct missus Clare had put her finger on the kind of trouble that would cause such a disquiet as seemed to agitate her son She is spotless he replied and felt that if it had sent him to eternal hell there and then he would have told that lie Then never mind the rest After all there are few purer things in nature then an unsullied country maid Any crudeness of manner which may offend your more educated sense at first will I am sure disappear under the influence or your companionship and tuition Such terrible sarcasm of blind magnanimity brought home to Clare the secondary perception that he had utterly wrecked his career by this marriage which had not been among his early thoughts after the disclosure True on his own account he cared very little about his career but he had wished to make it at least a respectable one on account of his parents and brothers And now as he looked into the candle its flame dumbly expressed to him that it was made to shine on sensible people and that it abhorred lighting the face of a dupe and a failure When his agitation had cooled he would be at moments incensed with his poor wife for causing a situation in which he was obliged to practise deception on his parents He almost talked to her in his anger as if she had been in the room And then her cooing voice plaintive in expostulation disturbed the darkness the velvet touch of her lips passed over his brow and he could distinguish in the air the warmth of her breath This night the woman of his belittling deprecations was thinking how great and good her husband was But over them both there hung a deeper shade than the shade which Angel Clare perceived namely the shade of his own limitations With all his attempted independence of judgement this advanced and well meaning young man a sample product of the last five and twenty years was yet the slave to custom and conventionality when surprised back into his early teachings No prophet had told him and he was not prophet enough to tell himself that essentially this young wife of his was as deserving of the praise of King Lemuel as any other woman endowed with the same dislike of evil her moral value having to be reckoned not by achievement but by tendency Moreover the figure near at hand suffers on such occasion because it shows up its sorriness without shade while vague figures afar off are honoured in that their distance makes artistic virtues of their stains In considering what Tess was not he overlooked what she was and forgot that the defective can be more than the entire XL At breakfast Brazil was the topic and all endeavoured to take a hopeful view of Clare s proposed experiment with that country s soil notwithstanding the discouraging reports of some farm labourers who had emigrated thither and returned home within the twelve months After breakfast Clare went into the little town to wind up such trifling matters as he was concerned with there and to get from the local bank all the money he possessed On his way back he encountered Miss Mercy Chant by the church from whose walls she seemed to be a sort of emanation She was carrying an armful of Bibles for her class and such was her view of life that events which produced heartache in others wrought beatific smiles upon her an enviable result although in the opinion of Angel it was obtained by a curiously unnatural sacrifice of humanity to mysticism She had learnt that he was about to leave England and observed what an excellent and promising scheme it seemed to be Yes it is a likely scheme enough in a commercial sense no doubt he replied But my dear Mercy it snaps the continuity of existence Perhaps a cloister would be preferable A cloister O Angel Clare Well Why you wicked man a cloister implies a monk and a monk Roman Catholicism And Roman Catholicism sin and sin damnation Thou art in a parlous state Angel Clare I glory in my Protestantism she said severely Then Clare thrown by sheer misery into one of the demoniacal moods in which a man does despite to his true principles called her close to him and fiendishly whispered in her ear the most heterodox ideas he could think of His momentary laughter at the horror which appeared on her fair face ceased when it merged in pain and anxiety for his welfare Dear Mercy he said you must forgive me I think I am going crazy She thought that he was and thus the interview ended and Clare re entered the Vicarage With the local banker he deposited the jewels till happier days should arise He also paid into the bank thirty pounds to be sent to Tess in a few months as she might require and wrote to her at her parents home in Blackmoor Vale to inform her of what he had done This amount with the sum he had already placed in her hands about fifty pounds he hoped would be amply sufficient for her wants just at present particularly as in an emergency she had been directed to apply to his father He deemed it best not to put his parents into communication with her by informing them of her address and being unaware of what had really happened to estrange the two neither his father nor his mother suggested that he should do so During the day he left the parsonage for what he had to complete he wished to get done quickly As the last duty before leaving this part of England it was necessary for him to call at the Wellbridge farmhouse in which he had spent with Tess the first three days of their marriage the trifle of rent having to be paid the key given up of the rooms they had occupied and two or three small articles fetched away that they had left behind It was under this roof that the deepest shadow ever thrown upon his life had stretched its gloom over him Yet when he had unlocked the door of the sitting room and looked into it the memory which returned first upon him was that of their happy arrival on a similar afternoon the first fresh sense of sharing a habitation conjointly the first meal together the chatting by the fire with joined hands The farmer and his wife were in the field at the moment of his visit and Clare was in the rooms alone for some time Inwardly swollen with a renewal of sentiment that he had not quite reckoned with he went upstairs to her chamber which had never been his The bed was smooth as she had made it with her own hands on the morning of leaving The mistletoe hung under the tester just as he had placed it Having been there three or four weeks it was turning colour and the leaves and berries were wrinkled Angel took it down and crushed it into the grate Standing there he for the first time doubted whether his course in this conjecture had been a wise much less a generous one But had he not been cruelly blinded In the incoherent multitude of his emotions he knelt down at the bedside wet eyed O Tess If you had only told me sooner I would have forgiven you he mourned Hearing a footstep below he rose and went to the top of the stairs At the bottom of the flight he saw a woman standing and on her turning up her face recognized the pale dark eyed Izz Huett mister Clare she said I ve called to see you and missus Clare and to inquire if ye be well I thought you might be back here again This was a girl whose secret he had guessed but who had not yet guessed his an honest girl who loved him one who would have made as good or nearly as good a practical farmer s wife as Tess I am here alone he said we are not living here now Explaining why he had come he asked Which way are you going home Izz I have no home at Talbothays Dairy now sir she said Why is that Izz looked down It was so dismal there that I left I am staying out this way She pointed in a contrary direction the direction in which he was journeying Well are you going there now I can take you if you wish for a lift Her olive complexion grew richer in hue Thank ee mister Clare she said He soon found the farmer and settled the account for his rent and the few other items which had to be considered by reason of the sudden abandonment of the lodgings On Clare s return to his horse and gig Izz jumped up beside him I am going to leave England Izz he said as they drove on Going to Brazil And do missus Clare like the notion of such a journey she asked She is not going at present say for a year or so I am going out to reconnoitre to see what life there is like They sped along eastward for some considerable distance Izz making no observation How are the others he inquired How is Retty She was in a sort of nervous state when I zid her last and so thin and hollow cheeked that a do seem in a decline Nobody will ever fall in love wi her any more said Izz absently And Marian Izz lowered her voice Marian drinks Indeed Yes The dairyman has got rid of her And you I don t drink and I bain t in a decline But I am no great things at singing afore breakfast now How is that Do you remember how neatly you used to turn Twas down in Cupid s Gardens and The Tailor s Breeches at morning milking Ah yes When you first came sir that was Not when you had been there a bit Why was that falling off Her black eyes flashed up to his face for one moment by way of answer Izz how weak of you for such as I he said and fell into reverie Then suppose I had asked YOU to marry me If you had I should have said Yes and you would have married a woman who loved ee Really Down to the ground she whispered vehemently O my God did you never guess it till now By and by they reached a branch road to a village I must get down I live out there said Izz abruptly never having spoken since her avowal Clare slowed the horse He was incensed against his fate bitterly disposed towards social ordinances for they had cooped him up in a corner out of which there was no legitimate pathway Why not be revenged on society by shaping his future domesticities loosely instead of kissing the pedagogic rod of convention in this ensnaring manner I am going to Brazil alone Izz said he I have separated from my wife for personal not voyaging reasons I may never live with her again I may not be able to love you but will you go with me instead of her You truly wish me to go I do I have been badly used enough to wish for relief And you at least love me disinterestedly Yes I will go said Izz after a pause You will You know what it means Izz It means that I shall live with you for the time you are over there that s good enough for me Remember you are not to trust me in morals now But I ought to remind you that it will be wrong doing in the eyes of civilization Western civilization that is to say I don t mind that no woman do when it comes to agony point and there s no other way Then don t get down but sit where you are He drove past the cross roads one mile two miles without showing any signs of affection You love me very very much Izz he suddenly asked I do I have said I do I loved you all the time we was at the dairy together More than Tess She shook her head No she murmured not more than she How s that Because nobody could love ee more than Tess did She would have laid down her life for ee I could do no more Like the prophet on the top of Peor Izz Huett would fain have spoken perversely at such a moment but the fascination exercised over her rougher nature by Tess s character compelled her to grace Clare was silent his heart had risen at these straightforward words from such an unexpected unimpeachable quarter In his throat was something as if a sob had solidified there His ears repeated SHE WOULD HAVE LAID DOWN HER LIFE FOR EE I COULD DO NO MORE Forget our idle talk Izz he said turning the horse s head suddenly I don t know what I ve been saying I will now drive you back to where your lane branches off So much for honesty towards ee O how can I bear it how can I how can I Izz Huett burst into wild tears and beat her forehead as she saw what she had done Do you regret that poor little act of justice to an absent one O Izz don t spoil it by regret She stilled herself by degrees Very well sir Perhaps I didn t know what I was saying either wh when I agreed to go I wish what cannot be Because I have a loving wife already Yes yes You have They reached the corner of the lane which they had passed half an hour earlier and she hopped down Izz please please forget my momentary levity he cried It was so ill considered so ill advised Forget it Never never O it was no levity to me He felt how richly he deserved the reproach that the wounded cry conveyed and in a sorrow that was inexpressible leapt down and took her hand Well but Izz we ll part friends anyhow You don t know what I ve had to bear She was a really generous girl and allowed no further bitterness to mar their adieux I forgive ee sir she said Now Izz he said while she stood beside him there forcing himself to the mentor s part he was far from feeling I want you to tell Marian when you see her that she is to be a good woman and not to give way to folly Promise that and tell Retty that there are more worthy men than I in the world that for my sake she is to act wisely and well remember the words wisely and well for my sake I send this message to them as a dying man to the dying for I shall never see them again And you Izzy you have saved me by your honest words about my wife from an incredible impulse towards folly and treachery Women may be bad but they are not so bad as men in these things On that one account I can never forget you Be always the good and sincere girl you have hitherto been and think of me as a worthless lover but a faithful friend Promise She gave the promise Heaven bless and keep you sir Goodbye He drove on but no sooner had Izz turned into the lane and Clare was out of sight than she flung herself down on the bank in a fit of racking anguish and it was with a strained unnatural face that she entered her mother s cottage late that night Nobody ever was told how Izz spent the dark hours that intervened between Angel Clare s parting from her and her arrival home Clare too after bidding the girl farewell was wrought to aching thoughts and quivering lips But his sorrow was not for Izz That evening he was within a feather weight s turn of abandoning his road to the nearest station and driving across that elevated dorsal line of South Wessex which divided him from his Tess s home It was neither a contempt for her nature nor the probable state of her heart which deterred him No it was a sense that despite her love as corroborated by Izz s admission the facts had not changed If he was right at first he was right now And the momentum of the course on which he had embarked tended to keep him going in it unless diverted by a stronger more sustained force than had played upon him this afternoon He could soon come back to her He took the train that night for London and five days after shook hands in farewell of his brothers at the port of embarkation XLI From the foregoing events of the winter time let us press on to an October day more than eight months subsequent to the parting of Clare and Tess We discover the latter in changed conditions instead of a bride with boxes and trunks which others bore we see her a lonely woman with a basket and a bundle in her own porterage as at an earlier time when she was no bride instead of the ample means that were projected by her husband for her comfort through this probationary period she can produce only a flattened purse After again leaving Marlott her home she had got through the spring and summer without any great stress upon her physical powers the time being mainly spent in rendering light irregular service at dairy work near Port Bredy to the west of the Blackmoor Valley equally remote from her native place and from Talbothays She preferred this to living on his allowance Mentally she remained in utter stagnation a condition which the mechanical occupation rather fostered than checked Her consciousness was at that other dairy at that other season in the presence of the tender lover who had confronted her there he who the moment she had grasped him to keep for her own had disappeared like a shape in a vision The dairy work lasted only till the milk began to lessen for she had not met with a second regular engagement as at Talbothays but had done duty as a supernumerary only However as harvest was now beginning she had simply to remove from the pasture to the stubble to find plenty of further occupation and this continued till harvest was done Of the five and twenty pounds which had remained to her of Clare s allowance after deducting the other half of the fifty as a contribution to her parents for the trouble and expense to which she had put them she had as yet spent but little But there now followed an unfortunate interval of wet weather during which she was obliged to fall back upon her sovereigns She could not bear to let them go Angel had put them into her hand had obtained them bright and new from his bank for her his touch had consecrated them to souvenirs of himself they appeared to have had as yet no other history than such as was created by his and her own experiences and to disperse them was like giving away relics But she had to do it and one by one they left her hands She had been compelled to send her mother her address from time to time but she concealed her circumstances When her money had almost gone a letter from her mother reached her Joan stated that they were in dreadful difficulty the autumn rains had gone through the thatch of the house which required entire renewal but this could not be done because the previous thatching had never been paid for New rafters and a new ceiling upstairs also were required which with the previous bill would amount to a sum of twenty pounds As her husband was a man of means and had doubtless returned by this time could she not send them the money Tess had thirty pounds coming to her almost immediately from Angel s bankers and the case being so deplorable as soon as the sum was received she sent the twenty as requested Part of the remainder she was obliged to expend in winter clothing leaving only a nominal sum for the whole inclement season at hand When the last pound had gone a remark of Angel s that whenever she required further resources she was to apply to his father remained to be considered But the more Tess thought of the step the more reluctant was she to take it The same delicacy pride false shame whatever it may be called on Clare s account which had led her to hide from her own parents the prolongation of the estrangement hindered her owning to his that she was in want after the fair allowance he had left her They probably despised her already how much more they would despise her in the character of a mendicant The consequence was that by no effort could the parson s daughter in law bring herself to let him know her state Her reluctance to communicate with her husband s parents might she thought lessen with the lapse of time but with her own the reverse obtained On her leaving their house after the short visit subsequent to her marriage they were under the impression that she was ultimately going to join her husband and from that time to the present she had done nothing to disturb their belief that she was awaiting his return in comfort hoping against hope that his journey to Brazil would result in a short stay only after which he would come to fetch her or that he would write for her to join him in any case that they would soon present a united front to their families and the world This hope she still fostered To let her parents know that she was a deserted wife dependent now that she had relieved their necessities on her own hands for a living after the eclat of a marriage which was to nullify the collapse of the first attempt would be too much indeed The set of brilliants returned to her mind Where Clare had deposited them she did not know and it mattered little if it were true that she could only use and not sell them Even were they absolutely hers it would be passing mean to enrich herself by a legal title to them which was not essentially hers at all Meanwhile her husband s days had been by no means free from trial At this moment he was lying ill of fever in the clay lands near Curitiba in Brazil having been drenched with thunder storms and persecuted by other hardships in common with all the English farmers and farm labourers who just at this time were deluded into going thither by the promises of the Brazilian Government and by the baseless assumption that those frames which ploughing and sowing on English uplands had resisted all the weathers to whose moods they had been born could resist equally well all the weathers by which they were surprised on Brazilian plains To return Thus it happened that when the last of Tess s sovereigns had been spent she was unprovided with others to take their place while on account of the season she found it increasingly difficult to get employment Not being aware of the rarity of intelligence energy health and willingness in any sphere of life she refrained from seeking an indoor occupation fearing towns large houses people of means and social sophistication and of manners other than rural From that direction of gentility Black Care had come Society might be better than she supposed from her slight experience of it But she had no proof of this and her instinct in the circumstances was to avoid its purlieus The small dairies to the west beyond Port Bredy in which she had served as supernumerary milkmaid during the spring and summer required no further aid Room would probably have been made for her at Talbothays if only out of sheer compassion but comfortable as her life had been there she could not go back The anti climax would be too intolerable and her return might bring reproach upon her idolized husband She could not have borne their pity and their whispered remarks to one another upon her strange situation though she would almost have faced a knowledge of her circumstances by every individual there so long as her story had remained isolated in the mind of each It was the interchange of ideas about her that made her sensitiveness wince Tess could not account for this distinction she simply knew that she felt it She was now on her way to an upland farm in the centre of the county to which she had been recommended by a wandering letter which had reached her from Marian Marian had somehow heard that Tess was separated from her husband probably through Izz Huett and the good natured and now tippling girl deeming Tess in trouble had hastened to notify to her former friend that she herself had gone to this upland spot after leaving the dairy and would like to see her there where there was room for other hands if it was really true that she worked again as of old With the shortening of the days all hope of obtaining her husband s forgiveness began to leave her and there was something of the habitude of the wild animal in the unreflecting instinct with which she rambled on disconnecting herself by littles from her eventful past at every step obliterating her identity giving no thought to accidents or contingencies which might make a quick discovery of her whereabouts by others of importance to her own happiness if not to theirs Among the difficulties of her lonely position not the least was the attention she excited by her appearance a certain bearing of distinction which she had caught from Clare being superadded to her natural attractiveness Whilst the clothes lasted which had been prepared for her marriage these casual glances of interest caused her no inconvenience but as soon as she was compelled to don the wrapper of a fieldwoman rude words were addressed to her more than once but nothing occurred to cause her bodily fear till a particular November afternoon She had preferred the country west of the River Brit to the upland farm for which she was now bound because for one thing it was nearer to the home of her husband s father and to hover about that region unrecognized with the notion that she might decide to call at the Vicarage some day gave her pleasure But having once decided to try the higher and drier levels she pressed back eastward marching afoot towards the village of Chalk Newton where she meant to pass the night The lane was long and unvaried and owing to the rapid shortening of the days dusk came upon her before she was aware She had reached the top of a hill down which the lane stretched its serpentine length in glimpses when she heard footsteps behind her back and in a few moments she was overtaken by a man He stepped up alongside Tess and said Good night my pretty maid to which she civilly replied The light still remaining in the sky lit up her face though the landscape was nearly dark The man turned and stared hard at her Why surely it is the young wench who was at Trantridge awhile young Squire d Urberville s friend I was there at that time though I don t live there now She recognized in him the well to do boor whom Angel had knocked down at the inn for addressing her coarsely A spasm of anguish shot through her and she returned him no answer Be honest enough to own it and that what I said in the town was true though your fancy man was so up about it hey my sly one You ought to beg my pardon for that blow of his considering Still no answer came from Tess There seemed only one escape for her hunted soul She suddenly took to her heels with the speed of the wind and without looking behind her ran along the road till she came to a gate which opened directly into a plantation Into this she plunged and did not pause till she was deep enough in its shade to be safe against any possibility of discovery Under foot the leaves were dry and the foliage of some holly bushes which grew among the deciduous trees was dense enough to keep off draughts She scraped together the dead leaves till she had formed them into a large heap making a sort of nest in the middle Into this Tess crept Such sleep as she got was naturally fitful she fancied she heard strange noises but persuaded herself that they were caused by the breeze She thought of her husband in some vague warm clime on the other side of the globe while she was here in the cold Was there another such a wretched being as she in the world Tess asked herself and thinking of her wasted life said All is vanity She repeated the words mechanically till she reflected that this was a most inadequate thought for modern days Solomon had thought as far as that more than two thousand years ago she herself though not in the van of thinkers had got much further If all were only vanity who would mind it All was alas worse than vanity injustice punishment exaction death The wife of Angel Clare put her hand to her brow and felt its curve and the edges of her eye sockets perceptible under the soft skin and thought as she did so that a time would come when that bone would be bare I wish it were now she said In the midst of these whimsical fancies she heard a new strange sound among the leaves It might be the wind yet there was scarcely any wind Sometimes it was a palpitation sometimes a flutter sometimes it was a sort of gasp or gurgle Soon she was certain that the noises came from wild creatures of some kind the more so when originating in the boughs overhead they were followed by the fall of a heavy body upon the ground Had she been ensconced here under other and more pleasant conditions she would have become alarmed but outside humanity she had at present no fear Day at length broke in the sky When it had been day aloft for some little while it became day in the wood Directly the assuring and prosaic light of the world s active hours had grown strong she crept from under her hillock of leaves and looked around boldly Then she perceived what had been going on to disturb her The plantation wherein she had taken shelter ran down at this spot into a peak which ended it hitherward outside the hedge being arable ground Under the trees several pheasants lay about their rich plumage dabbled with blood some were dead some feebly twitching a wing some staring up at the sky some pulsating quickly some contorted some stretched out all of them writhing in agony except the fortunate ones whose tortures had ended during the night by the inability of nature to bear more Tess guessed at once the meaning of this The birds had been driven down into this corner the day before by some shooting party and while those that had dropped dead under the shot or had died before nightfall had been searched for and carried off many badly wounded birds had escaped and hidden themselves away or risen among the thick boughs where they had maintained their position till they grew weaker with loss of blood in the night time when they had fallen one by one as she had heard them She had occasionally caught glimpses of these men in girlhood looking over hedges or peeping through bushes and pointing their guns strangely accoutred a bloodthirsty light in their eyes She had been told that rough and brutal as they seemed just then they were not like this all the year round but were in fact quite civil persons save during certain weeks of autumn and winter when like the inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula they ran amuck and made it their purpose to destroy life in this case harmless feathered creatures brought into being by artificial means solely to gratify these propensities at once so unmannerly and so unchivalrous towards their weaker fellows in Nature s teeming family With the impulse of a soul who could feel for kindred sufferers as much as for herself Tess s first thought was to put the still living birds out of their torture and to this end with her own hands she broke the necks of as many as she could find leaving them to lie where she had found them till the game keepers should come as they probably would come to look for them a second time Poor darlings to suppose myself the most miserable being on earth in the sight o such misery as yours she exclaimed her tears running down as she killed the birds tenderly And not a twinge of bodily pain about me I be not mangled and I be not bleeding and I have two hands to feed and clothe me She was ashamed of herself for her gloom of the night based on nothing more tangible than a sense of condemnation under an arbitrary law of society which had no foundation in Nature XLII It was now broad day and she started again emerging cautiously upon the highway But there was no need for caution not a soul was at hand and Tess went onward with fortitude her recollection of the birds silent endurance of their night of agony impressing upon her the relativity of sorrows and the tolerable nature of her own if she could once rise high enough to despise opinion But that she could not do so long as it was held by Clare She reached Chalk Newton and breakfasted at an inn where several young men were troublesomely complimentary to her good looks Somehow she felt hopeful for was it not possible that her husband also might say these same things to her even yet She was bound to take care of herself on the chance of it and keep off these casual lovers

4712-93896-0003	train-other-500	What a mommet of a maid said the next man who met her to a companion Tears came into her eyes for very pity of herself as she heard him But I don t care she said O no I don t care
4712-93896-0004	train-other-500	I ll always be ugly now because Angel is not here and I have nobody to take care of me My husband that was is gone away and never will love me any more but I love him just the same and hate all other men and like to make em think scornfully of me
4712-93896-0005	train-other-500	Thus Tess walks on a figure which is part of the landscape a fieldwoman pure and simple in winter guise a gray serge cape a red woollen cravat a stuff skirt covered by a whitey brown rough wrapper
4712-93896-0006	train-other-500	and buff leather gloves Every thread of that old attire has become faded and thin under the stroke of raindrops the burn of sunbeams and the stress of winds There is no sign of young passion in her now The maiden s mouth is cold
4712-93896-0007	train-other-500	Fold over simple fold Binding her head Inside this exterior over which the eye might have roved as over a thing scarcely percipient almost inorganic there was the record of a pulsing life which had learnt too well
4712-93896-0008	train-other-500	for its years of the dust and ashes of things of the cruelty of lust and the fragility of love Next day the weather was bad but she trudged on the honesty directness and impartiality of elemental
none	none	 enmity disconcerting her but little Her object being a winter s occupation and a winter s home there was no time to lose 
4712-93896-0009	train-other-500	Her experience of short hirings had been such that she was determined to accept no more Thus she went forward from farm to farm in the direction of the place whence Marian had written to her which she determined to make use of as a last shift only
4712-93896-0010	train-other-500	its rumoured stringencies being the reverse of tempting
none	none	 First she inquired for the lighter kinds of employment 
4712-93896-0011	train-other-500	and as acceptance in any variety of these grew hopeless applied next for the less light till
none	none	 beginning with the dairy and poultry tendance that she liked best 
4712-93896-0012	train-other-500	she ended with the heavy and course pursuits which she liked least work on arable land work of such roughness indeed as she would never have deliberately voluteered for
4712-93896-0013	train-other-500	Towards the second evening she reached the irregular chalk table land or plateau bosomed with semi globular tumuli
none	none	 as if Cybele 
4712-93896-0014	train-other-500	the Many breasted were supinely extended there which stretched between the valley of her birth and the valley of her love Here the air was dry and cold and the long cart roads were blown white and dusty within a few hours after rain
4712-93896-0015	train-other-500	There were few trees or none those that would have grown in the hedges being mercilessly plashed down with the quickset by the tenant farmers the natural enemies of tree bush and brake In the middle distance ahead of her
none	none	 she could see the summits of Bulbarrow and of Nettlecombe Tout 
4712-93896-0016	train-other-500	and they seemed friendly They had a low and unassuming aspect from this upland though as approached on the other side from Blackmoor in her childhood
none	none	 they were as lofty bastions against the sky 
4712-93896-0017	train-other-500	Southerly at many miles distance and over the hills and ridges coastward
none	none	 she could discern a surface like polished steel it was the English Channel at a point far out towards France 
4712-93896-0018	train-other-500	Before her in a slight depression were the remains of a village
none	none	 She had in fact reached Flintcomb Ash the place of Marian s sojourn 
4712-93896-0019	train-other-500	There seemed to be no help for it hither she was doomed to come The stubborn soil around her showed plainly enough that the kind of labour in demand here was of the roughest kind but it was time to rest from searching
none	none	 and she resolved to stay particularly as it began to rain At the entrance to the village was a cottage whose gable jutted into the road 
4712-93896-0020	train-other-500	and before applying for a lodging she stood under its shelter and watched the evening close in Who would think I was missus Angel Clare she said The wall felt warm to her back and shoulders
4712-93896-0021	train-other-500	and she found that immediately within the gable
none	none	 was the cottage fireplace the heat of which came through the bricks She warmed her hands upon them and also put her cheek 
4712-93896-0022	train-other-500	red and moist with the drizzle against their comforting surface The wall seemed to be the only friend she had She had so little wish to leave it that she could have stayed there all night Tess could hear the occupants of the cottage
4712-93896-0023	train-other-500	gathered together after their day s labour talking to each other within and the rattle of their supper plates was also audible But in the village street she had seen no soul as yet The solitude was at last broken by the approach of one feminine figure who
4712-93896-0024	train-other-500	though the evening was cold wore the print gown and the tilt bonnet of summer time Tess instinctively thought it might be Marian and when she came near enough to be distinguishable in the gloom surely enough it was she Marian was even stouter and redder in the face than formerly
4712-93896-0025	train-other-500	and decidedly shabbier in attire At any previous period of her existence Tess would hardly have cared to renew the acquaintance in such conditions but her loneliness was excessive and she responded readily to Marian s greeting
4712-93896-0026	train-other-500	Marian was quite respectful in her inquiries
none	none	 but seemed much moved by the fact that Tess should still continue in no better condition than at first though she had dimly heard of the separation 
4712-93896-0027	train-other-500	Tess missus Clare the dear wife of dear he And is it really so bad as this my child Why is your cwomely face tied up in such a way Anybody been beating ee Not HE No no no
4712-93896-0028	train-other-500	I merely did it not to be clipsed or colled Marian She pulled off in disgust a bandage which could suggest such wild thoughts And you ve got no collar on Tess had been accustomed to wear a little white collar at the dairy
4712-93896-0029	train-other-500	I know it Marian You ve lost it travelling I ve not lost it The truth is I don t care anything about my looks and so I didn t put it on And you don t wear your wedding ring Yes I do but not in public
none	none	 I wear it round my neck on a ribbon I don t wish people to think who I am by marriage or that I am married at all it would be so awkward while I lead my present life 
4712-93896-0030	train-other-500	Marian paused But you BE a gentleman s wife and it seems hardly fair that you should live like this
none	none	 O yes it is quite fair 
4712-93896-0031	train-other-500	though I am very unhappy Well well HE married you and you can be unhappy Wives are unhappy sometimes from no fault of their husbands from their own
4712-93896-0032	train-other-500	You ve no faults deary that I m sure of And he s none
none	none	 So it must be something outside ye both 
4712-93896-0033	train-other-500	Marian dear Marian will you do me a good turn without asking questions
none	none	 My husband has gone abroad and somehow I have overrun my allowance so that I have to fall back upon my old work for a time Do not call me missus Clare but Tess as before Do they want a hand here 
4712-93896-0034	train-other-500	O yes they ll take one always because few care to come Tis a starve acre place Corn and swedes are all they grow Though I be here myself I feel tis a pity for such as you to come
4712-93896-0035	train-other-500	But you used to be as good a dairywoman as I Yes but I ve got out o that since I took to drink
none	none	 Lord that s the only comfort I ve got now 
4712-93896-0036	train-other-500	If you engage you ll be set swede hacking That s what I be doing but you won t like it O anything Will you speak for me You will do better by speaking for yourself Very well Now Marian remember
4712-93896-0037	train-other-500	nothing about HIM if I get the place
none	none	 I don t wish to bring his name down to the dirt 
4712-93896-0038	train-other-500	Marian who was really a trustworthy girl though of coarser grain than Tess promised anything she asked This is pay night she said and if you were to come with me you would know at once
4712-93896-0039	train-other-500	I be real sorry that you are not happy but tis because he s away I know You couldn t be unhappy if he were here even if he gie d ye no money even if he used you like a drudge That s true I could not
4712-93896-0040	train-other-500	They walked on together and soon reached the farmhouse which was almost sublime in its dreariness
none	none	 There was not a tree within sight there was not at this season a green pasture 
4712-93896-0041	train-other-500	nothing but fallow and turnips everywhere in large fields divided by hedges plashed to unrelieved levels
none	none	 Tess waited outside the door of the farmhouse till the group of workfolk had received their wages and then Marian introduced her The farmer himself it appeared was not at home but his wife who represented him this evening made no objection to hiring Tess on her agreeing to remain till Old Lady Day Female field labour was seldom offered now and its cheapness made it profitable for tasks which women could perform as readily as men Having signed the agreement there was nothing more for Tess to do at present than to get a lodging and she found one in the house at whose gable wall she had warmed herself It was a poor subsistence that she had ensured but it would afford a shelter for the winter at any rate That night she wrote to inform her parents of her new address in case a letter should arrive at Marlott from her husband But she did not tell them of the sorriness of her situation it might have brought reproach upon him XLIII There was no exaggeration in Marian s definition of Flintcomb Ash farm as a starve acre place The single fat thing on the soil was Marian herself and she was an importation Of the three classes of village the village cared for by its lord the village cared for by itself and the village uncared for either by itself or by its lord in other words the village of a resident squires s tenantry the village of free or copy holders and the absentee owner s village farmed with the land this place Flintcomb Ash was the third But Tess set to work Patience that blending of moral courage with physical timidity was now no longer a minor feature in missus Angel Clare and it sustained her The swede field in which she and her companion were set hacking was a stretch of a hundred odd acres in one patch on the highest ground of the farm rising above stony lanchets or lynchets the outcrop of siliceous veins in the chalk formation composed of myriads of loose white flints in bulbous cusped and phallic shapes The upper half of each turnip had been eaten off by the live stock and it was the business of the two women to grub up the lower or earthy half of the root with a hooked fork called a hacker that it might be eaten also Every leaf of the vegetable having already been consumed the whole field was in colour a desolate drab it was a complexion without features as if a face from chin to brow should be only an expanse of skin The sky wore in another colour the same likeness a white vacuity of countenance with the lineaments gone So these two upper and nether visages confronted each other all day long the white face looking down on the brown face and the brown face looking up at the white face without anything standing between them but the two girls crawling over the surface of the former like flies Nobody came near them and their movements showed a mechanical regularity their forms standing enshrouded in Hessian wroppers sleeved brown pinafores tied behind to the bottom to keep their gowns from blowing about scant skirts revealing boots that reached high up the ankles and yellow sheepskin gloves with gauntlets The pensive character which the curtained hood lent to their bent heads would have reminded the observer of some early Italian conception of the two Marys They worked on hour after hour unconscious of the forlorn aspect they bore in the landscape not thinking of the justice or injustice of their lot Even in such a position as theirs it was possible to exist in a dream In the afternoon the rain came on again and Marian said that they need not work any more But if they did not work they would not be paid so they worked on It was so high a situation this field that the rain had no occasion to fall but raced along horizontally upon the yelling wind sticking into them like glass splinters till they were wet through Tess had not known till now what was really meant by that There are degrees of dampness and a very little is called being wet through in common talk But to stand working slowly in a field and feel the creep of rain water first in legs and shoulders then on hips and head then at back front and sides and yet to work on till the leaden light diminishes and marks that the sun is down demands a distinct modicum of stoicism even of valour Yet they did not feel the wetness so much as might be supposed They were both young and they were talking of the time when they lived and loved together at Talbothays Dairy that happy green tract of land where summer had been liberal in her gifts in substance to all emotionally to these Tess would fain not have conversed with Marian of the man who was legally if not actually her husband but the irresistible fascination of the subject betrayed her into reciprocating Marian s remarks And thus as has been said though the damp curtains of their bonnets flapped smartly into their faces and their wrappers clung about them to wearisomeness they lived all this afternoon in memories of green sunny romantic Talbothays You can see a gleam of a hill within a few miles o Froom Valley from here when tis fine said Marian Ah Can you said Tess awake to the new value of this locality So the two forces were at work here as everywhere the inherent will to enjoy and the circumstantial will against enjoyment Marian s will had a method of assisting itself by taking from her pocket as the afternoon wore on a pint bottle corked with white rag from which she invited Tess to drink Tess s unassisted power of dreaming however being enough for her sublimation at present she declined except the merest sip and then Marian took a pull from the spirits I ve got used to it she said and can t leave it off now Tis my only comfort You see I lost him you didn t and you can do without it perhaps Tess thought her loss as great as Marian s but upheld by the dignity of being Angel s wife in the letter at least she accepted Marian s differentiation Amid this scene Tess slaved in the morning frosts and in the afternoon rains When it was not swede grubbing it was swede trimming in which process they sliced off the earth and the fibres with a bill hook before storing the roots for future use At this occupation they could shelter themselves by a thatched hurdle if it rained but if it was frosty even their thick leather gloves could not prevent the frozen masses they handled from biting their fingers Still Tess hoped She had a conviction that sooner or later the magnanimity which she persisted in reckoning as a chief ingredient of Clare s character would lead him to rejoin her Marian primed to a humorous mood would discover the queer shaped flints aforesaid and shriek with laughter Tess remaining severely obtuse They often looked across the country to where the Var or Froom was know to stretch even though they might not be able to see it and fixing their eyes on the cloaking gray mist imagined the old times they had spent out there Ah said Marian how I should like another or two of our old set to come here Then we could bring up Talbothays every day here afield and talk of he and of what nice times we had there and o the old things we used to know and make it all come back a most in seeming Marian s eyes softened and her voice grew vague as the visions returned I ll write to Izz Huett she said She s biding at home doing nothing now I know and I ll tell her we be here and ask her to come and perhaps Retty is well enough now Tess had nothing to say against the proposal and the next she heard of this plan for importing old Talbothays joys was two or three days later when Marian informed her that Izz had replied to her inquiry and had promised to come if she could There had not been such a winter for years It came on in stealthy and measured glides like the moves of a chess player One morning the few lonely trees and the thorns of the hedgerows appeared as if they had put off a vegetable for an animal integument Every twig was covered with a white nap as of fur grown from the rind during the night giving it four times its usual stoutness the whole bush or tree forming a staring sketch in white lines on the mournful gray of the sky and horizon Cobwebs revealed their presence on sheds and walls where none had ever been observed till brought out into visibility by the crystallizing atmosphere hanging like loops of white worsted from salient points of the out houses posts and gates After this season of congealed dampness came a spell of dry frost when strange birds from behind the North Pole began to arrive silently on the upland of Flintcomb Ash gaunt spectral creatures with tragical eyes eyes which had witnessed scenes of cataclysmal horror in inaccessible polar regions of a magnitude such as no human being had ever conceived in curdling temperatures that no man could endure which had beheld the crash of icebergs and the slide of snow hills by the shooting light of the Aurora been half blinded by the whirl of colossal storms and terraqueous distortions and retained the expression of feature that such scenes had engendered These nameless birds came quite near to Tess and Marian but of all they had seen which humanity would never see they brought no account The traveller s ambition to tell was not theirs and with dumb impassivity they dismissed experiences which they did not value for the immediate incidents of this homely upland the trivial movements of the two girls in disturbing the clods with their hackers so as to uncover something or other that these visitants relished as food Then one day a peculiar quality invaded the air of this open country There came a moisture which was not of rain and a cold which was not of frost It chilled the eyeballs of the twain made their brows ache penetrated to their skeletons affecting the surface of the body less than its core They knew that it meant snow and in the night the snow came Tess who continued to live at the cottage with the warm gable that cheered any lonely pedestrian who paused beside it awoke in the night and heard above the thatch noises which seemed to signify that the roof had turned itself into a gymnasium of all the winds When she lit her lamp to get up in the morning she found that the snow had blown through a chink in the casement forming a white cone of the finest powder against the inside and had also come down the chimney so that it lay sole deep upon the floor on which her shoes left tracks when she moved about Without the storm drove so fast as to create a snow mist in the kitchen but as yet it was too dark out of doors to see anything Tess knew that it was impossible to go on with the swedes and by the time she had finished breakfast beside the solitary little lamp Marian arrived to tell her that they were to join the rest of the women at reed drawing in the barn till the weather changed As soon therefore as the uniform cloak of darkness without began to turn to a disordered medley of grays they blew out the lamp wrapped themselves up in their thickest pinners tied their woollen cravats round their necks and across their chests and started for the barn The snow had followed the birds from the polar basin as a white pillar of a cloud and individual flakes could not be seen The blast smelt of icebergs arctic seas whales and white bears carrying the snow so that it licked the land but did not deepen on it They trudged onwards with slanted bodies through the flossy fields keeping as well as they could in the shelter of hedges which however acted as strainers rather than screens The air afflicted to pallor with the hoary multitudes that infested it twisted and spun them eccentrically suggesting an achromatic chaos of things But both the young women were fairly cheerful such weather on a dry upland is not in itself dispiriting Ha ha the cunning northern birds knew this was coming said Marian Depend upon t they keep just in front o t all the way from the North Star Your husband my dear is I make no doubt having scorching weather all this time Lord if he could only see his pretty wife now Not that this weather hurts your beauty at all in fact it rather does it good You mustn t talk about him to me Marian said Tess severely Well but surely you care for n Do you Instead of answering Tess with tears in her eyes impulsively faced in the direction in which she imagined South America to lie and putting up her lips blew out a passionate kiss upon the snowy wind Well well I know you do But pon my body it is a rum life for a married couple There I won t say another word Well as for the weather it won t hurt us in the wheat barn but reed drawing is fearful hard work worse than swede hacking I can stand it because I m stout but you be slimmer than I I can t think why maister should have set ee at it They reached the wheat barn and entered it One end of the long structure was full of corn the middle was where the reed drawing was carried on and there had already been placed in the reed press the evening before as many sheaves of wheat as would be sufficient for the women to draw from during the day Why here s Izz said Marian Izz it was and she came forward She had walked all the way from her mother s home on the previous afternoon and not deeming the distance so great had been belated arriving however just before the snow began and sleeping at the alehouse The farmer had agreed with her mother at market to take her on if she came to day and she had been afraid to disappoint him by delay In addition to Tess Marian and Izz there were two women from a neighbouring village two Amazonian sisters whom Tess with a start remembered as Dark Car the Queen of Spades and her junior the Queen of Diamonds those who had tried to fight with her in the midnight quarrel at Trantridge They showed no recognition of her and possibly had none for they had been under the influence of liquor on that occasion and were only temporary sojourners there as here They did all kinds of men s work by preference including well sinking hedging ditching and excavating without any sense of fatigue Noted reed drawers were they too and looked round upon the other three with some superciliousness Putting on their gloves all set to work in a row in front of the press an erection formed of two posts connected by a cross beam under which the sheaves to be drawn from were laid ears outward the beam being pegged down by pins in the uprights and lowered as the sheaves diminished The day hardened in colour the light coming in at the barndoors upwards from the snow instead of downwards from the sky The girls pulled handful after handful from the press but by reason of the presence of the strange women who were recounting scandals Marian and Izz could not at first talk of old times as they wished to do Presently they heard the muffled tread of a horse and the farmer rode up to the barndoor When he had dismounted he came close to Tess and remained looking musingly at the side of her face She had not turned at first but his fixed attitude led her to look round when she perceived that her employer was the native of Trantridge from whom she had taken flight on the high road because of his allusion to her history He waited till she had carried the drawn bundles to the pile outside when he said So you be the young woman who took my civility in such ill part Be drowned if I didn t think you might be as soon as I heard of your being hired Well you thought you had got the better of me the first time at the inn with your fancy man and the second time on the road when you bolted but now I think I ve got the better you He concluded with a hard laugh Tess between the Amazons and the farmer like a bird caught in a clap net returned no answer continuing to pull the straw She could read character sufficiently well to know by this time that she had nothing to fear from her employer s gallantry it was rather the tyranny induced by his mortification at Clare s treatment of him Upon the whole she preferred that sentiment in man and felt brave enough to endure it You thought I was in love with ee I suppose Some women are such fools to take every look as serious earnest But there s nothing like a winter afield for taking that nonsense out o young wenches heads and you ve signed and agreed till Lady Day Now are you going to beg my pardon I think you ought to beg mine Very well as you like But we ll see which is master here Be they all the sheaves you ve done to day Yes sir Tis a very poor show Just see what they ve done over there pointing to the two stalwart women The rest too have done better than you They ve all practised it before and I have not And I thought it made no difference to you as it is task work and we are only paid for what we do Oh but it does I want the barn cleared I am going to work all the afternoon instead of leaving at two as the others will do He looked sullenly at her and went away Tess felt that she could not have come to a much worse place but anything was better than gallantry When two o clock arrived the professional reed drawers tossed off the last half pint in their flagon put down their hooks tied their last sheaves and went away Marian and Izz would have done likewise but on hearing that Tess meant to stay to make up by longer hours for her lack of skill they would not leave her Looking out at the snow which still fell Marian exclaimed Now we ve got it all to ourselves And so at last the conversation turned to their old experiences at the dairy and of course the incidents of their affection for Angel Clare Izz and Marian said missus Angel Clare with a dignity which was extremely touching seeing how very little of a wife she was I can t join in talk with you now as I used to do about mister Clare you will see that I cannot because although he is gone away from me for the present he is my husband Izz was by nature the sauciest and most caustic of all the four girls who had loved Clare He was a very splendid lover no doubt she said but I don t think he is a too fond husband to go away from you so soon He had to go he was obliged to go to see about the land over there pleaded Tess He might have tided ee over the winter Ah that s owing to an accident a misunderstanding and we won t argue it Tess answered with tearfulness in her words Perhaps there s a good deal to be said for him He did not go away like some husbands without telling me and I can always find out where he is After this they continued for some long time in a reverie as they went on seizing the ears of corn drawing out the straw gathering it under their arms and cutting off the ears with their bill hooks nothing sounding in the barn but the swish of the straw and the crunch of the hook Then Tess suddenly flagged and sank down upon the heap of wheat ears at her feet I knew you wouldn t be able to stand it cried Marian It wants harder flesh than yours for this work Just then the farmer entered Oh that s how you get on when I am away he said to her But it is my own loss she pleaded Not yours I want it finished he said doggedly as he crossed the barn and went out at the other door Don t ee mind him there s a dear said Marian I ve worked here before Now you go and lie down there and Izz and I will make up your number I don t like to let you do that I m taller than you too However she was so overcome that she consented to lie down awhile and reclined on a heap of pull tails the refuse after the straight straw had been drawn thrown up at the further side of the barn Her succumbing had been as largely owning to agitation at the re opening the subject of her separation from her husband as to the hard work She lay in a state of percipience without volition and the rustle of the straw and the cutting of the ears by the others had the weight of bodily touches She could hear from her corner in addition to these noises the murmur of their voices She felt certain that they were continuing the subject already broached but their voices were so low that she could not catch the words At last Tess grew more and more anxious to know what they were saying and persuading herself that she felt better she got up and resumed work Then Izz Huett broke down She had walked more than a dozen miles the previous evening had gone to bed at midnight and had risen again at five o clock Marian alone thanks to her bottle of liquor and her stoutness of build stood the strain upon back and arms without suffering Tess urged Izz to leave off agreeing as she felt better to finish the day without her and make equal division of the number of sheaves Izz accepted the offer gratefully and disappeared through the great door into the snowy track to her lodging Marian as was the case every afternoon at this time on account of the bottle began to feel in a romantic vein I should not have thought it of him never she said in a dreamy tone And I loved him so I didn t mind his having YOU But this about Izz is too bad Tess in her start at the words narrowly missed cutting off a finger with the bill hook Is it about my husband she stammered Well yes Izz said Don t ee tell her but I am sure I can t help it It was what he wanted Izz to do He wanted her to go off to Brazil with him Tess s face faded as white as the scene without and its curves straightened And did Izz refuse to go she asked I don t know Anyhow he changed his mind Pooh then he didn t mean it Twas just a man s jest Yes he did for he drove her a good ways towards the station He didn t take her They pulled on in silence till Tess without any premonitory symptoms burst out crying There said Marian Now I wish I hadn t told ee No It is a very good thing that you have done I have been living on in a thirtover lackaday way and have not seen what it may lead to I ought to have sent him a letter oftener He said I could not go to him but he didn t say I was not to write as often as I liked I won t dally like this any longer I have been very wrong and neglectful in leaving everything to be done by him The dim light in the barn grew dimmer and they could see to work no longer When Tess had reached home that evening and had entered into the privacy of her little white washed chamber she began impetuously writing a letter to Clare But falling into doubt she could not finish it Afterwards she took the ring from the ribbon on which she wore it next her heart and retained it on her finger all night as if to fortify herself in the sensation that she was really the wife of this elusive lover of hers who could propose that Izz should go with him abroad so shortly after he had left her Knowing that how could she write entreaties to him or show that she cared for him any more XLIV By the disclosure in the barn her thoughts were led anew in the direction which they had taken more than once of late to the distant Emminster Vicarage It was through her husband s parents that she had been charged to send a letter to Clare if she desired and to write to them direct if in difficulty But that sense of her having morally no claim upon him had always led Tess to suspend her impulse to send these notes and to the family at the Vicarage therefore as to her own parents since her marriage she was virtually non existent This self effacement in both directions had been quite in consonance with her independent character of desiring nothing by way of favour or pity to which she was not entitled on a fair consideration of her deserts She had set herself to stand or fall by her qualities and to waive such merely technical claims upon a strange family as had been established for her by the flimsy fact of a member of that family in a season of impulse writing his name in a church book beside hers But now that she was stung to a fever by Izz s tale there was a limit to her powers of renunciation Why had her husband not written to her He had distinctly implied that he would at least let her know of the locality to which he had journeyed but he had not sent a line to notify his address Was he really indifferent But was he ill Was it for her to make some advance Surely she might summon the courage of solicitude call at the Vicarage for intelligence and express her grief at his silence If Angel s father were the good man she had heard him represented to be he would be able to enter into her heart starved situation Her social hardships she could conceal To leave the farm on a week day was not in her power Sunday was the only possible opportunity Flintcomb Ash being in the middle of the cretaceous tableland over which no railway had climbed as yet it would be necessary to walk And the distance being fifteen miles each way she would have to allow herself a long day for the undertaking by rising early A fortnight later when the snow had gone and had been followed by a hard black frost she took advantage of the state of the roads to try the experiment At four o clock that Sunday morning she came downstairs and stepped out into the starlight The weather was still favourable the ground ringing under her feet like an anvil Marian and Izz were much interested in her excursion knowing that the journey concerned her husband Their lodgings were in a cottage a little further along the lane but they came and assisted Tess in her departure and argued that she should dress up in her very prettiest guise to captivate the hearts of her parents in law though she knowing of the austere and Calvinistic tenets of old mister Clare was indifferent and even doubtful A year had now elapsed since her sad marriage but she had preserved sufficient draperies from the wreck of her then full wardrobe to clothe her very charmingly as a simple country girl with no pretensions to recent fashion a soft gray woollen gown with white crape quilling against the pink skin of her face and neck and a black velvet jacket and hat Tis a thousand pities your husband can t see ee now you do look a real beauty said Izz Huett regarding Tess as she stood on the threshold between the steely starlight without and the yellow candlelight within Izz spoke with a magnanimous abandonment of herself to the situation she could not be no woman with a heart bigger than a hazel nut could be antagonistic to Tess in her presence the influence which she exercised over those of her own sex being of a warmth and strength quite unusual curiously overpowering the less worthy feminine feelings of spite and rivalry With a final tug and touch here and a slight brush there they let her go and she was absorbed into the pearly air of the fore dawn They heard her footsteps tap along the hard road as she stepped out to her full pace Even Izz hoped she would win and though without any particular respect for her own virtue felt glad that she had been prevented wronging her friend when momentarily tempted by Clare It was a year ago all but a day that Clare had married Tess and only a few days less than a year that he had been absent from her Still to start on a brisk walk and on such an errand as hers on a dry clear wintry morning through the rarefied air of these chalky hogs backs was not depressing and there is no doubt that her dream at starting was to win the heart of her mother in law tell her whole history to that lady enlist her on her side and so gain back the truant In time she reached the edge of the vast escarpment below which stretched the loamy Vale of Blackmoor now lying misty and still in the dawn Instead of the colourless air of the uplands the atmosphere down there was a deep blue Instead of the great enclosures of a hundred acres in which she was now accustomed to toil there were little fields below her of less than half a dozen acres so numerous that they looked from this height like the meshes of a net Here the landscape was whitey brown down there as in Froom Valley it was always green Yet it was in that vale that her sorrow had taken shape and she did not love it as formerly Beauty to her as to all who have felt lay not in the thing but in what the thing symbolized Keeping the Vale on her right she steered steadily westward passing above the Hintocks crossing at right angles the high road from Sherton Abbas to Casterbridge and skirting Dogbury Hill and High Stoy with the dell between them called The Devil s Kitchen Still following the elevated way she reached Cross in Hand where the stone pillar stands desolate and silent to mark the site of a miracle or murder or both Three miles further she cut across the straight and deserted Roman road called Long Ash Lane leaving which as soon as she reached it she dipped down a hill by a transverse lane into the small town or village of Evershead being now about halfway over the distance She made a halt here and breakfasted a second time heartily enough not at the Sow and Acorn for she avoided inns but at a cottage by the church The second half of her journey was through a more gentle country by way of Benvill Lane But as the mileage lessened between her and the spot of her pilgrimage so did Tess s confidence decrease and her enterprise loom out more formidably She saw her purpose in such staring lines and the landscape so faintly that she was sometimes in danger of losing her way However about noon she paused by a gate on the edge of the basin in which Emminster and its Vicarage lay The square tower beneath which she knew that at that moment the Vicar and his congregation were gathered had a severe look in her eyes She wished that she had somehow contrived to come on a week day Such a good man might be prejudiced against a woman who had chosen Sunday never realizing the necessities of her case But it was incumbent upon her to go on now She took off the thick boots in which she had walked thus far put on her pretty thin ones of patent leather and stuffing the former into the hedge by the gatepost where she might readily find them again descended the hill the freshness of colour she had derived from the keen air thinning away in spite of her as she drew near the parsonage Tess hoped for some accident that might favour her but nothing favoured her The shrubs on the Vicarage lawn rustled uncomfortably in the frosty breeze she could not feel by any stretch of imagination dressed to her highest as she was that the house was the residence of near relations and yet nothing essential in nature or emotion divided her from them in pains pleasures thoughts birth death and after death they were the same She nerved herself by an effort entered the swing gate and rang the door bell The thing was done there could be no retreat No the thing was not done Nobody answered to her ringing The effort had to be risen to and made again She rang a second time and the agitation of the act coupled with her weariness after the fifteen miles walk led her to support herself while she waited by resting her hand on her hip and her elbow against the wall of the porch The wind was so nipping that the ivy leaves had become wizened and gray each tapping incessantly upon its neighbour with a disquieting stir of her nerves A piece of blood stained paper caught up from some meat buyer s dust heap beat up and down the road without the gate too flimsy to rest too heavy to fly away and a few straws kept it company The second peal had been louder and still nobody came Then she walked out of the porch opened the gate and passed through And though she looked dubiously at the house front as if inclined to return it was with a breath of relied that she closed the gate A feeling haunted her that she might have been recognized though how she could not tell and orders been given not to admit her Tess went as far as the corner She had done all she could do but determined not to escape present trepidation at the expense of future distress she walked back again quite past the house looking up at all the windows Ah the explanation was that they were all at church every one She remembered her husband saying that his father always insisted upon the household servants included going to morning service and as a consequence eating cold food when they came home It was therefore only necessary to wait till the service was over She would not make herself conspicuous by waiting on the spot and she started to get past the church into the lane But as she reached the churchyard gate the people began pouring out and Tess found herself in the midst of them The Emminster congregation looked at her as only a congregation of small country townsfolk walking home at its leisure can look at a woman out of the common whom it perceives to be a stranger She quickened her pace and ascended the road by which she had come to find a retreat between its hedges till the Vicar s family should have lunched and it might be convenient for them to receive her She soon distanced the churchgoers except two youngish men who linked arm in arm were beating up behind her at a quick step As they drew nearer she could hear their voices engaged in earnest discourse and with the natural quickness of a woman in her situation did not fail to recognize in those noises the quality of her husband s tones The pedestrians were his two brothers Forgetting all her plans Tess s one dread was lest they should overtake her now in her disorganized condition before she was prepared to confront them for though she felt that they could not identify her she instinctively dreaded their scrutiny The more briskly they walked the more briskly walked she They were plainly bent upon taking a short quick stroll before going indoors to lunch or dinner to restore warmth to limbs chilled with sitting through a long service Only one person had preceded Tess up the hill a ladylike young woman somewhat interesting though perhaps a trifle guindee and prudish Tess had nearly overtaken her when the speed of her brothers in law brought them so nearly behind her back that she could hear every word of their conversation They said nothing however which particularly interested her till observing the young lady still further in front one of them remarked There is Mercy Chant Let us overtake her Tess knew the name It was the woman who had been destined for Angel s life companion by his and her parents and whom he probably would have married but for her intrusive self She would have known as much without previous information if she had waited a moment for one of the brothers proceeded to say Ah poor Angel poor Angel I never see that nice girl without more and more regretting his precipitancy in throwing himself away upon a dairymaid or whatever she may be It is a queer business apparently Whether she has joined him yet or not I don t know but she had not done so some months ago when I heard from him I can t say He never tells me anything nowadays His ill considered marriage seems to have completed that estrangement from me which was begun by his extraordinary opinions Tess beat up the long hill still faster but she could not outwalk them without exciting notice At last they outsped her altogether and passed her by The young lady still further ahead heard their footsteps and turned Then there was a greeting and a shaking of hands and the three went on together They soon reached the summit of the hill and evidently intending this point to be the limit of their promenade slackened pace and turned all three aside to the gate whereat Tess had paused an hour before that time to reconnoitre the town before descending into it During their discourse one of the clerical brothers probed the hedge carefully with his umbrella and dragged something to light Here s a pair of old boots he said Thrown away I suppose by some tramp or other Some imposter who wished to come into the town barefoot perhaps and so excite our sympathies said Miss Chant Yes it must have been for they are excellent walking boots by no means worn out What a wicked thing to do I ll carry them home for some poor person Cuthbert Clare who had been the one to find them picked them up for her with the crook of his stick and Tess s boots were appropriated She who had heard this walked past under the screen of her woollen veil till presently looking back she perceived that the church party had left the gate with her boots and retreated down the hill Thereupon our heroine resumed her walk Tears blinding tears were running down her face She knew that it was all sentiment all baseless impressibility which had caused her to read the scene as her own condemnation nevertheless she could not get over it she could not contravene in her own defenceless person all those untoward omens It was impossible to think of returning to the Vicarage Angel s wife felt almost as if she had been hounded up that hill like a scorned thing by those to her superfine clerics Innocently as the slight had been inflicted it was somewhat unfortunate that she had encountered the sons and not the father who despite his narrowness was far less starched and ironed than they and had to the full the gift of charity As she again thought of her dusty boots she almost pitied those habiliments for the quizzing to which they had been subjected and felt how hopeless life was for their owner Ah she said still sighing in pity of herself THEY didn t know that I wore those over the roughest part of the road to save these pretty ones HE bought for me no they did not know it And they didn t think that HE chose the colour o my pretty frock no how could they If they had known perhaps they would not have cared for they don t care much for him poor thing Then she grieved for the beloved man whose conventional standard of judgement had caused her all these latter sorrows and she went her way without knowing that the greatest misfortune of her life was this feminine loss of courage at the last and critical moment through her estimating her father in law by his sons Her present condition was precisely one which would have enlisted the sympathies of old mister and missus Clare Their hearts went out of them at a bound towards extreme cases when the subtle mental troubles of the less desperate among mankind failed to win their interest or regard In jumping at Publicans and Sinners they would forget that a word might be said for the worries of Scribes and Pharisees and this defect or limitation might have recommended their own daughter in law to them at this moment as a fairly choice sort of lost person for their love Thereupon she began to plod back along the road by which she had come not altogether full of hope but full of a conviction that a crisis in her life was approaching No crisis apparently had supervened and there was nothing left for her to do but to continue upon that starve acre farm till she could again summon courage to face the Vicarage She did indeed take sufficient interest in herself to throw up her veil on this return journey as if to let the world see that she could at least exhibit a face such as Mercy Chant could not show But it was done with a sorry shake of the head It is nothing it is nothing she said Nobody loves it nobody sees it Who cares about the looks of a castaway like me Her journey back was rather a meander than a march It had no sprightliness no purpose only a tendency Along the tedious length of Benvill Lane she began to grow tired and she leant upon gates and paused by milestones She did not enter any house till at the seventh or eighth mile she descended the steep long hill below which lay the village or townlet of Evershead where in the morning she had breakfasted with such contrasting expectations The cottage by the church in which she again sat down was almost the first at that end of the village and while the woman fetched her some milk from the pantry Tess looking down the street perceived that the place seemed quite deserted The people are gone to afternoon service I suppose she said No my dear said the old woman Tis too soon for that the bells hain t strook out yet They be all gone to hear the preaching in yonder barn A ranter preaches there between the services an excellent fiery Christian man they say But Lord I don t go to hear n What comes in the regular way over the pulpit is hot enough for I Tess soon went onward into the village her footsteps echoing against the houses as though it were a place of the dead Nearing the central part her echoes were intruded on by other sounds and seeing the barn not far off the road she guessed these to be the utterances of the preacher His voice became so distinct in the still clear air that she could soon catch his sentences though she was on the closed side of the barn The sermon as might be expected was of the extremest antinomian type on justification by faith as expounded in the theology of saint Paul This fixed idea of the rhapsodist was delivered with animated enthusiasm in a manner entirely declamatory for he had plainly no skill as a dialectician Although Tess had not heard the beginning of the address she learnt what the text had been from its constant iteration O foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you Tess was all the more interested as she stood listening behind in finding that the preacher s doctrine was a vehement form of the view of Angel s father and her interest intensified when the speaker began to detail his own spiritual experiences of how he had come by those views He had he said been the greatest of sinners He had scoffed he had wantonly associated with the reckless and the lewd But a day of awakening had come and in a human sense it had been brought about mainly by the influence of a certain clergyman whom he had at first grossly insulted but whose parting words had sunk into his heart and had remained there till by the grace of Heaven they had worked this change in him and made him what they saw him But more startling to Tess than the doctrine had been the voice which impossible as it seemed was precisely that of Alec d Urberville Her face fixed in painful suspense she came round to the front of the barn and passed before it The low winter sun beamed directly upon the great double doored entrance on this side one of the doors being open so that the rays stretched far in over the threshing floor to the preacher and his audience all snugly sheltered from the northern breeze The listeners were entirely villagers among them being the man whom she had seen carrying the red paint pot on a former memorable occasion But her attention was given to the central figure who stood upon some sacks of corn facing the people and the door The three o clock sun shone full upon him and the strange enervating conviction that her seducer confronted her which had been gaining ground in Tess ever since she had heard his words distinctly was at last established as a fact indeed END OF PHASE THE FIFTH Phase the Sixth The Convert XLV Till this moment she had never seen or heard from d Urberville since her departure from Trantridge The rencounter came at a heavy moment one of all moments calculated to permit its impact with the least emotional shock But such was unreasoning memory that though he stood there openly and palpably a converted man who was sorrowing for his past irregularities a fear overcame her paralyzing her movement so that she neither retreated nor advanced To think of what emanated from that countenance when she saw it last and to behold it now There was the same handsome unpleasantness of mien but now he wore neatly trimmed old fashioned whiskers the sable moustache having disappeared and his dress was half clerical a modification which had changed his expression sufficiently to abstract the dandyism from his features and to hinder for a second her belief in his identity To Tess s sense there was just at first a ghastly bizarrerie a grim incongruity in the march of these solemn words of Scripture out of such a mouth This too familiar intonation less than four years earlier had brought to her ears expressions of such divergent purpose that her heart became quite sick at the irony of the contrast It was less a reform than a transfiguration The former curves of sensuousness were now modulated to lines of devotional passion The lip shapes that had meant seductiveness were now made to express supplication the glow on the cheek that yesterday could be translated as riotousness was evangelized to day into the splendour of pious rhetoric animalism had become fanaticism Paganism Paulinism the bold rolling eye that had flashed upon her form in the old time with such mastery now beamed with the rude energy of a theolatry that was almost ferocious Those black angularities which his face had used to put on when his wishes were thwarted now did duty in picturing the incorrigible backslider who would insist upon turning again to his wallowing in the mire The lineaments as such seemed to complain They had been diverted from their hereditary connotation to signify impressions for which Nature did not intend them Strange that their very elevation was a misapplication that to raise seemed to falsify Yet could it be so She would admit the ungenerous sentiment no longer D Urberville was not the first wicked man who had turned away from his wickedness to save his soul alive and why should she deem it unnatural in him It was but the usage of thought which had been jarred in her at hearing good new words in bad old notes The greater the sinner the greater the saint it was not necessary to dive far into Christian history to discover that Such impressions as these moved her vaguely and without strict definiteness As soon as the nerveless pause of her surprise would allow her to stir her impulse was to pass on out of his sight He had obviously not discerned her yet in her position against the sun But the moment that she moved again he recognized her The effect upon her old lover was electric far stronger than the effect of his presence upon her His fire the tumultuous ring of his eloquence seemed to go out of him His lip struggled and trembled under the words that lay upon it but deliver them it could not as long as she faced him His eyes after their first glance upon her face hung confusedly in every other direction but hers but came back in a desperate leap every few seconds This paralysis lasted however but a short time for Tess s energies returned with the atrophy of his and she walked as fast as she was able past the barn and onward As soon as she could reflect it appalled her this change in their relative platforms He who had wrought her undoing was now on the side of the Spirit while she remained unregenerate And as in the legend it had resulted that her Cyprian image had suddenly appeared upon his altar whereby the fire of the priest had been well nigh extinguished She went on without turning her head Her back seemed to be endowed with a sensitiveness to ocular beams even her clothing so alive was she to a fancied gaze which might be resting upon her from the outside of that barn All the way along to this point her heart had been heavy with an inactive sorrow now there was a change in the quality of its trouble That hunger for affection too long withheld was for the time displaced by an almost physical sense of an implacable past which still engirdled her It intensified her consciousness of error to a practical despair the break of continuity between her earlier and present existence which she had hoped for had not after all taken place Bygones would never be complete bygones till she was a bygone herself Thus absorbed she recrossed the northern part of Long Ash Lane at right angles and presently saw before her the road ascending whitely to the upland along whose margin the remainder of her journey lay Its dry pale surface stretched severely onward unbroken by a single figure vehicle or mark save some occasional brown horse droppings which dotted its cold aridity here and there While slowly breasting this ascent Tess became conscious of footsteps behind her and turning she saw approaching that well known form so strangely accoutred as the Methodist the one personage in all the world she wished not to encounter alone on this side of the grave There was not much time however for thought or elusion and she yielded as calmly as she could to the necessity of letting him overtake her She saw that he was excited less by the speed of his walk than by the feelings within him Tess he said She slackened speed without looking round Tess he repeated It is I Alec d Urberville She then looked back at him and he came up I see it is she answered coldly Well is that all Yet I deserve no more Of course he added with a slight laugh there is something of the ridiculous to your eyes in seeing me like this But I must put up with that I heard you had gone away nobody knew where Tess you wonder why I have followed you I do rather and I would that you had not with all my heart Yes you may well say it he returned grimly as they moved onward together she with unwilling tread But don t mistake me I beg this because you may have been led to do so in noticing if you did notice it how your sudden appearance unnerved me down there It was but a momentary faltering and considering what you have been to me it was natural enough But will helped me through it though perhaps you think me a humbug for saying it and immediately afterwards I felt that of all persons in the world whom it was my duty and desire to save from the wrath to come sneer if you like the woman whom I had so grievously wronged was that person I have come with that sole purpose in view nothing more There was the smallest vein of scorn in her words of rejoinder Have you saved yourself Charity begins at home they say I have done nothing said he indifferently Heaven as I have been telling my hearers has done all No amount of contempt that you can pour upon me Tess will equal what I have poured upon myself the old Adam of my former years Well it is a strange story believe it or not but I can tell you the means by which my conversion was brought about and I hope you will be interested enough at least to listen Have you ever heard the name of the parson of Emminster you must have done do old mister Clare one of the most earnest of his school one of the few intense men left in the Church not so intense as the extreme wing of Christian believers with which I have thrown in my lot but quite an exception among the Established clergy the younger of whom are gradually attenuating the true doctrines by their sophistries till they are but the shadow of what they were I only differ from him on the question of Church and State the interpretation of the text Come out from among them and be ye separate saith the Lord that s all He is one who I firmly believe has been the humble means of saving more souls in this country than any other man you can name You have heard of him I have she said He came to Trantridge two or three years ago to preach on behalf of some missionary society and I wretched fellow that I was insulted him when in his disinterestedness he tried to reason with me and show me the way He did not resent my conduct he simply said that some day I should receive the first fruits of the Spirit that those who came to scoff sometimes remained to pray There was a strange magic in his words They sank into my mind But the loss of my mother hit me most and by degrees I was brought to see daylight Since then my one desire has been to hand on the true view to others and that is what I was trying to do to day though it is only lately that I have preached hereabout The first months of my ministry have been spent in the North of England among strangers where I preferred to make my earliest clumsy attempts so as to acquire courage before undergoing that severest of all tests of one s sincerity addressing those who have known one and have been one s companions in the days of darkness If you could only know Tess the pleasure of having a good slap at yourself I am sure Don t go on with it she cried passionately as she turned away from him to a stile by the wayside on which she bent herself I can t believe in such sudden things I feel indignant with you for talking to me like this when you know when you know what harm you ve done me You and those like you take your fill of pleasure on earth by making the life of such as me bitter and black with sorrow and then it is a fine thing when you have had enough of that to think of securing your pleasure in heaven by becoming converted Out upon such I don t believe in you I hate it Tess he insisted don t speak so It came to me like a jolly new idea And you don t believe me What don t you believe Your conversion Your scheme of religion Why She dropped her voice Because a better man than you does not believe in such What a woman s reason Who is this better man I cannot tell you Well he declared a resentment beneath his words seeming ready to spring out at a moment s notice God forbid that I should say I am a good man and you know I don t say any such thing I am new to goodness truly but newcomers see furthest sometimes Yes she replied sadly But I cannot believe in your conversion to a new spirit Such flashes as you feel Alec I fear don t last Thus speaking she turned from the stile over which she had been leaning and faced him whereupon his eyes falling casually upon the familiar countenance and form remained contemplating her The inferior man was quiet in him now but it was surely not extracted nor even entirely subdued Don t look at me like that he said abruptly Tess who had been quite unconscious of her action and mien instantly withdrew the large dark gaze of her eyes stammering with a flush I beg your pardon And there was revived in her the wretched sentiment which had often come to her before that in inhabiting the fleshly tabernacle with which Nature had endowed her she was somehow doing wrong No no Don t beg my pardon But since you wear a veil to hide your good looks why don t you keep it down She pulled down the veil saying hastily It was mostly to keep off the wind It may seem harsh of me to dictate like this he went on but it is better that I should not look too often on you It might be dangerous Ssh said Tess Well women s faces have had too much power over me already for me not to fear them An evangelist has nothing to do with such as they and it reminds me of the old times that I would forget After this their conversation dwindled to a casual remark now and then as they rambled onward Tess inwardly wondering how far he was going with her and not liking to send him back by positive mandate Frequently when they came to a gate or stile they found painted thereon in red or blue letters some text of Scripture and she asked him if he knew who had been at the pains to blazon these announcements He told her that the man was employed by himself and others who were working with him in that district to paint these reminders that no means might be left untried which might move the hearts of a wicked generation At length the road touched the spot called Cross in Hand Of all spots on the bleached and desolate upland this was the most forlorn It was so far removed from the charm which is sought in landscape by artists and view lovers as to reach a new kind of beauty a negative beauty of tragic tone The place took its name from a stone pillar which stood there a strange rude monolith from a stratum unknown in any local quarry on which was roughly carved a human hand Differing accounts were given of its history and purport Some authorities stated that a devotional cross had once formed the complete erection thereon of which the present relic was but the stump others that the stone as it stood was entire and that it had been fixed there to mark a boundary or place of meeting Anyhow whatever the origin of the relic there was and is something sinister or solemn according to mood in the scene amid which it stands something tending to impress the most phlegmatic passer by I think I must leave you now he remarked as they drew near to this spot I have to preach at Abbot s Cernel at six this evening and my way lies across to the right from here And you upset me somewhat too Tessy I cannot will not say why I must go away and get strength How is it that you speak so fluently now Who has taught you such good English I have learnt things in my troubles she said evasively What troubles have you had She told him of the first one the only one that related to him D Urberville was struck mute I knew nothing of this till now he next murmured Why didn t you write to me when you felt your trouble coming on She did not reply and he broke the silence by adding Well you will see me again No she answered Do not again come near me I will think But before we part come here He stepped up to the pillar This was once a Holy Cross Relics are not in my creed but I fear you at moments far more than you need fear me at present and to lessen my fear put your hand upon that stone hand and swear that you will never tempt me by your charms or ways Good God how can you ask what is so unnecessary All that is furthest from my thought Yes but swear it Tess half frightened gave way to his importunity placed her hand upon the stone and swore I am sorry you are not a believer he continued that some unbeliever should have got hold of you and unsettled your mind But no more now At home at least I can pray for you and I will and who knows what may not happen I m off Goodbye He turned to a hunting gate in the hedge and without letting his eyes again rest upon her leapt over and struck out across the down in the direction of Abbot s Cernel As he walked his pace showed perturbation and by and by as if instigated by a former thought he drew from his pocket a small book between the leaves of which was folded a letter worn and soiled as from much re reading D Urberville opened the letter It was dated several months before this time and was signed by Parson Clare The letter began by expressing the writer s unfeigned joy at d Urberville s conversion and thanked him for his kindness in communicating with the parson on the subject It expressed mister Clare s warm assurance of forgiveness for d Urberville s former conduct and his interest in the young man s plans for the future He mister Clare would much have liked to see d Urberville in the Church to whose ministry he had devoted so many years of his own life and would have helped him to enter a theological college to that end but since his correspondent had possibly not cared to do this on account of the delay it would have entailed he was not the man to insist upon its paramount importance Every man must work as he could best work and in the method towards which he felt impelled by the Spirit D Urberville read and re read this letter and seemed to quiz himself cynically He also read some passages from memoranda as he walked till his face assumed a calm and apparently the image of Tess no longer troubled his mind She meanwhile had kept along the edge of the hill by which lay her nearest way home Within the distance of a mile she met a solitary shepherd What is the meaning of that old stone I have passed she asked of him Was it ever a Holy Cross Cross no twer not a cross Tis a thing of ill omen Miss It was put up in wuld times by the relations of a malefactor who was tortured there by nailing his hand to a post and afterwards hung The bones lie underneath They say he sold his soul to the devil and that he walks at times She felt the petite mort at this unexpectedly gruesome information and left the solitary man behind her It was dusk when she drew near to Flintcomb Ash and in the lane at the entrance to the hamlet she approached a girl and her lover without their observing her They were talking no secrets and the clear unconcerned voice of the young woman in response to the warmer accents of the man spread into the chilly air as the one soothing thing within the dusky horizon full of a stagnant obscurity upon which nothing else intruded For a moment the voices cheered the heart of Tess till she reasoned that this interview had its origin on one side or the other in the same attraction which had been the prelude to her own tribulation When she came close the girl turned serenely and recognized her the young man walking off in embarrassment The woman was Izz Huett whose interest in Tess s excursion immediately superseded her own proceedings Tess did not explain very clearly its results and Izz who was a girl of tact began to speak of her own little affair a phase of which Tess had just witnessed He is Amby Seedling the chap who used to sometimes come and help at Talbothays she explained indifferently He actually inquired and found out that I had come here and has followed me He says he s been in love wi me these two years But I ve hardly answered him XLVI Several days had passed since her futile journey and Tess was afield The dry winter wind still blew but a screen of thatched hurdles erected in the eye of the blast kept its force away from her On the sheltered side was a turnip slicing machine whose bright blue hue of new paint seemed almost vocal in the otherwise subdued scene Opposite its front was a long mound or grave in which the roots had been preserved since early winter Tess was standing at the uncovered end chopping off with a bill hook the fibres and earth from each root and throwing it after the operation into the slicer A man was turning the handle of the machine and from its trough came the newly cut swedes the fresh smell of whose yellow chips was accompanied by the sounds of the snuffling wind the smart swish of the slicing blades and the choppings of the hook in Tess s leather gloved hand The wide acreage of blank agricultural brownness apparent where the swedes had been pulled was beginning to be striped in wales of darker brown gradually broadening to ribands Along the edge of each of these something crept upon ten legs moving without haste and without rest up and down the whole length of the field it was two horses and a man the plough going between them turning up the cleared ground for a spring sowing For hours nothing relieved the joyless monotony of things Then far beyond the ploughing teams a black speck was seen It had come from the corner of a fence where there was a gap and its tendency was up the incline towards the swede cutters From the proportions of a mere point it advanced to the shape of a ninepin and was soon perceived to be a man in black arriving from the direction of Flintcomb Ash The man at the slicer having nothing else to do with his eyes continually observed the comer but Tess who was occupied did not perceive him till her companion directed her attention to his approach It was not her hard taskmaster Farmer Groby it was one in a semi clerical costume who now represented what had once been the free and easy Alec d Urberville Not being hot at his preaching there was less enthusiasm about him now and the presence of the grinder seemed to embarrass him A pale distress was already on Tess s face and she pulled her curtained hood further over it D Urberville came up and said quietly I want to speak to you Tess You have refused my last request not to come near me said she Yes but I have a good reason Well tell it It is more serious than you may think He glanced round to see if he were overheard They were at some distance from the man who turned the slicer and the movement of the machine too sufficiently prevented Alec s words reaching other ears D Urberville placed himself so as to screen Tess from the labourer turning his back to the latter It is this he continued with capricious compunction In thinking of your soul and mine when we last met I neglected to inquire as to your worldly condition You were well dressed and I did not think of it But I see now that it is hard harder than it used to be when I knew you harder than you deserve Perhaps a good deal of it is owning to me She did not answer and he watched her inquiringly as with bent head her face completely screened by the hood she resumed her trimming of the swedes By going on with her work she felt better able to keep him outside her emotions Tess he added with a sigh of discontent yours was the very worst case I ever was concerned in I had no idea of what had resulted till you told me Scamp that I was to foul that innocent life The whole blame was mine the whole unconventional business of our time at Trantridge You too the real blood of which I am but the base imitation what a blind young thing you were as to possibilities I say in all earnestness that it is a shame for parents to bring up their girls in such dangerous ignorance of the gins and nets that the wicked may set for them whether their motive be a good one or the result of simple indifference Tess still did no more than listen throwing down one globular root and taking up another with automatic regularity the pensive contour of the mere fieldwoman alone marking her But it is not that I came to say d Urberville went on My circumstances are these I have lost my mother since you were at Trantridge and the place is my own But I intend to sell it and devote myself to missionary work in Africa A devil of a poor hand I shall make at the trade no doubt However what I want to ask you is will you put it in my power to do my duty to make the only reparation I can make for the trick played you that is will you be my wife and go with me I have already obtained this precious document It was my old mother s dying wish He drew a piece of parchment from his pocket with a slight fumbling of embarrassment What is it said she A marriage licence O no sir no she said quickly starting back You will not Why is that And as he asked the question a disappointment which was not entirely the disappointment of thwarted duty crossed d Urberville s face It was unmistakably a symptom that something of his old passion for her had been revived duty and desire ran hand in hand Surely he began again in more impetuous tones and then looked round at the labourer who turned the slicer Tess too felt that the argument could not be ended there Informing the man that a gentleman had come to see her with whom she wished to walk a little way she moved off with d Urberville across the zebra striped field When they reached the first newly ploughed section he held out his hand to help her over it but she stepped forward on the summits of the earth rolls as if she did not see him You will not marry me Tess and make me a self respecting man he repeated as soon as they were over the furrows I cannot But why You know I have no affection for you But you would get to feel that in time perhaps as soon as you really could forgive me Never Why so positive I love somebody else The words seemed to astonish him You do he cried Somebody else But has not a sense of what is morally right and proper any weight with you No no no don t say that Anyhow then your love for this other man may be only a passing feeling which you will overcome No no Yes yes Why not I cannot tell you You must in honour Well then I have married him Ah he exclaimed and he stopped dead and gazed at her I did not wish to tell I did not mean to she pleaded It is a secret here or at any rate but dimly known So will you PLEASE will you keep from questioning me You must remember that we are now strangers Strangers are we Strangers For a moment a flash of his old irony marked his face but he determinedly chastened it down Is that man your husband he asked mechanically denoting by a sign the labourer who turned the machine That man she said proudly I should think not Who then Do not ask what I do not wish to tell she begged and flashed her appeal to him from her upturned face and lash shadowed eyes D Urberville was disturbed But I only asked for your sake he retorted hotly Angels of heaven God forgive me for such an expression I came here I swear as I thought for your good Tess don t look at me so I cannot stand your looks There never were such eyes surely before Christianity or since There I won t lose my head I dare not I own that the sight of you had waked up my love for you which I believed was extinguished with all such feelings But I thought that our marriage might be a sanctification for us both The unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband I said to myself But my plan is dashed from me and I must bear the disappointment He moodily reflected with his eyes on the ground Married Married Well that being so he added quite calmly tearing the licence slowly into halves and putting them in his pocket that being prevented I should like to do some good to you and your husband whoever he may be There are many questions that I am tempted to ask but I will not do so of course in opposition to your wishes Though if I could know your husband I might more easily benefit him and you Is he on this farm No she murmured He is far away Far away From YOU What sort of husband can he be O do not speak against him It was through you He found out Ah is it so That s sad Tess Yes But to stay away from you to leave you to work like this He does not leave me to work she cried springing to the defence of the absent one with all her fervour He don t know it It is by my own arrangement Then does he write I I cannot tell you There are things which are private to ourselves Of course that means that he does not You are a deserted wife my fair Tess In an impulse he turned suddenly to take her hand the buff glove was on it and he seized only the rough leather fingers which did not express the life or shape of those within You must not you must not she cried fearfully slipping her hand from the glove as from a pocket and leaving it in his grasp O will you go away for the sake of me and my husband go in the name of your own Christianity Yes yes I will he said abruptly and thrusting the glove back to her he turned to leave Facing round however he said Tess as God is my judge I meant no humbug in taking your hand A pattering of hoofs on the soil of the field which they had not noticed in their preoccupation ceased close behind them and a voice reached her ear What the devil are you doing away from your work at this time o day Farmer Groby had espied the two figures from the distance and had inquisitively ridden across to learn what was their business in his field Don t speak like that to her said d Urberville his face blackening with something that was not Christianity Indeed Mister And what mid Methodist pa sons have to do with she Who is the fellow asked d Urberville turning to Tess She went close up to him Go I do beg you she said What And leave you to that tyrant I can see in his face what a churl he is He won t hurt me HE S not in love with me I can leave at Lady Day Well I have no right but to obey I suppose But well goodbye Her defender whom she dreaded more than her assailant having reluctantly disappeared the farmer continued his reprimand which Tess took with the greatest coolness that sort of attack being independent of sex To have as a master this man of stone who would have cuffed her if he had dared was almost a relief after her former experiences She silently walked back towards the summit of the field that was the scene of her labour so absorbed in the interview which had just taken place that she was hardly aware that the nose of Groby s horse almost touched her shoulders If so be you make an agreement to work for me till Lady Day I ll see that you carry it out he growled Od rot the women now tis one thing and then tis another But I ll put up with it no longer Knowing very well that he did not harass the other women of the farm as he harassed her out of spite for the flooring he had once received she did for one moment picture what might have been the result if she had been free to accept the offer just made her of being the monied Alec s wife It would have lifted her completely out of subjection not only to her present oppressive employer but to a whole world who seemed to despise her But no no she said breathlessly I could not have married him now He is so unpleasant to me That very night she began an appealing letter to Clare concealing from him her hardships and assuring him of her undying affection Any one who had been in a position to read between the lines would have seen that at the back of her great love was some monstrous fear almost a desperation as to some secret contingencies which were not disclosed But again she did not finish her effusion he had asked Izz to go with him and perhaps he did not care for her at all She put the letter in her box and wondered if it would ever reach Angel s hands After this her daily tasks were gone through heavily enough and brought on the day which was of great import to agriculturists the day of the Candlemas Fair It was at this fair that new engagements were entered into for the twelve months following the ensuing Lady Day and those of the farming population who thought of changing their places duly attended at the county town where the fair was held Nearly all the labourers on Flintcomb Ash farm intended flight and early in the morning there was a general exodus in the direction of the town which lay at a distance of from ten to a dozen miles over hilly country Though Tess also meant to leave at the quarter day she was one of the few who did not go to the fair having a vaguely shaped hope that something would happen to render another outdoor engagement unnecessary It was a peaceful February day of wonderful softness for the time and one would almost have thought that winter was over She had hardly finished her dinner when d Urberville s figure darkened the window of the cottage wherein she was a lodger which she had all to herself to day Tess jumped up but her visitor had knocked at the door and she could hardly in reason run away D Urberville s knock his walk up to the door had some indescribable quality of difference from his air when she last saw him They seemed to be acts of which the doer was ashamed She thought that she would not open the door but as there was no sense in that either she arose and having lifted the latch stepped back quickly He came in saw her and flung himself down into a chair before speaking Tess I couldn t help it he began desperately as he wiped his heated face which had also a superimposed flush of excitement I felt that I must call at least to ask how you are I assure you I had not been thinking of you at all till I saw you that Sunday now I cannot get rid of your image try how I may It is hard that a good woman should do harm to a bad man yet so it is If you would only pray for me Tess The suppressed discontent of his manner was almost pitiable and yet Tess did not pity him How can I pray for you she said when I am forbidden to believe that the great Power who moves the world would alter His plans on my account You really think that Yes I have been cured of the presumption of thinking otherwise Cured By whom By my husband if I must tell Ah your husband your husband How strange it seems I remember you hinted something of the sort the other day What do you really believe in these matters Tess he asked You seem to have no religion perhaps owing to me But I have Though I don t believe in anything supernatural D Urberville looked at her with misgiving Then do you think that the line I take is all wrong A good deal of it H m and yet I ve felt so sure about it he said uneasily I believe in the SPIRIT of the Sermon on the Mount and so did my dear husband But I don t believe Here she gave her negations The fact is said d Urberville drily whatever your dear husband believed you accept and whatever he rejected you reject without the least inquiry or reasoning on your own part That s just like you women Your mind is enslaved to his Ah because he knew everything said she with a triumphant simplicity of faith in Angel Clare that the most perfect man could hardly have deserved much less her husband Yes but you should not take negative opinions wholesale from another person like that A pretty fellow he must be to teach you such scepticism He never forced my judgement He would never argue on the subject with me But I looked at it in this way what he believed after inquiring deep into doctrines was much more likely to be right than what I might believe who hadn t looked into doctrines at all What used he to say He must have said something She reflected and with her acute memory for the letter of Angel Clare s remarks even when she did not comprehend their spirit she recalled a merciless polemical syllogism that she had heard him use when as it occasionally happened he indulged in a species of thinking aloud with her at his side In delivering it she gave also Clare s accent and manner with reverential faithfulness Say that again asked d Urberville who had listened with the greatest attention She repeated the argument and d Urberville thoughtfully murmured the words after her Anything else he presently asked He said at another time something like this and she gave another which might possibly have been paralleled in many a work of the pedigree ranging from the Dictionnaire Philosophique to Huxley s Essays Ah ha How do you remember them I wanted to believe what he believed though he didn t wish me to and I managed to coax him to tell me a few of his thoughts I can t say I quite understand that one but I know it is right H m Fancy your being able to teach me what you don t know yourself He fell into thought And so I threw in my spiritual lot with his she resumed I didn t wish it to be different What s good enough for him is good enough for me Does he know that you are as big an infidel as he No I never told him if I am an infidel Well you are better off to day that I am Tess after all You don t believe that you ought to preach my doctrine and therefore do no despite to your conscience in abstaining I do believe I ought to preach it but like the devils I believe and tremble for I suddenly leave off preaching it and give way to my passion for you How Why he said aridly I have come all the way here to see you to day But I started from home to go to Casterbridge Fair where I have undertaken to preach the Word from a waggon at half past two this afternoon and where all the brethren are expecting me this minute Here s the announcement He drew from his breast pocket a poster whereon was printed the day hour and place of meeting at which he d Urberville would preach the Gospel as aforesaid But how can you get there said Tess looking at the clock I cannot get there I have come here What you have really arranged to preach and I have arranged to preach and I shall not be there by reason of my burning desire to see a woman whom I once despised No by my word and truth I never despised you if I had I should not love you now Why I did not despise you was on account of your being unsmirched in spite of all you withdrew yourself from me so quickly and resolutely when you saw the situation you did not remain at my pleasure so there was one petticoat in the world for whom I had no contempt and you are she But you may well despise me now I thought I worshipped on the mountains but I find I still serve in the groves Ha ha O Alec d Urberville what does this mean What have I done Done he said with a soulless sneer in the word Nothing intentionally But you have been the means the innocent means of my backsliding as they call it I ask myself am I indeed one of those servants of corruption who after they have escaped the pollutions of the world are again entangled therein and overcome whose latter end is worse than their beginning He laid his hand on her shoulder Tess my girl I was on the way to at least social salvation till I saw you again he said freakishly shaking her as if she were a child And why then have you tempted me I was firm as a man could be till I saw those eyes and that mouth again surely there never was such a maddening mouth since Eve s His voice sank and a hot archness shot from his own black eyes You temptress Tess you dear damned witch of Babylon I could not resist you as soon as I met you again I couldn t help your seeing me again said Tess recoiling I know it I repeat that I do not blame you But the fact remains When I saw you ill used on the farm that day I was nearly mad to think that I had no legal right to protect you that I could not have it whilst he who has it seems to neglect you utterly Don t speak against him he is absent she cried in much excitement Treat him honourably he has never wronged you O leave his wife before any scandal spreads that may do harm to his honest name I will I will he said like a man awakening from a luring dream I have broken my engagement to preach to those poor drunken boobies at the fair it is the first time I have played such a practical joke A month ago I should have been horrified at such a possibility I ll go away to swear and ah can I to keep away Then suddenly One clasp Tessy one Only for old friendship I am without defence Alec A good man s honour is in my keeping think be ashamed Pooh Well yes yes He clenched his lips mortified with himself for his weakness His eyes were equally barren of worldly and religious faith The corpses of those old fitful passions which had lain inanimate amid the lines of his face ever since his reformation seemed to wake and come together as in a resurrection He went out indeterminately Though d Urberville had declared that this breach of his engagement to day was the simple backsliding of a believer Tess s words as echoed from Angel Clare had made a deep impression upon him and continued to do so after he had left her He moved on in silence as if his energies were benumbed by the hitherto undreamt of possibility that his position was untenable Reason had had nothing to do with his whimsical conversion which was perhaps the mere freak of a careless man in search of a new sensation and temporarily impressed by his mother s death The drops of logic Tess had let fall into the sea of his enthusiasm served to chill its effervescence to stagnation He said to himself as he pondered again and again over the crystallized phrases that she had handed on to him That clever fellow little thought that by telling her those things he might be paving my way back to her XLVII It is the threshing of the last wheat rick at Flintcomb Ash farm The dawn of the March morning is singularly inexpressive and there is nothing to show where the eastern horizon lies Against the twilight rises the trapezoidal top of the stack which has stood forlornly here through the washing and bleaching of the wintry weather When Izz Huett and Tess arrived at the scene of operations only a rustling denoted that others had preceded them to which as the light increased there were presently added the silhouettes of two men on the summit They were busily unhaling the rick that is stripping off the thatch before beginning to throw down the sheaves and while this was in progress Izz and Tess with the other women workers in their whitey brown pinners stood waiting and shivering Farmer Groby having insisted upon their being on the spot thus early to get the job over if possible by the end of the day Close under the eaves of the stack and as yet barely visible was the red tyrant that the women had come to serve a timber framed construction with straps and wheels appertaining the threshing machine which whilst it was going kept up a despotic demand upon the endurance of their muscles and nerves A little way off there was another indistinct figure this one black with a sustained hiss that spoke of strength very much in reserve The long chimney running up beside an ash tree and the warmth which radiated from the spot explained without the necessity of much daylight that here was the engine which was to act as the primum mobile of this little world By the engine stood a dark motionless being a sooty and grimy embodiment of tallness in a sort of trance with a heap of coals by his side it was the engine man The isolation of his manner and colour lent him the appearance of a creature from Tophet who had strayed into the pellucid smokelessness of this region of yellow grain and pale soil with which he had nothing in common to amaze and to discompose its aborigines What he looked he felt He was in the agricultural world but not of it He served fire and smoke these denizens of the fields served vegetation weather frost and sun He travelled with his engine from farm to farm from county to county for as yet the steam threshing machine was itinerant in this part of Wessex He spoke in a strange northern accent his thoughts being turned inwards upon himself his eye on his iron charge hardly perceiving the scenes around him and caring for them not at all holding only strictly necessary intercourse with the natives as if some ancient doom compelled him to wander here against his will in the service of his Plutonic master The long strap which ran from the driving wheel of his engine to the red thresher under the rick was the sole tie line between agriculture and him While they uncovered the sheaves he stood apathetic beside his portable repository of force round whose hot blackness the morning air quivered He had nothing to do with preparatory labour His fire was waiting incandescent his steam was at high pressure in a few seconds he could make the long strap move at an invisible velocity Beyond its extent the environment might be corn straw or chaos it was all the same to him If any of the autochthonous idlers asked him what he called himself he replied shortly an engineer The rick was unhaled by full daylight the men then took their places the women mounted and the work began Farmer Groby or as they called him he had arrived ere this and by his orders Tess was placed on the platform of the machine close to the man who fed it her business being to untie every sheaf of corn handed on to her by Izz Huett who stood next but on the rick so that the feeder could seize it and spread it over the revolving drum which whisked out every grain in one moment They were soon in full progress after a preparatory hitch or two which rejoiced the hearts of those who hated machinery The work sped on till breakfast time when the thresher was stopped for half an hour and on starting again after the meal the whole supplementary strength of the farm was thrown into the labour of constructing the straw rick which began to grow beside the stack of corn A hasty lunch was eaten as they stood without leaving their positions and then another couple of hours brought them near to dinner time the inexorable wheel continuing to spin and the penetrating hum of the thresher to thrill to the very marrow all who were near the revolving wire cage The old men on the rising straw rick talked of the past days when they had been accustomed to thresh with flails on the oaken barn floor when everything even to winnowing was effected by hand labour which to their thinking though slow produced better results Those too on the corn rick talked a little but the perspiring ones at the machine including Tess could not lighten their duties by the exchange of many words It was the ceaselessness of the work which tried her so severely and began to make her wish that she had never some to Flintcomb Ash The women on the corn rick Marian who was one of them in particular could stop to drink ale or cold tea from the flagon now and then or to exchange a few gossiping remarks while they wiped their faces or cleared the fragments of straw and husk from their clothing but for Tess there was no respite for as the drum never stopped the man who fed it could not stop and she who had to supply the man with untied sheaves could not stop either unless Marian changed places with her which she sometimes did for half an hour in spite of Groby s objections that she was too slow handed for a feeder For some probably economical reason it was usually a woman who was chosen for this particular duty and Groby gave as his motive in selecting Tess that she was one of those who best combined strength with quickness in untying and both with staying power and this may have been true The hum of the thresher which prevented speech increased to a raving whenever the supply of corn fell short of the regular quantity As Tess and the man who fed could never turn their heads she did not know that just before the dinner hour a person had come silently into the field by the gate and had been standing under a second rick watching the scene and Tess in particular He was dressed in a tweed suit of fashionable pattern and he twirled a gay walking cane Who is that said Izz Huett to Marian She had at first addressed the inquiry to Tess but the latter could not hear it Somebody s fancy man I s pose said Marian laconically I ll lay a guinea he s after Tess O no Tis a ranter pa son who s been sniffing after her lately not a dandy like this Well this is the same man The same man as the preacher But he s quite different He hev left off his black coat and white neckercher and hev cut off his whiskers but he s the same man for all that D ye really think so Then I ll tell her said Marian Don t She ll see him soon enough good now Well I don t think it at all right for him to join his preaching to courting a married woman even though her husband mid be abroad and she in a sense a widow Oh he can do her no harm said Izz drily Her mind can no more be heaved from that one place where it do bide than a stooded waggon from the hole he s in Lord love ee neither court paying nor preaching nor the seven thunders themselves can wean a woman when twould be better for her that she should be weaned Dinner time came and the whirling ceased whereupon Tess left her post her knees trembling so wretchedly with the shaking of the machine that she could scarcely walk You ought to het a quart o drink into ee as I ve done said Marian You wouldn t look so white then Why souls above us your face is as if you d been hagrode It occurred to the good natured Marian that as Tess was so tired her discovery of her visitor s presence might have the bad effect of taking away her appetite and Marian was thinking of inducing Tess to descend by a ladder on the further side of the stack when the gentleman came forward and looked up Tess uttered a short little Oh And a moment after she said quickly I shall eat my dinner here right on the rick Sometimes when they were so far from their cottages they all did this but as there was rather a keen wind going to day Marian and the rest descended and sat under the straw stack The newcomer was indeed Alec d Urberville the late Evangelist despite his changed attire and aspect It was obvious at a glance that the original Weltlust had come back that he had restored himself as nearly as a man could do who had grown three or four years older to the old jaunty slapdash guise under which Tess had first known her admirer and cousin so called Having decided to remain where she was Tess sat down among the bundles out of sight of the ground and began her meal till by and by she heard footsteps on the ladder and immediately after Alec appeared upon the stack now an oblong and level platform of sheaves He strode across them and sat down opposite of her without a word Tess continued to eat her modest dinner a slice of thick pancake which she had brought with her The other workfolk were by this time all gathered under the rick where the loose straw formed a comfortable retreat I am here again as you see said d Urberville Why do you trouble me so she cried reproach flashing from her very finger ends I trouble YOU I think I may ask why do you trouble me Sure I don t trouble you any when You say you don t But you do You haunt me Those very eyes that you turned upon me with such a bitter flash a moment ago they come to me just as you showed them then in the night and in the day Tess ever since you told me of that child of ours it is just as if my feelings which have been flowing in a strong puritanical stream had suddenly found a way open in the direction of you and had all at once gushed through The religious channel is left dry forthwith and it is you who have done it She gazed in silence What you have given up your preaching entirely she asked She had gathered from Angel sufficient of the incredulity of modern thought to despise flash enthusiasm but as a woman she was somewhat appalled In affected severity d Urberville continued Entirely I have broken every engagement since that afternoon I was to address the drunkards at Casterbridge Fair The deuce only knows what I am thought of by the brethren Ah ha The brethren No doubt they pray for me weep for me for they are kind people in their way But what do I care How could I go on with the thing when I had lost my faith in it it would have been hypocrisy of the basest kind Among them I should have stood like Hymenaeus and Alexander who were delivered over to Satan that they might learn not to blaspheme What a grand revenge you have taken I saw you innocent and I deceived you Four years after you find me a Christian enthusiast you then work upon me perhaps to my complete perdition But Tess my coz as I used to call you this is only my way of talking and you must not look so horribly concerned Of course you have done nothing except retain your pretty face and shapely figure I saw it on the rick before you saw me that tight pinafore thing sets it off and that wing bonnet you field girls should never wear those bonnets if you wish to keep out of danger He regarded her silently for a few moments and with a short cynical laugh resumed I believe that if the bachelor apostle whose deputy I thought I was had been tempted by such a pretty face he would have let go the plough for her sake as I do Tess attempted to expostulate but at this juncture all her fluency failed her and without heeding he added Well this paradise that you supply is perhaps as good as any other after all But to speak seriously Tess D Urberville rose and came nearer reclining sideways amid the sheaves and resting upon his elbow Since I last saw you I have been thinking of what you said that HE said I have come to the conclusion that there does seem rather a want of common sense in these threadbare old propositions how I could have been so fired by poor Parson Clare s enthusiasm and have gone so madly to work transcending even him I cannot make out As for what you said last time on the strength of your wonderful husband s intelligence whose name you have never told me about having what they call an ethical system without any dogma I don t see my way to that at all Why you can have the religion of loving kindness and purity at least if you can t have what do you call it dogma O no I m a different sort of fellow from that If there s nobody to say Do this and it will be a good thing for you after you are dead do that and if will be a bad thing for you I can t warm up Hang it I am not going to feel responsible for my deeds and passions if there s nobody to be responsible to and if I were you my dear I wouldn t either She tried to argue and tell him that he had mixed in his dull brain two matters theology and morals which in the primitive days of mankind had been quite distinct But owing to Angel Clare s reticence to her absolute want of training and to her being a vessel of emotions rather than reasons she could not get on Well never mind he resumed Here I am my love as in the old times Not as then never as then tis different she entreated And there was never warmth with me O why didn t you keep your faith if the loss of it has brought you to speak to me like this Because you ve knocked it out of me so the evil be upon your sweet head Your husband little thought how his teaching would recoil upon him Ha ha I m awfully glad you have made an apostate of me all the same Tess I am more taken with you than ever and I pity you too For all your closeness I see you are in a bad way neglected by one who ought to cherish you She could not get her morsels of food down her throat her lips were dry and she was ready to choke The voices and laughs of the workfolk eating and drinking under the rick came to her as if they were a quarter of a mile off It is cruelty to me she said How how can you treat me to this talk if you care ever so little for me True true he said wincing a little I did not come to reproach you for my deeds I came Tess to say that I don t like you to be working like this and I have come on purpose for you You say you have a husband who is not I Well perhaps you have but I ve never seen him and you ve not told me his name and altogether he seems rather a mythological personage However even if you have one I think I am nearer to you than he is I at any rate try to help you out of trouble but he does not bless his invisible face The words of the stern prophet Hosea that I used to read come back to me Don t you know them Tess And she shall follow after her lover but she shall not overtake him and she shall seek him but shall not find him then shall she say I will go and return to my first husband for then was it better with me than now Tess my trap is waiting just under the hill and darling mine not his you know the rest Her face had been rising to a dull crimson fire while he spoke but she did not answer You have been the cause of my backsliding he continued stretching his arm towards her waist you should be willing to share it and leave that mule you call husband for ever One of her leather gloves which she had taken off to eat her skimmer cake lay in her lap and without the slightest warning she passionately swung the glove by the gauntlet directly in his face It was heavy and thick as a warrior s and it struck him flat on the mouth Fancy might have regarded the act as the recrudescence of a trick in which her armed progenitors were not unpractised Alec fiercely started up from his reclining position A scarlet oozing appeared where her blow had alighted and in a moment the blood began dropping from his mouth upon the straw But he soon controlled himself calmly drew his handkerchief from his pocket and mopped his bleeding lips She too had sprung up but she sank down again Now punish me she said turning up her eyes to him with the hopeless defiance of the sparrow s gaze before its captor twists its neck Whip me crush me you need not mind those people under the rick I shall not cry out Once victim always victim that s the law O no no Tess he said blandly I can make full allowance for this Yet you most unjustly forget one thing that I would have married you if you had not put it out of my power to do so Did I not ask you flatly to be my wife hey Answer me You did And you cannot be But remember one thing His voice hardened as his temper got the better of him with the recollection of his sincerity in asking her and her present ingratitude and he stepped across to her side and held her by the shoulders so that she shook under his grasp Remember my lady I was your master once I will be your master again If you are any man s wife you are mine The threshers now began to stir below So much for our quarrel he said letting her go Now I shall leave you and shall come again for your answer during the afternoon You don t know me yet But I know you She had not spoken again remaining as if stunned D Urberville retreated over the sheaves and descended the ladder while the workers below rose and stretched their arms and shook down the beer they had drunk Then the threshing machine started afresh and amid the renewed rustle of the straw Tess resumed her position by the buzzing drum as one in a dream untying sheaf after sheaf in endless succession XLVIII In the afternoon the farmer made it known that the rick was to be finished that night since there was a moon by which they could see to work and the man with the engine was engaged for another farm on the morrow Hence the twanging and humming and rustling proceeded with even less intermission than usual It was not till nammet time about three o clock that Tess raised her eyes and gave a momentary glance round She felt but little surprise at seeing that Alec d Urberville had come back and was standing under the hedge by the gate He had seen her lift her eyes and waved his hand urbanely to her while he blew her a kiss It meant that their quarrel was over Tess looked down again and carefully abstained from gazing in that direction Thus the afternoon dragged on The wheat rick shrank lower and the straw rick grew higher and the corn sacks were carted away At six o clock the wheat rick was about shoulder high from the ground But the unthreshed sheaves remaining untouched seemed countless still notwithstanding the enormous numbers that had been gulped down by the insatiable swallower fed by the man and Tess through whose two young hands the greater part of them had passed And the immense stack of straw where in the morning there had been nothing appeared as the faeces of the same buzzing red glutton From the west sky a wrathful shine all that wild March could afford in the way of sunset had burst forth after the cloudy day flooding the tired and sticky faces of the threshers and dyeing them with a coppery light as also the flapping garments of the women which clung to them like dull flames A panting ache ran through the rick The man who fed was weary and Tess could see that the red nape of his neck was encrusted with dirt and husks She still stood at her post her flushed and perspiring face coated with the corndust and her white bonnet embrowned by it She was the only woman whose place was upon the machine so as to be shaken bodily by its spinning and the decrease of the stack now separated her from Marian and Izz and prevented their changing duties with her as they had done The incessant quivering in which every fibre of her frame participated had thrown her into a stupefied reverie in which her arms worked on independently of her consciousness She hardly knew where she was and did not hear Izz Huett tell her from below that her hair was tumbling down By degrees the freshest among them began to grow cadaverous and saucer eyed Whenever Tess lifted her head she beheld always the great upgrown straw stack with the men in shirt sleeves upon it against the gray north sky in front of it the long red elevator like a Jacob s ladder on which a perpetual stream of threshed straw ascended a yellow river running uphill and spouting out on the top of the rick She knew that Alec d Urberville was still on the scene observing her from some point or other though she could not say where There was an excuse for his remaining for when the threshed rick drew near its final sheaves a little ratting was always done and men unconnected with the threshing sometimes dropped in for that performance sporting characters of all descriptions gents with terriers and facetious pipes roughs with sticks and stones But there was another hour s work before the layer of live rats at the base of the stack would be reached and as the evening light in the direction of the Giant s Hill by Abbot s Cernel dissolved away the white faced moon of the season arose from the horizon that lay towards Middleton Abbey and Shottsford on the other side For the last hour or two Marian had felt uneasy about Tess whom she could not get near enough to speak to the other women having kept up their strength by drinking ale and Tess having done without it through traditionary dread owing to its results at her home in childhood But Tess still kept going if she could not fill her part she would have to leave and this contingency which she would have regarded with equanimity and even with relief a month or two earlier had become a terror since d Urberville had begun to hover round her The sheaf pitchers and feeders had now worked the rick so low that people on the ground could talk to them To Tess s surprise Farmer Groby came up on the machine to her and said that if she desired to join her friend he did not wish her to keep on any longer and would send somebody else to take her place The friend was d Urberville she knew and also that this concession had been granted in obedience to the request of that friend or enemy She shook her head and toiled on The time for the rat catching arrived at last and the hunt began The creatures had crept downwards with the subsidence of the rick till they were all together at the bottom and being now uncovered from their last refuge they ran across the open ground in all directions a loud shriek from the by this time half tipsy Marian informing her companions that one of the rats had invaded her person a terror which the rest of the women had guarded against by various schemes of skirt tucking and self elevation The rat was at last dislodged and amid the barking of dogs masculine shouts feminine screams oaths stampings and confusion as of Pandemonium Tess untied her last sheaf the drum slowed the whizzing ceased and she stepped from the machine to the ground Her lover who had only looked on at the rat catching was promptly at her side What after all my insulting slap too said she in an underbreath She was so utterly exhausted that she had not strength to speak louder I should indeed be foolish to feel offended at anything you say or do he answered in the seductive voice of the Trantridge time How the little limbs tremble You are as weak as a bled calf you know you are and yet you need have done nothing since I arrived How could you be so obstinate However I have told the farmer that he has no right to employ women at steam threshing It is not proper work for them and on all the better class of farms it has been given up as he knows very well I will walk with you as far as your home O yes she answered with a jaded gait Walk wi me if you will I do bear in mind that you came to marry me before you knew o my state Perhaps perhaps you are a little better and kinder than I have been thinking you were Whatever is meant as kindness I am grateful for whatever is meant in any other way I am angered at I cannot sense your meaning sometimes If I cannot legitimize our former relations at least I can assist you And I will do it with much more regard for your feelings than I formerly showed My religious mania or whatever it was is over But I retain a little good nature I hope I do Now Tess by all that s tender and strong between man and woman trust me I have enough and more than enough to put you out of anxiety both for yourself and your parents and sisters I can make them all comfortable if you will only show confidence in me Have you seen em lately she quickly inquired Yes They didn t know where you were It was only by chance that I found you here The cold moon looked aslant upon Tess s fagged face between the twigs of the garden hedge as she paused outside the cottage which was her temporary home d Urberville pausing beside her Don t mention my little brothers and sisters don t make me break down quite she said If you want to help them God knows they need it do it without telling me But no no she cried I will take nothing from you either for them or for me He did not accompany her further since as she lived with the household all was public indoors No sooner had she herself entered laved herself in a washing tub and shared supper with the family than she fell into thought and withdrawing to the table under the wall by the light of her own little lamp wrote in a passionate mood MY OWN HUSBAND Let me call you so I must even if it makes you angry to think of such an unworthy wife as I I must cry to you in my trouble I have no one else I am so exposed to temptation Angel I fear to say who it is and I do not like to write about it at all But I cling to you in a way you cannot think Can you not come to me now at once before anything terrible happens O I know you cannot because you are so far away I think I must die if you do not come soon or tell me to come to you The punishment you have measured out to me is deserved I do know that well deserved and you are right and just to be angry with me But Angel please please not to be just only a little kind to me even if I do not deserve it and come to me If you would come I could die in your arms I would be well content to do that if so be you had forgiven me Angel I live entirely for you I love you too much to blame you for going away and I know it was necessary you should find a farm Do not think I shall say a word of sting or bitterness Only come back to me I am desolate without you my darling O so desolate I do not mind having to work but if you will send me one little line and say I am coming soon I will bide on Angel O so cheerfully It has been so much my religion ever since we were married to be faithful to you in every thought and look that even when a man speaks a compliment to me before I am aware it seems wronging you Have you never felt one little bit of what you used to feel when we were at the dairy If you have how can you keep away from me I am the same women Angel as you fell in love with yes the very same not the one you disliked but never saw What was the past to me as soon as I met you It was a dead thing altogether I became another woman filled full of new life from you How could I be the early one Why do you not see this Dear if you would only be a little more conceited and believe in yourself so far as to see that you were strong enough to work this change in me you would perhaps be in a mind to come to me your poor wife How silly I was in my happiness when I thought I could trust you always to love me I ought to have known that such as that was not for poor me But I am sick at heart not only for old times but for the present Think think how it do hurt my heart not to see you ever ever Ah if I could only make your dear heart ache one little minute of each day as mine does every day and all day long it might lead you to show pity to your poor lonely one People still say that I am rather pretty Angel handsome is the word they use since I wish to be truthful Perhaps I am what they say But I do not value my good looks I only like to have them because they belong to you my dear and that there may be at least one thing about me worth your having So much have I felt this that when I met with annoyance on account of the same I tied up my face in a bandage as long as people would believe in it O Angel I tell you all this not from vanity you will certainly know I do not but only that you may come to me If you really cannot come to me will you let me come to you I am as I say worried pressed to do what I will not do It cannot be that I shall yield one inch yet I am in terror as to what an accident might lead to and I so defenceless on account of my first error I cannot say more about this it makes me too miserable But if I break down by falling into some fearful snare my last state will be worse than my first O God I cannot think of it Let me come at once or at once come to me I would be content ay glad to live with you as your servant if I may not as your wife so that I could only be near you and get glimpses of you and think of you as mine The daylight has nothing to show me since you are not here and I don t like to see the rooks and starlings in the field because I grieve and grieve to miss you who used to see them with me I long for only one thing in heaven or earth or under the earth to meet you my own dear Come to me come to me and save me from what threatens me Your faithful heartbroken TESS XLIX The appeal duly found its way to the breakfast table of the quiet Vicarage to the westward in that valley where the air is so soft and the soil so rich that the effort of growth requires but superficial aid by comparison with the tillage at Flintcomb Ash and where to Tess the human world seemed so different though it was much the same It was purely for security that she had been requested by Angel to send her communications through his father whom he kept pretty well informed of his changing addresses in the country he had gone to exploit for himself with a heavy heart Now said old mister Clare to his wife when he had read the envelope if Angel proposes leaving Rio for a visit home at the end of next month as he told us that he hoped to do I think this may hasten his plans for I believe it to be from his wife He breathed deeply at the thought of her and the letter was redirected to be promptly sent on to Angel Dear fellow I hope he will get home safely murmured missus Clare To my dying day I shall feel that he has been ill used You should have sent him to Cambridge in spite of his want of faith and given him the same chance as the other boys had He would have grown out of it under proper influence and perhaps would have taken Orders after all Church or no Church it would have been fairer to him This was the only wail with which missus Clare ever disturbed her husband s peace in respect to their sons And she did not vent this often for she was as considerate as she was devout and knew that his mind too was troubled by doubts as to his justice in this matter Only too often had she heard him lying awake at night stifling sighs for Angel with prayers But the uncompromising Evangelical did not even now hold that he would have been justified in giving his son an unbeliever the same academic advantages that he had given to the two others when it was possible if not probable that those very advantages might have been used to decry the doctrines which he had made it his life s mission and desire to propagate and the mission of his ordained sons likewise To put with one hand a pedestal under the feet of the two faithful ones and with the other to exalt the unfaithful by the same artificial means he deemed to be alike inconsistent with his convictions his position and his hopes Nevertheless he loved his misnamed Angel and in secret mourned over this treatment of him as Abraham might have mourned over the doomed Isaac while they went up the hill together His silent self generated regrets were far bitterer than the reproaches which his wife rendered audible They blamed themselves for this unlucky marriage If Angel had never been destined for a farmer he would never have been thrown with agricultural girls They did not distinctly know what had separated him and his wife nor the date on which the separation had taken place At first they had supposed it must be something of the nature of a serious aversion But in his later letters he occasionally alluded to the intention of coming home to fetch her from which expressions they hoped the division might not owe its origin to anything so hopelessly permanent as that He had told them that she was with her relatives and in their doubts they had decided not to intrude into a situation which they knew no way of bettering The eyes for which Tess s letter was intended were gazing at this time on a limitless expanse of country from the back of a mule which was bearing him from the interior of the South American Continent towards the coast His experiences of this strange land had been sad The severe illness from which he had suffered shortly after his arrival had never wholly left him and he had by degrees almost decided to relinquish his hope of farming here though as long as the bare possibility existed of his remaining he kept this change of view a secret from his parents The crowds of agricultural labourers who had come out to the country in his wake dazzled by representations of easy independence had suffered died and wasted away He would see mothers from English farms trudging along with their infants in their arms when the child would be stricken with fever and would die the mother would pause to dig a hole in the loose earth with her bare hands would bury the babe therein with the same natural grave tools shed one tear and again trudge on Angel s original intention had not been emigration to Brazil but a northern or eastern farm in his own country He had come to this place in a fit of desperation the Brazil movement among the English agriculturists having by chance coincided with his desire to escape from his past existence During this time of absence he had mentally aged a dozen years What arrested him now as of value in life was less its beauty than its pathos Having long discredited the old systems of mysticism he now began to discredit the old appraisements of morality He thought they wanted readjusting Who was the moral man Still more pertinently who was the moral woman The beauty or ugliness of a character lay not only in its achievements but in its aims and impulses its true history lay not among things done but among things willed How then about Tess Viewing her in these lights a regret for his hasty judgement began to oppress him Did he reject her eternally or did he not He could no longer say that he would always reject her and not to say that was in spirit to accept her now This growing fondness for her memory coincided in point of time with her residence at Flintcomb Ash but it was before she had felt herself at liberty to trouble him with a word about her circumstances or her feelings He was greatly perplexed and in his perplexity as to her motives in withholding intelligence he did not inquire Thus her silence of docility was misinterpreted How much it really said if he had understood that she adhered with literal exactness to orders which he had given and forgotten that despite her natural fearlessness she asserted no rights admitted his judgement to be in every respect the true one and bent her head dumbly thereto In the before mentioned journey by mules through the interior of the country another man rode beside him Angel s companion was also an Englishman bent on the same errand though he came from another part of the island They were both in a state of mental depression and they spoke of home affairs Confidence begat confidence With that curious tendency evinced by men more especially when in distant lands to entrust to strangers details of their lives which they would on no account mention to friends Angel admitted to this man as they rode along the sorrowful facts of his marriage The stranger had sojourned in many more lands and among many more peoples than Angel to his cosmopolitan mind such deviations from the social norm so immense to domesticity were no more than are the irregularities of vale and mountain chain to the whole terrestrial curve He viewed the matter in quite a different light from Angel thought that what Tess had been was of no importance beside what she would be and plainly told Clare that he was wrong in coming away from her The next day they were drenched in a thunder storm Angel s companion was struck down with fever and died by the week s end Clare waited a few hours to bury him and then went on his way The cursory remarks of the large minded stranger of whom he knew absolutely nothing beyond a commonplace name were sublimed by his death and influenced Clare more than all the reasoned ethics of the philosophers His own parochialism made him ashamed by its contrast His inconsistencies rushed upon him in a flood He had persistently elevated Hellenic Paganism at the expense of Christianity yet in that civilization an illegal surrender was not certain disesteem Surely then he might have regarded that abhorrence of the un intact state which he had inherited with the creed of mysticism as at least open to correction when the result was due to treachery A remorse struck into him The words of Izz Huett never quite stilled in his memory came back to him He had asked Izz if she loved him and she had replied in the affirmative Did she love him more than Tess did No she had replied Tess would lay down her life for him and she herself could do no more He thought of Tess as she had appeared on the day of the wedding How her eyes had lingered upon him how she had hung upon his words as if they were a god s And during the terrible evening over the hearth when her simple soul uncovered itself to his how pitiful her face had looked by the rays of the fire in her inability to realize that his love and protection could possibly be withdrawn Thus from being her critic he grew to be her advocate Cynical things he had uttered to himself about her but no man can be always a cynic and live and he withdrew them The mistake of expressing them had arisen from his allowing himself to be influenced by general principles to the disregard of the particular instance But the reasoning is somewhat musty lovers and husbands have gone over the ground before to day Clare had been harsh towards her there is no doubt of it Men are too often harsh with women they love or have loved women with men And yet these harshnesses are tenderness itself when compared with the universal harshness out of which they grow the harshness of the position towards the temperament of the means towards the aims of to day towards yesterday of hereafter towards to day The historic interest of her family that masterful line of d Urbervilles whom he had despised as a spent force touched his sentiments now Why had he not known the difference between the political value and the imaginative value of these things In the latter aspect her d Urberville descent was a fact of great dimensions worthless to economics it was a most useful ingredient to the dreamer to the moralizer on declines and falls It was a fact that would soon be forgotten that bit of distinction in poor Tess s blood and name and oblivion would fall upon her hereditary link with the marble monuments and leaded skeletons at Kingsbere So does Time ruthlessly destroy his own romances In recalling her face again and again he thought now that he could see therein a flash of the dignity which must have graced her grand dames and the vision sent that aura through his veins which he had formerly felt and which left behind it a sense of sickness Despite her not inviolate past what still abode in such a woman as Tess outvalued the freshness of her fellows Was not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer So spoke love renascent preparing the way for Tess s devoted outpouring which was then just being forwarded to him by his father though owing to his distance inland it was to be a long time in reaching him Meanwhile the writer s expectation that Angel would come in response to the entreaty was alternately great and small What lessened it was that the facts of her life which had led to the parting had not changed could never change and that if her presence had not attenuated them her absence could not Nevertheless she addressed her mind to the tender question of what she could do to please him best if he should arrive Sighs were expended on the wish that she had taken more notice of the tunes he played on his harp that she had inquired more curiously of him which were his favourite ballads among those the country girls sang She indirectly inquired of Amby Seedling who had followed Izz from Talbothays and by chance Amby remembered that amongst the snatches of melody in which they had indulged at the dairyman s to induce the cows to let down their milk Clare had seemed to like Cupid s Gardens I have parks I have hounds and The break o the day and had seemed not to care for The Tailor s Breeches and Such a beauty I did grow excellent ditties as they were To perfect the ballads was now her whimsical desire She practised them privately at odd moments especially The break o the day Arise arise arise And pick your love a posy All o the sweetest flowers That in the garden grow The turtle doves and sma birds In every bough a building So early in the May time At the break o the day It would have melted the heart of a stone to hear her singing these ditties whenever she worked apart from the rest of the girls in this cold dry time the tears running down her cheeks all the while at the thought that perhaps he would not after all come to hear her and the simple silly words of the songs resounding in painful mockery of the aching heart of the singer Tess was so wrapt up in this fanciful dream that she seemed not to know how the season was advancing that the days had lengthened that Lady Day was at hand and would soon be followed by Old Lady Day the end of her term here But before the quarter day had quite come something happened which made Tess think of far different matters She was at her lodging as usual one evening sitting in the downstairs room with the rest of the family when somebody knocked at the door and inquired for Tess Through the doorway she saw against the declining light a figure with the height of a woman and the breadth of a child a tall thin girlish creature whom she did not recognize in the twilight till the girl said Tess What is it Liza Lu asked Tess in startled accents Her sister whom a little over a year ago she had left at home as a child had sprung up by a sudden shoot to a form of this presentation of which as yet Lu seemed herself scarce able to understand the meaning Her thin legs visible below her once long frock now short by her growing and her uncomfortable hands and arms revealed her youth and inexperience Yes I have been traipsing about all day Tess said Lu with unemotional gravity a trying to find ee and I m very tired What is the matter at home Mother is took very bad and the doctor says she s dying and as father is not very well neither and says tis wrong for a man of such a high family as his to slave and drave at common labouring work we don t know what to do Tess stood in reverie a long time before she thought of asking Liza Lu to come in and sit down When she had done so and Liza Lu was having some tea she came to a decision It was imperative that she should go home Her agreement did not end till Old Lady Day the sixth of April but as the interval thereto was not a long one she resolved to run the risk of starting at once To go that night would be a gain of twelve hours but her sister was too tired to undertake such a distance till the morrow Tess ran down to where Marian and Izz lived informed them of what had happened and begged them to make the best of her case to the farmer Returning she got Lu a supper and after that having tucked the younger into her own bed packed up as many of her belongings as would go into a withy basket and started directing Lu to follow her next morning L She plunged into the chilly equinoctial darkness as the clock struck ten for her fifteen miles walk under the steely stars In lonely districts night is a protection rather than a danger to a noiseless pedestrian and knowing this Tess pursued the nearest course along by lanes that she would almost have feared in the day time but marauders were wanting now and spectral fears were driven out of her mind by thoughts of her mother Thus she proceeded mile after mile ascending and descending till she came to Bulbarrow and about midnight looked from that height into the abyss of chaotic shade which was all that revealed itself of the vale on whose further side she was born Having already traversed about five miles on the upland she had now some ten or eleven in the lowland before her journey would be finished The winding road downwards became just visible to her under the wan starlight as she followed it and soon she paced a soil so contrasting with that above it that the difference was perceptible to the tread and to the smell It was the heavy clay land of Blackmoor Vale and a part of the Vale to which turnpike roads had never penetrated Superstitions linger longest on these heavy soils Having once been forest at this shadowy time it seemed to assert something of its old character the far and the near being blended and every tree and tall hedge making the most of its presence The harts that had been hunted here the witches that had been pricked and ducked the green spangled fairies that whickered at you as you passed the place teemed with beliefs in them still and they formed an impish multitude now At Nuttlebury she passed the village inn whose sign creaked in response to the greeting of her footsteps which not a human soul heard but herself Under the thatched roofs her mind s eye beheld relaxed tendons and flaccid muscles spread out in the darkness beneath coverlets made of little purple patchwork squares and undergoing a bracing process at the hands of sleep for renewed labour on the morrow as soon as a hint of pink nebulosity appeared on Hambledon Hill At three she turned the last corner of the maze of lanes she had threaded and entered Marlott passing the field in which as a club girl she had first seen Angel Clare when he had not danced with her the sense of disappointment remained with her yet In the direction of her mother s house she saw a light It came from the bedroom window and a branch waved in front of it and made it wink at her As soon as she could discern the outline of the house newly thatched with her money it had all its old effect upon Tess s imagination Part of her body and life it ever seemed to be the slope of its dormers the finish of its gables the broken courses of brick which topped the chimney all had something in common with her personal character A stupefaction had come into these features to her regard it meant the illness of her mother She opened the door so softly as to disturb nobody the lower room was vacant but the neighbour who was sitting up with her mother came to the top of the stairs and whispered that missus Durbeyfield was no better though she was sleeping just then Tess prepared herself a breakfast and then took her place as nurse in her mother s chamber In the morning when she contemplated the children they had all a curiously elongated look although she had been away little more than a year their growth was astounding and the necessity of applying herself heart and soul to their needs took her out of her own cares Her father s ill health was the same indefinite kind and he sat in his chair as usual But the day after her arrival he was unusually bright He had a rational scheme for living and Tess asked him what it was I m thinking of sending round to all the old antiqueerians in this part of England he said asking them to subscribe to a fund to maintain me I m sure they d see it as a romantical artistical and proper thing to do They spend lots o money in keeping up old ruins and finding the bones o things and such like and living remains must be more interesting to em still if they only knowed of me Would that somebody would go round and tell em what there is living among em and they thinking nothing of him If Pa son Tringham who discovered me had lived he d ha done it I m sure Tess postponed her arguments on this high project till she had grappled with pressing matters in hand which seemed little improved by her remittances When indoor necessities had been eased she turned her attention to external things It was now the season for planting and sowing many gardens and allotments of the villagers had already received their spring tillage but the garden and the allotment of the Durbeyfields were behindhand She found to her dismay that this was owing to their having eaten all the seed potatoes that last lapse of the improvident At the earliest moment she obtained what others she could procure and in a few days her father was well enough to see to the garden under Tess s persuasive efforts while she herself undertook the allotment plot which they rented in a field a couple of hundred yards out of the village She liked doing it after the confinement of the sick chamber where she was not now required by reason of her mother s improvement Violent motion relieved thought The plot of ground was in a high dry open enclosure where there were forty or fifty such pieces and where labour was at its briskest when the hired labour of the day had ended Digging began usually at six o clock and extended indefinitely into the dusk or moonlight Just now heaps of dead weeds and refuse were burning on many of the plots the dry weather favouring their combustion One fine day Tess and Liza Lu worked on here with their neighbours till the last rays of the sun smote flat upon the white pegs that divided the plots As soon as twilight succeeded to sunset the flare of the couch grass and cabbage stalk fires began to light up the allotments fitfully their outlines appearing and disappearing under the dense smoke as wafted by the wind When a fire glowed banks of smoke blown level along the ground would themselves become illuminated to an opaque lustre screening the workpeople from one another and the meaning of the pillar of a cloud which was a wall by day and a light by night could be understood As evening thickened some of the gardening men and women gave over for the night but the greater number remained to get their planting done Tess being among them though she sent her sister home It was on one of the couch burning plots that she laboured with her fork its four shining prongs resounding against the stones and dry clods in little clicks Sometimes she was completely involved in the smoke of her fire then it would leave her figure free irradiated by the brassy glare from the heap She was oddly dressed to night and presented a somewhat staring aspect her attire being a gown bleached by many washings with a short black jacket over it the effect of the whole being that of a wedding and funeral guest in one The women further back wore white aprons which with their pale faces were all that could be seen of them in the gloom except when at moments they caught a flash from the flames Westward the wiry boughs of the bare thorn hedge which formed the boundary of the field rose against the pale opalescence of the lower sky Above Jupiter hung like a full blown jonquil so bright as almost to throw a shade A few small nondescript stars were appearing elsewhere In the distance a dog barked and wheels occasionally rattled along the dry road Still the prongs continued to click assiduously for it was not late and though the air was fresh and keen there was a whisper of spring in it that cheered the workers on Something in the place the hours the crackling fires the fantastic mysteries of light and shade made others as well as Tess enjoy being there Nightfall which in the frost of winter comes as a fiend and in the warmth of summer as a lover came as a tranquillizer on this March day Nobody looked at his or her companions The eyes of all were on the soil as its turned surface was revealed by the fires Hence as Tess stirred the clods and sang her foolish little songs with scarce now a hope that Clare would ever hear them she did not for a long time notice the person who worked nearest to her a man in a long smockfrock who she found was forking the same plot as herself and whom she supposed her father had sent there to advance the work She became more conscious of him when the direction of his digging brought him closer Sometimes the smoke divided them then it swerved and the two were visible to each other but divided from all the rest Tess did not speak to her fellow worker nor did he speak to her Nor did she think of him further than to recollect that he had not been there when it was broad daylight and that she did not know him as any one of the Marlott labourers which was no wonder her absences having been so long and frequent of late years By and by he dug so close to her that the fire beams were reflected as distinctly from the steel prongs of his fork as from her own On going up to the fire to throw a pitch of dead weeds upon it she found that he did the same on the other side The fire flared up and she beheld the face of d Urberville The unexpectedness of his presence the grotesqueness of his appearance in a gathered smockfrock such as was now worn only by the most old fashioned of the labourers had a ghastly comicality that chilled her as to its bearing D Urberville emitted a low long laugh If I were inclined to joke I should say How much this seems like Paradise he remarked whimsically looking at her with an inclined head What do you say she weakly asked A jester might say this is just like Paradise You are Eve and I am the old Other One come to tempt you in the disguise of an inferior animal I used to be quite up in that scene of Milton s when I was theological Some of it goes Empress the way is ready and not long Beyond a row of myrtles If thou accept My conduct I can bring thee thither soon Lead then said Eve And so on My dear Tess I am only putting this to you as a thing that you might have supposed or said quite untruly because you think so badly of me I never said you were Satan or thought it I don t think of you in that way at all My thoughts of you are quite cold except when you affront me What did you come digging here entirely because of me Entirely To see you nothing more The smockfrock which I saw hanging for sale as I came along was an afterthought that I mightn t be noticed I come to protest against your working like this But I like doing it it is for my father Your engagement at the other place is ended Yes Where are you going to next To join your dear husband She could not bear the humiliating reminder O I don t know she said bitterly I have no husband It is quite true in the sense you mean But you have a friend and I have determined that you shall be comfortable in spite of yourself When you get down to your house you will see what I have sent there for you O Alec I wish you wouldn t give me anything at all I cannot take it from you I don t like it is not right It IS right he cried lightly I am not going to see a woman whom I feel so tenderly for as I do for you in trouble without trying to help her But I am very well off I am only in trouble about about not about living at all She turned and desperately resumed her digging tears dripping upon the fork handle and upon the clods About the children your brothers and sisters he resumed I ve been thinking of them Tess s heart quivered he was touching her in a weak place He had divined her chief anxiety Since returning home her soul had gone out to those children with an affection that was passionate If your mother does not recover somebody ought to do something for them since your father will not be able to do much I suppose He can with my assistance He must And with mine No sir How damned foolish this is burst out d Urberville Why he thinks we are the same family and will be quite satisfied He don t I ve undeceived him The more fool you D Urberville in anger retreated from her to the hedge where he pulled off the long smockfrock which had disguised him and rolling it up and pushing it into the couch fire went away Tess could not get on with her digging after this she felt restless she wondered if he had gone back to her father s house and taking the fork in her hand proceeded homewards Some twenty yards from the house she was met by one of her sisters O Tessy what do you think Liza Lu is a crying and there s a lot of folk in the house and mother is a good deal better but they think father is dead The child realized the grandeur of the news but not as yet its sadness and stood looking at Tess with round eyed importance till beholding the effect produced upon her she said What Tess shan t we talk to father never no more But father was only a little bit ill exclaimed Tess distractedly Liza Lu came up He dropped down just now and the doctor who was there for mother said there was no chance for him because his heart was growed in Yes the Durbeyfield couple had changed places the dying one was out of danger and the indisposed one was dead The news meant even more than it sounded Her father s life had a value apart from his personal achievements or perhaps it would not have had much It was the last of the three lives for whose duration the house and premises were held under a lease and it had long been coveted by the tenant farmer for his regular labourers who were stinted in cottage accommodation Moreover liviers were disapproved of in villages almost as much as little freeholders because of their independence of manner and when a lease determined it was never renewed Thus the Durbeyfields once d Urbervilles saw descending upon them the destiny which no doubt when they were among the Olympians of the county they had caused to descend many a time and severely enough upon the heads of such landless ones as they themselves were now So do flux and reflux the rhythm of change alternate and persist in everything under the sky LI At length it was the eve of Old Lady Day and the agricultural world was in a fever of mobility such as only occurs at that particular date of the year It is a day of fulfilment agreements for outdoor service during the ensuing year entered into at Candlemas are to be now carried out The labourers or work folk as they used to call themselves immemorially till the other word was introduced from without who wish to remain no longer in old places are removing to the new farms These annual migrations from farm to farm were on the increase here When Tess s mother was a child the majority of the field folk about Marlott had remained all their lives on one farm which had been the home also of their fathers and grandfathers but latterly the desire for yearly removal had risen to a high pitch With the younger families it was a pleasant excitement which might possibly be an advantage The Egypt of one family was the Land of Promise to the family who saw it from a distance till by residence there it became it turn their Egypt also and so they changed and changed However all the mutations so increasingly discernible in village life did not originate entirely in the agricultural unrest A depopulation was also going on The village had formerly contained side by side with the argicultural labourers an interesting and better informed class ranking distinctly above the former the class to which Tess s father and mother had belonged and including the carpenter the smith the shoemaker the huckster together with nondescript workers other than farm labourers a set of people who owed a certain stability of aim and conduct to the fact of their being lifeholders like Tess s father or copyholders or occasionally small freeholders But as the long holdings fell in they were seldom again let to similar tenants and were mostly pulled down if not absolutely required by the farmer for his hands Cottagers who were not directly employed on the land were looked upon with disfavour and the banishment of some starved the trade of others who were thus obliged to follow These families who had formed the backbone of the village life in the past who were the depositaries of the village traditions had to seek refuge in the large centres the process humorously designated by statisticians as the tendency of the rural population towards the large towns being really the tendency of water to flow uphill when forced by machinery The cottage accommodation at Marlott having been in this manner considerably curtailed by demolitions every house which remained standing was required by the agriculturist for his work people Ever since the occurrence of the event which had cast such a shadow over Tess s life the Durbeyfield family whose descent was not credited had been tacitly looked on as one which would have to go when their lease ended if only in the interests of morality It was indeed quite true that the household had not been shining examples either of temperance soberness or chastity The father and even the mother had got drunk at times the younger children seldom had gone to church and the eldest daughter had made queer unions By some means the village had to be kept pure So on this the first Lady Day on which the Durbeyfields were expellable the house being roomy was required for a carter with a large family and Widow Joan her daughters Tess and Liza Lu the boy Abraham and the younger children had to go elsewhere On the evening preceding their removal it was getting dark betimes by reason of a drizzling rain which blurred the sky As it was the last night they would spend in the village which had been their home and birthplace missus Durbeyfield Liza Lu and Abraham had gone out to bid some friends goodbye and Tess was keeping house till they should return She was kneeling in the window bench her face close to the casement where an outer pane of rain water was sliding down the inner pane of glass Her eyes rested on the web of a spider probably starved long ago which had been mistakenly placed in a corner where no flies ever came and shivered in the slight draught through the casement Tess was reflecting on the position of the household in which she perceived her own evil influence Had she not come home her mother and the children might probably have been allowed to stay on as weekly tenants But she had been observed almost immediately on her return by some people of scrupulous character and great influence they had seen her idling in the churchyard restoring as well as she could with a little trowel a baby s obliterated grave By this means they had found that she was living here again her mother was scolded for harbouring her sharp retorts had ensued from Joan who had independently offered to leave at once she had been taken at her word and here was the result I ought never to have come home said Tess to herself bitterly She was so intent upon these thoughts that she hardly at first took note of a man in a white mackintosh whom she saw riding down the street Possibly it was owing to her face being near to the pane that he saw her so quickly and directed his horse so close to the cottage front that his hoofs were almost upon the narrow border for plants growing under the wall It was not till he touched the window with his riding crop that she observed him The rain had nearly ceased and she opened the casement in obedience to his gesture Didn t you see me asked d Urberville I was not attending she said I heard you I believe though I fancied it was a carriage and horses I was in a sort of dream Ah you heard the d Urberville Coach perhaps You know the legend I suppose No My somebody was going to tell it me once but didn t If you are a genuine d Urberville I ought not to tell you either I suppose As for me I m a sham one so it doesn t matter It is rather dismal It is that this sound of a non existent coach can only be heard by one of d Urberville blood and it is held to be of ill omen to the one who hears it It has to do with a murder committed by one of the family centuries ago Now you have begun it finish it Very well One of the family is said to have abducted some beautiful woman who tried to escape from the coach in which he was carrying her off and in the struggle he killed her or she killed him I forget which Such is one version of the tale I see that your tubs and buckets are packed Going away aren t you Yes to morrow Old Lady Day I heard you were but could hardly believe it it seems so sudden Why is it Father s was the last life on the property and when that dropped we had no further right to stay Though we might perhaps have stayed as weekly tenants if it had not been for me What about you I am not a proper woman D Urberville s face flushed What a blasted shame Miserable snobs May their dirty souls be burnt to cinders he exclaimed in tones of ironic resentment That s why you are going is it Turned out We are not turned out exactly but as they said we should have to go soon it was best to go now everybody was moving because there are better chances Where are you going to Kingsbere We have taken rooms there Mother is so foolish about father s people that she will go there But your mother s family are not fit for lodgings and in a little hole of a town like that Now why not come to my garden house at Trantridge There are hardly any poultry now since my mother s death but there s the house as you know it and the garden It can be whitewashed in a day and your mother can live there quite comfortably and I will put the children to a good school Really I ought to do something for you But we have already taken the rooms at Kingsbere she declared And we can wait there Wait what for For that nice husband no doubt Now look here Tess I know what men are and bearing in mind the grounds of your separation I am quite positive he will never make it up with you Now though I have been your enemy I am your friend even if you won t believe it Come to this cottage of mine We ll get up a regular colony of fowls and your mother can attend to them excellently and the children can go to school Tess breathed more and more quickly and at length she said How do I know that you would do all this Your views may change and then we should be my mother would be homeless again O no no I would guarantee you against such as that in writing if necessary Think it over Tess shook her head But d Urberville persisted she had seldom seen him so determined he would not take a negative Please just tell your mother he said in emphatic tones It is her business to judge not yours I shall get the house swept out and whitened to morrow morning and fires lit and it will be dry by the evening so that you can come straight there Now mind I shall expect you Tess again shook her head her throat swelling with complicated emotion She could not look up at d Urberville I owe you something for the past you know he resumed And you cured me too of that craze so I am glad I would rather you had kept the craze so that you had kept the practice which went with it I am glad of this opportunity of repaying you a little To morrow I shall expect to hear your mother s goods unloading Give me your hand on it now dear beautiful Tess With the last sentence he had dropped his voice to a murmur and put his hand in at the half open casement With stormy eyes she pulled the stay bar quickly and in doing so caught his arm between the casement and the stone mullion Damnation you are very cruel he said snatching out his arm No no I know you didn t do it on purpose Well I shall expect you or your mother and children at least I shall not come I have plenty of money she cried Where At my father in law s if I ask for it IF you ask for it But you won t Tess I know you you ll never ask for it you ll starve first With these words he rode off Just at the corner of the street he met the man with the paint pot who asked him if he had deserted the brethren You go to the devil said d Urberville Tess remained where she was a long while till a sudden rebellious sense of injustice caused the region of her eyes to swell with the rush of hot tears thither Her husband Angel Clare himself had like others dealt out hard measure to her surely he had She had never before admitted such a thought but he had surely Never in her life she could swear it from the bottom of her soul had she ever intended to do wrong yet these hard judgements had come Whatever her sins they were not sins of intention but of inadvertence and why should she have been punished so persistently She passionately seized the first piece of paper that came to hand and scribbled the following lines O why have you treated me so monstrously Angel I do not deserve it I have thought it all over carefully and I can never never forgive you You know that I did not intend to wrong you why have you so wronged me You are cruel cruel indeed I will try to forget you It is all injustice I have received at your hands T She watched till the postman passed by ran out to him with her epistle and then again took her listless place inside the window panes It was just as well to write like that as to write tenderly How could he give way to entreaty The facts had not changed there was no new event to alter his opinion It grew darker the fire light shining over the room The two biggest of the younger children had gone out with their mother the four smallest their ages ranging from three and a half years to eleven all in black frocks were gathered round the hearth babbling their own little subjects Tess at length joined them without lighting a candle This is the last night that we shall sleep here dears in the house where we were born she said quickly We ought to think of it oughtn t we They all became silent with the impressibility of their age they were ready to burst into tears at the picture of finality she had conjured up though all the day hitherto they had been rejoicing in the idea of a new place Tess changed the subject Sing to me dears she said What shall we sing Anything you know I don t mind There was a momentary pause it was broken first in one little tentative note then a second voice strengthened it and a third and a fourth chimed in unison with words they had learnt at the Sunday school Here we suffer grief and pain Here we meet to part again In Heaven we part no more The four sang on with the phlegmatic passivity of persons who had long ago settled the question and there being no mistake about it felt that further thought was not required With features strained hard to enunciate the syllables they continued to regard the centre of the flickering fire the notes of the youngest straying over into the pauses of the rest Tess turned from them and went to the window again Darkness had now fallen without but she put her face to the pane as though to peer into the gloom It was really to hide her tears If she could only believe what the children were singing if she were only sure how different all would now be how confidently she would leave them to Providence and their future kingdom But in default of that it behoved her to do something to be their Providence for to Tess as to not a few millions of others there was ghastly satire in the poet s lines Not in utter nakedness But trailing clouds of glory do we come To her and her like birth itself was an ordeal of degrading personal compulsion whose gratuitousness nothing in the result seemed to justify and at best could only palliate In the shades of the wet road she soon discerned her mother with tall Liza Lu and Abraham missus Durbeyfield s pattens clicked up to the door and Tess opened it I see the tracks of a horse outside the window said Joan Hev somebody called No said Tess The children by the fire looked gravely at her and one murmured Why Tess the gentleman a horseback He didn t call said Tess He spoke to me in passing Who was the gentleman asked the mother Your husband No He ll never never come answered Tess in stony hopelessness Then who was it Oh you needn t ask You ve seen him before and so have I Ah What did he say said Joan curiously I will tell you when we are settled in our lodging at Kingsbere to morrow every word It was not her husband she had said Yet a consciousness that in a physical sense this man alone was her husband seemed to weigh on her more and more LII During the small hours of the next morning while it was still dark dwellers near the highways were conscious of a disturbance of their night s rest by rumbling noises intermittently continuing till daylight noises as certain to recur in this particular first week of the month as the voice of the cuckoo in the third week of the same They were the preliminaries of the general removal the passing of the empty waggons and teams to fetch the goods of the migrating families for it was always by the vehicle of the farmer who required his services that the hired man was conveyed to his destination That this might be accomplished within the day was the explanation of the reverberation occurring so soon after midnight the aim of the carters being to reach the door of the outgoing households by six o clock when the loading of their movables at once began But to Tess and her mother s household no such anxious farmer sent his team They were only women they were not regular labourers they were not particularly required anywhere hence they had to hire a waggon at their own expense and got nothing sent gratuitously It was a relief to Tess when she looked out of the window that morning to find that though the weather was windy and louring it did not rain and that the waggon had come A wet Lady Day was a spectre which removing families never forgot damp furniture damp bedding damp clothing accompanied it and left a train of ills Her mother Liza Lu and Abraham were also awake but the younger children were let sleep on The four breakfasted by the thin light and the house ridding was taken in hand It proceeded with some cheerfulness a friendly neighbour or two assisting When the large articles of furniture had been packed in position a circular nest was made of the beds and bedding in which Joan Durbeyfield and the young children were to sit through the journey After loading there was a long delay before the horses were brought these having been unharnessed during the ridding but at length about two o clock the whole was under way the cooking pot swinging from the axle of the waggon missus Durbeyfield and family at the top the matron having in her lap to prevent injury to its works the head of the clock which at any exceptional lurch of the waggon struck one or one and a half in hurt tones Tess and the next eldest girl walked alongside till they were out of the village They had called on a few neighbours that morning and the previous evening and some came to see them off all wishing them well though in their secret hearts hardly expecting welfare possible to such a family harmless as the Durbeyfields were to all except themselves Soon the equipage began to ascend to higher ground and the wind grew keener with the change of level and soil The day being the sixth of April the Durbeyfield waggon met many other waggons with families on the summit of the load which was built on a wellnigh unvarying principle as peculiar probably to the rural labourer as the hexagon to the bee The groundwork of the arrangement was the family dresser which with its shining handles and finger marks and domestic evidences thick upon it stood importantly in front over the tails of the shaft horses in its erect and natural position like some Ark of the Covenant that they were bound to carry reverently Some of the households were lively some mournful some were stopping at the doors of wayside inns where in due time the Durbeyfield menagerie also drew up to bait horses and refresh the travellers During the halt Tess s eyes fell upon a three pint blue mug which was ascending and descending through the air to and from the feminine section of a household sitting on the summit of a load that had also drawn up at a little distance from the same inn She followed one of the mug s journeys upward and perceived it to be clasped by hands whose owner she well knew Tess went towards the waggon Marian and Izz she cried to the girls for it was they sitting with the moving family at whose house they had lodged Are you house ridding to day like everybody else They were they said It had been too rough a life for them at Flintcomb Ash and they had come away almost without notice leaving Groby to prosecute them if he chose They told Tess their destination and Tess told them hers Marian leant over the load and lowered her voice Do you know that the gentleman who follows ee you ll guess who I mean came to ask for ee at Flintcomb after you had gone We didn t tell n where you was knowing you wouldn t wish to see him Ah but I did see him Tess murmured He found me And do he know where you be going I think so Husband come back No She bade her acquaintance goodbye for the respective carters had now come out from the inn and the two waggons resumed their journey in opposite directions the vehicle whereon sat Marian Izz and the ploughman s family with whom they had thrown in their lot being brightly painted and drawn by three powerful horses with shining brass ornaments on their harness while the waggon on which missus Durbeyfield and her family rode was a creaking erection that would scarcely bear the weight of the superincumbent load one which had known no paint since it was made and drawn by two horses only The contrast well marked the difference between being fetched by a thriving farmer and conveying oneself whither no hirer waited one s coming The distance was great too great for a day s journey and it was with the utmost difficulty that the horses performed it Though they had started so early it was quite late in the afternoon when they turned the flank of an eminence which formed part of the upland called Greenhill While the horses stood to stale and breathe themselves Tess looked around Under the hill and just ahead of them was the half dead townlet of their pilgrimage Kingsbere where lay those ancestors of whom her father had spoken and sung to painfulness Kingsbere the spot of all spots in the world which could be considered the d Urbervilles home since they had resided there for full five hundred years A man could be seen advancing from the outskirts towards them and when he beheld the nature of their waggon load he quickened his steps You be the woman they call missus Durbeyfield I reckon he said to Tess s mother who had descended to walk the remainder of the way She nodded Though widow of the late Sir John d Urberville poor nobleman if I cared for my rights and returning to the domain of his forefathers Oh Well I know nothing about that but if you be missus Durbeyfield I am sent to tell ee that the rooms you wanted be let We didn t know that you was coming till we got your letter this morning when twas too late But no doubt you can get other lodgings somewhere The man had noticed the face of Tess which had become ash pale at his intelligence Her mother looked hopelessly at fault What shall we do now Tess she said bitterly Here s a welcome to your ancestors lands However let s try further They moved on into the town and tried with all their might Tess remaining with the waggon to take care of the children whilst her mother and Liza Lu made inquiries At the last return of Joan to the vehicle an hour later when her search for accommodation had still been fruitless the driver of the waggon said the goods must be unloaded as the horses were half dead and he was bound to return part of the way at least that night Very well unload it here said Joan recklessly I ll get shelter somewhere The waggon had drawn up under the churchyard wall in a spot screened from view and the driver nothing loth soon hauled down the poor heap of household goods This done she paid him reducing herself to almost her last shilling thereby and he moved off and left them only too glad to get out of further dealings with such a family It was a dry night and he guessed that they would come to no harm Tess gazed desperately at the pile of furniture The cold sunlight of this spring evening peered invidiously upon the crocks and kettles upon the bunches of dried herbs shivering in the breeze upon the brass handles of the dresser upon the wicker cradle they had all been rocked in and upon the well rubbed clock case all of which gave out the reproachful gleam of indoor articles abandoned to the vicissitudes of a roofless exposure for which they were never made Round about were deparked hills and slopes now cut up into little paddocks and the green foundations that showed where the d Urberville mansion once had stood also an outlying stretch of Egdon Heath that had always belonged to the estate Hard by the aisle of the church called the d Urberville Aisle looked on imperturbably Isn t your family vault your own freehold said Tess s mother as she returned from a reconnoitre of the church and graveyard Why of course tis and that s where we will camp girls till the place of your ancestors finds us a roof Now Tess and Liza and Abraham you help me We ll make a nest for these children and then we ll have another look round Tess listlessly lent a hand and in a quarter of an hour the old four post bedstead was dissociated from the heap of goods and erected under the south wall of the church the part of the building known as the d Urberville Aisle beneath which the huge vaults lay Over the tester of the bedstead was a beautiful traceried window of many lights its date being the fifteenth century It was called the d Urberville Window and in the upper part could be discerned heraldic emblems like those on Durbeyfield s old seal and spoon Joan drew the curtains round the bed so as to make an excellent tent of it and put the smaller children inside If it comes to the worst we can sleep there too for one night she said But let us try further on and get something for the dears to eat O Tess what s the use of your playing at marrying gentlemen if it leaves us like this Accompanied by Liza Lu and the boy she again ascended the little lane which secluded the church from the townlet As soon as they got into the street they beheld a man on horseback gazing up and down Ah I m looking for you he said riding up to them This is indeed a family gathering on the historic spot It was Alec d Urberville Where is Tess he asked Personally Joan had no liking for Alec She cursorily signified the direction of the church and went on d Urberville saying that he would see them again in case they should be still unsuccessful in their search for shelter of which he had just heard When they had gone d Urberville rode to the inn and shortly after came out on foot In the interim Tess left with the children inside the bedstead remained talking with them awhile till seeing that no more could be done to make them comfortable just then she walked about the churchyard now beginning to be embrowned by the shades of nightfall The door of the church was unfastened and she entered it for the first time in her life Within the window under which the bedstead stood were the tombs of the family covering in their dates several centuries They were canopied altar shaped and plain their carvings being defaced and broken their brasses torn from the matrices the rivet holes remaining like martin holes in a sandcliff Of all the reminders that she had ever received that her people were socially extinct there was none so forcible as this spoliation She drew near to a dark stone on which was inscribed OSTIUM SEPULCHRI ANTIQUAE FAMILIAE D URBERVILLE Tess did not read Church Latin like a Cardinal but she knew that this was the door of her ancestral sepulchre and that the tall knights of whom her father had chanted in his cups lay inside She musingly turned to withdraw passing near an altar tomb the oldest of them all on which was a recumbent figure In the dusk she had not noticed it before and would hardly have noticed it now but for an odd fancy that the effigy moved As soon as she drew close to it she discovered all in a moment that the figure was a living person and the shock to her sense of not having been alone was so violent that she was quite overcome and sank down nigh to fainting not however till she had recognized Alec d Urberville in the form He leapt off the slab and supported her I saw you come in he said smiling and got up there not to interrupt your meditations A family gathering is it not with these old fellows under us here Listen He stamped with his heel heavily on the floor whereupon there arose a hollow echo from below That shook them a bit I ll warrant he continued And you thought I was the mere stone reproduction of one of them But no The old order changeth The little finger of the sham d Urberville can do more for you than the whole dynasty of the real underneath Now command me What shall I do Go away she murmured I will I ll look for your mother said he blandly But in passing her he whispered Mind this you ll be civil yet When he was gone she bent down upon the entrance to the vaults and said Why am I on the wrong side of this door In the meantime Marian and Izz Huett had journeyed onward with the chattels of the ploughman in the direction of their land of Canaan the Egypt of some other family who had left it only that morning But the girls did not for a long time think of where they were going Their talk was of Angel Clare and Tess and Tess s persistent lover whose connection with her previous history they had partly heard and partly guessed ere this Tisn t as though she had never known him afore said Marian His having won her once makes all the difference in the world Twould be a thousand pities if he were to tole her away again mister Clare can never be anything to us Izz and why should we grudge him to her and not try to mend this quarrel If he could on y know what straits she s put to and what s hovering round he might come to take care of his own Could we let him know They thought of this all the way to their destination but the bustle of re establishment in their new place took up all their attention then But when they were settled a month later they heard of Clare s approaching return though they had learnt nothing more of Tess Upon that agitated anew by their attachment to him yet honourably disposed to her Marian uncorked the penny ink bottle they shared and a few lines were concocted between the two girls HONOUR D SIR Look to your Wife if you do love her as much as she do love you For she is sore put to by an Enemy in the shape of a Friend Sir there is one near her who ought to be Away A woman should not be try d beyond her Strength and continual dropping will wear away a Stone ay more a Diamond FROM TWO WELL WISHERS This was addressed to Angel Clare at the only place they had ever heard him to be connected with Emminster Vicarage after which they continued in a mood of emotional exaltation at their own generosity which made them sing in hysterical snatches and weep at the same time END OF PHASE THE SIXTH Phase the Seventh Fulfilment LIII It was evening at Emminster Vicarage The two customary candles were burning under their green shades in the Vicar s study but he had not been sitting there Occasionally he came in stirred the small fire which sufficed for the increasing mildness of the spring and went out again sometimes pausing at the front door going on to the drawing room then returning again to the front door It faced westward and though gloom prevailed inside there was still light enough without to see with distinctness missus Clare who had been sitting in the drawing room followed him hither Plenty of time yet said the Vicar He doesn t reach Chalk Newton till six even if the train should be punctual and ten miles of country road five of them in Crimmercrock Lane are not jogged over in a hurry by our old horse But he has done it in an hour with us my dear Years ago Thus they passed the minutes each well knowing that this was only waste of breath the one essential being simply to wait At length there was a slight noise in the lane and the old pony chaise appeared indeed outside the railings They saw alight therefrom a form which they affected to recognize but would actually have passed by in the street without identifying had he not got out of their carriage at the particular moment when a particular person was due missus Clare rushed through the dark passage to the door and her husband came more slowly after her The new arrival who was just about to enter saw their anxious faces in the doorway and the gleam of the west in their spectacles because they confronted the last rays of day but they could only see his shape against the light O my boy my boy home again at last cried missus Clare who cared no more at that moment for the stains of heterodoxy which had caused all this separation than for the dust upon his clothes What woman indeed among the most faithful adherents of the truth believes the promises and threats of the Word in the sense in which she believes in her own children or would not throw her theology to the wind if weighed against their happiness As soon as they reached the room where the candles were lighted she looked at his face O it is not Angel not my son the Angel who went away she cried in all the irony of sorrow as she turned herself aside His father too was shocked to see him so reduced was that figure from its former contours by worry and the bad season that Clare had experienced in the climate to which he had so rashly hurried in his first aversion to the mockery of events at home You could see the skeleton behind the man and almost the ghost behind the skeleton He matched Crivelli s dead Christus His sunken eye pits were of morbid hue and the light in his eyes had waned The angular hollows and lines of his aged ancestors had succeeded to their reign in his face twenty years before their time I was ill over there you know he said I am all right now As if however to falsify this assertion his legs seemed to give way and he suddenly sat down to save himself from falling It was only a slight attack of faintness resulting from the tedious day s journey and the excitement of arrival Has any letter come for me lately he asked I received the last you sent on by the merest chance and after considerable delay through being inland or I might have come sooner It was from your wife we supposed It was Only one other had recently come They had not sent it on to him knowing he would start for home so soon He hastily opened the letter produced and was much disturbed to read in Tess s handwriting the sentiments expressed in her last hurried scrawl to him O why have you treated me so monstrously Angel I do not deserve it I have thought it all over carefully and I can never never forgive you You know that I did not intend to wrong you why have you so wronged me You are cruel cruel indeed I will try to forget you It is all injustice I have received at your hands T It is quite true said Angel throwing down the letter Perhaps she will never be reconciled to me Don t Angel be so anxious about a mere child of the soil said his mother Child of the soil Well we all are children of the soil I wish she were so in the sense you mean but let me now explain to you what I have never explained before that her father is a descendant in the male line of one of the oldest Norman houses like a good many others who lead obscure agricultural lives in our villages and are dubbed sons of the soil He soon retired to bed and the next morning feeling exceedingly unwell he remained in his room pondering The circumstances amid which he had left Tess were such that though while on the south of the Equator and just in receipt of her loving epistle it had seemed the easiest thing in the world to rush back into her arms the moment he chose to forgive her now that he had arrived it was not so easy as it had seemed She was passionate and her present letter showing that her estimate of him had changed under his delay too justly changed he sadly owned made him ask himself if it would be wise to confront her unannounced in the presence of her parents Supposing that her love had indeed turned to dislike during the last weeks of separation a sudden meeting might lead to bitter words Clare therefore thought it would be best to prepare Tess and her family by sending a line to Marlott announcing his return and his hope that she was still living with them there as he had arranged for her to do when he left England He despatched the inquiry that very day and before the week was out there came a short reply from missus Durbeyfield which did not remove his embarrassment for it bore no address though to his surprise it was not written from Marlott SIR J write these few lines to say that my Daughter is away from me at present and J am not sure when she will return but J will let you know as Soon as she do J do not feel at liberty to tell you Where she is temperly biding J should say that me and my Family have left Marlott for some Time Yours J DURBEYFIELD It was such a relief to Clare to learn that Tess was at least apparently well that her mother s stiff reticence as to her whereabouts did not long distress him They were all angry with him evidently He would wait till missus Durbeyfield could inform him of Tess s return which her letter implied to be soon He deserved no more His had been a love which alters when it alteration finds He had undergone some strange experiences in his absence he had seen the virtual Faustina in the literal Cornelia a spiritual Lucretia in a corporeal Phryne he had thought of the woman taken and set in the midst as one deserving to be stoned and of the wife of Uriah being made a queen and he had asked himself why he had not judged Tess constructively rather than biographically by the will rather than by the deed A day or two passed while he waited at his father s house for the promised second note from Joan Durbeyfield and indirectly to recover a little more strength The strength showed signs of coming back but there was no sign of Joan s letter Then he hunted up the old letter sent on to him in Brazil which Tess had written from Flintcomb Ash and re read it The sentences touched him now as much as when he had first perused them I must cry to you in my trouble I have no one else I think I must die if you do not come soon or tell me to come to you please please not to be just only a little kind to me If you would come I could die in your arms I would be well content to do that if so be you had forgiven me if you will send me one little line and say I am coming soon I will bide on Angel O so cheerfully think how it do hurt my heart not to see you ever ever Ah if I could only make your dear heart ache one little minute of each day as mine does every day and all day long it might lead you to show pity to your poor lonely one I would be content ay glad to live with you as your servant if I may not as your wife so that I could only be near you and get glimpses of you and think of you as mine I long for only one thing in heaven or earth or under the earth to meet you my own dear Come to me come to me and save me from what threatens me Clare determined that he would no longer believe in her more recent and severer regard of him but would go and find her immediately He asked his father if she had applied for any money during his absence His father returned a negative and then for the first time it occurred to Angel that her pride had stood in her way and that she had suffered privation From his remarks his parents now gathered the real reason of the separation and their Christianity was such that reprobates being their especial care the tenderness towards Tess which her blood her simplicity even her poverty had not engendered was instantly excited by her sin Whilst he was hastily packing together a few articles for his journey he glanced over a poor plain missive also lately come to hand the one from Marian and Izz Huett beginning Honour d Sir Look to your Wife if you do love her as much as she do love you and signed From Two Well Wishers LIV In a quarter of an hour Clare was leaving the house whence his mother watched his thin figure as it disappeared into the street He had declined to borrow his father s old mare well knowing of its necessity to the household He went to the inn where he hired a trap and could hardly wait during the harnessing In a very few minutes after he was driving up the hill out of the town which three or four months earlier in the year Tess had descended with such hopes and ascended with such shattered purposes Benvill Lane soon stretched before him its hedges and trees purple with buds but he was looking at other things and only recalled himself to the scene sufficiently to enable him to keep the way In something less than an hour and a half he had skirted the south of the King s Hintock estates and ascended to the untoward solitude of Cross in Hand the unholy stone whereon Tess had been compelled by Alec d Urberville in his whim of reformation to swear the strange oath that she would never wilfully tempt him again The pale and blasted nettle stems of the preceding year even now lingered nakedly in the banks young green nettles of the present spring growing from their roots Thence he went along the verge of the upland overhanging the other Hintocks and turning to the right plunged into the bracing calcareous region of Flintcomb Ash the address from which she had written to him in one of the letters and which he supposed to be the place of sojourn referred to by her mother Here of course he did not find her and what added to his depression was the discovery that no missus Clare had ever been heard of by the cottagers or by the farmer himself though Tess was remembered well enough by her Christian name His name she had obviously never used during their separation and her dignified sense of their total severance was shown not much less by this abstention than by the hardships she had chosen to undergo of which he now learnt for the first time rather than apply to his father for more funds From this place they told him Tess Durbeyfield had gone without due notice to the home of her parents on the other side of Blackmoor and it therefore became necessary to find missus Durbeyfield She had told him she was not now at Marlott but had been curiously reticent as to her actual address and the only course was to go to Marlott and inquire for it The farmer who had been so churlish with Tess was quite smooth tongued to Clare and lent him a horse and man to drive him towards Marlott the gig he had arrived in being sent back to Emminster for the limit of a day s journey with that horse was reached Clare would not accept the loan of the farmer s vehicle for a further distance than to the outskirts of the Vale and sending it back with the man who had driven him he put up at an inn and next day entered on foot the region wherein was the spot of his dear Tess s birth It was as yet too early in the year for much colour to appear in the gardens and foliage the so called spring was but winter overlaid with a thin coat of greenness and it was of a parcel with his expectations The house in which Tess had passed the years of her childhood was now inhabited by another family who had never known her The new residents were in the garden taking as much interest in their own doings as if the homestead had never passed its primal time in conjunction with the histories of others beside which the histories of these were but as a tale told by an idiot They walked about the garden paths with thoughts of their own concerns entirely uppermost bringing their actions at every moment in jarring collision with the dim ghosts behind them talking as though the time when Tess lived there were not one whit intenser in story than now Even the spring birds sang over their heads as if they thought there was nobody missing in particular On inquiry of these precious innocents to whom even the name of their predecessors was a failing memory Clare learned that John Durbeyfield was dead that his widow and children had left Marlott declaring that they were going to live at Kingsbere but instead of doing so had gone on to another place they mentioned By this time Clare abhorred the house for ceasing to contain Tess and hastened away from its hated presence without once looking back His way was by the field in which he had first beheld her at the dance It was as bad as the house even worse He passed on through the churchyard where amongst the new headstones he saw one of a somewhat superior design to the rest The inscription ran thus In memory of John Durbeyfield rightly d Urberville of the once powerful family of that Name and Direct Descendant through an illustrious Line from Sir Pagan d Urberville one of the Knights of the Conqueror Died March tenth eighteen HOW ARE THE MIGHTY FALLEN Some man apparently the sexton had observed Clare standing there and drew nigh Ah sir now that s a man who didn t want to lie here but wished to be carried to Kingsbere where his ancestors be And why didn t they respect his wish Oh no money Bless your soul sir why there I wouldn t wish to say it everywhere but even this headstone for all the flourish wrote upon en is not paid for Ah who put it up The man told the name of a mason in the village and on leaving the churchyard Clare called at the mason s house He found that the statement was true and paid the bill This done he turned in the direction of the migrants The distance was too long for a walk but Clare felt such a strong desire for isolation that at first he would neither hire a conveyance nor go to a circuitous line of railway by which he might eventually reach the place At Shaston however he found he must hire but the way was such that he did not enter Joan s place till about seven o clock in the evening having traversed a distance of over twenty miles since leaving Marlott The village being small he had little difficulty in finding missus Durbeyfield s tenement which was a house in a walled garden remote from the main road where she had stowed away her clumsy old furniture as best she could It was plain that for some reason or other she had not wished him to visit her and he felt his call to be somewhat of an intrusion She came to the door herself and the light from the evening sky fell upon her face This was the first time that Clare had ever met her but he was too preoccupied to observe more than that she was still a handsome woman in the garb of a respectable widow He was obliged to explain that he was Tess s husband and his object in coming there and he did it awkwardly enough I want to see her at once he added You said you would write to me again but you have not done so Because she ve not come home said Joan Do you know if she is well I don t But you ought to sir said she I admit it Where is she staying From the beginning of the interview Joan had disclosed her embarrassment by keeping her hand to the side of her cheek I don t know exactly where she is staying she answered She was but Where was she Well she is not there now In her evasiveness she paused again and the younger children had by this time crept to the door where pulling at his mother s skirts the youngest murmured Is this the gentleman who is going to marry Tess He has married her Joan whispered Go inside Clare saw her efforts for reticence and asked Do you think Tess would wish me to try and find her If not of course I don t think she would Are you sure I am sure she wouldn t He was turning away and then he thought of Tess s tender letter I am sure she would he retorted passionately I know her better than you do That s very likely sir for I have never really known her Please tell me her address missus Durbeyfield in kindness to a lonely wretched man Tess s mother again restlessly swept her cheek with her vertical hand and seeing that he suffered she at last said is a low voice She is at Sandbourne Ah where there Sandbourne has become a large place they say I don t know more particularly than I have said Sandbourne For myself I was never there It was apparent that Joan spoke the truth in this and he pressed her no further Are you in want of anything he said gently No sir she replied We are fairly well provided for Without entering the house Clare turned away There was a station three miles ahead and paying off his coachman he walked thither The last train to Sandbourne left shortly after and it bore Clare on its wheels LV At eleven o clock that night having secured a bed at one of the hotels and telegraphed his address to his father immediately on his arrival he walked out into the streets of Sandbourne It was too late to call on or inquire for any one and he reluctantly postponed his purpose till the morning But he could not retire to rest just yet This fashionable watering place with its eastern and its western stations its piers its groves of pines its promenades and its covered gardens was to Angel Clare like a fairy place suddenly created by the stroke of a wand and allowed to get a little dusty An outlying eastern tract of the enormous Egdon Waste was close at hand yet on the very verge of that tawny piece of antiquity such a glittering novelty as this pleasure city had chosen to spring up Within the space of a mile from its outskirts every irregularity of the soil was prehistoric every channel an undisturbed British trackway not a sod having been turned there since the days of the Caesars Yet the exotic had grown here suddenly as the prophet s gourd and had drawn hither Tess By the midnight lamps he went up and down the winding way of this new world in an old one and could discern between the trees and against the stars the lofty roofs chimneys gazebos and towers of the numerous fanciful residences of which the place was composed It was a city of detached mansions a Mediterranean lounging place on the English Channel and as seen now by night it seemed even more imposing than it was The sea was near at hand but not intrusive it murmured and he thought it was the pines the pines murmured in precisely the same tones and he thought they were the sea Where could Tess possibly be a cottage girl his young wife amidst all this wealth and fashion The more he pondered the more was he puzzled Were there any cows to milk here There certainly were no fields to till She was most probably engaged to do something in one of these large houses and he sauntered along looking at the chamber windows and their lights going out one by one and wondered which of them might be hers Conjecture was useless and just after twelve o clock he entered and went to bed Before putting out his light he re read Tess s impassioned letter Sleep however he could not so near her yet so far from her and he continually lifted the window blind and regarded the backs of the opposite houses and wondered behind which of the sashes she reposed at that moment He might almost as well have sat up all night In the morning he arose at seven and shortly after went out taking the direction of the chief post office At the door he met an intelligent postman coming out with letters for the morning delivery Do you know the address of a missus Clare asked Angel The postman shook his head Then remembering that she would have been likely to continue the use of her maiden name Clare said Of a Miss Durbeyfield Durbeyfield This also was strange to the postman addressed There s visitors coming and going every day as you know sir he said and without the name of the house tis impossible to find em One of his comrades hastening out at that moment the name was repeated to him I know no name of Durbeyfield but there is the name of d Urberville at The Herons said the second That s it cried Clare pleased to think that she had reverted to the real pronunciation What place is The Herons A stylish lodging house Tis all lodging houses here bless ee Clare received directions how to find the house and hastened thither arriving with the milkman The Herons though an ordinary villa stood in its own grounds and was certainly the last place in which one would have expected to find lodgings so private was its appearance If poor Tess was a servant here as he feared she would go to the back door to that milkman and he was inclined to go thither also However in his doubts he turned to the front and rang The hour being early the landlady herself opened the door Clare inquired for Teresa d Urberville or Durbeyfield missus d Urberville Yes Tess then passed as a married woman and he felt glad even though she had not adopted his name Will you kindly tell her that a relative is anxious to see her It is rather early What name shall I give sir Angel mister Angel No Angel It is my Christian name She ll understand I ll see if she is awake He was shown into the front room the dining room and looked out through the spring curtains at the little lawn and the rhododendrons and other shrubs upon it Obviously her position was by no means so bad as he had feared and it crossed his mind that she must somehow have claimed and sold the jewels to attain it He did not blame her for one moment Soon his sharpened ear detected footsteps upon the stairs at which his heart thumped so painfully that he could hardly stand firm Dear me what will she think of me so altered as I am he said to himself and the door opened Tess appeared on the threshold not at all as he had expected to see her bewilderingly otherwise indeed Her great natural beauty was if not heightened rendered more obvious by her attire She was loosely wrapped in a cashmere dressing gown of gray white embroidered in half mourning tints and she wore slippers of the same hue Her neck rose out of a frill of down and her well remembered cable of dark brown hair was partially coiled up in a mass at the back of her head and partly hanging on her shoulder the evident result of haste He had held out his arms but they had fallen again to his side for she had not come forward remaining still in the opening of the doorway Mere yellow skeleton that he was now he felt the contrast between them and thought his appearance distasteful to her Tess he said huskily can you forgive me for going away Can t you come to me How do you get to be like this It is too late said she her voice sounding hard through the room her eyes shining unnaturally I did not think rightly of you I did not see you as you were he continued to plead I have learnt to since dearest Tessy mine Too late too late she said waving her hand in the impatience of a person whose tortures cause every instant to seem an hour Don t come close to me Angel No you must not Keep away But don t you love me my dear wife because I have been so pulled down by illness You are not so fickle I am come on purpose for you my mother and father will welcome you now Yes O yes yes But I say I say it is too late She seemed to feel like a fugitive in a dream who tries to move away but cannot Don t you know all don t you know it Yet how do you come here if you do not know I inquired here and there and I found the way I waited and waited for you she went on her tones suddenly resuming their old fluty pathos But you did not come And I wrote to you and you did not come He kept on saying you would never come any more and that I was a foolish woman He was very kind to me and to mother and to all of us after father s death He I don t understand He has won me back to him Clare looked at her keenly then gathering her meaning flagged like one plague stricken and his glance sank it fell on her hands which once rosy were now white and more delicate She continued He is upstairs I hate him now because he told me a lie that you would not come again and you HAVE come These clothes are what he s put upon me I didn t care what he did wi me But will you go away Angel please and never come any more They stood fixed their baffled hearts looking out of their eyes with a joylessness pitiful to see Both seemed to implore something to shelter them from reality Ah it is my fault said Clare But he could not get on Speech was as inexpressive as silence But he had a vague consciousness of one thing though it was not clear to him till later that his original Tess had spiritually ceased to recognize the body before him as hers allowing it to drift like a corpse upon the current in a direction dissociated from its living will A few instants passed and he found that Tess was gone His face grew colder and more shrunken as he stood concentrated on the moment and a minute or two after he found himself in the street walking along he did not know whither LVI missus Brooks the lady who was the householder at The Herons and owner of all the handsome furniture was not a person of an unusually curious turn of mind She was too deeply materialized poor woman by her long and enforced bondage to that arithmetical demon Profit and Loss to retain much curiousity for its own sake and apart from possible lodgers pockets Nevertheless the visit of Angel Clare to her well paying tenants mister and missus d Urberville as she deemed them was sufficiently exceptional in point of time and manner to reinvigorate the feminine proclivity which had been stifled down as useless save in its bearings to the letting trade Tess had spoken to her husband from the doorway without entering the dining room and missus Brooks who stood within the partly closed door of her own sitting room at the back of the passage could hear fragments of the conversation if conversation it could be called between those two wretched souls She heard Tess re ascend the stairs to the first floor and the departure of Clare and the closing of the front door behind him Then the door of the room above was shut and missus Brooks knew that Tess had re entered her apartment As the young lady was not fully dressed missus Brooks knew that she would not emerge again for some time She accordingly ascended the stairs softly and stood at the door of the front room a drawing room connected with the room immediately behind it which was a bedroom by folding doors in the common manner This first floor containing missus Brooks s best apartments had been taken by the week by the d Urbervilles The back room was now in silence but from the drawing room there came sounds All that she could at first distinguish of them was one syllable continually repeated in a low note of moaning as if it came from a soul bound to some Ixionian wheel O O O Then a silence then a heavy sigh and again O O O The landlady looked through the keyhole Only a small space of the room inside was visible but within that space came a corner of the breakfast table which was already spread for the meal and also a chair beside Over the seat of the chair Tess s face was bowed her posture being a kneeling one in front of it her hands were clasped over her head the skirts of her dressing gown and the embroidery of her night gown flowed upon the floor behind her and her stockingless feet from which the slippers had fallen protruded upon the carpet It was from her lips that came the murmur of unspeakable despair Then a man s voice from the adjoining bedroom What s the matter She did not answer but went on in a tone which was a soliloquy rather than an exclamation and a dirge rather than a soliloquy missus Brooks could only catch a portion And then my dear dear husband came home to me and I did not know it And you had used your cruel persuasion upon me you did not stop using it no you did not stop My little sisters and brothers and my mother s needs they were the things you moved me by and you said my husband would never come back never and you taunted me and said what a simpleton I was to expect him And at last I believed you and gave way And then he came back Now he is gone Gone a second time and I have lost him now for ever and he will not love me the littlest bit ever any more only hate me O yes I have lost him now again because of you In writhing with her head on the chair she turned her face towards the door and missus Brooks could see the pain upon it and that her lips were bleeding from the clench of her teeth upon them and that the long lashes of her closed eyes stuck in wet tags to her cheeks She continued And he is dying he looks as if he is dying And my sin will kill him and not kill me O you have torn my life all to pieces made me be what I prayed you in pity not to make me be again My own true husband will never never O God I can t bear this I cannot There were more and sharper words from the man then a sudden rustle she had sprung to her feet missus Brooks thinking that the speaker was coming to rush out of the door hastily retreated down the stairs She need not have done so however for the door of the sitting room was not opened But missus Brooks felt it unsafe to watch on the landing again and entered her own parlour below She could hear nothing through the floor although she listened intently and thereupon went to the kitchen to finish her interrupted breakfast Coming up presently to the front room on the ground floor she took up some sewing waiting for her lodgers to ring that she might take away the breakfast which she meant to do herself to discover what was the matter if possible Overhead as she sat she could now hear the floorboards slightly creak as if some one were walking about and presently the movement was explained by the rustle of garments against the banisters the opening and the closing of the front door and the form of Tess passing to the gate on her way into the street She was fully dressed now in the walking costume of a well to do young lady in which she had arrived with the sole addition that over her hat and black feathers a veil was drawn missus Brooks had not been able to catch any word of farewell temporary or otherwise between her tenants at the door above They might have quarrelled or mister d Urberville might still be asleep for he was not an early riser She went into the back room which was more especially her own apartment and continued her sewing there The lady lodger did not return nor did the gentleman ring his bell missus Brooks pondered on the delay and on what probable relation the visitor who had called so early bore to the couple upstairs In reflecting she leant back in her chair As she did so her eyes glanced casually over the ceiling till they were arrested by a spot in the middle of its white surface which she had never noticed there before It was about the size of a wafer when she first observed it but it speedily grew as large as the palm of her hand and then she could perceive that it was red The oblong white ceiling with this scarlet blot in the midst had the appearance of a gigantic ace of hearts missus Brooks had strange qualms of misgiving She got upon the table and touched the spot in the ceiling with her fingers It was damp and she fancied that it was a blood stain Descending from the table she left the parlour and went upstairs intending to enter the room overhead which was the bedchamber at the back of the drawing room But nerveless woman as she had now become she could not bring herself to attempt the handle She listened The dead silence within was broken only by a regular beat Drip drip drip missus Brooks hastened downstairs opened the front door and ran into the street A man she knew one of the workmen employed at an adjoining villa was passing by and she begged him to come in and go upstairs with her she feared something had happened to one of her lodgers The workman assented and followed her to the landing She opened the door of the drawing room and stood back for him to pass in entering herself behind him The room was empty the breakfast a substantial repast of coffee eggs and a cold ham lay spread upon the table untouched as when she had taken it up excepting that the carving knife was missing She asked the man to go through the folding doors into the adjoining room He opened the doors entered a step or two and came back almost instantly with a rigid face My good God the gentleman in bed is dead I think he has been hurt with a knife a lot of blood had run down upon the floor The alarm was soon given and the house which had lately been so quiet resounded with the tramp of many footsteps a surgeon among the rest The wound was small but the point of the blade had touched the heart of the victim who lay on his back pale fixed dead as if he had scarcely moved after the infliction of the blow In a quarter of an hour the news that a gentleman who was a temporary visitor to the town had been stabbed in his bed spread through every street and villa of the popular watering place LVII Meanwhile Angel Clare had walked automatically along the way by which he had come and entering his hotel sat down over the breakfast staring at nothingness He went on eating and drinking unconsciously till on a sudden he demanded his bill having paid which he took his dressing bag in his hand the only luggage he had brought with him and went out At the moment of his departure a telegram was handed to him a few words from his mother stating that they were glad to know his address and informing him that his brother Cuthbert had proposed to and been accepted by Mercy Chant Clare crumpled up the paper and followed the route to the station reaching it he found that there would be no train leaving for an hour and more He sat down to wait and having waited a quarter of an hour felt that he could wait there no longer Broken in heart and numbed he had nothing to hurry for but he wished to get out of a town which had been the scene of such an experience and turned to walk to the first station onward and let the train pick him up there The highway that he followed was open and at a little distance dipped into a valley across which it could be seen running from edge to edge He had traversed the greater part of this depression and was climbing the western acclivity when pausing for breath he unconsciously looked back Why he did so he could not say but something seemed to impel him to the act The tape like surface of the road diminished in his rear as far as he could see and as he gazed a moving spot intruded on the white vacuity of its perspective It was a human figure running Clare waited with a dim sense that somebody was trying to overtake him The form descending the incline was a woman s yet so entirely was his mind blinded to the idea of his wife s following him that even when she came nearer he did not recognize her under the totally changed attire in which he now beheld her It was not till she was quite close that he could believe her to be Tess I saw you turn away from the station just before I got there and I have been following you all this way She was so pale so breathless so quivering in every muscle that he did not ask her a single question but seizing her hand and pulling it within his arm he led her along To avoid meeting any possible wayfarers he left the high road and took a footpath under some fir trees When they were deep among the moaning boughs he stopped and looked at her inquiringly Angel she said as if waiting for this do you know what I have been running after you for To tell you that I have killed him A pitiful white smile lit her face as she spoke What said he thinking from the strangeness of her manner that she was in some delirium I have done it I don t know how she continued Still I owed it to you and to myself Angel I feared long ago when I struck him on the mouth with my glove that I might do it some day for the trap he set for me in my simple youth and his wrong to you through me He has come between us and ruined us and now he can never do it any more I never loved him at all Angel as I loved you You know it don t you You believe it You didn t come back to me and I was obliged to go back to him Why did you go away why did you when I loved you so I can t think why you did it But I don t blame you only Angel will you forgive me my sin against you now I have killed him I thought as I ran along that you would be sure to forgive me now I have done that It came to me as a shining light that I should get you back that way I could not bear the loss of you any longer you don t know how entirely I was unable to bear your not loving me Say you do now dear dear husband say you do now I have killed him I do love you Tess O I do it is all come back he said tightening his arms round her with fervid pressure But how do you mean you have killed him I mean that I have she murmured in a reverie What bodily Is he dead Yes He heard me crying about you and he bitterly taunted me and called you by a foul name and then I did it My heart could not bear it He had nagged me about you before And then I dressed myself and came away to find you By degrees he was inclined to believe that she had faintly attempted at least what she said she had done and his horror at her impulse was mixed with amazement at the strength of her affection for himself and at the strangeness of its quality which had apparently extinguished her moral sense altogether Unable to realize the gravity of her conduct she seemed at last content and he looked at her as she lay upon his shoulder weeping with happiness and wondered what obscure strain in the d Urberville blood had led to this aberration if it were an aberration There momentarily flashed through his mind that the family tradition of the coach and murder might have arisen because the d Urbervilles had been known to do these things As well as his confused and excited ideas could reason he supposed that in the moment of mad grief of which she spoke her mind had lost its balance and plunged her into this abyss It was very terrible if true if a temporary hallucination sad But anyhow here was this deserted wife of his this passionately fond woman clinging to him without a suspicion that he would be anything to her but a protector He saw that for him to be otherwise was not in her mind within the region of the possible Tenderness was absolutely dominant in Clare at last He kissed her endlessly with his white lips and held her hand and said I will not desert you I will protect you by every means in my power dearest love whatever you may have done or not have done They then walked on under the trees Tess turning her head every now and then to look at him Worn and unhandsome as he had become it was plain that she did not discern the least fault in his appearance To her he was as of old all that was perfection personally and mentally He was still her Antinous her Apollo even his sickly face was beautiful as the morning to her affectionate regard on this day no less than when she first beheld him for was it not the face of the one man on earth who had loved her purely and who had believed in her as pure With an instinct as to possibilities he did not now as he had intended make for the first station beyond the town but plunged still farther under the firs which here abounded for miles Each clasping the other round the waist they promenaded over the dry bed of fir needles thrown into a vague intoxicating atmosphere at the consciousness of being together at last with no living soul between them ignoring that there was a corpse Thus they proceeded for several miles till Tess arousing herself looked about her and said timidly Are we going anywhere in particular I don t know dearest Why I don t know Well we might walk a few miles further and when it is evening find lodgings somewhere or other in a lonely cottage perhaps Can you walk well Tessy O yes I could walk for ever and ever with your arm round me Upon the whole it seemed a good thing to do Thereupon they quickened their pace avoiding high roads and following obscure paths tending more or less northward But there was an unpractical vagueness in their movements throughout the day neither one of them seemed to consider any question of effectual escape disguise or long concealment Their every idea was temporary and unforefending like the plans of two children At mid day they drew near to a roadside inn and Tess would have entered it with him to get something to eat but he persuaded her to remain among the trees and bushes of this half woodland half moorland part of the country till he should come back Her clothes were of recent fashion even the ivory handled parasol that she carried was of a shape unknown in the retired spot to which they had now wandered and the cut of such articles would have attracted attention in the settle of a tavern He soon returned with food enough for half a dozen people and two bottles of wine enough to last them for a day or more should any emergency arise They sat down upon some dead boughs and shared their meal Between one and two o clock they packed up the remainder and went on again I feel strong enough to walk any distance said she I think we may as well steer in a general way towards the interior of the country where we can hide for a time and are less likely to be looked for than anywhere near the coast Clare remarked Later on when they have forgotten us we can make for some port She made no reply to this beyond that of grasping him more tightly and straight inland they went Though the season was an English May the weather was serenely bright and during the afternoon it was quite warm Through the latter miles of their walk their footpath had taken them into the depths of the New Forest and towards evening turning the corner of a lane they perceived behind a brook and bridge a large board on which was painted in white letters This desirable Mansion to be Let Furnished particulars following with directions to apply to some London agents Passing through the gate they could see the house an old brick building of regular design and large accommodation I know it said Clare It is Bramshurst Court You can see that it is shut up and grass is growing on the drive Some of the windows are open said Tess Just to air the rooms I suppose All these rooms empty and we without a roof to our heads You are getting tired my Tess he said We ll stop soon And kissing her sad mouth he again led her onwards He was growing weary likewise for they had wandered a dozen or fifteen miles and it became necessary to consider what they should do for rest They looked from afar at isolated cottages and little inns and were inclined to approach one of the latter when their hearts failed them and they sheered off At length their gait dragged and they stood still Could we sleep under the trees she asked He thought the season insufficiently advanced I have been thinking of that empty mansion we passed he said Let us go back towards it again They retraced their steps but it was half an hour before they stood without the entrance gate as earlier He then requested her to stay where she was whilst he went to see who was within She sat down among the bushes within the gate and Clare crept towards the house His absence lasted some considerable time and when he returned Tess was wildly anxious not for herself but for him He had found out from a boy that there was only an old woman in charge as caretaker and she only came there on fine days from the hamlet near to open and shut the windows She would come to shut them at sunset Now we can get in through one of the lower windows and rest there said he Under his escort she went tardily forward to the main front whose shuttered windows like sightless eyeballs excluded the possibility of watchers The door was reached a few steps further and one of the windows beside it was open Clare clambered in and pulled Tess in after him Except the hall the rooms were all in darkness and they ascended the staircase Up here also the shutters were tightly closed the ventilation being perfunctorily done for this day at least by opening the hall window in front and an upper window behind Clare unlatched the door of a large chamber felt his way across it and parted the shutters to the width of two or three inches A shaft of dazzling sunlight glanced into the room revealing heavy old fashioned furniture crimson damask hangings and an enormous four post bedstead along the head of which were carved running figures apparently Atalanta s race Rest at last said he setting down his bag and the parcel of viands They remained in great quietness till the caretaker should have come to shut the windows as a precaution putting themselves in total darkness by barring the shutters as before lest the woman should open the door of their chamber for any casual reason Between six and seven o clock she came but did not approach the wing they were in They heard her close the windows fasten them lock the door and go away Then Clare again stole a chink of light from the window and they shared another meal till by and by they were enveloped in the shades of night which they had no candle to disperse LVIII The night was strangely solemn and still In the small hours she whispered to him the whole story of how he had walked in his sleep with her in his arms across the Froom stream at the imminent risk of both their lives and laid her down in the stone coffin at the ruined abbey He had never known of that till now Why didn t you tell me next day he said It might have prevented much misunderstanding and woe Don t think of what s past said she I am not going to think outside of now Why should we Who knows what to morrow has in store But it apparently had no sorrow The morning was wet and foggy and Clare rightly informed that the caretaker only opened the windows on fine days ventured to creep out of their chamber and explore the house leaving Tess asleep There was no food on the premises but there was water and he took advantage of the fog to emerge from the mansion and fetch tea bread and butter from a shop in a little place two miles beyond as also a small tin kettle and spirit lamp that they might get fire without smoke His re entry awoke her and they breakfasted on what he had brought They were indisposed to stir abroad and the day passed and the night following and the next and next till almost without their being aware five days had slipped by in absolute seclusion not a sight or sound of a human being disturbing their peacefulness such as it was The changes of the weather were their only events the birds of the New Forest their only company By tacit consent they hardly once spoke of any incident of the past subsequent to their wedding day The gloomy intervening time seemed to sink into chaos over which the present and prior times closed as if it never had been Whenever he suggested that they should leave their shelter and go forwards towards Southampton or London she showed a strange unwillingness to move Why should we put an end to all that s sweet and lovely she deprecated What must come will come And looking through the shutter chink All is trouble outside there inside here content He peeped out also It was quite true within was affection union error forgiven outside was the inexorable And and she said pressing her cheek against his I fear that what you think of me now may not last I do not wish to outlive your present feeling for me I would rather not I would rather be dead and buried when the time comes for you to despise me so that it may never be known to me that you despised me I cannot ever despise you I also hope that But considering what my life has been I cannot see why any man should sooner or later be able to help despising me How wickedly mad I was Yet formerly I never could bear to hurt a fly or a worm and the sight of a bird in a cage used often to make me cry They remained yet another day In the night the dull sky cleared and the result was that the old caretaker at the cottage awoke early The brilliant sunrise made her unusually brisk she decided to open the contiguous mansion immediately and to air it thoroughly on such a day Thus it occurred that having arrived and opened the lower rooms before six o clock she ascended to the bedchambers and was about to turn the handle of the one wherein they lay At that moment she fancied she could hear the breathing of persons within Her slippers and her antiquity had rendered her progress a noiseless one so far and she made for instant retreat then deeming that her hearing might have deceived her she turned anew to the door and softly tried the handle The lock was out of order but a piece of furniture had been moved forward on the inside which prevented her opening the door more than an inch or two A stream of morning light through the shutter chink fell upon the faces of the pair wrapped in profound slumber Tess s lips being parted like a half opened flower near his cheek The caretaker was so struck with their innocent appearance and with the elegance of Tess s gown hanging across a chair her silk stockings beside it the pretty parasol and the other habits in which she had arrived because she had none else that her first indignation at the effrontery of tramps and vagabonds gave way to a momentary sentimentality over this genteel elopement as it seemed She closed the door and withdrew as softly as she had come to go and consult with her neighbours on the odd discovery Not more than a minute had elapsed after her withdrawal when Tess woke and then Clare Both had a sense that something had disturbed them though they could not say what and the uneasy feeling which it engendered grew stronger As soon as he was dressed he narrowly scanned the lawn through the two or three inches of shutter chink I think we will leave at once said he It is a fine day And I cannot help fancying somebody is about the house At any rate the woman will be sure to come to day She passively assented and putting the room in order they took up the few articles that belonged to them and departed noiselessly When they had got into the Forest she turned to take a last look at the house Ah happy house goodbye she said My life can only be a question of a few weeks Why should we not have stayed there Don t say it Tess We shall soon get out of this district altogether We ll continue our course as we ve begun it and keep straight north Nobody will think of looking for us there We shall be looked for at the Wessex ports if we are sought at all When we are in the north we will get to a port and away Having thus persuaded her the plan was pursued and they kept a bee line northward Their long repose at the manor house lent them walking power now and towards mid day they found that they were approaching the steepled city of Melchester which lay directly in their way He decided to rest her in a clump of trees during the afternoon and push onward under cover of darkness At dusk Clare purchased food as usual and their night march began the boundary between Upper and Mid Wessex being crossed about eight o clock To walk across country without much regard to roads was not new to Tess and she showed her old agility in the performance The intercepting city ancient Melchester they were obliged to pass through in order to take advantage of the town bridge for crossing a large river that obstructed them It was about midnight when they went along the deserted streets lighted fitfully by the few lamps keeping off the pavement that it might not echo their footsteps The graceful pile of cathedral architecture rose dimly on their left hand but it was lost upon them now Once out of the town they followed the turnpike road which after a few miles plunged across an open plain Though the sky was dense with cloud a diffused light from some fragment of a moon had hitherto helped them a little But the moon had now sunk the clouds seemed to settle almost on their heads and the night grew as dark as a cave However they found their way along keeping as much on the turf as possible that their tread might not resound which it was easy to do there being no hedge or fence of any kind All around was open loneliness and black solitude over which a stiff breeze blew They had proceeded thus gropingly two or three miles further when on a sudden Clare became conscious of some vast erection close in his front rising sheer from the grass They had almost struck themselves against it What monstrous place is this said Angel It hums said she Hearken He listened The wind playing upon the edifice produced a booming tune like the note of some gigantic one stringed harp No other sound came from it and lifting his hand and advancing a step or two Clare felt the vertical surface of the structure It seemed to be of solid stone without joint or moulding Carrying his fingers onward he found that what he had come in contact with was a colossal rectangular pillar by stretching out his left hand he could feel a similar one adjoining At an indefinite height overhead something made the black sky blacker which had the semblance of a vast architrave uniting the pillars horizontally They carefully entered beneath and between the surfaces echoed their soft rustle but they seemed to be still out of doors The place was roofless Tess drew her breath fearfully and Angel perplexed said What can it be Feeling sideways they encountered another tower like pillar square and uncompromising as the first beyond it another and another The place was all doors and pillars some connected above by continuous architraves A very Temple of the Winds he said The next pillar was isolated others composed a trilithon others were prostrate their flanks forming a causeway wide enough for a carriage and it was soon obvious that they made up a forest of monoliths grouped upon the grassy expanse of the plain The couple advanced further into this pavilion of the night till they stood in its midst It is Stonehenge said Clare The heathen temple you mean Yes Older than the centuries older than the d Urbervilles Well what shall we do darling We may find shelter further on But Tess really tired by this time flung herself upon an oblong slab that lay close at hand and was sheltered from the wind by a pillar Owing to the action of the sun during the preceding day the stone was warm and dry in comforting contrast to the rough and chill grass around which had damped her skirts and shoes I don t want to go any further Angel she said stretching out her hand for his Can t we bide here I fear not This spot is visible for miles by day although it does not seem so now One of my mother s people was a shepherd hereabouts now I think of it And you used to say at Talbothays that I was a heathen So now I am at home He knelt down beside her outstretched form and put his lips upon hers Sleepy are you dear I think you are lying on an altar I like very much to be here she murmured It is so solemn and lonely after my great happiness with nothing but the sky above my face It seems as if there were no folk in the world but we two and I wish there were not except Liza Lu Clare though she might as well rest here till it should get a little lighter and he flung his overcoat upon her and sat down by her side Angel if anything happens to me will you watch over Liza Lu for my sake she asked when they had listened a long time to the wind among the pillars I will She is so good and simple and pure O Angel I wish you would marry her if you lose me as you will do shortly O if you would If I lose you I lose all And she is my sister in law That s nothing dearest People marry sister laws continually about Marlott and Liza Lu is so gentle and sweet and she is growing so beautiful O I could share you with her willingly when we are spirits If you would train her and teach her Angel and bring her up for your own self She had all the best of me without the bad of me and if she were to become yours it would almost seem as if death had not divided us Well I have said it I won t mention it again She ceased and he fell into thought In the far north east sky he could see between the pillars a level streak of light The uniform concavity of black cloud was lifting bodily like the lid of a pot letting in at the earth s edge the coming day against which the towering monoliths and trilithons began to be blackly defined Did they sacrifice to God here asked she No said he Who to I believe to the sun That lofty stone set away by itself is in the direction of the sun which will presently rise behind it This reminds me dear she said You remember you never would interfere with any belief of mine before we were married But I knew your mind all the same and I thought as you thought not from any reasons of my own but because you thought so Tell me now Angel do you think we shall meet again after we are dead I want to know He kissed her to avoid a reply at such a time O Angel I fear that means no said she with a suppressed sob And I wanted so to see you again so much so much What not even you and I Angel who love each other so well Like a greater than himself to the critical question at the critical time he did not answer and they were again silent In a minute or two her breathing became more regular her clasp of his hand relaxed and she fell asleep The band of silver paleness along the east horizon made even the distant parts of the Great Plain appear dark and near and the whole enormous landscape bore that impress of reserve taciturnity and hesitation which is usual just before day The eastward pillars and their architraves stood up blackly against the light and the great flame shaped Sun stone beyond them and the Stone of Sacrifice midway Presently the night wind died out and the quivering little pools in the cup like hollows of the stones lay still At the same time something seemed to move on the verge of the dip eastward a mere dot It was the head of a man approaching them from the hollow beyond the Sun stone Clare wished they had gone onward but in the circumstances decided to remain quiet The figure came straight towards the circle of pillars in which they were He heard something behind him the brush of feet Turning he saw over the prostrate columns another figure then before he was aware another was at hand on the right under a trilithon and another on the left The dawn shone full on the front of the man westward and Clare could discern from this that he was tall and walked as if trained They all closed in with evident purpose Her story then was true Springing to his feet he looked around for a weapon loose stone means of escape anything By this time the nearest man was upon him It is no use sir he said There are sixteen of us on the Plain and the whole country is reared Let her finish her sleep he implored in a whisper of the men as they gathered round When they saw where she lay which they had not done till then they showed no objection and stood watching her as still as the pillars around He went to the stone and bent over her holding one poor little hand her breathing now was quick and small like that of a lesser creature than a woman All waited in the growing light their faces and hands as if they were silvered the remainder of their figures dark the stones glistening green gray the Plain still a mass of shade Soon the light was strong and a ray shone upon her unconscious form peering under her eyelids and waking her What is it Angel she said starting up Have they come for me Yes dearest he said They have come It is as it should be she murmured Angel I am almost glad yes glad This happiness could not have lasted It was too much I have had enough and now I shall not live for you to despise me She stood up shook herself and went forward neither of the men having moved I am ready she said quietly LIX The city of Wintoncester that fine old city aforetime capital of Wessex lay amidst its convex and concave downlands in all the brightness and warmth of a July morning The gabled brick tile and freestone houses had almost dried off for the season their integument of lichen the streams in the meadows were low and in the sloping High Street from the West Gateway to the mediaeval cross and from the mediaeval cross to the bridge that leisurely dusting and sweeping was in progress which usually ushers in an old fashioned market day From the western gate aforesaid the highway as every Wintoncestrian knows ascends a long and regular incline of the exact length of a measured mile leaving the houses gradually behind Up this road from the precincts of the city two persons were walking rapidly as if unconscious of the trying ascent unconscious through preoccupation and not through buoyancy They had emerged upon this road through a narrow barred wicket in a high wall a little lower down They seemed anxious to get out of the sight of the houses and of their kind and this road appeared to offer the quickest means of doing so Though they were young they walked with bowed heads which gait of grief the sun s rays smiled on pitilessly One of the pair was Angel Clare the other a tall budding creature half girl half woman a spiritualized image of Tess slighter than she but with the same beautiful eyes Clare s sister in law Liza Lu Their pale faces seemed to have shrunk to half their natural size They moved on hand in hand and never spoke a word the drooping of their heads being that of Giotto s Two Apostles When they had nearly reached the top of the great West Hill the clocks in the town struck eight Each gave a start at the notes and walking onward yet a few steps they reached the first milestone standing whitely on the green margin of the grass and backed by the down which here was open to the road They entered upon the turf and impelled by a force that seemed to overrule their will suddenly stood still turned and waited in paralyzed suspense beside the stone The prospect from this summit was almost unlimited In the valley beneath lay the city they had just left its more prominent buildings showing as in an isometric drawing among them the broad cathedral tower with its Norman windows and immense length of aisle and nave the spires of saint Thomas s the pinnacled tower of the College and more to the right the tower and gables of the ancient hospice where to this day the pilgrim may receive his dole of bread and ale Behind the city swept the rotund upland of saint Catherine s Hill further off landscape beyond landscape till the horizon was lost in the radiance of the sun hanging above it Against these far stretches of country rose in front of the other city edifices a large red brick building with level gray roofs and rows of short barred windows bespeaking captivity the whole contrasting greatly by its formalism with the quaint irregularities of the Gothic erections It was somewhat disguised from the road in passing it by yews and evergreen oaks but it was visible enough up here The wicket from which the pair had lately emerged was in the wall of this structure From the middle of the building an ugly flat topped octagonal tower ascended against the east horizon and viewed from this spot on its shady side and against the light it seemed the one blot on the city s beauty Yet it was with this blot and not with the beauty that the two gazers were concerned Upon the cornice of the tower a tall staff was fixed Their eyes were riveted on it A few minutes after the hour had struck something moved slowly up the staff and extended itself upon the breeze It was a black flag Justice was done and the President of the Immortals in Aeschylean phrase had ended his sport with Tess And the d Urberville knights and dames slept on in their tombs unknowing The two speechless gazers bent themselves down to the earth as if in prayer and remained thus a long time absolutely motionless the flag continued to wave silently As soon as they had strength they arose joined hands again and went on END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TESS OF THE D URBERVILLES This file should be named one
