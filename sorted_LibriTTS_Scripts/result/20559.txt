INTRODUCING mister RAFFLES HOLMES It was a blistering night in August All day long the mercury in the thermometer had been flirting with the figures at the top of the tube and the promised shower at night which a mendacious Weather Bureau had been prophesying as a slight mitigation of our sufferings was conspicuous wholly by its absence I had but one comfort in the sweltering hours of the day afternoon and evening and that was that my family were away in the mountains and there was no law against my sitting around all day clad only in my pajamas and otherwise concealed from possibly intruding eyes by the wreaths of smoke that I extracted from the nineteen or twenty cigars which when there is no protesting eye to suggest otherwise form my daily allowance I had tried every method known to the resourceful flat dweller of modern times to get cool and to stay so but alas it was impossible Even the radiators which all winter long had never once given forth a spark of heat now hissed to the touch of my moistened finger Enough cooling drinks to float an ocean greyhound had passed into my inner man with no other result than to make me perspire more profusely than ever and in so far as sensations went to make me feel hotter than before Finally as a last resource along about midnight its gridiron floor having had a chance to lose some of its stored up warmth I climbed out upon the fire escape at the rear of the Richmere hitched my hammock from one of the railings thereof to the leader running from the roof to the area and swung myself therein some eighty feet above the concealed pavement of our backyard so called perhaps because of its dimensions which were just about that square It was a little improvement though nothing to brag of What fitful zephyrs there might be caused no doubt by the rapid passage to and fro on the roof above and fence tops below of vagrant felines on Cupid s contentious battles bent to the disturbance of the still air soughed softly through the meshes of my hammock and gave some measure of relief grateful enough for which I ceased the perfervid language I had been using practically since sunrise and dozed off And then there entered upon the scene that marvelous man Raffles Holmes of whose exploits it is the purpose of these papers to tell I had dozed perhaps for a full hour when the first strange sounds grated upon my ear Somebody had opened a window in the kitchen of the first floor apartment below and with a dark lantern was inspecting the iron platform of the fire escape without A moment later this somebody crawled out of the window and with movements that in themselves were a sufficient indication of the questionable character of his proceedings made for the ladder leading to the floor above upon which many a time and oft had I too climbed to home and safety when an inconsiderate janitor had locked me out Every step that he took was stealthy that much I could see by the dim starlight His lantern he had turned dark again evidently lest he should attract attention in the apartments below as he passed their windows in his upward flight Ha ha thought I to myself It s never too hot for mister Sneak to get in his fine work I wonder whose stuff he is after Turning over flat on my stomach so that I might the more readily observe the man s movements and breathing pianissimo lest he in turn should observe mine I watched him as he climbed Up he came as silently as the midnight mouse upon a soft carpet up past the Jorkins apartments on the second floor up stealthily by the Tinkletons abode on the third up past the fire escape Italian garden of little missus Persimmon on the fourth up past the windows of the disagreeable Garraways kitchen below mine and then with the easy grace of a feline zip he silently landed within reach of my hand on my own little iron veranda and craning his neck to one side peered in through the open window and listened intently for two full minutes Humph whispered my inner consciousness to itself He is the coolest thing I ve seen since last Christmas left town I wonder what he is up to There s nothing in my apartment worth stealing now that my wife and children are away unless it be my Jap valet Nogi who might make a very excellent cab driver if I could only find words to convey to his mind the idea that he is discharged And then the visitor apparently having correctly assured himself that there was no one within stepped across the window sill and vanished into the darkness of my kitchen A moment later I too entered the window in pursuit not so close a one however as to acquaint him with my proximity I wanted to see what the chap was up to and also being totally unarmed and ignorant as to whether or not he carried dangerous weapons I determined to go slow for a little while Moreover the situation was not wholly devoid of novelty and it seemed to me that here at last was abundant opportunity for a new sensation As he had entered so did he walk cautiously along the narrow bowling alley that serves for a hallway connecting my drawing room and library with the dining room until he came to the library into which he disappeared This was not reassuring to me because to tell the truth I value my books more than I do my plate and if I were to be robbed I should much have preferred his taking my plated plate from the dining room than any one of my editions deluxe sets of the works of Marie Corelli Hall Caine and other standard authors from the library shelves Once in the library he quietly drew the shades at the windows thereof to bar possible intruding eyes from without turned on the electric lights and proceeded to go through my papers as calmly and coolly as though they were his own In a short time apparently he found what he wanted in the shape of a royalty statement recently received by me from my publishers and lighting one of my cigars from a bundle of brevas in front of him took off his coat and sat down to peruse the statement of my returns Simple though it was this act aroused the first feeling of resentment in my breast for the relations between the author and his publishers are among the most sacred confidences of life and the peeping Tom who peers through a keyhole at the courtship of a young man engaged in wooing his fiancee is no worse an intruder than he who would tear aside the veil of secrecy which screens the official returns of a best seller from the public eye Feeling therefore that I had permitted matters to proceed as far as they might with propriety I instantly entered the room and confronted my uninvited guest bracing myself of course for the defensive onslaught which I naturally expected to sustain But nothing of the sort occurred for the intruder with a composure that was nothing short of marvelous under the circumstances instead of rising hurriedly like one caught in some disreputable act merely leaned farther back in the chair took the cigar from his mouth and greeted me with Howdy do sir What can I do for you this beastly hot night The cold rim of a revolver barrel placed at my temple could not more effectually have put me out of business than this nonchalant reception Consequently I gasped out something about its being the sultriest forty seventh of August in eighteen years and plumped back into a chair opposite him I wouldn t mind a Remsen cooler myself he went on but the fact is your butler is off for to night and I m hanged if I can find a lemon in the house Maybe you ll join me in a smoke he added shoving my own bundle of brevas across the table Help yourself I guess I know where the lemons are said I But how did you know my butler was out I telephoned him to go to Philadelphia this afternoon to see his brother Yoku who is ill there said my visitor You see I didn t want him around to night when I called I knew I could manage you alone in case you turned up as you see you have but two of you and one a Jap I was afraid might involve us all in ugly complications Between you and me Jenkins these Orientals are pretty lively fighters and your man Nogi particularly has got jiu jitsu down to a pretty fine point so I had to do something to get rid of him Our arrangement is a matter for two not three anyhow So said I coldly You and I have an arrangement have we I wasn t aware of it Not yet he answered But there s a chance that we may have If I can only satisfy myself that you are the man I m looking for there is no earthly reason that I can see why we should not come to terms Go on out and get the lemons and the gin and soda and let s talk this thing over man to man like a couple of good fellows at the club I mean you no harm and you certainly don t wish to do any kind of injury to a chap who even though appearances are against him really means to do you a good turn Appearances certainly are against you sir said I a trifle warmly for the man s composure was irritating A disappearance would be more likely to do you credit at this moment Tush Jenkins he answered Why waste breath saying self evident things Here you are on the verge of a big transaction and you delay proceedings by making statements of fact mixed in with a cheap wit which I must confess I find surprising and so obvious as to be visible even to the blind You don t talk like an author whose stuff is worth ten cents a word more like a penny a liner in fact with whom words are of such small value that no one s the loser if he throws away a whole dictionary Go out and mix a couple of your best Remsen coolers and by the time you get back I ll have got to the gist of this royalty statement of yours which is all I ve come for Your silver and books and love letters and manuscripts are safe from me I wouldn t have em as a gift What concern have you with my royalties I demanded A vital one said he Mix the coolers and when you get back I ll tell you Go on There s a good chap It ll be daylight before long and I want to close up this job if I can before sunrise What there was in the man s manner to persuade me to compliance with his wishes I am sure I cannot say definitely There was a cold steely glitter in his eye for one thing With it however was a strengthfulness of purpose a certain pleasant masterfulness that made me feel that I could trust him and it was to this aspect of his nature that I yielded There was something frankly appealing in his long thin ascetic looking face and I found it irresistible All right said I with a smile and a frown to express the conflicting quality of my emotions So be it I ll get the coolers but you must remember my friend that there are coolers and coolers just as there are jugs and jugs The kind of jug that remains for you will depend upon the story you have to tell when I get back so you d better see that it s a good one I am not afraid Jenkins old chap he said with a hearty laugh as I rose If this royalty statement can prove to me that you are the literary partner I need in my business I can prove to you that I m a good man to tie up to so go along with you With this he lighted a fresh cigar and turned to a perusal of my statement which I am glad to say was a good one owing to the great success of my book Wild Animals I Have Never Met the seventh best seller at Rochester Watertown and Miami in June and July nineteen oh five while I went out into the dining room and mixed the coolers As you may imagine I was not long at it for my curiosity over my visitor lent wings to my corkscrew and in five minutes I was back with the tempting beverages in the tall glasses the lemon curl giving it the vertebrate appearance that all stiff drinks should have and the ice tinkling refreshingly upon the sultry air There said I placing his glass before him Drink hearty and then to business Who are you There is my card he replied swallowing a goodly half of the cooler and smacking his lips appreciatively and tossing a visiting card across to me on the other side of the table I picked up the card and read as follows mister Raffles Holmes London and New York Raffles Holmes I cried in amazement The same mister Jenkins said he I am the son of Sherlock Holmes the famous detective and grandson of A J Raffles the distinguished er ah cricketer sir I gazed at him dumb with astonishment You ve heard of my father Sherlock Holmes asked my visitor I confessed that the name of the gentleman was not unfamiliar to me And mister Raffles my grandfather he persisted If there ever was a story of that fascinating man that I have not read mister Holmes said I I beg you will let me have it Well then said he with that quick nervous manner which proved him a true son of Sherlock Holmes did it never occur to you as an extraordinary happening as you read of my father s wonderful powers as a detective and of Raffles equally wonderful prowess as a er well let us not mince words as a thief mister Jenkins the two men operating in England at the same time that no story ever appeared in which Sherlock Holmes s genius was pitted against the subtly planned misdeeds of mister Raffles Is it not surprising that with two such men as they were working out their destinies in almost identical grooves of daily action they should never have crossed each other s paths as far as the public is the wiser and in the very nature of the conflicting interests of their respective lines of action as foemen the one pursuing the other pursued they should to the public s knowledge never have clashed Now that you speak of it said I it was rather extraordinary that nothing of the sort happened One would think that the sufferers from the depredations of Raffles would immediately have gone to Holmes for assistance in bringing the other to justice Truly as you intimate it was strange that they never did Pardon me Jenkins put in my visitor I never intimated anything of the sort What I intimated was that no story of any such conflict ever came to light As a matter of fact Sherlock Holmes was put upon a Raffles case in eighteen eighty three and while success attended upon every step of it and my grandfather was run to earth by him as easily as was ever any other criminal in Holmes s grip a little naked god called Cupid stepped in saved Raffles from jail and wrote the word failure across Holmes s docket of the case I sir am the only tangible result of Lord Dorrington s retainers to Sherlock Holmes You speak enigmatically after the occasional fashion of your illustrious father said I The Dorrington case is unfamiliar to me Naturally so said my vis a vis Because save to my father my grandfather and myself the details are unknown to anybody Not even my mother knew of the incident and as for doctor Watson and Bunny the scribes through whose industry the adventures of those two great men were respectively narrated to an absorbed world they didn t even know there had ever been a Dorrington case because Sherlock Holmes never told Watson and Raffles never told Bunny But they both told me and now that I am satisfied that there is a demand for your books I am willing to tell it to you with the understanding that we share and share alike in the profits if perchance you think well enough of it to write it up Go on I said I ll whack up with you square and honest Which is more than either Watson or Bunny ever did with my father or my grandfather else I should not be in the business which now occupies my time and attention said Raffles Holmes with a cold snap to his eyes which I took as an admonition to hew strictly to the line of honor or to subject myself to terrible consequences With that understanding Jenkins I ll tell you the story of the Dorrington Ruby Seal in which some crime a good deal of romance and my ancestry are involved II THE ADVENTURE OF THE DORRINGTON RUBY SEAL Lord Dorrington as you may have heard said Raffles Holmes leaning back in my easy chair and gazing reflectively up at the ceiling was chiefly famous in England as a sporting peer His vast estates in five counties were always open to any sportsman of renown or otherwise as long as he was a true sportsman So open indeed was the house that he kept that whether he was there or not little week end parties of members of the sporting fraternity used to be got up at a moment s notice to run down to Dorrington Castle Devonshire to Dorrington Lodge on the Isle of Wight to Dorrington Hall near Dublin or to any other country place for over Sunday Sometimes there d be a lot of turf people sometimes a dozen or more devotes of the prize ring not infrequently a gathering of the best known cricketers of the time among whom of course my grandfather A J Raffles was conspicuous For the most part the cricketers never partook of Dorrington s hospitality save when his lordship was present for your cricket player is a bit more punctilious in such matters than your turfmen or ring side habitues It so happened one year however that his lordship was absent from England for the better part of eight months and when the time came for the annual cricket gathering at his Devonshire place he cabled his London representative to see to it that everything was carried on just as if he were present and that every one should be invited for the usual week s play and pleasure at Dorrington Castle His instructions were carried out to the letter and save for the fact that the genial host was absent the house part went through to perfection My grandfather as usual was the life of the occasion and all went merry as a marriage bell Seven months later Lord Dorrington returned and a week after that the loss of the Dorrington jewels from the Devonshire strong boxes was a matter of common knowledge When or by whom they had been taken was an absolute mystery As far as anybody could find out they might have been taken the night before his return or the night after his departure The only fact in sight was that they were gone Lady Dorrington s diamonds a half dozen valuable jewelled rings belonging to his lordship and most irremediable of losses the famous ruby seal which George IV had given to Dorrington s grandfather Sir Arthur Deering as a token of his personal esteem during the period of the Regency This was a flawless ruby valued at some six or seven thousand pounds sterling in which had been cut the Deering arms surrounded by a garter upon which were engraved the words Deering Ton which the family upon Sir Arthur s elevation to the peerage in eighteen thirty six took as its title or Dorrington His lordship was almost prostrated by the loss The diamonds and the rings although valued at thirty thousand pounds he could easily replace but the personal associations of the seal were such that nothing no amount of money could duplicate the lost ruby So that his first act I broke in breathlessly was to send for Sherlock Holmes my father said Raffles Holmes Yes mister Jenkins the first thing Lord Dorrington did was to telegraph to London for Sherlock Holmes requesting him to come immediately to Dorrington Castle and assume charge of the case Needless to say mister Holmes dropped everything else and came He inspected the gardens measured the road from the railway station to the castle questioned all the servants was particularly insistent upon knowing where the parlor maid was on the thirteenth of January secured accurate information as to the personal habits of his lordship s dachshund Nicholas subjected the chef to a cross examination that covered every point of his life from his remote ancestry to his receipt for baking apples gathered up three suit cases of sweeping from his lordship s private apartment and two boxes containing three each of every variety of cigars that Lord Dorrington had laid down in his cellar As you are aware Sherlock Holmes in his prime was a great master of detail He then departed for London taking with him an impression in wax of the missing seal which Lord Dorrington happened to have preserved in his escritoire On his return to London Holmes inspected the seal carefully under a magnifying glass and was instantly impressed with the fact that it was not unfamiliar to him He had seen it somewhere before but where That was now the question upper most in his mind Prior to this he had never had any communication with Lord Dorrington so that if it was in his correspondence that the seal had formerly come to him most assuredly the person who had used it had come by it dishonestly Fortunately at that time it was a habit of my father s never to destroy papers of any sort Every letter that he ever received was classified and filed envelope and all The thing to do then was manifestly to run over the files and find the letter if indeed it was in or on a letter that the seal had first come to his attention It was a herculean job but that never feazed Sherlock Holmes and he went at it tooth and nail Finally his effort was rewarded Under Applications for Autograph he found a daintily scented little missive from a young girl living at Goring Streatley on the Thames the daughter she said of a retired missionary the Reverend James Tattersby asking him if he would not kindly write his autograph upon the enclosed slip for her collection It was the regular stock application that truly distinguished men receive in every mail The only thing to distinguish it from other applications was the beauty of the seal on the fly of the envelope which attracted his passing notice and was then filed away with the other letters of similar import Ho ho quoth Holmes as he compared the two impressions and discovered that they were identical An innocent little maiden who collects autographs and a retired missionary in possession of the Dorrington seal eh Well that is interesting I think I shall run down to Goring Streatley over Sunday and meets Miss Marjorie Tattersby and her reverend father I d like to see to what style of people I have intrusted my autograph To decide was to act with Sherlock Holmes and the following Saturday hiring a canoe at Windsor he made his way up the river until he came to the pretty little hamlet snuggling in the Thames Valley if such it may be called where the young lady and her good father were dwelling Fortune favored him in that his prey was still there both much respected by the whole community the father a fine looking really splendid specimen of a man whose presence alone carried a conviction of integrity and a lofty man the daughter well to see her was to love her and the moment the eyes of Sherlock fell upon her face that great heart of his that had ever been adamant to beauty a very Gibraltar against the wiles of the other sex went down in the chaos of a first and overwhelming passion So hard hit was he by Miss Tattersby s beauty that his chief thought now was to avert rather than to direct suspicion towards her After all she might have come into possession of the jewel honestly though how the daughter of a retired missionary considering its intrinsic value could manage such a thing was pretty hard to understand and he fled back to London to think it over Arrived there he found an invitation to visit Dorrington Castle again incog Lord Dorrington was to have a mixed week end party over the following Sunday and this he thought would give Holmes an opportunity to observe the characteristics of Dorrington s visitors and possibly gain therefore some clew as to the light fingered person from whose depredations his lordship had suffered The idea commended itself to Holmes and in the disguise of a young American clergyman whom Dorrington had met in the States the following Friday found him at Dorrington Castle Well to make a long story short said Raffles Holmes the young clergyman was introduced to many of the leading sportsmen of the hour and for the most part they passed muster but one of them did not and that was the well known cricketer A J Raffles for the moment Raffles entered the room jovially greeting everybody about him and was presented to Lord Dorrington s new guest Sherlock Holmes recognized in him no less a person that the Reverend James Tattersby retired missionary of Goring Streatley on Thames and the father of the woman who had filled his soul with love and yearning of the truest sort The problem was solved Raffles was to all intents and purposes caught with the goods on Holmes could have exposed him then and there had he chosen to do so but every time it came to the point the lovely face of Marjorie Tattersby came between him and his purpose How could he inflict the pain and shame which the exposure of her father s misconduct would certainly entail upon that fair woman whose beauty and fresh innocence had taken so strong a hold upon his heart No that was out of the question The thing to do clearly was to visit Miss Tattersby during her father s absence and if possible ascertain from just how she had come into possession of the seal before taking further steps in the matter This he did Making sure to begin with that Raffles was to remain at Dorrington Hall for the coming ten days Holmes had himself telegraphed for and returned to London There he wrote himself a letter of introduction to the Reverend James Tattersby on the paper of the Anglo American Missionary Society a sheet of which he secured in the public writing room of that institution armed with which he returned to the beautiful little spot on the Thames where the Tattersbys abode He spent the night at the inn and in conversation with the landlord and boatmen learned much that was interesting concerning the Reverend James Among other things he discovered that this gentleman and his daughter had been respected residents of the place for three years that Tattersby was rarely seen in the daytime about the place that he was unusually fond of canoeing at night which he said gave him the quiet and solitude necessary for that reflection which is so essential to the spiritual being of a minister of grace that he frequently indulged in long absences during which time it was supposed that he was engaged in the work of his calling He appeared to be a man of some but not lavish means The most notable and suggestive thing however that Holmes ascertained in his conversation with the boatmen was that at the time of the famous Cliveden robbery when several thousand pounds worth of plate had been taken from the great hall that later fell into the possession of a well known American hotel keeper Tattersby who happened to be on the river late that night was according to his own statement the unconscious witness of the escape of the thieves on board a mysterious steam launch which the police were never able afterwards to locate They had nearly upset his canoe with the wash of their rapidly moving craft as they sped past him after having stowed their loot safely on board Tattersby had supposed them to be employes of the estate and never gave the matter another thought until three days later when the news of the robbery was published to the world He had immediately communicated the news of what he had seen to the police and had done all that lay in his power to aid them in locating the robbers but all to no purpose From that day to this the mystery of the Cliveden plot had never been solved The following day Holmes called at the Tattersby cottage and was fortunate enough to find Miss Tattersby at home His previous impression as to her marvellous beauty was more than confirmed and each moment that he talked to her she revealed new graces of manner that completed the capture of his hitherto unsusceptible heart Miss Tattersby regretted her father s absence He had gone she said to attend a secret missionary conference at Pentwllycod in Wales and was not expected back for a week all of which quite suited Sherlock Holmes Convinced that after years of waiting his affinity had at last crossed his path he was in no hurry for the return of that parent who would put an instant quietus upon this affair of the heart Manifestly the thing for him to do was to win the daughter s hand and then intercept the father acquaint him with his aspirations and compel acquiescence by the force of his knowledge of Raffles s misdeed Hence instead of taking his departure immediately he remained at the Goring Streatley Inn taking care each day to encounter Miss Tattersby on one pretext or another hoping that their acquaintance would ripen into friendship and then into something warmer Nor was the hope a vain one for when the far Marjorie learned that it was the visitor s intention to remain in the neighborhood until her father s return she herself bade him to make use of the old gentleman s library to regard himself always as a welcome daytime guest She even suggested pleasant walks through the neighboring country little canoe trips up and down the Thames which they might take together of all of which Holmes promptly availed himself with the result that at the end of six days both realized that they were designed for each other and a passionate declaration followed which opened new vistas of happiness for both Hence it was that when the Reverend James Tattersby arrived at Goring Streatley the following Monday night unexpectedly he was astounded to find sitting together in the moonlight in the charming little English garden at the rear of his dwelling two persons one of whom was his daughter Marjorie and the other a young American curate to whom he had already been introduced as A J Raffles We have met before I think said Raffles coldly as his eye fell upon Holmes I er do not recall the fact replied Holmes meeting the steely stare of the home comer with one of his own flinty glances H m ejaculated Raffles non plussed at the other s failure to recognize him Then he shivered slightly Suppose we go in doors it is a trifle chilly out here in the night air The whole thing the greeting the meeting Holmes s demeanor and all was so admirably handled that Marjorie Tattersby never guessed the truth never even suspected the intense dramatic quality of the scene she had just gazed upon Yes let us go in doors she acquiesced mister Dutton has something to say to you papa So I presumed said Raffles dryly And something that were better said to me alone I fancy eh he added Quite so said Holmes calmly And in doors they went Marjorie immediately retired to the drawing room and Holmes and Raffles went at once to Tattersby s study Well said Raffles impatiently when they were seated I suppose you have come to get the Dorrington seal mister Holmes Ah you know me then mister Raffles said Holmes with a pleasant smile Perfectly said Raffles I knew you at Dorrington Hall the moment I set eyes on you and if I hadn t I should have known later for the night after your departure Lord Dorrington took me into his confidence and revealed your identity to me I am glad said Holmes It saves me a great deal of unnecessary explanation If you admit that you have the seal But I don t said Raffles I mentioned it a moment ago because Dorrington told me that was what you were after I haven t got it mister Holmes I know that observed Holmes quietly It is in the possession of Miss Tattersby your daughter mister Raffles She showed it to you eh demanded Raffles paling No She sealed a note to me with it however Holmes replied A note to you cried Raffles Yes One asking for my autograph I have it in my possession said Holmes And how do you know that she is the person from whom that note really came Raffles asked Because I have seen the autograph which was sent in response to that request in your daughter s collection mister Raffles said Holmes So that you conclude Raffles put in hoarsely I do not conclude I begin by surmising sir that the missing seal of Lord Dorrington was stolen by one of two persons yourself or Miss Marjorie Tattersby said Holmes calmly Sir roared Raffles springing to his feet menacingly Sit down please said Holmes You did not let me finish I was going to add doctor Tattersby that a week s acquaintance with that lovely woman a full knowledge of her peculiarly exalted character and guileless nature makes the alternative of guilt that affects her integrity clearly preposterous which by a very simple process of elimination fastens the guilt beyond all peradventure on your shoulders At any rate the presence of the seal in this house will involve you in difficult explanations Why is it here How did it come here Why are you known as the Reverend James Tattersby the missionary at Goring Streatley and as mister A J Raffles the cricketer and man of the world at Dorrington Hall to say nothing of the Cliveden plate Damnation roared the Reverend James Tattersby again springing to his feet and glancing instinctively at the long low book shelves behind him To say nothing continued Holmes calmly lighting a cigarette of the Cliveden plate now lying concealed behind those dusty theological tomes of yours which you never allow to be touched by any other hand than your own How did you know cried Raffles hoarsely I didn t laughed Holmes You have only this moment informed me of the fact There was a long pause during which Raffles paced the floor like a caged tiger I m a dangerous man to trifle with mister Holmes he said finally I can shoot you down in cold blood in a second Very likely said Holmes But you won t It would add to the difficulties in which the Reverend James Tattersby is already deeply immersed Your troubles are sufficient as matters stand without your having to explain to the world why you have killed a defenceless guest in your own study in cold blood Well what do you propose to do demanded Raffles after another pause Marry your daughter mister Raffles or Tattersby whatever your permanent name is I guess it s Tattersby in this case said Holmes I love her and she loves me Perhaps I should apologize for having wooed and won her without due notice to you but you doubtless will forgive that It s a little formality you sometimes overlook yourself when you happen to want something that belongs to somebody else What Raffles would have answered no one knows He had no chance to reply for at that moment Marjorie herself put her radiantly lovely little head in at the door with a May I come in and a moment later she was gathered in Holmes s arms and the happy lovers received the Reverend James Tattersby s blessing They were married a week later and as far as the world is concerned the mystery of the Dorrington seal and that of the Cliveden plate was never solved It is compounding a felony Raffles said Holmes after the wedding but for a wife like that hanged if I wouldn t compound the ten commandments I hope I ventured to put in at that point that the marriage ceremony was not performed by the Reverend James Tattersby Not on your life retorted Raffles Holmes My father was too fond of my mother to permit of any flaw in his title A year later I was born and well here I am son of one grandson of the other with hereditary traits from both strongly developed and ready for business I want a literary partner a man who will write me up as Bunny did Raffles and Watson did Holmes so that I may get a percentage on that part of the swag I offer you the job Jenkins Those royalty statements show me that you are the man and your books prove to me that you need a few fresh ideas Come what do you say Will you do it My boy said I enthusiastically don t say another word Will I Well just try me And so it was that Raffles Holmes and I struck a bargain and became partners III THE ADVENTURE OF missus BURLINGAME S DIAMOND STOMACHER I had seen the marvellous creation very often at the opera and in many ways resented it Not that I was in the least degree a victim to envy hatred and malice towards those who are possessed of a superabundance of this world s good things far from it I rejoice in the great fortunes of earth because with every dollar corralled by the superior energies of the multi millionaires the fewer there are for other men to seek and until we stop seeking dollars and turn our minds to other finer things there will be no hope of peace and sweet content upon this little green ball we inhabit My resentment of missus Burlingame s diamond stomacher was not then based on envy of its possession but merely upon the twofold nuisance which it created at the opera house as the lady who wore it sat and listened to the strains of Wagner Bizet or Gounod mixed in with the small talk of Reggie Stockson Tommie de Coupon and other lights of the social firmament In the first place it caused the people sitting about me in the high seats of the opera house to chatter about it and discuss its probable worth every time the lady made her appearance in it and I had fled from the standee part of the house to the top gallery just to escape the talkers and if possible to get my music straight without interruptions of any sort whatsoever on the side In the second place the confounded thing glittered so that from where I sat it was as dazzling as so many small mirrors flashing in the light of the sun It seemed as if every electric light in the house found some kind of a refractor in the thousands of gems of which it was composed and many of the brilliant light effects of the stage were dimmed in their lustre by the persistent intrusion of missus Burlingame s glory upon my line of vision Hence in was that when I picked up my morning paper and read in great flaring head lines on the front page that missus Burlingame s diamond stomacher had been stolen from her at her Onyx Cottage at Newport I smiled broadly and slapped the breakfast table so hard in my satisfaction that even the shredded wheat biscuits flew up into the air and caught in the chandelier Thank Heaven for that I said Next season I shall be able to enjoy my opera undisturbed I little thought at that blissful moment how closely indeed were my own fortunes to be connected with that wonderful specimen of the jeweler s handicraft but an hour later I was made aware of the first link in the chain that in a measure bound me to it Breakfast over I went to my desk to put the finishing touches to a novel I had written the week before when word came up on the telephone from below that a gentleman from Busybody s Magazine wished to see me on an important matter of business Tell him I m already a subscriber I called down supposing the visitor to be merely an agent I took the magazine and a set of Chaucer in a revolving bookcase from one of their agents last month and have paid my dollar In a moment another message came over the wire The gentleman says he wants to see you about writing a couple of full page sonnets for the Christmas number the office man phoned up Show him up I replied instantly Two minutes later a rather handsome man with a fine eye and a long flowing gray beard was ushered into my apartment I am mister Stikes of Busybody s mister Jenkins he said with a twinkle in his eye We thought you might like to contribute to our Christmas issue We want two sonnets one on the old Christmas and the other on the new We can t offer you more than a thousand dollars apiece for them but Something caught in my throat but I managed to reply I might shade my terms a trifle since you want as many as two I gurgled And I assume you will pay on acceptance Certainly he said gravely Could you let me have them say this afternoon I turned away so that he would not see the expression of joy on my face and then there came from behind me a deep chuckle and the observation in a familiar voice You might throw in a couple of those Remsen coolers too while you re about it Jenkins I whirled about as if struck and there in place of the gray bearded editor stood Raffles Holmes Bully disguise eh he said folding up his beard and putting it in his pocket Ye e es said I ruefully as I thought of the vanished two thousand I think I preferred you in disguise though old man I added You won t when you hear what I ve come for said he There s five thousand dollars apiece in this job for us To what job do you refer I asked The Burlingame case he replied I suppose you read in the papers this morning how missus Burlingame s diamond stomacher has turned up missing Yes said I and I m glad of it You ought to be said Holmes since it will put five thousand dollars in your pocket You haven t heard yet that there is a reward of ten thousand dollars offered for its recovery The public announcement has not yet been made but it will be in to night s papers and we are the chaps that are going to get the reward But how I demanded Leave that to me said he By the way I wish you d let me leave this suit case of mine in your room for about ten days It holds some important papers and my shop is turned topsy turvy just now with the painters Very well said I I ll shove it under my bed I took the suit case as Holmes had requested and hid it away in my bedroom immediately returning to the library where he sat smoking one of my cigars as cool as a cucumber There was something in his eye however that aroused my suspicion as soon as I entered See here Holmes said I I can t afford to be mixed up in any shady business like this you know Have you got that stomacher No I haven t said he Honor bright I haven t I eyed him narrowly I think I understand the evasion I went on You haven t got it because I have got it it s in that suit case under my bed Open it and see for yourself said he It isn t there But you know where it is I demanded How else could I be sure of that ten thousand dollars reward he asked Where is it I demanded It er it isn t located yet that is not finally said he And it won t be for ten days Ten days from now missus Burlingame will find it herself and we ll divvy on the reward my boy and not a trace of dishonesty in the whole business And with that Raffles Holmes filled his pockets with cigars from my stores and bidding me be patient went his way The effect of his visit upon my nerves was such that any more work that day was impossible The fear of possible complications to follow upset me wholly and despite his assurance that the suit case was innocent of surreptitiously acquired stomachers I could not rid my mind of the suspicion that he made of my apartment a fence for the concealment of his booty The more I thought of it the more was I inclined to send for him and request him to remove the bag forthwith and yet if it should so happen that he had spoken the truth I should by that act endanger our friendship and possibly break the pact which bade fair to be profitable Suddenly I remembered his injunction to me to look for myself and see if the stomacher really was concealed there and I hastened to act upon it It might have been pure bluff on his part and I resolved not to be bluffed The case opened easily and the moment I glanced into it my suspicions were allayed It contained nothing but bundle after bundle of letters tied together with pink and blue ribbons one or two old daguerreotypes some locks of hair and an ivory miniature of Raffles Holmes himself as an infant Not a stomacher diamond or otherwise was hid in the case nor any other suspicious object and I closed it with a sheepish feeling of shame for having intruded upon the sacred correspondence and relics of the happy childhood days of my new friend That night as Holmes had asserted a reward of ten thousand dollars was offered for the recovery of the Burlingame stomacher and the newspapers for the next ten days were full of the theories of detectives of all sorts amateur professional and reportorial Central Office was after it in one place others sought it elsewhere The editor of one New York paper printed a full list of the names of the guests at missus Burlingame s dinner the night the treasure was stolen and whether they ever discovered it for themselves or not several bearers of highly honored social names were shadowed by reporters and others everywhere they went for the next week At the end of five days the reward was increased to twenty thousand dollars and then Raffles Holmes s name began to appear in connection with the case missus Burlingame herself had sent for him and without taking it out of the hands of others had personally requested him to look into the matter He had gone to Newport and looked the situation over there He had questioned all the servants in her two establishments at Newport and New York and had finally assured the lady that on the following Tuesday morning he would advise her by wire of the definite location of her missing jewel During all this time Holmes had not communicated with me at all and I began to fear that offended by my behavior at our last meeting he had cut me out of his calculations altogether when just as I was about to retire on Sunday night he reappeared as he had first come to me stealing up the fire escape and this time he wore a mask and carried unquestionably a burglar s kit and a dark lantern He started nervously as he caught sight of me reaching up to turn off the light in the library Hang it call Jenkins he cried I thought you d gone off to the country for the week end No said I I meant to go but I was detained What s up Oh well I may as well out with it he answered I didn t want you to know but well watch and see With this Raffles Holmes strode directly to my bookcase removed my extra illustrated set of Fox s Book of Martyrs in five volumes from the shelves and there resting upon the shelf behind them glittered nothing less than the missing stomacher Great Heavens Holmes I said what does this mean How did those diamonds get there I put them there myself while you were shoving my suit case under your bed the other night said he You told me you didn t have them I said reproachfully I didn t when I spoke you had them said he You told me they had not been finally located I persisted angrily I told you the truth They were only temporarily located he answered I m going to locate them definitely to night and to morrow missus Burlingame will find them Where I cried In her own safe in her New York house said Raffles Holmes You Yes I took them from Newport myself very easy job too said Raffles Holmes Ever since I saw them at the opera last winter I have had this in mind so when missus Burlingame gave her dinner I served as an extra butler from Delmonico s drugged the regular chap up on the train on his way up from New York took his clothes and went in his place That night I rifled the Newport safe of the stomacher and the next day brought it here To night I take it to the Burlingame house on Fifth Avenue secure entrance through a basement door to which in my capacity of detective I have obtained the key and while the caretakers sleep missus Burlingame s diamond stomacher will be placed in the safe on the first floor back To morrow morning I shall send missus Burlingame this message Have you looked in your New York safe Signed Raffles Holmes he continued She will come to town by the first train to find out what I mean we will go to her residence she will open the safe and twenty thousand dollars for us By Jove Holmes you are a wonder said I This stomacher is worth two hundred fifty thousand dollars at the least I added as I took the creation in my hand Pot of money that Yes said he with a sigh taking the stomacher from me and fondling it The Raffles in me tells me that but the Sherlock Holmes in my veins well I can t keep it Jenkins if that is what you mean I blushed at the intimation conveyed by his words and was silent and Holmes gathering up his tools and stuffing the stomacher in the capacious bosom of his coat bade me au revoir and went out into the night The rest is already public property All the morning papers were full of the strange recovery of the Burlingame stomacher the following Tuesday morning and the name of Raffles Holmes was in every mouth That night the very essence of promptitude Holmes appeared at my apartment and handed me a check for my share in the transaction Why what does this mean I cried as I took in the figures twelve thousand five hundred dollars I thought it was to be only ten thousand dollars It was said Raffles Holmes but missus Burlingame was so overjoyed at getting the thing back she made the check for twenty five thousand dollars instead of for twenty thousand dollars You re the soul of honor Holmes I murmured On my father s side he said with a sigh On my mother s side it comes hard And missus Burlingame didn t she ask you how you ferreted the thing out I asked Yes said Holmes But I told her that that was my secret that my secret was my profession and that my profession was my bread and butter But she must have asked you who was the guilty person I persisted Yes said Holmes she did and I took her for a little gallop through the social register in search of the guilty party that got on her nerves so that when it came down to an absolute question of identity she begged me to forget it I am dull of comprehension Raffles said I Tell me exactly what you mean Simply this said Raffles Holmes The present four hundred consists of about nineteen thousand two hundred fifty people of whom about twenty five per cent go to Newport at one time or another say four thousand eight hundred twelve Of these four thousand eight hundred twelve about ten per cent are eligible for invitations to the Burlingame dinners or four hundred eighty Now whom of the four hundred eighty possibilities having access to the Burlingame cottage would we naturally suspect Surely only those who were in the vicinity the night of the robbery By a process of elimination we narrowed them down to just ten persons exclusive of missus Burlingame herself and her husband old Billie Burlingame We took the lot and canvassed them There were mister and missus Willington Bodfish they left early and the stomacher was known to be safe at the time of their departure There were Bishop and missus Pounderby neither of whom would be at all likely to come back in the dead of night and remove property that did not belong to them There were Senator and missus Jorrocks The Senator is after bigger game than diamond stomachers and missus Jorrocks is known to be honest There were Harry Gaddsby and his wife Harry doesn t know enough to go in when it rains and is too timid to call even his soul his own so he couldn t have taken it and missus Gaddsby is long on stomachers having at least five and therefore would not be likely to try to land a sixth by questionable means In that way we practically cleared eight possibilities of suspicion Now missus Burlingame said I that leaves four persons still in the ring yourself your husband your daughter and the Duke of Snarleyow your daughter s newly acquired fiance in whose honor the dinner was given Of these four you are naturally yourself the first to be acquitted Your husband comes next and is not likely to be the guilty party because if he wants a diamond stomacher he needn t steal it having money enough to buy a dozen of them if he wishes The third your daughter should be regarded as equally innocent because if she was really desirous of possessing the jewel all she had to do was to borrow it from you That brings us down to the Duke of Hush I beg of you mister Raffles Holmes she cried in great agitation Not another word I beseech you If any one should overhear us The subject after all is an unprofitable one and I d I d rather drop it and it it er it has just occurred to me that possibly I er possibly I Put the jewel in the safe yourself I suggested Yes said missus Burlingame with a grateful glance and a tremendous sigh of relief Now that I think of it mister Raffles Holmes that was it I er I remember perfectly that er that I didn t wear it at all the night of my little dinner and that I did leave it behind me when I left town Humph said I That may account for the extra five thousand dollars It may said Raffles Holmes pursing his lips into a deprecatory smile IV THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING PENDANTS I think said Raffles Holmes as he ran over his expense account while sitting in my library one night some months ago that in view of the present condition of my exchequer my dear Jenkins it behooveth me to get busy Owning a motor car is a demned expensive piece of business and my balance at the back has shrunk to about sixteen eighty three dollars fifty nine cents thanks to my bills for cogs clutches and gasoline plus the chauffeur s fines In what capacity shall you work Raffles or Holmes I asked pausing in my writing and regarding him with that affectionate interest which contact with him had inspired in me Play the combination always Jenkins he replied If I did the Raffles act alone I should become the billionaire in this land of silk and money your rich are so careless of their wealth but where would my conscience be On the other hand if I stuck to the Holmes act exclusively I d starve to death but the combination ah there is moderate fortune my boy with peace of mind thrown in Here he rose up buttoned his coat about his spare figure and reached out for his hat I guess I ll tackle that case of the missing pendants to morrow he continued flicking the ash from his cigar and gazing up at the ceiling with that strange twist in his eye which I had learned to regard as the harbinger of a dawning idea in his mind There s ten thousand dollars for somebody in that job and you and I might as well have it as any one else I m ready said I as well I might be for all I had to do in the matter was to record the adventure and take my half of the profits no very difficult proceeding in either case Good quoth he I ll go to Gaffany company to morrow and offer my services You have a clew I asked I have an idea he answered As for the lost diamonds I know no more of their whereabouts than you do but I shall be able beyond all question to restore to Gaffany company two pendants just as good as those they have lost and if I do that I am entitled to the reward I fancy am I not Most certainly said I But where the dickens will you find two such stones They are worth fifty thousand dollars apiece and they must match perfectly the two remaining jewels which Gaffany company have in their safe I ll match em so closely that their own mother couldn t tell em apart said Holmes with a chuckle Then the report that they are of such rarity of cut and lustre is untrue I asked It s perfectly true said Holmes but that makes no difference The two stones that I shall return two weeks from to day to Gaffany company will be as like the two they have as they are themselves Ta ta Jenkins you can count on your half of that ten thousand as surely as though it is jingled now in your pockets And with that Raffles Holmes left me to my own devices I presume that most readers of the daily newspapers are tolerably familiar with the case of the missing pendants to which Holmes referred and on the quest for which he was now about to embark There may be some of you however who have never heard of the mysterious robbery of Gaffany company by which two diamonds of almost matchless purity half of a quartet of these stones pear shaped and valued at fifty thousand dollars each had disappeared almost as if the earth had opened and swallowed them up They were a part of the famous Gloria Diamond found last year at Kimberley a huge uncut gem of such value that no single purchaser for it could be found in the world By a syndicate arrangement Gaffany company had assumed charge of it and were in the process of making for a customer a bar with four pendants cut from the original when two of them disappeared They had been last seen in the hands of trusted employe of many years standing to whom they had been intrusted for mounting and he had been seen to replace them at the end of the day s work in the little cage like office of the custodian of the safe in which jewels of great value were kept at night This was the last seen of them and although five weeks had elapsed since the discovery of their loss and Holmes s decision to look into the matter no clew of the slightest description had been discovered by the thousands of sleuths professional or amateur who had interested themselves in the case He had such assurance I muttered To hear him talk one would almost believe that they were already in his possession I did not see Raffles Holmes again for five days and then I met him only by chance nor should I have known it was he had he not made himself known to me I was on my way uptown a little after six o clock and as I passed Gaffany s an aged man emerged from the employes entrance carrying a small bag in his hand He was apparently very near sighted for he most unceremoniously bumped into me as he came out of the door on to the sidewalk Deference to age has always been a weakness of mine and I apologized although it was he that was at fault Don t mention it Jenkins he whispered You are just the man I want to see Cafe Panhard to night eleven o clock Just happen in and if a foreign looking person with a red beard speaks to you don t throw him down but act as if you were not annoyed by his mistake You know me I asked Tush man I m Raffles Holmes and with that he was off His make up was perfect and as he hobbled his way along Broadway through the maze of cars trucks and hansoms there was not in any part of him a hint or a suggestion that brought to mind my alert partner Of course my excitement was intense I could hardly wait for eleven o clock to come and at nine point thirty I found myself in front of the Cafe Panhard a full hour and a half ahead of time and never were there more minutes in that period of waiting than there seemed to be then as I paced Broadway until the appointed hour It seemed ages before the clock down in front of the Whirald Building pointed to ten point fifty five but at last the moment arrived and I entered the cafe taking one of the little tables in the farther corner where the light was not unduly strong and where the turmoil of the Hungarian band was reduced by distance from moltofortissimo to a moderate approach to a pianissimo which would admit of conversation Again I had to wait but not for so long a time It was twenty minutes past eleven when a fine looking man of military bearing wearing a full red beard entered and after looking the cafe over sauntered up to where I sat Good evening mister Jenkins said he with a slight foreign accent Are you alone Yes said I If you don t mind I should like to sit here for a few moments he observed pulling out the chair opposite me I have your permission Certainly mister er Robinstein is my name said he sitting down and producing a letter from his pocket I have here a not from my old friend Raffles Holmes a note of introduction to you I am a manufacturer of paste jewels or rather was I have had one or two misfortunes in my business and find myself here in America practically stranded Your place of business was In the Rue de l Echelle in Paris he explained I lost everything in unfortunate speculation and have come here to see if I could not get a new start mister Holmes thinks you can use your influence with Markoo company the theatrical costumers who I believe manufacture themselves all the stage jewelry they use in their business to give me something to do It was said in Paris that the gems which I made were of such quality that they would deceive for a time anyhow the most expert lapidaries and if I can only get an opening with Markoo company I am quite confident that you will not repent having exerted your good offices in my behalf Why certainly mister Robinstein said I Any friend of Raffles Holmes may command my services I know Tommy Markoo very well and as this is a pretty busy time with him getting his stuff out for the fall productions I have little doubt I shall be able to help you By Jove I added as I glanced over the cafe that s a singular coincidence there is Markoo himself just coming in the doorway Really said mister Robinstein turning and gazing towards the door He s a different looking chap from what I had imagined Perhaps mister Jenkins it would er expedite matters if you Of course I interrupted Tommy is alone we ll have him over And I beckoned to Markoo and invited him to join us Good said he in his whole souled way Glad to have a chance to see you I m so confoundedly busy these days just think of it I ve been at the shop ever since eight o clock this morning Tommy I want to introduce you to my friend mister Robinstein said I Not Isidore Robinstein of Paris said Markoo I have that misfortune mister Markoo said Robinstein Misfortune Gad mister Robinstein we look at things through different glasses returned Markoo The man who can do your work ought never to suffer misfortune If he only stays out of the stock market said Robinstein Aha laughed Tommy Et tu Brute We all laughed and if there was any ice to be broken after that it was along the line of business of the cafe We got along famously together and when we parted company two hours later all the necessary arrangements had been made for mister Robinstein to begin at once with Markoo the following day in fact Four nights later Holmes turned up at my apartment Well said I have you come to report progress Yes he said The reward will arrive on time but it s been the de il s own job Pretty aren t they he added taking a small package wrapped in tissue paper out of his pocket and disclosing its contents Gee rusalem what beauties I cried as my eyes fell on two such diamonds as I had never before seen They sparkled on the paper like bits of sunshine and that their value was quite one hundred thousand dollars it did not take one like myself who knew little of gems to see at a glance You have found them have you Found what asked Raffles Holmes The missing pendants said I Well not exactly said Raffles Holmes I think I m on the track of them though There s an old chap who works beside me down at Gaffany s who spends so much of his time drinking ice water that I m getting to be suspicious of him I roared with laughter The ice water habit is evidence of a criminal nature eh I queried Not per se said Holmes gravely but in conjunctibus if my Latin is weak please correct me it is a very suspicious habit When I see a man drink ten glasses of water in two hours it indicates to my mind that there is something in the water cooler that takes his mind off his business It is not likely to be either the ice or the water on the doctrine of probabilities Hence it must be something else I caught him yesterday with his hand in it His hand In the water cooler I demanded Yes said Holmes He said he was fishing around for a little piece of ice to cool his head which ached but I think differently He got as pale as a ghost when I started in to fish for a piece for myself because my head ached too I think he took the diamonds and has hid them there but I m not sure yet and in my business I can t afford to make mistakes If my suspicions are correct he is merely awaiting his opportunity to fish them out and light out with them Then these I said are are they paste No indeed they re the real thing said Raffles Holmes holding up one of the gems to the light where it fairly coruscated with brilliance These are the other two of the original quartet Great Heavens Holmes do you mean to say that Gaffany company permit you to go about with things like this in your pocket I demanded Not they laughed Holmes They d have a fit if they knew I had em only they don t know it But how have you concealed the fact from them I persisted Robinstein made me a pair exactly like them said Holmes The paste ones are now lying in the Gaffany safe where I saw them placed before leaving the shop to night You re too deep for me Holmes said I What s the game Now don t say game Jenkins he protested I never indulge in games My quarry is not a game but a scheme For the past two weeks with three days off I have been acting as a workman in the Gaffany ship with the ostensible purpose of keeping my eye on certain employes who are under suspicion Each day the remaining two pendant stones these have been handed to me to work on merely to carry out the illusion The first day in odd moments I made sketches of them and on the night of the second I had em down in such detail as to cut and color that Robinstein had no difficulty in reproducing them in the materials at his disposal in Markoo s shop And to night all I had to do to get them was to keep them and hand in the Robinstein substitutes when the hour of closing came So that now in place of four fifty thousand dollars diamonds Gaffany company are in possession of Two paste pendants worth about forty dollars apiece said Holmes If I fail to find the originals I shall have to use the paste ones to carry the scheme through but I hate to do it It s so confoundly inartistic and as old a trick as the pyramids And to morrow Raffles Holmes got up and paced the floor nervously Ah Jenkins he said with a heart rending sigh that is the point To morrow Heavens what will to morrow s story be I I cannot tell What s the matter Holmes said Are you in danger Physically no morally my God Jenkins yes I shall need all of your help he cried What can I do I asked You know you have only to command me Don t leave me this night for a minute he groaned If you do I am lost The Raffles in me is rampant when I look at those jewels and think of what they will mean if I keep them An independent fortune forever All I have to do is to get aboard a ship and go to Japan and live in comfort the rest of my days with the wealth in my possession and all the instincts of honest that I possess through the father in me will be powerless to prevent my indulgence in this crime Keep me in sight and if I show the slightest inclination to give you the slip knock me over the head will you for my own good I promised faithfully that I would do as he asked but as an easier way out of an unpleasant situation I drugged his Remsen cooler with a sleeping powder and an hour later he was lying off on my divan lost to the world for eight hours at least As a further precaution I put the jewels in my own safe The night s sleep had the desired effect and with the returning day Holmes s better nature asserted itself Raffles was subdued and he returned to Gaffany s to put the finishing touches to his work Here s your check Jenkins said Raffles Holmes handing me a draft for five thousand dollars The gems were found to day in the water cooler in the work room and Gaffany company paid up like gentlemen And the thief I asked Under arrest said Raffles Holmes We caught him fishing for them And your past jewels where are they I wish I knew he answered his face clouding over In the excitement of the moment of the arrest I got em mixed with the originals I had last night and they didn t give me time or opportunity to pick em out The four were mounted immediately and sent under guard to the purchaser Gaffany company didn t want to keep them a minute longer than was necessary But the purchaser is so rich he will never have to sell em so you see Jenkins we re as safe as a church Your friend Robinstein was a character Holmes said I Yes sighed Holmes Poor chap he was a great loss to his friends He taught me the art of making paste gems when I was in Paris I miss him like the dickens Miss him said I getting anxious for Robinstein What happened He isn t Dead said Holmes Two years ago dear old chap Oh come now Holmes I said What new game is this you are rigging on me I met him only five nights ago and you know it Oh that one said Raffles Holmes with a laugh I was that Robinstein You I cried Yes me said Holmes You don t suppose I d let a third party into our secret do you And then he gave me one of those sweet wistful smiles that made the wonder of the man all the greater I wish to the dickens I knew whether these were real or paste he muttered taking the extra pendants from his wallet as he spoke I don t dare ask anybody and I haven t got any means of telling myself Give them to me said I sternly noting a glitter in his eye that suggested the domination for the moment of the Raffles in him Tush Jenkins he began uneasily Give them to me or I ll brain you Holmes said I standing over him with a soda water bottle gripped in my right hand for your own good Come give up He meekly obeyed Come now get on your hat said I I want you to go out with me What for Jenkins he almost snarled You ll see what for said I And Raffles Holmes obeying we walked down to the river s edge where I stood for a moment and then hurled the remaining stones far out into the waters Holmes gave a gasp and then a sigh of relief There I said It doesn t matter much to us now whether the confounded things were real or not V THE ADVENTURE OF THE BRASS CHECK Jenkins said Raffles Holmes to me the other night as we sat in my den looking over the criminal news in the evening papers in search of some interesting material for him to work on this paper says that missus Wilbraham Ward Smythe has gone to Atlantic City for a week and will lend her gracious presence to the social functions of the Hotel Garrymore at that interesting city by the sea until Monday the twenty seventh when she will depart for Chicago where her sister is to be married on the twenty ninth How would you like to spend the week with me at the Garrymore It all depends upon what we are going for said I Also what in thunder has missus Wilbraham Ward Smythe got to do with us or we with her Nothing at all said Holmes That is nothing much Who is she I asked eying him suspiciously All I know is what I have seen in the papers said Holmes She came in on the Altruria two weeks ago and attracted considerable attention by declaring one hundred thirty thousand dollars worth of pearl rope that she bought in Paris instead of woman like trying to smuggle it through the custom house It broke the heart of pretty nearly every inspector in the service She d been watched very carefully by the detective bureau in Paris and when she purchased the rope there the news of it was cabled over in cipher so that they d all be on the lookout for it when she came in The whole force on the pier was on the qui vive and one of the most expert women searchers on the pay roll was detailed to give her special attention the minute she set foot on shore but instead of doing as they all believed she would do and giving the inspectors a chance to catch her at trying to evade the duties to their very great profit she calmly and coolly declared the stuff paid her little sixty five per cent like a major and drove off to the Castoria in full possession of her jewels The Collector of the Port had all he could do to keep em from draping the custom house for thirty days they were all so grief stricken She ll probably take the rope to Atlantic City with her Aha said I That s the milk in the cocoanut is it You re after that pearl rope are you Raffles On my honor as a Holmes said he I am not I shall not touch the pearl rope although I have no doubt that I shall have some unhappy moments during the week that I am in the same hotel with it That s one reason why I d like to have you go along Jenkins just to keep me out of temptation Raffles may need more than Holmes to keep him out of mischief I am confident however that with you to watch out for me I shall be able to suppress the strong tendency towards evil which at times besets me We d better keep out of it altogether Holmes said I not liking the weight of responsibility for his good behavior that more than once he had placed on my shoulders You don t deny I suppose that the pearl rope is a factor in your intentions whatever they may be Of course I don t Jenkins was his response If it were not for her pearl rope missus Wilbraham Ward Smythe could go anywhere she pleased without attracting any more attention from me than a passing motor car It would be futile for me to deny that as a matter of fact the pearl rope is an essential part of my scheme and even if it were not futile to do so I should still not deny it because neither my father nor my grandfather Holmes nor Raffles ever forgot that a gentleman does not lie Then count me out said I Even if there is seven thousand five hundred dollars in it for you he said with a twinkle in his eye If it were one hundred seven thousand five hundred dollars you could still count me out I retorted I don t like the business Very well said he with a sight I shall have to go alone and endeavor to fight the terrible temptation unaided with a strong probability that I shall fail and yielding to it commit my first real act of crime and in that event with the possibility of a term at Trenton prison if I am caught Give it up Raffles I pleaded And all because in the hour of my need my best friend whose aid I begged refused me he went on absolutely ignoring my plea Oh well if you put it on that score I said I ll go but you must promise me not to touch the pearls I ll do my best not to he replied As usual you have carte blanche to put me out of business if you catch me trying it With this understanding I accompanied Raffles Holmes to Atlantic City the following afternoon and the following evening we were registered at the Hotel Garrymore Holmes was not mistaken in his belief that missus Wilbraham Ward Smythe would take her famous pearl rope to Atlantic City with her That very evening while we were sitting at dinner the lady entered and draped about her stately neck and shoulders was the thing itself and a more beautiful decoration was never worn by woman from the days of the Queen of Sheba to this day of lavish display in jewels It was a marvel indeed but the moment I saw it I ceased to give the lady credit for superior virtue in failing to smuggle it through the custom house for its very size would have precluded the possibility of a successful issue to any such attempted evasion of the law It was too bulky to have been secreted in any of the ordinary ways known to smugglers Hence her candid acknowledgment of its possession was less an evidence of the lady s superiority to the majority of her sex in the matter of beating the government than of her having been confronted with the proverbial choice of the unidentified Hobson By Jove Jenkins Raffles Holmes muttered hoarsely as mister Ward Smythe paraded the length of the dining room as fairly corruscating with her rich possessions as though she were a jeweller s window incarnate it s a positive crime for a woman to appear in a place like this arrayed like that What right has she to subject poor weak humanity to such temptation as now confronts every servant in this hotel to say nothing of guests who like ourselves are made breathless with such lavish display There s poor old Tommie Bankson over there for instance See how he gloats over those pearls He s fairly red eyed over them I glanced across the dining room and sure enough there sat Tommie Bankson and even from where we were placed we could see his hands tremble with the itch for possession and his lips go dry with excitement as he thought of the material assets in full view under the glare of the dining room electric lights I happen to know on the inside continued Holmes that Tommie is not only a virtual bankrupt through stock speculation but is actually face to face with criminal disgrace for misuse of trust funds all of which he could escape if he could lay his hands upon half the stuff that woman is so carelessly wearing to night Do you think it s fair to wear for the mere gratification of one s vanity things that arouse in the hearts of less fortunate beings such passionate reflections and such dire temptations as those which are now besetting that man I guess we ve got enough to do looking after Raffles to night old man without wasting any of our nerve tissue on Tommie Bankson I replied Come on let s get out of this We ll go over to the Pentagon for the night and to morrow we ll shake the sands of Atlantic City from our feet and hie ourselves back to New York where the temptations are not so strong It s too late said Raffles Holmes I ve set out on this adventure and I m going to put it through I wouldn t give up in the middle of an enterprise of this sort any more than I would let a balky horse refuse to take a fence I d put him to It s going to be harder than I thought but we re in it and I shall stay to the end What the devil is the adventure anyhow I demanded impatiently You vowed you wouldn t touch the rope I hope not to was his response It is up to you to see that I don t My plan does not involve my laying hands upon even the shadow of it So we stayed on at the Garrymore and a worse week I never had anywhere With every glimpse of that infernal jewel the Raffles in Holmes became harder and harder to control In the daytime he was all right but when night came on he was feverish with the desire to acquire possession of the pearls Twice in the middle of the night I caught him endeavoring to sneak out of our room and upon each occasion when I rushed after him and forced him back he made no denial of my charge that he was going after the jewel The last time it involved us both in such a terrible struggle that I vowed then and there that the following morning should see my departure I can t stand the strain Holmes said I Well if you can t stand your strain said Raffles Holmes what do you think of mine The thing to do is to get out that s all I retorted I won t have a nerve left in twenty four hours For four nights now I haven t had a minute s normal sleep and this fight you ve just put up has regularly knocked me out One more day Jenkins he pleaded She goes day after to morrow and so do we We I cried After her Nope she to Chicago we to New York said Holmes Stick it out there s a good fellow and of course I yielded The next day Sunday was one of feverish excitement but we got through it without mishap and on Monday morning it was with a sigh of relief that I saw missus Wilbraham Ward Smythe pull out of the Philadelphia station en route for Chicago while Raffles Holmes and I returned to New York Well Raffles said I as we sped on our homeward way we ve had our trouble for our pains He laughed crisply Have we said he I guess not not unless you have lost the trunk check the porter gave you What this brass thing I demanded taking the check from my pocket and flicking it in the air like a penny That very brass thing said Holmes You haven t lifted that damned rope and put it in my trunk I roared Hush Jenkins For Heaven s sake don t make a scene I haven t done anything of the sort he whispered looking about him anxiously to make sure that we had not been overheard Those pearls are as innocent of my touch as the top of the Himalaya Mountains is of yours Then what have you done I demanded sulkily Just changed a couple of trunk checks that s all said Raffles Holmes That bit of brass you have in your hand which was handed to you in the station by the porter of the Garrymore when presented at Jersey City will put you in possession of missus Wilbraham Ward Smythe s trunk containing the bulk of her jewels She s a trifle careless about her possessions as any one could see who watched the nonchalant way in which she paraded the board walk with a small fortune on her neck and fingers Most women would carry such things in a small hand satchel or at least have the trunk sent by registered express but not missus Wilbraham Ward Smythe and thanks to her loud voice listening outside of her door last night I heard her directing her maid here she wished the gems packed And where the dickens is my trunk I asked On the way to Chicago said Raffles Holmes calmly missus Wilbraham Ward Smythe has the check for it Safe business I sneered Bribed the porter I presume Jenkins you are exceedingly uncomplimentary at times said Raffles Holmes showing more resentment than I had ever given him credit for Perhaps you observed that I didn t go to the station in the omnibus No you went over to the drug store after some phenacetine for your headache said I Precisely said Holmes and after purchasing the phenacetine I jumped aboard the Garrymore express wagon and got a lift over to the station It was during that ride that I transferred missus Ward Smythe s check from her trunk to yours and vice versa It s one of the easiest jobs in the Raffles business especially at this season of the year when travel is heavy and porters are overworked I ll see the trunk in the Hudson River pearl rope and all before I ll claim it at Jersey City or anywhere else said I Perfectly right Holmes returned We ll hand the check to the expressman when he comes through the train and neither of us need appear further in the matter It will merely be delivered at your apartment Why not yours said I Raffles said he laconically and I understood And then what I asked Let it alone unopened safe as a church until missus Wilbraham Ward Smythe discovers her loss which will be to morrow afternoon and then Well mister Holmes will step in unravel the mystery prove it to be a mere innocent mistake collect about ten or fifteen thousand dollars reward divvy up with you and the decks will be cleared for what turns up next said this wonderful player of dangerous games And as a beginning Jenkins please sign this he added Holmes handed me a typewritten letter which read as follows THE RICHMORE June thirty nineteen oh five Raffles Holmes esquire DEAR SIR I enclose herewith my check for one thousand dollars as a retainer for your services in locating for me a missing trunk which contains articles which I value at ten thousand dollars This trunk was checked through to New York from Atlantic City on Monday last nine point forty train and has not since been found Whether or not it has been stolen or has gone astray in some wholly innocent manner is not as yet clear I know of no one better equipped for the task of finding it for me than yourself who I am given to understand are the son of the famous Sherlock Holmes of England The check represents the ten per cent commission on the value of the lost articles which I believe is the customary fee for services such as I seek Very truly yours What are you going to do with this I demanded Send it as an enclosure to missus Wilbraham Ward Smythe showing my credentials as your agent in asking her if by any mischance your trunk has got mixed in with her luggage observed Holmes For form s sake I shall send it to twenty or thirty other people known to have left Atlantic City the same day Moreover it will suggest the idea to missus Wilbraham Ward Smythe that I am a good man to locate her trunk also and the delicate intimation of my terms will Aha I see said I And my thousand dollar check to you I shall of course keep observed Holmes You want the whole business to be bona fide don t you It would be unscrupulous for you to ask for its return I didn t exactly like the idea but after all there was much in what Holmes said and the actual risk of my own capital relieved my conscience of the suspicion that by signing the letter I should become a partner in a confidence game Hence I signed the note mailed it to Raffles Holmes enclosing my check for one thousand dollars with it Three days later Holmes entered my room with a broad grin on his face How s this for business said he handing me a letter he had received that morning from Chicago DEAR SIR I am perfectly delighted to receive your letter of July one I think I have mister Jenkins s missing trunk What pleases me most however is the possibility of your recovering mine which also went astray at the same time It contained articles of even greater value than mister Jenkins s my pearl rope among other things which is appraised at one hundred thirty thousand dollars Do you think there is any chance of your recovering it for me I enclose my check for five thousand dollars as a retainer The balance of your ten per cent fee I shall gladly pay on receipt of my missing luggage Most sincerely yours MAUDE WARD SMYTHE I rather think my dear Jenkins observed Raffles Holmes that we have that thirteen thousand dollars reward cinched There s seven thousand dollars for you Jenkins said Holmes a week later handing me his check for that amount Easy money that It only took two weeks to turn the trick and fourteen thousand dollars for fourteen days work is pretty fair pay If we could count on that for a steady income I think I d be able to hold Raffles down without your assistance You got fourteen thousand eh said I I thought it was only to be thirteen thousand dollars It was fourteen thousand counting in your one thousand dollars said Raffles Holmes You see I m playing on the square old man Half and half in everything I squeezed his hand affectionately But he ew I ejaculated with a great feeling of relief I m glad the thing s over with So am I said Holmes with a glitter in his eye If we d kept that trunk in this apartment another day there d have been trouble I had a piece of lead pipe up my sleeve when I called here Tuesday night What for I asked You said Raffles Holmes If you hadn t had that poker party with you I d have knocked you out and gone to China with the Ward Smythe jewels Sherlock Holmes stock was way below par Tuesday night VI THE ADVENTURE OF THE HIRED BURGLAR I had not seen Raffles Holmes for some weeks nor had I heard from him although I had faithfully remitted to his address his share of the literary proceeds of his adventures as promptly as circumstances permitted six hundred dollars on the first tale nine hundred twenty dollars on the second and no less than eighteen hundred dollars on the third showing a constantly growing profit on our combination from my side of the venture These checks had not even been presented for payment at the bank Fearing from this that he might be ill I called at Holmes s lodgings in the Rexmere a well established bachelor apartment hotel on Forty fourth Street to inquire as to the state of his health The clerk behind the desk greeted my cordially as I entered and bade me go at once to Holmes s apartment on the eighteenth floor which I immediately proceeded to do Here is mister Holmes s latch key sir said the clerk He told me you were to have access to his apartment at any time He is in is he I asked I really don t know sir I will call up and inquire if you wish replied the clerk Oh never mind said I I ll go up anyhow and if he is out I ll wait So up I went and a few moments later had entered the apartment As the door opened the little private hallway leading to his den at the rear burst into a flood of light and from an inner room the entrance to which was closed I could hear Holmes s voice cheerily carolling out snatches of such popular airs as Tammany and Ef Yo Habn t Got No Money Yo Needn t Bodder Me I laughed quietly and at the same time breathed a sigh of relief It was very evident from the tone of his voice that there was nothing serious the matter with my friend and partner Hullo Raffles I called out knocking on the door to the inner room Tam ma nee Tam ma nee Swampum swampum Get their wampum Tam ma nee was the sole answer and in such fortissimo tones that I was not surprised that he did not hear me Oh I say Raffles I hallooed rapping on the door again this time with the head of my cane It s Jenkins old man Came to look you up Was afraid something had happened to you Way down upon the Suwanee River Far far away Dere s whar my heart am turnin ever Dere s whar de ole folks stay was the reply Again I laughed He s suffering from a bad attack of coonitis this evening I observed to myself Looks to me as if I d have to let it run its course Whereupon I retired to a very comfortable couch near the window and sat down to await the termination of the musical Five minutes later the singing having shown no signs of abatement I became impatient and a third assault on the door followed this time with cane hands and toes in unison I ll have him out this time or die I ejaculated filled with resolve and then began such a pounding upon the door as should have sufficed to awake a dead Raffles not to mention a living one Hi there Jenkins cried a voice behind me in the midst of this operation identically the same voice too as that still going on in the room in front of me What the dickens are you trying to do batter the house down I whirled about like a flash and was deeply startled to see Raffles himself standing by the divan I had just vacated divesting himself of his gloves and light overcoat You Raffles I roared in astonishment Yep said he Who else But the the other chap in the room there Oh laughed Raffles That s my alibi prover hold on a minute and I ll show you Whereupon he unlocked the door into the bedroom whence had come the tuneful lyrics threw it wide open and revealed to my astonished gaze no less an object than a large talking machine still engaged in the strenuous fulfilment of its noisy mission What the dickens I said It s attacked to my front door said Raffles silencing the machine The minute the door is opened it begins to sing like the four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie But what good is it said I Oh well it keeps the servants from spending too much time in my apartment snooping among my papers perhaps and it my some day come in useful in establishing an alibi if things go wrong with me You d have sworn I was in there just now wouldn t you I would indeed said I Well you see I wasn t so there you are said Raffles Holmes By the way you ve come at an interesting moment There ll be things doing before the evening is over I ve had an anxious caller here five times already to day I ve been standing in the barber shop opposite getting a line on him His card name is Grouch his real name is Here Raffles Holmes leaned forward and whispered in my ear a name of such eminent respectability that I fairly gasped You don t mean the mister Nobody else said Raffles Holmes Only he don t know I know who he is The third time Grouch called I trailed him to Blank s house and then recognized him as Blank himself And what does he want with you I asked That remains to be seen said Raffles Holmes All I know is that next Tuesday he will be required to turn over one hundred thousand dollars unregistered bonds to a young man about to come of age for whom he has been a trustee Aha said I And you think I don t think Jenkins until the time comes Gray matter is scarce these times and I m not wasting any of mine on unnecessary speculation said Raffles Holmes At this point the telephone bell rang and Raffles answered the summons Yes I ll see mister Grouch Show him up he said It would be mighty interesting reading if some newspaper showed him up he added with a grin as he returned By the way Jenkins I think you d better go in there and have a half hour s chat with the talking machine I have an idea old man Grouch won t have much to say with a third party present Listen all you want to but don t breathe too loud or you ll frighten him away I immediately retired and a moment later mister Grouch entered Raffles Holmes s den Glad to see you said Raffles Holmes cordially I was wondering how soon you d be here You expected me then asked the visitor in surprise Yes said Holmes Next Tuesday is young Wilbraham s twenty first birthday and Peering through a crack in the door I could see Grouch stagger You you know my errand then he gasped out Only roughly mister Grouch said Holmes coolly Only roughly But I am very much afraid that I can t do what you want me to Those bonds are doubtless in some broker s box in a safe deposit company and I don t propose to try to borrow them surreptitiously even temporarily from an incorporated institution It is not only a dangerous but a criminal operation Does your employer know that you have taken them My employer stammered Grouch taken off his guard Yes Aren t you the confidential secretary of mister Here Holmes mentioned the name of the eminent financier and philanthropist No one would have suspected from the tone of his voice that Holmes was perfectly aware that Grouch and the eminent financier were one and the same person The idea seemed to please and steady the visitor Why ah yes I am mister Blank s confidential secretary he blurted out And ah of course mister Blank does not know that I have speculated with the bonds and lost them The bonds are In the hands of Bunker Burke I had hoped you would be able to suggest some way in which I could get hold of them long enough to turn them over to young Wilbraham and then in some other way to restore them later to Bunker Burke That is impossible said Raffles Holmes For the reasons stated I cannot be party to a criminal operation It will mean ruin for me if it cannot be done moaned Grouch For mister Blank as well mister Holmes he is so deep in the market he can t possibly pull out I thought possibly you knew of some reformed cracksman who would do this one favor for me just to tide things over All we need is three weeks time three miserable little weeks Can t be done with a safe deposit company at the other end of the line said Raffles Holmes If it were mister Blank s own private vault at his home it would be different That would be a matter between gentlemen between mister Blank and myself but the other would put a corporation on the trail of the safe breaker an uncompromising situation Grouch s eye glistened You know a man who for a consideration and with a guarantee against prosecution would break open my I mean mister Blank s private vault he cried I think so said Raffles Holmes noncommittally Not as a crime however merely as a favor and with the lofty purpose of saving an honored name from ruin My advice to you would be to put a dummy package supposed to contain the missing bonds along with about thirty thousand dollars worth of other securities in that vault and so arrange matters that on the night preceding the date of young Wilbraham s majority the man I will send you shall have the opportunity to crack it open and get away with the stuff unmolested and unseen Next day young Wilbraham will see for himself why it is that mister Blank cannot turn over the trust That is the only secure and I may say decently honest way out of your trouble mister Raffles Holmes you are a genius cried Grouch ecstatically And then he calmed down again as an unpleasant thought flashed across his mind Why is it necessary to put thirty thousand dollars additional in the safe mister Holmes Simply as a blind said Holmes Young Wilbraham would be suspicious if the burglar got away with nothing but his property wouldn t he Quite so said Grouch And now mister Holmes what will this service cost me Five thousand dollars said Holmes Phe e e w whistled Grouch Isn t that pretty steep No mister Grouch I save two reputations yours and mister Blank s Twenty five hundred dollars is not much to pay for a reputation these days I mean a real one of course such as yours is up to date said Holmes coldly Payable by certified check said Grouch Not much laughed Holmes In twenty dollar bills mister Grouch You may leave them in the safe along with the other valuables Thank you mister Holmes said Grouch rising It shall be as you say Before I go sir may I ask how you knew me and by what principle of deduction you came to guess my business so accurately It was simple enough said Holmes I knew in the first place that so eminent a person as mister Blank would not come to me in the guise of a mister Grouch if he hadn t some very serious trouble on his mind I knew from reading the society items in the Whirald that mister Bobby Wilbraham would celebrate the attainment of his majority by a big fete on the seventeenth of next month Everybody knows that mister Blank is mister Wilbraham s trustee until he comes of age It was easy enough to surmise from that what the nature of the trouble was Two and two almost invariably make four mister Grouch And how the devil demanded Grouch angrily how the devil did you know I was Blank mister Blank passes the plate at the church I go to every Sunday said Holmes laughing and it would take a great sight more than a two dollar wig and a pair of fifty cent whiskers to conceal that pompous manner of his Tush You would better not make me angry mister Holmes said Grouch reddening You can get as angry as you think you can afford to for all I care mister Blank said Holmes It s none of my funeral you know And so the matter was settled The unmasked Blank seeing that wrath was useless calmed down and accepted Holmes s terms and method for his relief I ll have my man there at four A M October seventeenth mister Blank said Holmes See that your end of it is ready The coast must be kept clear or the scheme falls through Grouch went heavily out and Holmes called me back into the room Jenkins said he that man is one of the biggest scoundrels in creation and I m going to give him a jolt Where are you going to get the retired burglar I asked Sir returned Raffles Holmes this is to be a personally conducted enterprise It s a job worthy of may grandsire on my mother s side Raffles will turn the trick And it turned out so to be for the affair went through without a hitch The night of October sixteenth I spend at Raffles s apartments He was as calm as though nothing unusual were on hand He sang songs played the piano and up to midnight was as gay and skittish as a school boy on vacation As twelve o clock struck however he sobered down put on his hat and coat and bidding me remain where I was departed by means of the fire escape Keep up the talk Jenkins he said The walls are thin here and it s just as well in matters of this sort that our neighbors should have the impression that I have not gone out I ve filled the machine up with a choice lot of songs and small talk to take care of my end of it A consolidated gas company life yourself should have no difficulty in filling in the gaps And with that he left me to as merry and withal as nervous a three hours as I ever spent in my life Raffles had indeed filled that talking machine thirteen full cylinders of it with as choice an assortment of causeries and humorous anecdotes as any one could have wished to hear Now and again it would bid me cheer up and not worry about him Once along about two A M it cried out You ought to see me now Jenkins I m right in the middle of this Grouch job and it s a dandy I ll teach him a lesson The effect of all this was most uncanny It was as if Raffles Holmes himself spoke to me from the depths of that dark room in the Blank household where he was engaged in an enterprise of dreadful risk merely to save the good name of one who no longer deserved to bear such a thing In spite of all this however as the hours passed I began to grow more and more nervous The talking machine sang and chattered but when four o clock came and Holmes had not yet returned I became almost frenzied with excitement and then at the climax of the tension came the flash of his dark lantern on the fire escape and he climbed heavily into the room Thank Heaven you re back I cried You have reason to said Holmes sinking into a chair Give me some whiskey That man Blank is a worse scoundrel than I took him for What s happened I asked Didn t he play square No said Holmes breathing heavily He waited until I had busted the thing open and was on my way out in the dark hall and then pounced on me with his butler and valet I bowled the butler down the kitchen stairs and sent the valet holing into the dining room with an appendicitis jab in the stomach and had the pleasure of blacking both of mister Blank s eyes And the stuff Right here said Holmes tapping his chest I was afraid something might happen on the way out and I kept both hands free I haven t much confidence in philanthropists like Blank Fortunately the scrimmage was in the dark so Blank will never know who hit him What are you going to do with the thirty five thousand dollars I queried as we went over the booty later and found it all there Don t know haven t made up my mind said Holmes laconically I m too tired to think about that now It s me for bed And with that he turned in Two days later about nine o clock in the evening mister Grouch again called and Holmes received him courteously Well mister Holmes Grouch observed unctuously rubbing his hands together it was a nice job neatly done It saved the day for me Wilbraham was satisfied and has given me a whole year to make good the loss My reputation is saved and Excuse me mister Blank or Grouch er to what do you refer asked Holmes Why our little transaction of Monday night or was it Tuesday morning said Grouch Oh that said Holmes Well I m glad to hear you managed to pull it off satisfactorily I was a little worried about it I was afraid you were done for Done for said Grouch No indeed The little plan when off without a hitch Good said Holmes I congratulate you Whom did you get to do the job Who what what why what do you mean mister Holmes gasped Grouch Precisely what I say or maybe you don t like to tell me such things are apt to be on a confidential basis Anyhow I m glad you re safe mister Grouch and I hope your troubles are over They will be when you give me back my thirty thousand dollars said Grouch Your what demanded Holmes with well feigned surprise My thirty thousand dollars repeated Blank his voice rising to a shout My dear mister Grouch said Holmes how should I know anything about your thirty thousand dollars Didn t your your man take it demanded Grouch huskily My man Really mister Grouch you speak in riddles this evening Pray make yourself more clear Your reformed burglar who broke open my safe and Grouch went on I have no such man mister Grouch Didn t you send a man to my house mister Raffles to break open my safe and take certain specified parcels of negotiable property therefrom said Grouch rising and pounding the table with his fists I did not returned Holmes with equal emphasis I have never in my life sent anybody to your house sir Then who in the name of Heaven did roared Grouch The stuff is gone Holmes shrugged his shoulders I am willing said he calmly to undertake to find out who did it if anybody if that is what you mean mister Grouch Ferreting out crime is my profession Otherwise I beg to assure you that my interest in the case ceases at this moment Here Holmes rose with quiet dignity and walked to the door You will find me at my office in the morning mister Grouch he remarked in case you wish to consult me professionally Hah sneered Grouch You think you can put me off this way do you I think so said Holmes with a glittering eye No gentleman or other person may try to raise a disturbance in my private apartments and remain there We ll see what the police have to say about this mister Raffles Holmes Grouch shrieked as he made for the door Very well said Holmes I ve no doubt they will find our discussion of the other sinners very interesting They are welcome to the whole story as far as I am concerned And he closed the door on the ashen face of the suffering mister Grouch What shall I do with your share of the thirty thousand dollars Jenkins said Raffles Holmes a week later Anything you please said I Only don t offer any of it to me I can t question the abstract justice of your mulcting old Blank for the amount but somehow or other I don t want any of it myself Send it to the Board of Foreign Missions Good said Holmes That s what I ve done with my share See And he showed me an evening paper in which the board conveyed its acknowledgment of the generosity of an unknown donor of the princely sum of fifteen thousand dollars VII THE REDEMPTION OF YOUNG BILLINGTON RAND Jenkins said Raffles Holmes lighting his pipe and throwing himself down upon my couch don t you sometimes pine for those good old days of Jack Sheppard and Dick Turpin Hang it all I m getting blisteringly tired of the modern refinements in crime and yearn for the period when the highwayman met you on the road and made you stand and deliver at the point of the pistol Indeed I don t I ejaculated I m not chicken livered Raffles but I m mighty glad my lines are cast in less strenuous scenes When a book agent comes in here for instance and holds me up for nineteen dollars a volume for a set of Kipling in words of one syllable illustrated by his aunt and every volume autographed by his uncle s step sister it s a game of wits between us as to whether I shall buy or not buy and if he gets away with my signature to a contract it is because he has legitimately outwitted me But your ancient Turpin overcame you by brute force you hadn t a run for your money from the moment he got his eye on you and no percentage of the swag was ever returned to you has in the case of the Double Cross Edition of Kipling in which you get at least fifty cents worth of paper and print for every nineteen dollars you give up That is merely the commercial way of looking at it protested Holmes You reckon up the situation on a basis of mere dollars strike a balance and charge the thing up to profit and loss But the romance of it all the element of the picturesque the delicious tingling sense of adventure which was inseparable from a road experience with a commanding personality like Turpin these things are all lost in your prosaic book agent methods of our day No man writing his memoirs for the enlightenment of posterity would ever dream of setting down upon paper the story of how a book agent robbed him of two hundred dollars but the chap who has been held up in the dark recesses of a forest on a foggy night by a Jack Sheppard would always find breathless and eager listeners to or readers of the tale he had to tell even if he lost only a nickel by the transaction Well old man said I I m satisfied with the prosaic methods of the gas companies the book agents and the riggers of the stock market Give me Wall Street and you take Dick Turpin and all his crew But what has set your mind to working on the Dick Turpin end of it anyhow Thinking of going in for that sort of thing yourself M m m yes replied Holmes hesitatingly I am Not that I pine to become one of the Broom Squires myself but because I well I may be forced into it Take my advice Raffles I interrupted earnestly Let fire arms and highways alone There s too much of battle murder and sudden death in loaded guns and surplus of publicity in street work You mustn t take me so literally Jenkins he retorted I m not going to follow precisely in the steps of Turpin but a hold up on the public highway seems to be the only way out of a problem which I have been employed to settle Do you know young Billington Rand By sight said I with a laugh And by reputation You re not going to hold him up are you I added contemptuously Why not said Holmes It s like breaking into an empty house in search of antique furniture I explained Common report has it that Billington Rand has already been skinned by about every skinning agency in town He s posted at all his clubs Every gambler in town professional as well as social has his I O U s for bridge poker and faro debts Everybody knows it except those fatuous people down in the Kenesaw National Bank where he s employed and the Fidelity Company that s on his bond He wouldn t last five minutes in either place if his uncle wasn t a director in both concerns I see that you have a pretty fair idea of Billington Rand s financial condition said Holmes It s rather common talk in the clubs so why shouldn t I I put in Holding him up would be at most an act of petit larceny if you measure a crime by what you get out of it It s a great shame though for at heart Rand is one of the best fellows in the world He s a man who has all the modern false notions of what a fellow ought to do to keep up what he calls his end He plays cards and sustains ruinous losses because he thinks he won t be considered a good fellow if he stays out He plays bridge with ladies and pays up when he loses and doesn t collect when he wins Win or lose he s doomed to be on the wrong side of the market just because of those very qualities that make him a lovable person kind to everybody but himself and weak as dish water For Heaven s sake Raffles if the poor devil has anything left don t take it from him Your sympathy for Rand does you credit said Holmes But I have just as much of that as you have and that is why at half past five o clock to morrow afternoon I m going to hold him up in the public eye and incontinently rob him of twenty five thousand dollars Twenty five thousand dollars Billington Rand I gasped Twenty five thousand dollars Billington Rand repeated Holmes firmly If you don t believe it come along and see He doesn t know you does he Not from Adam said I Very good then you ll be safe as a church Meet me in the Fifth Avenue Hotel corridor at five to morrow afternoon and I ll show you as pretty a hold up as you ever dreamed of said Holmes But I can t take part in a criminal proceeding like that Holmes I protested You won t have to even if it were a criminal proceeding which it is not he returned Nobody outside of you and me will know anything about it but Rand himself and the chances that he will peach are less than a millionth part of a half per cent Anyhow all you need be is a witness There was a long and uneasy silence I was far from liking the job but after all so far Holmes had not led me into any difficulties of a serious nature and knowing him as I had come to know him I had a hearty belief that any wrong he did was temporary and was sure to be rectified in the long run I ve a decent motive in all this Jenkins he resumed in a few moments Don t forget that This hold up is going to result in a reformation that will be for the good of everybody so don t have any scruples on that score All right Raffles said I You ve always played straight with me so far and I don t doubt your word only I hate the highway end of it Tutt Jenkins he ejaculated with a laugh and giving me a whack on the shoulders that nearly toppled me over into the fire place Don t be a rabbit The thing will be as easy as cutting calve s foot jelly with a razor Thus did I permit myself to be persuaded and the next afternoon at five Holmes and I met in the corridor of the Fifth Avenue Hotel Come on he said after the first salutations were over Rand will be at the Thirty third Street subway at five point fifteen and it is important that we should catch him before he gets to Fifth Avenue I m glad it s to be on a side street I remarked my heart beating rapidly with excitement over the work in hand for the more I thought of the venture the less I liked it Oh I don t know that it will be said Holmes carelessly I may pull it off in the corridors of the Powhatan The pumps in my heart reversed their action and for a moment I feared I should drop with dismay In the Powhatan I began Shut up Jenkins said Holmes imperatively This is no time for protests We re in it now and there s no drawing back Ten minutes later we stood at the intersection of Thirty third Street and Fifth Avenue Holmes s eyes flashed and his whole nervous system quivered as with the joy of the chase Keep your mouth shut Jenkins and you ll see a pretty sight he whispered for here comes our man Sure enough there was Billington Rand on the other side of the street walking along nervously and clutching an oblong package wrapped in brown paper firmly in his right hand Now for it said Holmes and we crossed the street scarcely reaching the opposite curb before Rand was upon us Rand eyed us closely and shied off to one side as Holmes blocked his progress I ll trouble you for that package mister Rand said Holmes quietly The man s face went white and he caught his breath Who the devil are you he demanded angrily That has nothing to do with the case retorted Holmes I want that package or Get out of my way cried Rand with a justifiable show of resentment Or I ll call an officer Will you said Holmes quietly Will you call an officer and so make known to the authorities that you are in possession of twenty five thousand dollars worth of securities that belong to other people which are supposed at this moment to be safely locked up in the vaults of the Kenesaw National Back along with other collateral Rand staggered back against the newel post of a brown stone stoop and stood there gazing wildly into Holmes s face Of course if you prefer having the facts made known in that way Holmes continued coolly you have the option I am not going to use physical force to persuade you to hand the package over to me but you are a greater fool than I take you for if you choose that alternative To use an expressive modern phrase mister Billington Rand you will be caught with the goods on and unless you have a far better explanation of how those securities happen in your possession at this moment than I think you have there is no power on earth can keep you from landing in state prison The unfortunate victim of Holmes s adventure fairly gasped in his combined rage and fright Twice he attempted to speak but only inarticulate sounds issued from his lips You are of course very much disturbed at the moment Holmes went on and I am really very sorry if anything I have done has disarranged any honorable enterprise in which you have embarked I don t wish to hurry you into a snap decision which you may repent later only either the police or I must have that package within an hour It is for you to say which of us is to get it Suppose we run over to the Powhatan and discuss the matter calmly over a bottle of Glengarry Possibly I can convince you that it will be for your own good to do precisely as I tell you and very much to your disadvantage to do otherwise Rand stupefied by this sudden intrusion upon his secret by an utter stranger lost what little fight there was left in him and at least seemed to assent to Holmes s proposition The latter linked arms with him and in a few minutes we walked into the famous hostelry just as if we were three friends bent only upon having a pleasant chat over a cafe table What ll you have mister Rand asked Holmes suavely I m elected for the Glengarry special with a little carbonic on the side Same said Rand laconically Sandwich with it asked Holmes You d better Oh I can t eat anything began Rand I Bring us some sandwiches waiter said Holmes Two Glengarry special a syphon of carbonic and Jenkins what s yours The calmness and the cheek of the fellow I m not in on this at all I retorted angered by Holmes s use of my name And I want mister Rand to understand Oh tutt ejaculated Holmes He knows that mister Rand my friend Jenkins has no connection with this enterprise of mine and he s done his level best to dissuade me from holding you up so summarily All he s along for is to write the thing up for The newspapers cried Rand now thoroughly frightened No laughed Holmes Nothing so useful the magazines Holmes winked at me as he spoke and I gathered that there was method in his apparent madness That s one of the points you want to consider though mister Rand he said leaning upon the table with his elbows Think of the newspapers to morrow morning if you call the police rather than hand that package over to me It ll be a big sensation for Wall Street and upper Fifth Avenue to say nothing of what the yellows will make of the story for the rest of hoi polloi The newsboys will be yelling extras all over town printed in great red letters A Club man Held Up in Broad Daylight For twenty five thousand dollars In Securities That Didn t Belong to Him Billington Rand Has Something To Explain Where Did He Get It For Heavens sake man don t pleased the unfortunate Billington God I never thought of that Of course you didn t think of that said Holmes That s why I m telling you about it now You don t dispute my facts do you No I Rand began Of course not said Holmes You might as well dispute the existence of the Flat iron Building If you don t want to morrow s papers to be full of this thing you ll hand that package over to me But protested Rand I m only taking them up to to a er to a broker Here he gathered himself together and spoke with greater assurance I am delivering them sir to a broker on behalf of one of our depositors who Who has been speculating with what little money he had left has lost his margins and is now forced into an act of crime to protect his speculation said Holmes The broker is the notorious William C Gallagher who runs an up town bucket shop for speculative ladies to lose their pin money and bridge winnings in and your depositor s name is Billington Rand esquire otherwise yourself How do you know all this gasped Rand Oh maybe I read it on the ticker laughed Holmes Or what is more likely possibly I overheard Gallagher recommending you to dip into the bank s collateral to save your investment at Green s chop house last night You were at Green s chop house last night cried Rand In the booth adjoining your own and I heard every word you said said Holmes Well I don t see why I should give the stuff to you anyhow growled Rand Chiefly because I happen to be long on information which would be of interest not only to the police but to the president and board of directors of the Kenesaw National Back mister Rand said Holmes It will be a simple matter for me to telephone mister Horace Huntington the president of your institution and put him wise to this transaction of yours and that is the second thing I shall do immediately you have decided not to part with that package The second thing Rand whimpered What will you do first Communicate with the first policeman we meet when we leave here said Holmes But take your time mister Rand take your time Don t let me hurry you into a decision Try a little of this Glengarry and we ll drink hearty to a sensible conclusion I I ll put them back in the vaults to morrow pleaded Rand Can t trust you my boy said Holmes Not with a persuasive crook like old Bucket ship Gallagher on your trail They re safer with me Rand s answer was a muttered oath as he tossed the package across the table and started to leave us One word more mister Rand said Holmes detaining him Don t do anything rash There s a lot of good fellowship between criminals and I ll stand by you all right So far nobody knows you took these things and even when they turn up missing if you go about your work as if nothing had happened while you may be suspected nobody can prove that you got the goods Rand s face brightened at this remark By Jove that s true enough said he Excepting Gallagher he added his face falling Pah for Gallagher cried Holmes snapping his fingers contemptuously If he as much as peeped we could put him in jail and if he sells you out you tell him for me that I ll land him in Sing Sing for a term of years He led you into this He certainly did moaned Rand And he s got to get you out said Holmes Now good bye old man The worst that can happen to you is a few judgments instead of penal servitude for eight or ten years unless you are foolish enough to try another turn of this sort and then you may not happen on a good natured highwayman like myself to get you out of your troubles By the way what is the combination of the big safe in the outer office of the Kenesaw National One eight nine seven said Rand Thanks said Holmes jotting it down coolly in his memorandum book That s a good thing to know That night shortly before midnight Holmes left me I ve got to finish this job said he The most ticklish part of the business is yet to come Great Scott Holmes I cried Isn t the thing done No of course not he replied I ve got to bust open the Kenesaw safe Now my dear Raffles I began why aren t you satisfied with what you ve done already Why must you Shut up Jenkins he interrupted with a laugh If you knew what I was going to do you wouldn t kick that is unless you ve turned crook too Not I said I indignantly You don t expect me to keep these bonds do you he asked But what are you going to do with them I retorted Put em back in the Kenesaw Bank where they belong so that they ll be found there to morrow morning As sure as I don t Billington Rand is doomed said he It s a tough job but I ve been paid a thousand dollars by his family to find out what he s up to and by thunder after following his trail for three weeks I ve got such a liking for the boy that I m going to save him if it can be done and if there s any Raffles left in me such a simple proposition as cracking a bank and puting the stuff back where it belongs in a safe of which I have the combination isn t going to stand in my way Don t fret old man it s as good as done Good night And Raffles Holmes was off I passed a feverish night but at five o clock the following morning a telephone message set all my misgivings at rest Hello Jenkins came Raffles s voice over the wire Hello I replied Just rang you up to let you know that it s all right The stuff s replaced Easiest job ever like opening oysters Pleasant dreams to you he said and click the connection was broken Two weeks later Billington Rand resigned from the Kenesaw Bank and went West where he is now leading the simple life on a sheep ranch His resignation was accepted with regret and the board of directors as a special mark of their liking voted him a gift of twenty five hundred dollars for faithful services And the best part of it was said Holmes when he told me of the young man s good fortune that his accounts were as straight as a string Holmes you are a bully chap I cried in a sudden excess of enthusiasm You do things for nothing sometimes Nothing echoed Holmes nothing Why that job was worth a million dollars to me Jenkins but not in coin Just in good solid satisfaction in saving a fine young chap like Billington Rand from the clutches of a sharper and sneaking skinflint like old Bucket shop Gallagher VIII THE NOSTALGIA OF NERVY JIM THE SNATCHER 
7507-100660-0000	train-other-500	Raffles Holmes was unusually thoughtful the other night when he entered my apartment and for a long time I could get nothing out of him save an occasional grunt of assent or dissent from propositions advanced by myself
7507-100660-0001	train-other-500	It was quite evident that he was cogitating deeply over some problem that was more than ordinarily vexatious so I finally gave up all efforts at conversation pushed the cigars closer to him
none	none	 poured him out a stiff dose of his favorite Glengarry 
7507-100660-0002	train-other-500	and returned to my own work It was a full hour before he volunteered an observation of any kind and then he plunged rapidly into a very remarkable tale
7507-100660-0003	train-other-500	I had a singular adventure to day Jenkins he said Do you happen to have in your set of my father s adventures a portrait of Sherlock Holmes Yes I have I replied
none	none	 But you don t need anything of the kind to refresh your memory of him All you have to do is to look at yourself in the glass 
7507-100660-0004	train-other-500	and you ve got the photograph before you I am so like him then he queried Most of the time old man I am glad to say said I There are days when you are the living image of your grandfather Raffles
7507-100660-0005	train-other-500	but that is only when you are planning some scheme of villany I can almost invariably detect the trend of your thoughts by a glance at your face you are Holmes himself in your honest moments Raffles at others
none	none	 For the past week it has delighted me more than I can say to find you a fac simile of your splendid father with naught to suggest your fascinating but vicious granddad That s what I wanted to find out 
7507-100660-0006	train-other-500	I had evidence of it this afternoon on Broadway said he It was bitterly cold up around Fortieth Street snowing like the
7507-100660-0007	train-other-500	devil and such winds as you d expect to find nowhere this side of Greenland s icy mountains I came out of a Broadway chop house and started north
7507-100660-0008	train-other-500	when I was stopped by an ill clad down trodden specimen of humanity who begged me for the love of Heaven to give him a drink The poor chap s condition was such that it would have been manslaughter to refuse him
7507-100660-0009	train-other-500	and a moment later I had him before the Skidmore bar gurgling down a tumblerful of raw brandy as though it were water He wiped his mouth on his sleeve
none	none	 and turned to thank me when a look of recognition came into his face and he staggered back half in fear and half in amazement 
7507-100660-0010	train-other-500	Sherlock Holmes he cried Am I said I calmly my curiosity much excited Him or his twin said he
none	none	 How should you know me I asked Good reason enough he muttered Twas Sherlock Holmes as landed me for ten years in Reading gaol Well my friend I answered I ve no doubt you deserved it if he did it 
7507-100660-0011	train-other-500	I am not Sherlock Holmes however but his son Will you let me take you by the hand governor he whispered hoarsely Not for the kindness you ve shown me here but for the service your old man did me
7507-100660-0012	train-other-500	I am Nervy Jim the Snatcher Service said I with a laugh You consider it a service
none	none	 to be landed in Reading gaol They was the only happy years I ever had sir he answered impetuously 
7507-100660-0013	train-other-500	The keepers was good to me I was well fed kept workin hard at an honest job pickin oakum
none	none	 the gaol was warm 
7507-100660-0014	train-other-500	and I never went to bed by night or got up o mornin s worried over the question o how I was goin to get the swag to pay my rent Compared to this with a wave of his hand at the raging of the elements along Broadway
none	none	 Reading gaol was heaven sir and since I was discharged I ve been a helpless hopeless wanderer 
7507-100660-0015	train-other-500	sleepin in doorways chilled to the bone half starved with not a friendly eye in sight and nothin to do all day long and all night long but move on when the Bobbies tell me to
7507-100660-0016	train-other-500	and think about the happiness I d left behind me when I left Reading Was you ever homesick governor
none	none	 I confessed to an occasional feeling of nostalgia for old Picadilly and the Thames 
7507-100660-0017	train-other-500	Then you know says he how I feels now in a strange land dreamin of my comfortable little cell at Reading the good meals the pleasant keepers and a steady job with nothin to worry about for ten short years
7507-100660-0018	train-other-500	I want to go back governor I want to go back Well said Holmes lighting a cigar I was pretty nearly floored
7507-100660-0019	train-other-500	but when the door of the saloon blew open and a blast of sharp air and a furry of snow came in I couldn t blame the poor beggar certainly any place in the world even a jail was more comfortable than Broadway at that moment
7507-100660-0020	train-other-500	I explained to him however that as far as Reading gaol was concerned I was powerless to help him But there s just as good prisons here ain t there governor he pleaded Oh yes said I laughing at the absurdity of the situation
7507-100660-0021	train-other-500	Sing Sing is a first class up to date penitentiary with all modern improvements and a pretty select clientele Couldn t you put me in there governor he asked wistfully I ll do anything you ask short o murder
7507-100660-0022	train-other-500	governor if you only will Why don t you get yourself arrested as a vagrant I asked That ll give you three months on Blackwell s Island and will tide you over the winter Tain t permanent governor he objected
none	none	 At the end o three months I d be out and have to begin all over again What I want is something I can count on for ten or twenty years Besides I has some pride governor 
7507-100660-0023	train-other-500	and for Nervy Jim to do three months time Lor sir I couldn t bring myself to nothin so small There was no resisting the poor cuss Jenkins and I promised to do what I could for him That s a nice job said I
7507-100660-0024	train-other-500	What can you do That s what stumps me said Raffles Holmes scratching his head in perplexity I ve set him up in a small tenement down on East Houston Street temporarily and meanwhile
7507-100660-0025	train-other-500	it s up to me to land him in Sing Sing where he can live comfortably for a decade or so and I m hanged if I know how to do it He used to be a first class second story man
none	none	 and in his day was an A one snatcher 
7507-100660-0026	train-other-500	as his name signifies and my father s diaries attest but I m afraid his hand is out for a nice job such as I would care to have anything to do with myself Better let him slide Raffles said I
7507-100660-0027	train-other-500	He introduces the third party element into our arrangement and that s mighty dangerous True but consider the literary value of a chap that s homesick for jail he answered persuasively
7507-100660-0028	train-other-500	I don t know but I think he s new Ah the insidious appeal of that man He knew the crack in my armor and with neatness and despatch he pierced it and I fell Well I demurred Good said he
7507-100660-0029	train-other-500	We ll consider it arranged I ll fix him out in a week Holmes left me at this point and for two days I heard nothing from him On the morning of the third day he telephoned me
7507-100660-0030	train-other-500	to meet him at the stage door of the Metropolitan Opera House at four o clock Bring your voice with you said he enigmatically we may need it An immediate explanation of his meaning was impossible
none	none	 for hardly were the words out of his mouth when he hung up the receiver and cut the connection I wanted to excite your curiosity so that you would be sure to come he laughed 
7507-100660-0031	train-other-500	when I asked his meaning later You and I are going to join mister Conried s selected chorus of educated persons who want to earn their grand opera instead of paying five dollars a performance for it
7507-100660-0032	train-other-500	And so we did although I objected a little at first I can t sing said I Of course you can t said he If you could you wouldn t go into the chorus But don t bother about that
7507-100660-0033	train-other-500	I have a slight pull here and we can get in all right as long as we are moderately intelligent and able bodied enough to carry a spear By the way
7507-100660-0034	train-other-500	in musical circles my name is Dickson Don t forget that That Holmes had a pull was shortly proven for although neither of us was more than ordinarily gifted vocally we proved acceptable
none	none	 and in a short time found ourselves enrolled among the supernumeraries who make of Lohengrin a splendid spectacle to the eye I found real zest in life carrying that spear and entered into the spirit 
7507-100660-0035	train-other-500	of what I presumed to be a mere frolic with enthusiasm merely for the experience of it to say nothing of the delight I took in the superb music which I have always loved And then the eventful night came It was Monday
none	none	 and the house was packed On both sides of the curtain everything was brilliant The cast was one of the best and the audience all that the New York audience is noted for 
7507-100660-0036	train-other-500	in wealth beauty and social prestige and in the matter of jewels of lavish display Conspicuous in respect to the last was the ever popular though somewhat eccentric
none	none	 missus Robinson Jones who in her grand tier box fairly scintillated with those marvellous gems which gave her as a musical critic whose notes on the opera 
7507-100660-0037	train-other-500	were chiefly confined to observations on its social aspects put it the appearance of being lit up by electricity Even from where I stood
none	none	 as a part and parcel of the mock king s court on the stage I could see the rubies and sapphires and diamonds loom large upon the horizon as the read white and blue emblem of our national greatness to the truly patriotic soul Little did I dream as I stood in the rear line of the court clad in all the gorgeous regalia of a vocal supernumerary and swelling the noisy welcome to the advancing Lohengrin with my apology for a voice how intimately associated with these lustrous headlights I was soon to be and as Raffles Holmes and I poured out our souls in song not even his illustrious father would have guessed that he was there upon any other business than that of mister Conried As far as I could see Raffles was wrapt in the music of the moment and not once to my knowledge did he seem to be aware that there was such a thing as an audience much less one individual member of it on the other side of the footlights Like a member of the Old Choral Guard he went through the work in hand as nonchalantly as though it were his regular business in life It was during the intermission between the first and second acts that I began to suspect that there was something in the wind beside music for Holmes s face became set and the resemblance to his honorable father which had of late been so marked seemed to dissolve itself into an unpleasant suggestion of his other forbear the acquisitive Raffles My own enthusiasm for our operatic experience which I took no pains to conceal found no response in him and from the fall of the curtain on the first act it seemed to me as if he were trying to avoid me So marked indeed did this desire to hold himself aloof become that I resolved to humor him in it and instead of clinging to his side as had been my wont I let him go his own way and at the beginning of the second act he disappeared I did not see him again until the long passage between Ortrud and Telrammund was on when in the semi darkness of the stage I caught sight of him hovering in the vicinity of the electric switch board by which the lights of the house are controlled Suddenly I saw him reach out his hand quickly and a moment later every box light went out leaving the auditorium in darkness relieved only by the lighting of the stage Almost immediately there came a succession of shrieks from the grand tier in the immediate vicinity of the Robinson Jones box and I knew that something was afoot Only a slight commotion in the audience was manifest to us upon the stage but there was a hurrying and scurrying of ushers and others of greater or less authority until finally the box lights flashed out again in all their silk tasselled illumination The progress of the opera was not interrupted for a moment but in that brief interval of blackness at the rear of the house some one had had time to force his way into the Robinson Jones box and snatch from the neck of its fair occupant that wondrous hundred thousand dollar necklace of matchless rubies that had won the admiring regard of many beholders and the envious interest of not a few Three hours later Raffles Holmes and I returned from the days and dress of Lohengrin s time to affairs of to day and when we were seated in my apartment along about two o clock in the morning Holmes lit a cigar poured himself out a liberal dose of Glengarry and with a quiet smile leaned back in his chair Well he said what about it You have the floor Raffles I answered Was that your work One end of it said he It went off like clock work Poor old Nervy has won his board and lodging for twenty years all right But he s got away with it I put in As far as East Houston Street Holmes observed quietly To morrow I shall take up the case track Nervy to his lair secure missus Robinson Jones necklace return it to the lady and within three weeks the Snatcher will take up his abode on the banks of the Hudson the only banks the ordinary cracksman is anxious to avoid But how the dickens did you manage to put a crook like that on the grand tier floor I demanded Jenkins what a child you are laughed Holmes How did I get him there Why I set him up with a box of his own directly above the Robinson Jones box you can always get one for a single performance if you are willing to pay for it and with a fair expanse of shirt front a claw hammer and a crush hat almost any man who has any style to him at all these days can pass for a gentleman All he had to do was to go to the opera house present his ticket walk in and await the signal I gave the man his music cue and two minutes before the lights went out he sauntered down the broad staircase to the door of the Robinson Jones box and was ready to turn the trick He was under cover of darkness long enough to get away with the necklace and when the lights came back if you had known enough to look out into the auditorium you would have seen him back there in his box above taking in the situation as calmly as though he had himself had nothing whatever to do with it And how shall you trace him I demanded Isn t that going to be a little dangerous Not if he followed out my instructions said Holmes If he dropped a letter addressed to himself in his own hand writing at his East Houston Street lair in the little anteroom of the box as I told him to do we ll have all the clews we need to run him to earth But suppose the police find it I asked They won t laughed Holmes They ll spend their time looking for some impecunious member of the smart set who might have done the job They always try to find the sensational clew first and by day after to morrow morning four or five poor but honest members of the four hundred will find when they read the morning papers that they are under surveillance while I knowing exactly what has happened will have all the start I need I have already offered my services and by ten o clock to morrow morning they will be accepted as will also those of half a hundred other detectives professional and amateur At eleven I will visit the opera house where I expect to find the incriminating letter on the floor or if the cleaning women have already done their work which is very doubtful I will find it later among the sweepings of waste paper in the cellar of the opera house Accompanied by two plain clothes men from headquarters I will then proceed to Nervy s quarters and if he is really sincere in his desire to go to jail for a protracted period we shall find him there giving an imitation of a gloat over his booty And suppose the incriminating letter is not there I asked He may have changed his mind I have arranged for that said Holmes with a quick steely glance at me I ve got a duplicate letter in my pocket now If he didn t drop it I will But Nervy Jim was honest at least in his desire for a permanent residence in an up to date penitentiary for even as the deed itself had been accomplished with a precision that was almost automatic so did the work yet to be done go off with the nicety of a well regulated schedule Everything came about as Holmes had predicted even to the action of the police in endeavoring to fasten the crime upon an inoffensive and somewhat impecunious social dangler whose only ambition in life was to lead a cotillion well and whose sole idea of how to get money under false pretences was to make some over rich old maid believe that he loved her for herself alone and in his heart scorned her wealth Even he profited by this since he later sued the editor who printed his picture with the label A Social Highwayman for libel claiming damages of fifty thousand dollars and then settled the case out of court for fifteen thousand dollars spot cash The letter was found on the floor of the box where Nervy Jim had dropped it Holmes and his plain clothes men paid an early visit at the East Houston Street lodging house and found the happy Snatcher snoring away in his cot with a smile on his face that seemed to indicate that he was dreaming he was back in a nice comfortable jail once more and as if to make assurance doubly sure the missing necklace hung about his swarthy neck Short work was made of the arrest Nervy Him almost embarrassingly grateful was railroaded to Sing Sing in ten days time for fifteen years and Raffles Holmes had the present pleasure and personal satisfaction of restoring the lost necklace to the fair hands of missus Robinson Jones herself Look at that Jenkins He said gleefully when the thing was all over A check for ten thousand dollars Well that isn t so much considering the value of the necklace said I That s the funny part of it laughed Holmes Every stone in it was paste but missus Robinson Jones never let on for a minute She paid her little ten thousand rather than have it known Great Heavens really I said Yes said Holmes replacing the check in his pocket book She s almost as nervy as Nervy Jim himself She s what I call a dead game sport IX THE ADVENTURE OF ROOM four hundred seven Raffles Holmes and I had walked up town together It was a beastly cold night and when we reached the Hotel Powhatan my companion suggested that we stop in for a moment to thaw out our frozen cheeks and incidentally warm up the inner man with some one of the spirituous concoctions for which that hostelry is deservedly famous I naturally acquiesced and in a moment we sat at one of the small tables in the combination reading room and cafe of the hotel Queer place this said Holmes gazing about him at the motley company of guests It is the gathering place of the noted and the notorious That handsome six footer who has just left the room is the Reverend doctor Harkaway possibly the most eloquent preacher they have in Boston At the table over in the corner talking to that gold haired lady with a roasted pheasant on her head in place of a hat is Jack McBride the light weight champion of the Northwest and by thunder Jenkins look at that A heavy browed sharp eyed Englishman appeared in the doorway stood a moment glanced about him eagerly and with a gesture of impatience turned away and disappeared in the throngs of the corridor without There s something doing to bring Lord Baskingford here muttered Holmes Lord Baskingford said I Who s he He s the most expert diamond lifter in London answered Holmes His appearance on Piccadilly was a signal always to Scotland Yard to wake up and to the jewellers of Bond Street to lock up My old daddy used to say that Baskingford could scent a Kohinoor quicker than a hound a fox I wonder what his game is Is he a real lord I asked Real laughed Holmes Yes he s a real Lord of the Lifters if that s what you mean but if you mean does he belong to the peerage no His real name is Bob Hollister He has served two terms in Pentonville escaped once from a Russian prison and is still in the ring He s never idle and if he comes to the Powhatan you can gamble your last dollar on it that he has a good big stake somewhere in the neighborhood We must look over the list of arrivals We finished our drink and settled the score Holmes sauntered in leisurely fashion out into the office and leaning easily over the counter inspected the register Got any real live dukes in the house to night mister Sommers he asked of the clerk Not to night mister Holmes laughed the clerk We re rather shy on the nobility to night The nearest we come to anything worth while in that line is a baronet Sir Henry Darlington of Dorsetshire England We can show you a nice line of Captains of Industry however Thank you Sommers said Holmes returning the laugh I sha n t trouble you Fact is I m long on Captains of Industry and was just a bit hungry to night for a dash of the British nobility Who is Sir Henry Darlington of Dorsetshire England You can search me said the clerk I m too busy to study genealogy but there s a man here who knows who he is all right all right at least I judge so from his manner Who s that asked Holmes Himself said Sommers with a chuckle Now s your chance to ask him for there he goes into the Palm Room We glanced over in the direction indicated and again our eyes fell upon the muscular form of Lord Baskingford Oh said Holmes Well he is a pretty fair specimen isn t he Little too large for my special purpose though Sommers he added so you needn t wrap him up and send him home All right mister Holmes grinned the clerk Come in again some time when we have a few fresh importations in and maybe we can fix you out With a swift glance at the open page of the register Holmes bade the clerk good night and we walked away Room four hundred seven he said as we moved along the corridor Room four hundred seven we mustn t forget that His lordship is evidently expecting some one and I think I ll fool around for a while and see what s in the wind A moment or two later we came face to face with the baronet and watched him as he passed along the great hall scanning every face in the place and on to the steps leading down to the barber shop which he descended He s anxious all right said Holmes as we sauntered along How would you like to take a bite Jenkins I d like to stay here and see this out Very good said I I find it interesting So we proceeded towards the Palm Room and sat down to order our repast Scarcely were we seated when one of the hotel boys resplendent in brass buttons strutted through between the tables calling aloud in a shrill voice Telegram for four oh seven Four hundred and seven telegram That s the number Raffles I whispered excitedly I know it he said quietly Give him another chance Telegram for number four hundred and seven called the buttons Here boy said Holmes nerving himself up Give me that Four hundred and seven sir asked the boy Certainly said Holmes coolly Hand it over any charge No sir said the boy giving Raffles the yellow covered message Thank you said Holmes tearing the flap open carelessly as the boy departed And just then the fictitious baronet entered the room and as Holmes read his telegram passed by us still apparently in search of the unattainable little dreaming how close at hand was the explanation of his troubles I was on the edge of nervous prostration but Holmes never turned a hair and save for a slight tremor of his hand no one would have even guessed that there was anything in the wind Sir Henry Darlington took a seat in the far corner of the room That accounts for his uneasiness said Holmes tossing the telegram across the table I read Slight delay Will meet you at eight with the goods The message was signed Cato Let s see said Holmes It is now six forty five Here lend me your fountain pen Jenkins I produced the desired article and Holmes in an admirably feigned hand added to the message the words at the Abbey Lafayette Boulevard Safer restored it in amended form to its envelope Call one of the bell boys please he said to the waiter A moment later a second buttons appeared This isn t for me boy said Holmes handing the message back to him Better take it to the office Very good sir said the lad and off he went A few minutes after this incident Sir Henry again rose impatiently and left the room and at a proper distance to the rear Holmes followed him Darlington stopped at the desk and observing the telegram in his box called for it and opened it His face flushed as he tore it into scraps and made for the elevator into which he disappeared He s nibbling the bait all right said Holmes gleefully We ll just wait around here until he starts and then we ll see what we can do with Cato This is quite an adventure What do you suppose it s all about I asked I don t know any more than you do Jenkins said Holmes save this that old Bob Hollister isn t playing penny ante When he goes on to a job as elaborately as all this you can bet your last dollar that the game runs into five figures and like a loyal subject of his Gracious Majesty King Edward VII whom may the Lord save he reckons not in dollars but in pounds sterling Who can Cato be I wonder I asked We ll know at eight o clock said Holmes I intend to have him up Up Up where I asked In Darlington s rooms where else demanded Holmes In four hundred and seven I gasped Certainly that s our headquarters isn t it he grinned Now see here Raffles I began Shut up Jenkins he answered Just hang on to your nerve But suppose Darlington turns up My dear boy the Abbey is six miles from here and he won t by any living chance get back before ten o clock to night We shall have a good two hours and a half to do up old Cato without any interference from him said Holmes Suppose he does come what then I rather doubt if Sir Henry Darlington of the Hotel Powhatan New York or Dorsetshire England would find it altogether pleasant to hear a few reminiscences of Bob Hollister of Pentonville prison which I have on tap He ll kick up the deuce of a row I protested Very doubtful Jenkins said Raffles I sort of believe he ll be as gentle as a lamb when he finds out what I know but if he isn t well don t I represent law and order and Holmes displayed a detective s badge which he wore for use in emergency cases pinned to the inner side of his suspenders As he spoke Darlington reappeared and leaving his key at the office went out through the revolving doorway and jumped into a hansom Where to sir asked the cabman The Abbey said Darlington They re off whispered Holmes with a laugh And now for mister Cato We walked back through the office and as we passed the bench upon which the bell boys sat Raffles stopped before the lad who had delivered the telegram to him Here son he said handing him a quarter run over to the news stand and get me a copy of this months Salmagundi I ll be in the smoking room The boy went off on his errand and in a few minutes returned with a magazine Thanks said Holmes Now get me my key and we ll call it square Four hundred and seven sir said the boy with a smile of recognition Yep said Holmes laconically as he leaned back in his chair and pretended to read Gad Holmes what a nerve I muttered We need it in this business said he The buttons returned and delivered the key of Sir Henry Darlington s apartment into the hands of Raffles Holmes Ten minutes later we sat in room four hundred seven I in a blue funk from sheer nervousness Raffles Holmes as imperturbable as the rock of Gibraltar from sheer nerve It was the usual style of hotel room with bath pictures telephone what nots wardrobes and centre table The last proved to be the main point of interest upon our arrival It was littered up with papers of one sort and another letters bills receipted and otherwise and a large assortment of railway and steamship folders He knows how to get away was Holmes s comment on the latter Most of the letters were addressed to Sir Henry Darlington in care of Bruce Watkins Brownleigh company bankers Same old game laughed Holmes as he read the superscription The most conservative banking house in New York It s amazing how such institutions issue letters indiscriminately to any Tom Dick or Harry who comes along and planks down his cash They don t seem to realize that they thereby unconsciously lend the glamour of their own respectability and credit to people who instead of travelling abroad should be locked up in the most convenient penitentiary at home Aha Holmes added as he ran his eye over some of the other documents and came upon a receipted bill We re getting close to it Jenkins Here s a receipted bill from Bar LeDuc company of Fifth Avenue for fifteen thousand dollars three rings one diamond necklace a ruby stick pin and a set of pearl shirt studs Yes said I but what is there suspicious about that If the things are paid for Precisely laughed Holmes They re paid for Sir Henry Darlington has enough working capital to buy all the credit he needs with Messrs Bar LeDuc company There isn t a house in this town that after a cash transaction of that kind conducted through Bruce Watkins Brownleigh company wouldn t send its own soul up on approval to a nice clean cut member of the British aristocracy like Sir Henry Darlington We re on the trail Jenkins we re on the trail Here s a letter from Bar LeDuc company let s see what light that sheds on the matter Holmes took a letter from an envelope and read rapidly Sir Henry Darlington care of Bruce Watkins and so forth dear Sir Henry We are having some difficulty matching the pearls they are of unusual quality but we hope to have the necklace ready for delivery as requested on Wednesday afternoon at the office of Messrs Bruce Watkins and so forth between five and six o clock Trusting the delay will not and so forth and hoping to merit a continuance of your valued favors we beg to remain and so forth and so forth That s it said Holmes It s a necklace that mister Cato is bringing up to Sir Henry Darlington and once in his possession it s Sir Henry for some place on one of these folders Why don t they send them directly here I inquired It is better for Darlington to emphasize Bruce Watkins Brownleigh company and not to bank to much on the Hotel Powhatan that s why said Holmes What s the good of having bankers like that back of you if you don t underscore their endorsement Anyhow we ve discovered the job Jenkins to day is Wednesday and the goods Cato has to deliver and referred to in his telegram is the pearl necklace of unusual quality hence not less than a fifty thousand dollars stake At this point the telephone bell rang Hello said Holmes answering immediately and in a voice entirely unlike his own Yes what Oh yes Ask him to come up He hung up the receiver put a cigar in his mouth lit it and turned to me It s Cato just called Coming up said he I wish to Heavens I was going down I ejaculated You re a queer duck Jenkins grinned Holmes Here you are with a front seat at what promises to be one of the greatest shows on earth a real live melodrama and all you can think of is home and mother Brace up for here he is There was a knock on the door Come in said Holmes cheerily A tall cadaverous looking man opened the door and entered As his eye fell upon us he paused on the threshold I beg your pardon he said I I m afraid I m in the wrong Not at all come in and sit down said Holmes cordially That is if you are our friend and partner Cato Darlington couldn t wait Couldn t wait said Cato Nope said Holmes He was very much annoyed by the delay Cato You see he s on bigger jobs than this puny little affair of Bar LeDuc s and your failure to appear on schedule time threw him out Pearls aren t the only chips in Darlington s game my boy Well I couldn t help it said Cato Bar LeDuc s messenger didn t get down there until five minutes of six Why should that have kept you until eight said Holmes I ve got a few side jobs of my own growled Cato That s what Darlington imagined said Holmes and I don t envy you your meeting with him when he comes in He s a cyclone when he s mad and if you ve got a cellar handy I d advise you to get it ready for occupancy Where s the stuff In here said Cato tapping his chest Well observed Holmes quietly we d better make ourselves easy until the Chief returns You don t mind if I write a letter do you Go ahead said Cato Don t mind me Light up said Holmes tossing him a cigar and turning to the table where he busied himself for the next five minutes apparently in writing Cato smoked away in silence and picked up Holmes s copy of the Salmagundi Magazine which lay on the bureau and shortly became absorbed in its contents As for me I had to grip both sides of my chair to conceal my nervousness My legs fairly shook with terror The silence broken only by the scratching of Holmes s pen was becoming unendurable and I think I should have given way and screamed had not Holmes suddenly risen and walked to the telephone directly back of where Cato was sitting I must ring for stamps he said There don t seem to be any here Darlington s getting stingy in his old age Hello he called but without removing the receiver from the hook Hello send me up a dollar s worth of two cent stamps thank you Good bye Cato read on but in a moment the magazine dropped from his hand to the floor Holmes was at his side and the cold muzzle of a revolver pressed uncomfortably against his right temple That bureau cover quick Raffles cried sharply to me What are you doing gasped Cato his face turning a greenish yellow with fear Another sound from you and you re a dead one said Holmes You ll see what I m doing quickly enough Twist it into a rope Jim he added addressing me I did as I was bade with the linen cover snatching it from the bureau and a second later we had Cato gagged Now tie his hands and feet with those curtain cords Holmes went on Heavens how I hated the job but there was no drawing back now We had gone too far for that There said Holmes as we laid our victim out on the floor tied hand and foot and as powerless to speak as though he had been born deaf and dumb We ll just rifle your chest Cato and stow you away in the bath tub with a sofa cushion under your head to make you comfortable and bid you farewell not au revoir Cato but just plain farewell forever The words were hardly spoken before the deed was accomplished Tearing aside poor Cato s vest and shirt front Raffles placed himself in possession of the treasure from Bar LeDuc company after which we lay Darlington s unhappy confederate at full length in the porcelain lined tub placed a sofa cushion under his head to mitigate his sufferings locked him in and started for the elevator Great Heavens Raffles I chattered as we emerged upon the street What will be the end of this It s awful When Sir Henry returns I wish I could be there to see said he with a chuckle I guess we ll see quick enough I leave town to morrow said I Nonsense said Holmes Don t you worry I put a quietus on Sir Henry Darlington He ll leave town to night and we ll never hear from him again that is not in this matter But how I demanded far from convinced I wrote him a letter in which I said You will find your treasure in the bath tub laughed Holmes And that will drive him from New York and close his mouth forever I observed sarcastically So very likely No Jenkins not that but the address my dear boy the address I put that message in an envelope and left it on his table where he ll surely see it the first thing when he gets back to night addressed to Bob Hollister Diamond Merchant Cell No ninety nine Pentonville Prison Aha said I my doubts clearing Likewise Ho ho said Holmes It is a delicate intimation to Sir Henry Darlington that somebody is on to his little game and he ll evaporate before dawn A week later Holmes brought me a magnificent pearl scarf pin What s that I asked Your share of the swag he answered I returned the pearl necklace to Bar LeDuc company with a full statement of how it came into my possession They rewarded me with this ruby ring and that stick pin Holmes held up his right hand on the fourth finger of which glistened a brilliant blood red stone worth not less than fifteen hundred dollars I breathed a sigh of relief I wondered what you were going to do with the necklace I said So did I for three days said Holmes and then when I realized that I was a single man I decided to give it up If I d had a wife to wear a necklace well I m a little afraid the Raffles side of my nature would have won out I wonder whatever became of Darlington said I I don t know Sommers says he left town suddenly that same Wednesday night without paying his bill Holmes answered And Cato I didn t inquire but from what I know of Bob Hollister I am rather inclined to believe that Cato left the Powhatan by way of the front window or possibly out through the plumbing in some way laughed Holmes Either way would be the most comfortable under the circumstances X THE MAJOR GENERAL S PEPPERPOTS I had often wondered during the winter whether or no it would be quite the proper thing for me to take my friend Raffles Holmes into the sacred precincts of my club By some men and I am one of them the club despite the bad name that clubs in general have as being antagonistic to the home is looked upon as an institution that should be guarded almost as carefully against the intrusion of improper persons as is one s own habitat and while I should never have admitted for a moment that Raffles was an undesirable chap to have around I could not deny that in view of certain characteristics which I knew him to possess the propriety of taking him into The Heraclean was seriously open to question My doubts were set at rest however on that point one day in January last when I observed seated at one of our luncheon tables the Reverend doctor Mulligatawnny Rector of Saint Mammon in the Fields a highly esteemed member of the organization who had with him no less a person than mister E H Merryman the railway magnate whose exploits in Wall Street have done much to give to that golden highway the particular kind of perfume which it now exudes to the nostrils of people of sensitive honor Surely if doctor Mulligatawnny was within his rights in having mister Merryman present I need have no misgivings as to mine in having Raffles Holmes at the same table The predatory instinct in his nature was as a drop of water in the sea to that ocean of known acquisitiveness which has floated mister Merryman into his high place in the world of finance and as far as the moral side of the two men was considered respectively I felt tolerably confident that the Recording Angel s account books would show a larger balance on the right side to the credit of Raffles than to that of his more famous contemporary Hence it was that I decided the question in my friend s favor and a week or two later had him in at The Heraclean for luncheon The dining room was filled with the usual assortment of interesting men men who had really done something in life and who suffered from none of that selfish modesty which leads some of us to hide our light under the bushel of silence There was the Honorable Poultry Tickletoe the historian whose articles on the shoddy quality of the modern Panama hat have created such a stir throughout the hat trade mister William Darlington Ponkapog the poet whose epic on the Reign of Gold is one of the longest and some writers say the thickest in the English language James Whistleton Potts the eminent portraitist whose limnings of his patients have won him a high place among the caricaturists of the age Robert Dozyphrase the expatriated American novelist now of London whose latest volume of sketches entitled Intricacies has been equally the delight of his followers and the despair of students of the occult and what is more to the purpose of our story Major General Carrington Cox U S A retired These gentlemen with others of equal distinction whom I have not the space to name were discussing with some degree of simultaneity their own achievements in the various fields of endeavor to which their lives had been devoted They occupied the large centre table which has for many a year been the point of contact for the distinguished minds of which the membership of The Heraclean is made up the tennis net as it were over which the verbal balls of discussion have for so many years volleyed to the delight of countless listeners Raffles and I sat apart at one of the smaller tables by the window where we could hear as much of the conversation at the larger board as we wished so many members of The Heraclean are deaf that to talk loud has become quite de rigueur there and at the same time hold converse with each other in tones best suited to the confidential quality of our communications We had enjoyed the first two courses of our repast when we became aware that General Carrington Cox had succeeded in getting to the floor and as he proceeded with what he had to say I observed in spite of his efforts to conceal the fact that Raffles Holmes was rather more deeply interested in the story the General was telling than in such chance observations as I was making Hence I finished the luncheon in silence and even as did Holmes listened to the General s periods and they were as usual worth listening to It was in the early eighties said General Cox I was informally attached to the Spanish legation at Madrid The King of Spain Alphonso XII was about to be married to the highly esteemed lady who is now the Queen Mother of that very interesting youth Alphonso XIII In anticipation of the event the city was in a fever of gayety and excitement that always attends upon a royal function of that nature Madrid was crowded with visitors of all sorts some of them not as desirable as they might be and here and there in the necessary laxity of the hour one or two perhaps that were most inimical to the personal safety and general welfare of the King Alphonso like many another royal personage was given to the old Haroun Al Raschid habit of travelling about at night in a more or less impenetrable incognito much to the distaste of his ministers and to the apprehension of the police who did not view with any too much satisfaction the possibility of disaster to the royal person and the consequent blame that would rest upon their shoulders should anything of a serious nature befall To all of this however the King was oblivious and it so happened one night that in the course of his wanderings he met with the long dreaded mix up He and his two companions fell in with a party of cut throats who promptly proceeded to hold them up The companions were speedily put out of business by the attacking party and the King found himself in the midst of a very serious misadventure the least issue from which bade fair to be a thorough beating if not an attempt on his life It was at the moment when his chances of escape were not one in a million when on my way home from the Legation where I had been detained to a very late hour I came upon him struggling in the hands of four as nasty ruffians as you will find this side of the gallows One of them held him by the arms another was giving him a fairly expert imitation of how it feels to be garroted which the other two were rifling his pockets This was too much for me I was in pretty fit physical condition at that time and felt myself to be quite the equal in a good old Anglo Saxon fist fight of any dozen ordinary Castilians so I plunged into the fray heart and soul not for an instant dreaming however what was the quality of the person to whose assistance I had come My first step was to bowl over the garroter Expecting no interference in his nefarious pursuit and unwarned by his companions who were to busily engaged in their adventure of loot to observe my approach he was easy prey and the good hard whack that I gave him just under his right ear sent him flying an unconscious mass of villanous clay into the gutter The surprise of the onslaught was such that the other three jumped backward thereby releasing the King s arms so that we were now two to three which in a moment became two to two for I lost no time in knocking out my second man with as pretty a solar plexus as you ever saw There is nothing in the world more demoralizing than a good solid blow straight from the shoulder to chaps whose idea of fighting is to sneak up behind you and choke you to death or to stick a knife into the small of your back and had I been far less expert with my fists I should still have had an incalculable moral advantage over such riffraff Once the odds in the matter of numbers were even the King and I had no further difficulty in handling the others His Majesty s quarry got away by the simple act of taking to his heels and mine turning to do likewise received a salute from my right toe which if I am any judge must have driven the upper end of his spine up through the top of his head Left alone his Majesty held out his hand and thanked me profusely from my timely aid and asked my name We thereupon bade each other good night and I went on to my lodging little dreaming of the service I had rendered to the nation The following day I was astonished to receive at the Legation a communication bearing the royal seal commanding me to appear at the palace at once The summons was obeyed and upon entering the palace I was immediately ushered into the presence of the King He received me most graciously dismissing however all his attendants Colonel Cox he said after the first formal greetings were over you rendered me a great service last night I your majesty said I In what way By putting those ruffians to flight said he Ah said I Then the gentleman attacked was one of your Majesty s friends I would have it so appear said the King For a great many reasons I should prefer that it were not known that it was I You your Majesty I cried really astonished I had no idea You are discretion itself Colonel Cox laughed the King and to assure you of my appreciation of the fact I beg that you will accept a small gift which you will some day shortly receive anonymously It will not be at all commensurate to the service you have rendered me nor to the discretion which you have already so kindly observed regarding the principals involved in last night s affair but in the spirit of friendly interest and appreciation back of it it will be of a value inestimable I began to try to tell his Majesty that my government did not permit me to accept gifts of any kind from persons royal or otherwise but it was not possible to do so and twenty minutes later my audience was over and I returned to the Legation with the uncomfortable sense of having placed myself in a position where I must either violate the King s confidence to acquire the permission of Congress to accept his gift or break the laws by which all who are connected with the diplomatic service directly or indirectly are strictly governed I assure you it was not in the least degree in the hope of personal profit that I chose the latter course Ten days later a pair of massive golden pepper pots came to me and as the King had intimated would be the case there was nothing about them to show whence they had come Taken altogether they were the most exquisitely wrought specimens of the goldsmith s artistry that I had ever seen and upon their under side was inscribed in a cipher which no one unfamiliar with the affair of that midnight fracas would even have observed A R to C C Alphonso Rex to Carrington Cox being of course the significance thereof They were put away with my other belongings and two years later when my activities were transferred to London I took them away with me In London I chose to live in chambers and was soon established at No seven Park Place saint James s a more than comfortable and centrally located apartment house where I found pretty much everything in the way of convenience that a man situated as I was could reasonably ask for I had not been there more than six months however when something happened that made the ease of apartment life seem somewhat less desirable That is my rooms were broken open during my absence over night on a little canoeing trip to Henley and about everything valuable in my possession was removed including the truly regal pepper pots sent me by his Majesty the King of Spain that I had carelessly left standing upon my sideboard Until last week the General continued nor hide nor hair of any of my stolen possessions was every discovered but last Thursday night I accepted the invitation of a gentleman well known in this country as a leader of finance a veritable Captain of Industry the soul of honor and one of the most genial hosts imaginable I sat down at his table at eight o clock and will you believe me gentlemen one of the first objects to greet my eye upon the brilliantly set napery was nothing less than one of my lost pepper pots There was no mistaking it Unique in pattern it was certain of identification anyhow but what made it the more certain was the cipher A R to C C And of course you claimed it asked Dozyphrase Of course I did nothing of the sort retorted the General I trust I am not so lacking in manners I merely remarked its beauty and quaintness and massiveness and general artistry My host expressed pleasure at my appreciation of its qualities and volunteered the information that it was a little thing he had picked up in a curio shop on Regent Street London last summer He had acquired it in perfect good faith What its history had been from the time I lost it until then I am not aware but there it was and under circumstances of such a character that although it was indubitably my property a strong sense of the proprieties prevented me from regaining its possession Who was your host General asked Tickletoe The General laughed That s telling said he I don t care to go into any further details because some of you well meaning friends of mine might suggest to mister ahem ha well never mind his name that he should return the pepper pot and I know that that is what he would do if he were familiar with the facts that I have just narrated It was at about this point that the gathering broke up and after our cigars Holmes and I left the club Come up to my rooms a moment said Raffles as we emerged upon the street I want to show you something All right said I I ve nothing in particular to do this afternoon That was a rather interesting tale of the General s wasn t it I added Very said Holmes I guess it s not an uncommon experience however in these days for the well to do and well meaning to be in possession of stolen property The fact of its turning up again under the General s very nose so many years later however that is unusual The case will appear even more so before the day is over if I am right in one of my conjectures What Raffles Holmes s conjecture was was soon to be made clear In a few minutes we had reached his apartment and there unlocking a huge iron bound chest in his bedroom he produced from it capacious depths another gold pepper pot This he handed to me There s the mate he observed quietly By Jove Raffles it must be I cried for beyond all question in the woof of the design on the base of the pepper pot was the cipher A R to C C Where the dickens did you get it That was a wedding present to my mother he explained That s why I have never sold it not even when I ve been on the edge of starvation From whom do you happen to know I inquired Yes he replied I do know It was a wedding present to the daughter of Raffles by her father my grandfather Raffles himself Great Heavens I cried Then it was Raffles who well you know That London flat job Precisely said Raffles Holmes We ve caught the old gentleman red handed Well I ll be jiggered said I Doesn t it beat creation how small the world is It does indeed I wonder who the chap is who has the other Raffles observed Pretty square of the old General to keep quiet about it said I Yes said Holmes That s why I m going to restore this one I wish I could give em both back I don t think my old grandfather would have taken the stuff if he d known what a dead game sport the old General was and I sort of feel myself under an obligation to make amends You can send him the one you ve got through the express companies anonymously said I No said Holmes The General left them on his sideboard and on his sideboard he must find them If we could only find out the name of his host last Thursday I tell you look in the Sunday Gazoo supplement said I They frequently publish short paragraphs of the social doings of the week You might get a clew there Good idea said Holmes I happen to have it here too There was an article in it last Sunday giving a diagram of Howard Vandergould s new house at Nippon s Point Long Island which I meant to cut out for future reference Holmes secured the Gazoo and between us we made a pretty thorough search of its contents especially The Doings of Society columns and at last we found it as follows A small dinner of thirty was given on Thursday evening last in honor of mister and missus Wilbur Rattington of Boston by missus Rattington s brother John D Bruce of Bruce Watkins company at the latter s residence seventy four Fifth Avenue Among mister Bruce s guests were mister and missus W K Dandervelt mister and missus Elisha Scroog junior Major General Carrington Cox mister and missus Henderson Scovill and Signor Caruso Old Bruce eh laughed Holmes Sans peur et sans reproche Well that is interesting One of the few honest railroad bankers in the country a pillar of the church a leading reformer and a stolen pepper pot on his table Gee What are you going to do now I asked Write to Bruce and tell him the facts Holmes s answer was a glance Oh cream cakes he ejaculated with profane emphasis A week after the incidents just described he walked into my room with a small package under his arm There s the pair he observed unwrapping the parcel and displaying its contents two superb golden pepper pots both inscribed A R to C C Beauties aren t they They are indeed Did Bruce give it up willingly I asked He never said a word laughed Holmes Fact is he snored all the time I was there Snored said I Yes you see it was at three point thirty this morning said Holmes and I went in the back way Climbed up to the extension roof in through Bruce s bedroom window down stairs to the dining room while Bruce slept unconscious of my arrival The house next to his is vacant you know and it was easy travelling You you I began Yes that s it said he Just a plain vulgar bit of second story business and I got it There were a lot of other good things lying around he added with a gulp but well I was righting a wrong this time so I let em alone and barring this I didn t deprive old Bruce of a blooming thing not even a wink of sleep And now what I demanded It s me for Cedarhurst that s where the General lives said he I ll get there about eleven point thirty to night and as soon as all is quiet Jenkins your old pal Raffles Holmes will climb easily up to the piazza gently slide back the bolts of the French windows in the General s dining room proceed cautiously to the sideboard and replace thereon these two souvenirs of a brave act by a good old sport whence they never would have been taken had my grandfather known his man You are taking a terrible risk Raffles said I you can just as easily send the tings to the General by express anonymously Jenkins he replied that suggestion does you little credit and appeals neither to the Raffles nor to the Holmes in me Pusillanimity was a word which neither of my forebears could ever learn to use It was too long for one thing and besides that it was never needed in their business And with that he left me Well General said I to General Cox a week later at the club heard anything further about your pepper pots yet Most singular thing Jenkins said he The d d things turned up again one morning last week and where the devil they came from I can t imagine One of them however had a piece of paper in it on which was written Returned with thanks for their use and apologies for having kept them so long The General opened his wallet and handed me a slip which he took from it There it is What in thunder do you make out of it he asked It was in Raffles Holmes s hand writing Looks to me as though Bruce also had been robbed I laughed Bruce Who the devil said anything about Bruce demanded the General Why didn t you tell us he had one of em on his table said I reddening Did I frowned the General Well if I did I must be a confounded ass I thought I took particular pains not the mention Bruce s name in the matter And then he laughed I shall have to be careful when Bruce comes to dine with me not to have those pepper pots in evidence he said He might ask embarrassing questions And thus it was that Raffles Holmes atoned for at least one of the offences of his illustrious grandsire THE END End of the Project
