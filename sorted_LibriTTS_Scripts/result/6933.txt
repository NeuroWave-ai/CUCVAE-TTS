IN NORTH AMERICA A SERIES OF HISTORICAL NARRATIVES BY FRANCIS PARKMAN PART SECOND THE JESUITS IN NORTH AMERICA IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY BY FRANCIS PARKMAN PREFACE Few passages of history are more striking than those which record the efforts of the earlier French Jesuits to convert the Indians Full as they are of dramatic and philosophic interest bearing strongly on the political destinies of America and closely involved with the history of its native population it is wonderful that they have been left so long in obscurity While the infant colonies of England still clung feebly to the shores of the Atlantic events deeply ominous to their future were in progress unknown to them in the very heart of the continent It will be seen in the sequel of this volume that civil and religious liberty found strange allies in this Western World The sources of information concerning the early Jesuits of New France are very copious During a period of forty years the Superior of the Mission sent every summer long and detailed reports embodying or accompanied by the reports of his subordinates to the Provincial of the Order at Paris where they were annually published in duodecimo volumes forming the remarkable series known as the Jesuit Relations Though the productions of men of scholastic training they are simple and often crude in style as might be expected of narratives hastily written in Indian lodges or rude mission houses in the forest amid annoyances and interruptions of all kinds In respect to the value of their contents they are exceedingly unequal Modest records of marvellous adventures and sacrifices and vivid pictures of forest life alternate with prolix and monotonous details of the conversion of individual savages and the praiseworthy deportment of some exemplary neophyte With regard to the condition and character of the primitive inhabitants of North America it is impossible to exaggerate their value as an authority I should add that the closest examination has left me no doubt that these missionaries wrote in perfect good faith and that the Relations hold a high place as authentic and trustworthy historical documents They are very scarce and no complete collection of them exists in America The entire series was however republished in eighteen fifty eight by the Canadian government in three large octavo volumes Both editions the old and the new are cited in the following pages Where the reference is to the old edition it is indicated by the name of the publisher Cramoisy appended to the citation in brackets In extracts given in the notes the antiquated orthography and accentuation are preserved These form but a part of the surviving writings of the French American Jesuits Many additional reports memoirs journals and letters official and private have come down to us some of which have recently been printed while others remain in manuscript Nearly every prominent actor in the scenes to be described has left his own record of events in which he bore part in the shape of reports to his Superiors or letters to his friends I have studied and compared these authorities as well as a great mass of collateral evidence with more than usual care striving to secure the greatest possible accuracy of statement and to reproduce an image of the past with photographic clearness and truth The introductory chapter of the volume is independent of the rest but a knowledge of the facts set forth in it is essential to the full understanding of the narrative which follows In the collection of material I have received valuable aid from mister J G Shea reverend Felix Martin S J the Abbes Laverdiere and H R Casgrain doctor J C Tache and the late Jacques Viger esquire I propose to devote the next volume of this series to the discovery and occupation by the French of the Valley of the Mississippi BOSTON first May eighteen sixty seven CONTENTS INTRODUCTION NATIVE TRIBES Divisions The Algonquins The Hurons Their Houses

THE ANDASTES THE IROQUOIS SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ORGANIZATION IROQUOIS INSTITUTIONS CUSTOMS AND CHARACTER INDIAN RELIGION AND SUPERSTITIONS THE INDIAN MIND America when it became known to Europeans was as it had long been a scene of wide spread revolution North and South tribe was giving place to tribe language to language for the Indian hopelessly unchanging in respect to individual and social development was as regarded tribal relations and local haunts mutable as the wind In Canada and the northern section of the United States the elements of change were especially active The Indian population which in fifteen thirty five Cartier found at Montreal and Quebec had disappeared at the opening of the next century and another race had succeeded in language and customs widely different while in the region now forming the State of New York a power was rising to a ferocious vitality which but for the presence of Europeans would probably have subjected absorbed or exterminated every other Indian community east of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio The vast tract of wilderness from the Mississippi to the Atlantic and from the Carolinas to Hudson s Bay was divided between two great families of tribes distinguished by a radical difference of language A part of Virginia and of Pennsylvania New Jersey Southeastern New York New England New Brunswick Nova Scotia and Lower Canada were occupied so far as occupied at all by tribes speaking various Algonquin languages and dialects They extended moreover along the shores of the Upper Lakes and into the dreary Northern wastes beyond They held Wisconsin Michigan Illinois and Indiana and detached bands ranged the lonely hunting round of Kentucky The word Algonquin is here used in its broadest signification It was originally applied to a group of tribes north of the River saint Lawrence The difference of language between the original Algonquins and the Abenaquis of New England the Ojibwas of the Great Lakes or the Illinois of the West corresponded to the difference between French and Italian or Italian and Spanish Each of these languages again had its dialects like those of different provinces of France Like a great island in the midst of the Algonquins lay the country of tribes speaking the generic tongue of the Iroquois 
2911_15045_000002_000001	train-clean-100	The true Iroquois or Five Nations extended through Central New York from the Hudson to the Genesee 
none	none	Southward lay the Andastes on and near the Susquehanna westward the Eries along the southern shore of Lake Erie and the Neutral Nation along its northern shore from Niagara towards the Detroit while the towns of the Hurons lay near the lake to which they have left their name To the above general statements there was in the first half of the seventeenth century but one exception worth notice A detached branch of the Dahcotah stock the Winnebago was established south of Green Bay on Lake Michigan in the midst of Algonquins and small Dahcotah bands had also planted themselves on the eastern side of the Mississippi nearly in the same latitude There was another branch of the Iroquois in the Carolinas consisting of the Tuscaroras and kindred bands In seventeen sixteen they were joined to the Five Nations Of the Algonquin populations the densest despite a recent epidemic which had swept them off by thousands was in New England 
2911_15045_000005_000001	train-clean-100	Here were Mohicans Pequots Narragansetts Wampanoags Massachusetts Penacooks thorns in the side of the Puritan 
2911_15045_000005_000002	train-clean-100	On the whole these savages were favorable specimens of the Algonquin stock belonging to that section of it which tilled the soil and was thus in some measure spared the extremes of misery and degradation to which the wandering hunter tribes were often reduced 
2911_15045_000005_000003	train-clean-100	They owed much also to the bounty of the sea and hence they tended towards the coast which before the epidemic Champlain and Smith had seen at many points studded with wigwams and waving with harvests of maize 
2911_15045_000005_000004	train-clean-100	Fear too drove them eastward for the Iroquois pursued them with an inveterate enmity 
2911_15045_000005_000005	train-clean-100	Some paid yearly tribute to their tyrants while others were still subject to their inroads flying in terror at the sound of the Mohawk war cry 
2911_15045_000005_000006	train-clean-100	Westward the population thinned rapidly northward it soon disappeared 
2911_15045_000005_000007	train-clean-100	Northern New Hampshire the whole of Vermont and Western Massachusetts had no human tenants but the roving hunter or prowling warrior 
2911_15045_000006_000000	train-clean-100	We have said that this group of tribes was relatively very populous yet it is more than doubtful whether all of them united had union been possible could have mustered eight thousand fighting men 
2911_15045_000006_000001	train-clean-100	To speak further of them is needless for they were not within the scope of the Jesuit labors 
2911_15045_000006_000002	train-clean-100	The heresy of heresies had planted itself among them and it was for the apostle Eliot not the Jesuit to essay their conversion 
none	none	These Indians the Armouchiquois of the old French writers were in a state of chronic war with the tribes of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Champlain on his voyage of sixteen oh three heard strange accounts of them The following is literally rendered from the first narrative of that heroic but credulous explorer They are savages of shape altogether monstrous for their heads are small their bodies short and their arms thin as a skeleton as are also their thighs but their legs are stout and long and all of one size and when they are seated on their heels their knees rise more than half a foot above their heads which seems a thing strange and against Nature Nevertheless they are active and bold and they have the best country on all the coast towards Acadia Des Sauvages f eighty four This story may match that of the great city of Norembega on the Penobscot with its population of dwarfs as related by Jean Alphonse 
2911_15045_000010_000000	train-clean-100	Landing at Boston three years before a solitude let the traveller push northward pass the River Piscataqua and the Penacooks and cross the River Saco 
2911_15045_000010_000001	train-clean-100	Here a change of dialect would indicate a different tribe or group of tribes 
none	none	These were the Abenaquis found chiefly along the course of the Kennebec and other rivers on whose banks they raised their rude harvests and whose streams they ascended to hunt the moose and bear in the forest desert of Northern Maine or descended to fish in the neighboring sea The Tarratines of New England writers were the Abenaquis or a portion of them 
2911_15045_000012_000000	train-clean-100	Crossing the Penobscot one found a visible descent in the scale of humanity 
none	none	Eastern Maine and the whole of New Brunswick were occupied by a race called Etchemins to whom agriculture was unknown though the sea prolific of fish lobsters and seals greatly lightened their miseries The Souriquois or Micmacs of Nova Scotia closely resembled them in habits and condition 
2911_15045_000012_000002	train-clean-100	From Nova Scotia to the saint Lawrence there was no population worthy of the name 
2911_15045_000012_000003	train-clean-100	From the Gulf of saint Lawrence to Lake Ontario the southern border of the great river had no tenants but hunters 
none	none	Northward between the saint Lawrence and Hudson s Bay roamed the scattered hordes of the Papinachois Bersiamites and others included by the French under the general name of Montagnais When in spring the French trading ships arrived and anchored in the port of Tadoussac they gathered from far and near toiling painfully through the desolation of forests mustering by hundreds at the point of traffic and setting up their bark wigwams along the strand of that wild harbor They were of the lowest Algonquin type Their ordinary sustenance was derived from the chase though often goaded by deadly famine they would subsist on roots the bark and buds of trees or the foulest offal and in extremity even cannibalism was not rare among them 
2911_15045_000013_000000	train-clean-100	Ascending the saint Lawrence it was seldom that the sight of a human form gave relief to the loneliness until at Quebec the roar of Champlain s cannon from the verge of the cliff announced that the savage prologue of the American drama was drawing to a close and that the civilization of Europe was advancing on the scene 
none	none	Ascending farther all was solitude except at Three Rivers a noted place of trade where a few Algonquins of the tribe called Atticamegues might possibly be seen 
2911_15045_000013_000002	train-clean-100	The fear of the Iroquois was everywhere and as the voyager passed some wooded point or thicket covered island the whistling of a stone headed arrow proclaimed perhaps the presence of these fierce marauders 
none	none	At Montreal there was no human life save during a brief space in early summer when the shore swarmed with savages who had come to the yearly trade from the great communities of the interior To day there were dances songs and feastings to morrow all again was solitude and the Ottawa was covered with the canoes of the returning warriors Along this stream a main route of traffic the silence of the wilderness was broken only by the splash of the passing paddle To the north of the river there was indeed a small Algonquin band called La Petite Nation together with one or two other feeble communities but they dwelt far from the banks through fear of the ubiquitous Iroquois It was nearly three hundred miles by the windings of the stream before one reached that Algonquin tribe La Nation de l Isle who occupied the great island of the Allumettes Then after many a day of lonely travel the voyager found a savage welcome among the Nipissings on the lake which bears their name and then circling west and south for a hundred and fifty miles of solitude he reached for the first time a people speaking a dialect of the Iroquois tongue 
2911_15045_000014_000004	train-clean-100	Here all was changed 
2911_15045_000014_000005	train-clean-100	Populous towns rude fortifications and an extensive though barbarous tillage indicated a people far in advance of the famished wanderers of the Saguenay or their less abject kindred of New England 
none	none	These were the Hurons of whom the modern Wyandots are a remnant Both in themselves and as a type of their generic stock they demand more than a passing notice The usual confusion of Indian tribal names prevails in the case of the Hurons The following are their synonymes Hurons of French origin Ochateguins Champlain Attigouantans the name of one of their tribes used by Champlain for the whole nation Ouendat their true name according to Lalemant Yendat Wyandot Guyandot corruptions of the preceding Ouaouakecinatouek Potier Quatogies Colden THE HURONS More than two centuries have elapsed since the Hurons vanished from their ancient seats and the settlers of this rude solitude stand perplexed and wondering over the relics of a lost people In the damp shadow of what seems a virgin forest the axe and plough bring strange secrets to light huge pits close packed with skeletons and disjointed bones mixed with weapons 
4701-15046-0000	train-other-500	copper kettles beads and trinkets Not even the straggling Algonquins who linger about the scene of Huron prosperity can tell their origin Yet on ancient worm eaten pages
4701-15046-0001	train-other-500	between covers of begrimed parchment the daily life of this ruined community its firesides its festivals its funeral rites are painted with a minute and vivid fidelity
4701-15046-0002	train-other-500	The ancient country of the Hurons is now the northern and eastern portion of Simcoe County Canada West and is embraced within the peninsula formed by the Nottawassaga and Matchedash Bays of Lake Huron
4701-15046-0003	train-other-500	the River Severn and Lake Simcoe Its area was small
none	none	 its population comparatively large In the year sixteen thirty nine the Jesuits made an enumeration of all its villages dwellings and families The result showed thirty two villages and hamlets with seven hundred dwellings about four thousand families and twelve thousand adult persons or a total population of at least twenty thousand Lalemant Relation des Hurons sixteen forty eighty eight Cramoisy His words are de feux enuiron deux mille et enuiron douze mille personnes There were two families to every fire That by personnes adults only are meant cannot be doubted as the Relations abound in incidental evidence of a total population far exceeding twelve thousand A Huron family usually numbered from five to eight persons The number of the Huron towns changed from year to year Champlain and Le Caron in sixteen fifteen reckoned them at seventeen or eighteen with a population of about ten thousand meaning no doubt adults Brebeuf in sixteen thirty five found twenty villages and as he thinks thirty thousand souls Both Le Mercier and De Quen as well as Dollier de Casson and the anonymous author of the Relation of sixteen sixty state the population at from thirty to thirty five thousand Since the time of Champlain s visit various kindred tribes or fragments of tribes had been incorporated with the Hurons thus more than balancing the ravages of a pestilence which had decimated them The region whose boundaries we have given was an alternation of meadows and deep forests interlaced with footpaths leading from town to town Of these towns some were fortified but the greater number were open and defenceless They were of a construction common to all tribes of Iroquois lineage and peculiar to them 
4701-15046-0004	train-other-500	Nothing similar exists at the present day The permanent bark villages of the Dahcotah of the saint Peter s are the nearest modern approach to the Huron towns The whole Huron country
4701-15046-0005	train-other-500	abounds with evidences of having been occupied by a numerous population On a close inspection of the forest doctor Tache writes to me the greatest part of it seems to have been cleared at former periods
4701-15046-0006	train-other-500	and almost the only places bearing the character of the primitive forest are the low grounds They covered a space of from one to ten acres the dwellings clustering together with little or no pretension to order
4701-15046-0007	train-other-500	In general these singular structures were about thirty or thirty five feet in length breadth and height but many were much larger and a few were of prodigious length
4701-15046-0008	train-other-500	In some of the villages there were dwellings two hundred and forty feet long though in breadth and height they did not much exceed the others Brebeuf

4701-15046-0010	train-other-500	or five hundred and forty feet In shape they were much like an arbor overarching a garden walk Their frame was of tall and strong saplings planted in a double row to form the two sides of the house

4701-15046-0011	train-other-500	To these other poles were bound transversely
none	none	 and the whole was covered with large sheets of the bark of the oak elm spruce or white cedar 
4701-15046-0012	train-other-500	overlapping like the shingles of a roof upon which for their better security split poles were made fast with cords of linden bark At the crown of the arch along the entire length of the house
4701-15046-0013	train-other-500	an opening a foot wide was left for the admission of light and the escape of smoke At each end was a close porch of similar construction
none	none	 and here were stowed casks of bark 
4701-15046-0014	train-other-500	filled with smoked fish Indian corn and other stores not liable to injury from frost Within on both sides were wide scaffolds four feet from the floor and extending the entire length of the house
4701-15046-0015	train-other-500	like the seats of a colossal omnibus Often especially among the Iroquois the internal arrangement was different The scaffolds or platforms were raised only a foot from the earthen floor and were only twelve or thirteen feet long
none	none	 with intervening spaces 
4701-15046-0016	train-other-500	where the occupants stored their family provisions and other articles Five or six feet above was another platform often occupied by children One pair of platforms sufficed for a family
4701-15046-0017	train-other-500	and here during summer they slept pellmell in the clothes they wore by day and without pillows These were formed of thick sheets of bark supported by posts and transverse poles and covered with mats and skins
none	none	 Here in summer was the sleeping place of the inmates and the space beneath served for storage of their firewood 
4701-15046-0018	train-other-500	The fires were on the ground in a line down the middle of the house Each sufficed for two families who in winter slept closely packed around them

4701-15046-0019	train-other-500	were a great number of poles like the perches of a hen roost and here were suspended weapons clothing skins and ornaments Here too in harvest time the squaws hung the ears of unshelled corn
4701-15046-0020	train-other-500	till the rude abode through all its length seemed decked with a golden tapestry In general however its only lining was a thick coating of soot from the smoke of fires with neither draught chimney nor window
none	none	 So pungent was the smoke that it produced inflammation of the eyes attended in old age with frequent blindness Another annoyance was the fleas and a third the unbridled and unruly children Privacy there was none The house was one chamber sometimes lodging more than twenty families One of the best descriptions of the Huron and Iroquois houses is that of Sagard Voyage des Hurons one hundred eighteen See also Champlain sixteen twenty seven seventy eight Brebeuf Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty five thirty one Vanderdonck New Netherlands in N Y Hist Coll Second Ser I one hundred ninety six Lafitau Moeurs des Sauvages II ten The account given by Cartier of the houses he saw at Montreal corresponds with the above He describes them as about fifty yards long In this case there were partial partitions for the several families and a sort of loft above Many of the Iroquois and Huron houses were of similar construction the partitions being at the sides only leaving a wide passage down the middle of the house Bartram Observations on a Journey from Pennsylvania to Canada gives a description and plan of the Iroquois Council House in seventeen fifty one which was of this construction Indeed the Iroquois preserved this mode of building in all essential points down to a recent period They usually framed the sides of their houses on rows of upright posts arched with separate poles for the roof The Hurons no doubt did the same in their larger structures For a door there was a sheet of bark hung on wooden hinges or suspended by cords from above On the site of Huron towns which were destroyed by fire the size shape and arrangement of the houses can still in some instances be traced by remains in the form of charcoal as well as by the charred bones and fragments of pottery found among the ashes doctor Tache after a zealous and minute examination of the Huron country extended through five years writes to me as follows From the remains I have found I can vouch for the scrupulous correctness of our ancient writers With the aid of their indications and descriptions I have been able to detect the sites of villages in the midst of the forest and by time study in situ of archaeological monuments small as they are to understand and confirm their many interesting details of the habits and especially the funeral rites of these extraordinary tribes He who entered on a winter night beheld a strange spectacle the vista of fires lighting the smoky concave the bronzed groups encircling each cooking eating gambling or amusing themselves with idle badinage shrivelled squaws hideous with threescore years of hardship grisly old warriors scarred with Iroquois war clubs young aspirants whose honors were yet to be won damsels gay with ochre and wampum 
4701-15046-0021	train-other-500	restless children pellmell with restless dogs Now a tongue of resinous flame painted each wild feature in vivid light now the fitful gleam expired and the group vanished from sight
4701-15046-0022	train-other-500	as their nation has vanished from history The fortified towns of the Hurons were all on the side exposed to Iroquois incursions The fortifications of all this family of tribes

none	none	 by which streams of water could be poured down on fires kindled by the enemy Magazines of stones and rude ladders for mounting the rampart completed the provision for defence The forts of the Iroquois were stronger and more elaborate than those of the Hurons and to this day large districts in New York are marked with frequent remains of their ditches and embankments There is no mathematical regularity in these works In their form the builders were guided merely by the nature of the ground Frequently a precipice or river sufficed for partial defence and the line of embankment occurs only on one or two sides In one instance distinct traces of a double line of palisades are visible along the embankment See Squier Aboriginal Monuments of New York thirty eight It is probable that the palisade was planted first and the earth heaped around it Indeed this is stated by the Tuscarora Indian Cusick in his curious History of the Six Nations Iroquois Brebeuf says that as early as sixteen thirty six the Jesuits taught the Hurons to build rectangular palisaded works with bastions The Iroquois adopted the same practice at an early period omitting the ditch and embankment and it is probable that even in their primitive defences the palisades where the ground was of a nature to yield easily to their rude implements were planted simply in holes dug for the purpose Such seems to have been the Iroquois fortress attacked by Champlain in sixteen fifteen The Muscogees with other Southern tribes and occasionally the Algonquins had palisaded towns but the palisades were usually but a single row planted upright The tribes of Virginia occasionally surrounded their dwellings with a triple palisade Beverly History of Virginia one hundred forty nine Among these tribes there was no individual ownership of land but each family had for the time exclusive right to as much as it saw fit to cultivate The clearing process a most toilsome one

4701-15046-0027	train-other-500	There was little game in the Huron country and here as among the Iroquois the staple of food was Indian corn cooked without salt in a variety of forms each more odious than the last
4701-15046-0028	train-other-500	Venison was a luxury found only at feasts dog flesh was in high esteem and in some of the towns captive bears were fattened for festive occasions These tribes were far less improvident than the roving Algonquins

4701-15046-0029	train-other-500	Their main stock of corn was buried in caches or deep holes in the earth either within or without the houses In respect to the arts of life all these stationary tribes were in advance of the wandering hunters of the North
4701-15046-0030	train-other-500	The women made a species of earthen pot for cooking but these were supplanted by the copper kettles of the French traders They wove rush mats with no little skill They spun twine from hemp
4701-15046-0031	train-other-500	by the primitive process of rolling it on their thighs and of this twine they made nets They extracted oil from fish and from the seeds of the sunflower the latter apparently only for the purposes of the toilet

4701-15046-0033	train-other-500	The Iroquois in the absence of the birch were forced to use the bark of the elm which was greatly inferior both in lightness and strength Of pipes than which nothing was more important in their eyes

4701-15046-0035	train-other-500	But their most mysterious fabric was wampum This was at once their currency their ornament their pen ink and parchment and its use was by no means confined to tribes of the Iroquois stock
4701-15046-0036	train-other-500	It consisted of elongated beads white and purple made from the inner part of certain shells It is not easy to conceive how with their rude implements the Indians contrived to shape and perforate this intractable material

4701-15046-0041	train-other-500	To one or more old men of the nation was assigned the honorable but very onerous charge of keepers of the wampum in other words of the national records and it was for them to remember and interpret the meaning of the belts
4701-15046-0042	train-other-500	The figures on wampum belts were for the most part simply mnemonic So also were those carved on wooden tablets or painted on bark and skin to preserve in memory the songs of war hunting or magic
4701-15046-0043	train-other-500	Engravings of many specimens of these figured songs are given in the voluminous reports on the condition of the Indians published by Government under the editorship of mister Schoolcraft The specimens are chiefly Algonquin
4701-15046-0044	train-other-500	The Hurons had however in common with other tribes a system of rude pictures and arbitrary signs by which they could convey to each other with tolerable precision information touching the ordinary subjects of Indian interest
4701-15046-0045	train-other-500	Their dress was chiefly of skins cured with smoke after the well known Indian mode That of the women according to the Jesuits was more modest than that of our most pious ladies of France

4701-15046-0059	train-other-500	by striking it sharply upon the ground and the players betted on the black or white Sometimes a village challenged a neighboring village
none	none	 The game was played in one of the houses Strong poles were extended from side to side and on these sat or perched the company party facing party while two players struck the bowl on the ground between Bets ran high and Brebeuf relates that once in midwinter with the snow nearly three feet deep the men of his village returned from a gambling visit bereft of their leggins and barefoot yet in excellent humor Brebeuf Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty six one hundred thirteen This game is still a favorite among the Iroquois some of whom hold to the belief that they will play it after death in the realms of bliss In all their important games of chance they employed charms incantations and all the resources of their magical art to gain good luck Ludicrous as it may appear these games were often medical prescriptions and designed as a cure of the sick Their feasts and dances were of various character 
4701-15046-0060	train-other-500	social medical and mystical or religious Some of their feasts were on a scale of extravagant profusion A vain or ambitious host threw all his substance into one entertainment

4701-15046-0063	train-other-500	The kettles were slung over the fires in the midst First there was a long prelude of lugubrious singing Then the host who took no share in the feast proclaimed in a loud voice the contents of each kettle in turn

none	none	 and at times the entertainment was protracted through the day When the feast had a medical or mystic character it was indispensable that each guest should devour the whole of the portion given him however enormous Should he fail the host would be outraged the community shocked 
4701-15046-0065	train-other-500	and the spirits roused to vengeance Disaster would befall the nation
none	none	 death perhaps the individual In some cases the imagined efficacy of the feast was proportioned to the rapidity with which the viands were despatched Prizes of tobacco were offered to the most rapid feeder and the spectacle then became truly porcine This superstition was not confined to the Hurons but extended to many other tribes including probably all the Algonquins with some of which it holds in full force to this day A feaster unable to do his full part might if he could hire another to aid him otherwise he must remain in his place till the work was done These festins a manger tout were much dreaded by many of the Hurons who however were never known to decline them Invitation to a dance was no less concise than to a feast Sometimes a crier proclaimed the approaching festivity through the village The house was crowded Old men old women and children thronged the platforms 
4701-15046-0066	train-other-500	or clung to the poles which supported the sides and roof Fires were raked out and the earthen floor cleared Two chiefs sang at the top of their voices
none	none	 keeping time to their song with tortoise shell rattles one The men danced with great violence and gesticulation the women with a much more measured action The former were nearly divested of clothing in mystical dances sometimes wholly so and from a superstitious motive this was now and then the case with the women Both however were abundantly decorated with paint oil beads wampum trinkets and feathers one Sagard gives specimens of their songs In both dances and feasts there was no little variety These were sometimes combined It is impossible in brief space to indicate more than their general features In the famous war dance which was frequently danced as it still is for amusement speeches exhortations jests personal satire and repartee were commonly introduced as a part of the performance sometimes by way of patriotic stimulus sometimes for amusement The music in this case was the drum and the war song Some of the other dances were also interspersed with speeches and sharp witticisms always taken in good part though Lafitau says that he has seen the victim so pitilessly bantered that he was forced to hide his head in his blanket Religious festivals councils the entertainment of an envoy the inauguration of a chief were all occasions of festivity in which social pleasure was joined with matter of grave import and which at times gathered nearly all the nation into one great and harmonious concourse Warlike expeditions too 
4701-15046-0067	train-other-500	were always preceded by feasting

4701-15046-0069	train-other-500	Disease in his belief is the result of sorcery the agency of spirits or supernatural influences
none	none	 undefined and indefinable The Indian doctor was a conjurer and his remedies were to the last degree preposterous ridiculous or revolting The well known Indian sweating bath is the most prominent of the few means of cure based on agencies simply physical and this with all the other natural remedies was applied not by the professed doctor but by the sufferer himself or his friends The Indians had many simple applications for wounds said to have been very efficacious but the purity of their blood owing to the absence from their diet of condiments and stimulants as well as to their active habits aided the remedy In general they were remarkably exempt from disease or deformity though often seriously injured by alternations of hunger and excess The Hurons sometimes died from the effects of their festins a manger tout The Indian doctor beat shook and pinched his patient howled whooped rattled a tortoise shell at his ear to expel the evil spirit bit him till blood flowed and then displayed in triumph a small piece of wood bone or iron which he had hidden in his mouth and which he affirmed was the source of the disease now happily removed one Sometimes he prescribed a dance feast or game and the whole village bestirred themselves to fulfil the injunction to the letter They gambled away their all they gorged themselves like vultures they danced or played ball naked among the snow drifts from morning till night At a medical feast some strange or unusual act was commonly enjoined as vital to the patient s cure as for example the departing guest in place of the customary monosyllable of thanks was required to greet his host with an ugly grimace Sometimes by prescription half the village would throng into the house where the patient lay led by old women disguised with the heads and skins of bears and beating with sticks on sheets of dry bark Here the assembly danced and whooped for hours together with a din to which a civilized patient would promptly have succumbed Sometimes the doctor wrought himself into a prophetic fury raving through the length and breadth of the dwelling snatching firebrands and flinging them about him to the terror of the squaws with whom in their combustible tenements fire was a constant bugbear one The Hurons believed that the chief cause of disease and death was a monstrous serpent that lived under the earth By touching a tuft of hair a feather or a fragment of bone with a portion of his flesh or fat the sorcerer imparted power to it of entering the body of his victim and gradually killing him It was an important part of the doctor s function to extract these charms from the vitals of his patient Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty eight seventy five Among the Hurons and kindred tribes disease was frequently ascribed to some hidden wish ungratified Hence the patient was overwhelmed with gifts in the hope that in their multiplicity the desideratum might be supplied Kettles skins awls pipes wampum fish hooks weapons objects of every conceivable variety were piled before him by a host of charitable contributors and if as often happened a dream the Indian oracle had revealed to the sick man the secret of his cure his demands were never refused however extravagant idle nauseous or abominable one Hence it is no matter of wonder that sudden illness and sudden cures were frequent among the Hurons The patient reaped profit and the doctor both profit and honor one Dans le pays de nos Hurons il se faict aussi des assemblees de toutes les filles d vn bourg aupres d vne malade tant

the medical practices of the Hurons see also Champlain Brebeuf Lafitau Charlevoix and other early writers Those of the Algonquins were in some points different The doctor often consulted the spirits to learn the cause and cure of the disease by a method peculiar to that family of tribes He shut himself in a small conical lodge and the spirits here visited him manifesting their presence by a violent shaking of the whole structure This superstition will be described in another connection THE HURON IROQUOIS FAMILY And now before entering upon the very curious subject of Indian social and tribal organization it may be well briefly to observe the position and prominent distinctive features of the various communities speaking dialects of the generic tongue of the Iroquois In this remarkable family of tribes occur the fullest developments of Indian character and the most conspicuous examples of Indian intelligence If the higher traits popularly ascribed to the race are not to be found here they are to be found nowhere A palpable proof of the superiority of this stock is afforded in the size of the Iroquois and Huron brains In average internal capacity of the cranium they surpass with few and doubtful exceptions all other aborigines of North and South America not excepting the civilized races of Mexico and Peru On comparing five Iroquois heads I find that they give an average internal capacity of eighty eight cubic inches which is within two inches of the Caucasian mean Morton Crania Americana one hundred ninety five It is remarkable that the internal capacity of the skulls of the barbarous American tribes is greater than that of either the Mexicans or the Peruvians The difference in volume is chiefly confined to the occipital and basal portions in other words to the region of the animal propensities and hence it is argued the ferocious brutal and uncivilizable character of the wild tribes See J S Phillips Admeasurements of Crania of the Principal Groups of Indians in the United States In the woody valleys of the Blue Mountains south of the Nottawassaga Bay of Lake Huron and two days journey west of the frontier Huron towns lay the nine villages of the Tobacco Nation or Tionnontates Synonymes Tionnontates Etionontates Tuinontatek Dionondadies Khionontaterrhonons Petuneux or Nation du Petun Tobacco In manners as in language they closely resembled the Hurons Of old they were their enemies but were now at peace with them and about the year sixteen forty became their close confederates Indeed in the ruin which befell that hapless people the Tionnontates alone retained a tribal organization and their descendants with a trifling exception are to this day the sole inheritors of the Huron or Wyandot name Expatriated and wandering they held

original seats among the Blue Mountains they offered an example extremely rare among Indians of a tribe raising a crop for the market for they traded in tobacco largely with other tribes Their Huron

enormous profit On the Tionnontates see Le Mercier Relation sixteen thirty seven one hundred sixty three Lalemant Relation sixteen forty one sixty nine Ragueneau Relation sixteen forty eight sixty one An excellent summary of their character and history by mister Shea will be found in Hist Mag V two hundred sixty two Journeying southward five days from the Tionnontate towns the forest traveller reached the border villages of the Attiwandarons or Neutral Nation Attiwandarons Attiwendaronk Atirhagenrenrets Rhagenratka Jesuit Relations Attionidarons Sagard They and not the Eries were the Kahkwas of Seneca tradition As early as sixteen twenty six they were visited by the Franciscan friar La Roche Dallion who reports a numerous population in twenty eight towns besides many small hamlets Their country about forty leagues in extent embraced wide and fertile districts on the north shore of Lake Erie and their frontier extended eastward across the Niagara where they had three or four outlying towns Lalemant Relation des Hurons sixteen forty one seventy one The Niagara was then called the River of the Neutrals or the Onguiaahra Lalemant estimates the Neutral population in sixteen forty at twelve thousand in forty villages Their name of Neutrals was due to their neutrality in the war between the Hurons and the Iroquois proper The hostile warriors meeting in a Neutral cabin were forced to keep the peace though once in the open air the truce was at an end Yet this people were abundantly ferocious and while holding a pacific attitude betwixt their warring kindred waged deadly strife with the Mascoutins an Algonquin horde beyond Lake Michigan Indeed it was but recently that they had been at blows with seventeen Algonquin tribes Lettre du Pere La Roche Dallion eight Juillet sixteen twenty seven in Le Clerc Etablissement de la Foy I three hundred forty six They burned female prisoners a practice unknown to the Hurons Women were often burned by the Iroquois witness the case of Catherine Mercier in sixteen sixty one and many cases of Indian women mentioned by the early writers Their country was full of game and they were bold and active hunters In form and stature they surpassed even the Hurons whom they resembled in their mode of life and from whose language their own though radically similar was dialectically distinct Their licentiousness was even more open and shameless and they stood alone in the extravagance of some of their usages They kept their dead in their houses till they became insupportable then scraped the flesh from the bones and displayed them in rows along the walls there to remain till the periodical Feast of the Dead or general burial In summer the men wore no clothing whatever but were usually tattooed from head to foot with powdered charcoal The sagacious Hurons refused them a passage through their country to the French and the Neutrals apparently had not sense or reflection enough to take the easy and direct route of Lake Ontario which was probably open to them though closed against the Hurons by Iroquois enmity Thus the former made excellent profit by exchanging French goods at high rates for the valuable furs of the Neutrals The Hurons became very jealous when La Roche Dallion visited the Neutrals lest a direct trade should be opened between the latter and the French against whom they at once put in circulation a variety of slanders that they were a people who lived on snakes and venom that they were furnished with tails and that French women though having but one breast bore six children at a birth The missionary nearly lost his life in consequence the Neutrals conceiving the idea that he would infect their country with a pestilence La Roche Dallion in Le Clerc I three hundred forty six

systematized and concreted into an established polity The Iroquois was the Indian of Indians A thorough savage yet a finished and developed savage he is perhaps an example of the highest elevation which man can reach without emerging from his primitive condition of the hunter A geographical position commanding on one hand the portal of the Great Lakes and on the other the sources of the streams flowing both to the Atlantic and the Mississippi gave the ambitious and aggressive confederates advantages which they perfectly understood and by which they profited to the utmost Patient and politic as they were ferocious they were not only conquerors of their own race but the powerful allies and the dreaded foes of the French and English colonies flattered and caressed by both yet too sagacious to give themselves without reserve to either Their organization and their history evince their intrinsic superiority Even their traditionary lore amid its wild puerilities shows at times the stamp of an energy and force in striking contrast with the flimsy creations of Algonquin fancy That the Iroquois left under their institutions to work out their destiny undisturbed would ever have developed a civilization of their own I do not believe These institutions however are sufficiently characteristic and curious and we shall soon have occasion to observe them The name Iroquois is French Charlevoix

simply means people SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ORGANIZATION In Indian social organization a problem at once suggests itself In these communities comparatively populous how could spirits so fierce and in many respects so ungoverned live together in peace without law and without enforced authority Yet there were towns where savages lived together in thousands with a harmony which civilization might envy This was in good measure due to peculiarities of Indian character and habits This intractable race were in certain external respects the most pliant and complaisant of mankind The early missionaries were charmed by the docile acquiescence with which their dogmas were received but they soon discovered that their facile auditors neither believed nor understood that to which they had so promptly assented They assented from a kind of courtesy which while it vexed the priests tended greatly to keep the Indians in mutual accord That well known self control which originating in a form of pride covered the savage nature of the man with a veil opaque though thin contributed not a little to the same end Though vain arrogant boastful and vindictive the Indian bore abuse and sarcasm with an astonishing patience Though greedy and grasping he was lavish without stint and would give away his all to soothe the manes of a departed relative gain influence and applause or ingratiate himself with his neighbors In his dread of public opinion he rivalled some of his civilized successors All Indians and especially these populous and stationary tribes had their code of courtesy whose requirements were rigid and exact nor might any infringe it without the ban of public censure Indian nature inflexible and unmalleable was peculiarly under the control of custom Established usage took the place of law was in fact a sort of common law with no tribunal to expound or enforce it In these wild democracies democracies in spirit though not in form a respect for native superiority and a willingness to yield to it were always conspicuous All were prompt to aid each other in distress and a neighborly spirit was often exhibited among them When a young woman was permanently married the other women of the village supplied her with firewood for the year each contributing an armful When one or more families were without shelter the men of the village joined in building them a house In return the recipients of the favor gave a feast if they could if not their thanks were sufficient The following testimony concerning Indian charity and hospitality is from Ragueneau As often as we have seen tribes broken up towns destroyed and their people driven to flight we have seen them to the number of seven or eight hundred persons received with open arms by charitable hosts who gladly gave them aid and even distributed among them a part of the lands already planted that they might have the means of living Relation sixteen fifty twenty eight Among the Iroquois and Hurons and doubtless among the kindred tribes there were marked distinctions of noble and base prosperous and poor yet while there was food in the village the meanest and the poorest need not suffer want He had but to enter the nearest house and seat himself by the fire when without a word on either side food was placed before him by the women The Jesuit Brebeuf than whom no one knew the Hurons better is very emphatic in praise of their harmony and social spirit Speaking of one of the four nations of which the Hurons were composed he says Ils ont vne douceur et vne affabilite quasi incroyable pour des Sauuages ils ne se picquent pas aisement Ils se maintiennent dans cette si parfaite intelligence par les frequentes visites les secours qu ils se donnent mutuellement dans leurs maladies par les festins et les alliances Ils sont moins en leurs Cabanes que chez leurs amis S ils ont vn bon morceau ils en font festin a leurs amis et ne le mangent quasi iamais en leur particulier et cetera Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty six one hundred eighteen Contrary to the received opinion these Indians like others of their race when living in communities were of a very social disposition Besides their incessant dances and feasts great and small they were continually visiting spending most of their time in their neighbors houses chatting joking bantering one another with witticisms sharp broad and in no sense delicate yet always taken in good part Every village had its adepts in these wordy tournaments while the shrill laugh of young squaws untaught to blush echoed each hardy jest or rough sarcasm In the organization of the savage communities of the continent one feature more or less conspicuous continually appears Each nation or tribe to adopt the names by which these communities are usually known is subdivided into several clans These clans are not locally separate but are mingled throughout the nation All the members of each clan are or are assumed to be intimately joined in consanguinity Hence it is held an abomination for two persons of the same clan to intermarry and hence again it follows that every family must contain members of at least two clans Each clan has its name as the clan of the Hawk of the Wolf or of the Tortoise and each has for its emblem the figure of the beast bird reptile plant or other object from which its name is derived This emblem called totem by the Algonquins is often tattooed on the clansman s body or rudely painted over the entrance of his lodge The child belongs in most cases to the clan not of the father but of the mother In other words descent not of the totem alone but of all rank titles and possessions is through the female The son of a chief can never be a chief by hereditary title though he may become so by force of personal influence or achievement Neither can he inherit from his father so much as a tobacco pipe All possessions alike pass of right to the brothers of the chief or to the sons of his sisters since these are all sprung from a common mother This rule of descent was noticed by Champlain among the Hurons in sixteen fifteen That excellent observer refers it to an origin which is doubtless its true one The child may not be the son of his reputed father but must be the son of his mother a consideration of more than ordinary force in an Indian community Les enfans ne succedent iamais aux biens et dignitez de leurs peres doubtant comme i ay dit de leur geniteur mais bien font ils leurs successeurs et heritiers les enfans de leurs soeurs et desquels ils sont asseurez d estre yssus et sortis Champlain sixteen twenty seven ninety one Captain John Smith had observed the same several years before among the tribes of Virginia For the Crowne their heyres inherite not but the first heyres of the Sisters True Relation forty three ed Deane This system of clanship with the rule of descent usually belonging to it was of very wide prevalence Indeed it is more than probable that close observation would have detected it in every tribe east of the Mississippi while there is positive evidence of its existence in by far the greater number It is found also among the Dahcotah and other tribes west of the Mississippi and there is reason to believe it universally prevalent as far as the Rocky Mountains and even beyond them The fact that with most of these hordes there is little property worth transmission and that the most influential becomes chief with little regard to inheritance has blinded casual observers to the existence of this curious system It was found in full development among the Creeks Choctaws Cherokees and other Southern tribes including that remarkable people the Natchez who judged by their religious and political institutions seem a detached offshoot of the Toltec family It is no less conspicuous among the roving Algonquins of the extreme North where the number of totems is almost countless Everywhere it formed the foundation of the polity of all the tribes where a polity could be said to exist The Franciscans and Jesuits close students of the languages and superstitions of the Indians were by no means so zealous to analyze their organization and government In the middle of the seventeenth century the Hurons as a nation had ceased to exist and their political portraiture as handed down to us is careless and unfinished Yet some decisive features are plainly shown The Huron nation was a confederacy of four distinct contiguous nations afterwards increased to five by the addition of the Tionnontates it was divided into clans it was governed by chiefs whose office was hereditary through the female the power of these chiefs though great was wholly of a persuasive or advisory character there were two principal chiefs one for peace the other for war there were chiefs assigned to special national functions as the charge of the great Feast of the Dead the direction of trading voyages to other nations et cetera there were numerous other chiefs equal in rank but very unequal in influence since the measure of their influence depended on the measure of their personal ability each nation of the confederacy had a separate organization but at certain periods grand councils of the united nations were held at which were present not chiefs only but also a great concourse of the people and at these and other councils the chiefs and principal men voted on proposed measures by means of small sticks or reeds the opinion of the plurality ruling These facts are gathered here and there from Champlain Sagard Bressani and the Jesuit Relations prior to sixteen fifty Of the Jesuits Brebeuf is the most full and satisfactory Lafitau and Charlevoix knew the Huron institutions only through others The names of the four confederate Huron nations were the Ataronchronons Attignenonghac Attignaouentans and Ahrendarrhonons There was also a subordinate nation called Tohotaenrat which had but one town See the map of the Huron Country They all bore the name of some animal or other object thus the Attignaouentans were the Nation of the Bear As the clans are usually named after animals this makes confusion and may easily lead to error The Bear Nation was the principal member of the league THE IROQUOIS The Iroquois were a people far more conspicuous in history and their institutions are not yet extinct In early and recent times they have been closely studied and no little light has been cast upon a subject as difficult and obscure as it is curious By comparing the statements of observers old and new the character of their singular organization becomes sufficiently clear Among modern students of Iroquois institutions a place far in advance of all others is due to Lewis H Morgan himself an Iroquois by adoption and intimate with the race from boyhood His work The League of the Iroquois is a production of most thorough and able research conducted under peculiar advantages and with the aid of an efficient company laborer Hasanoanda Ely S Parker an educated and highly intelligent Iroquois of the Seneca nation Though often differing widely from mister Morgan s conclusions I cannot bear a too emphatic testimony to the value of his researches The Notes on the Iroquois of mister H R Schoolcraft also contain some interesting facts but here as in all mister Schoolcraft s productions the reader must scrupulously reserve his right of private judgment None of the old writers are so satisfactory as Lafitau His work Moeurs des Sauvages Ameriquains comparees aux Moeurs des Premiers Temps relates chiefly to the Iroquois and Hurons the basis for his account of the former being his own observations and those of Father Julien Garnier who was a missionary among them more than sixty years from his novitiate to his death Both reason and tradition point to the conclusion that the Iroquois formed originally one undivided people Sundered like countless other tribes by dissension caprice or the necessities of the hunter life they separated into five distinct nations cantoned from east to west along the centre of New York in the following order Mohawks Oneidas Onondagas Cayugas Senecas There was discord among them wars followed and they lived in mutual fear each ensconced in its palisaded villages At length says tradition a celestial being incarnate on earth counselled them to compose their strife and unite in a league of defence and aggression Another personage wholly mortal yet wonderfully endowed a renowned warrior and a mighty magician stands with his hair of writhing snakes grotesquely conspicuous through the dim light of tradition at this birth of Iroquois nationality This was Atotarho a chief of the Onondagas and from this honored source has sprung a long line of chieftains heirs not to the blood alone but to the name of their great predecessor A few years since there lived in Onondaga Hollow a handsome Indian boy on whom the dwindled remnant of the nation looked with pride as their destined Atotarho With earthly and celestial aid the league was consummated and through all the land the forests trembled at the name of the Iroquois The Iroquois people was divided into eight clans When the original stock was sundered into five parts each of these clans was also sundered into five parts and as by the principle already indicated the clans were intimately mingled in every village hamlet and cabin each one of the five nations had its portion of each of the eight clans one When the league was formed these separate portions readily resumed their ancient tie of fraternity Thus of the Turtle clan all the members became brothers again nominal members of one family whether Mohawks Oneidas Onondagas Cayugas or Senecas and so too of the remaining clans All the Iroquois irrespective of nationality were therefore divided into eight families each tracing its descent to a common mother and each designated by its distinctive emblem or totem This connection of clan or family was exceedingly strong and by it the five nations of the league were linked together as by an eightfold chain one With a view to clearness the above statement is made categorical It requires however to be qualified It is not quite certain that at the formation of the confederacy there were eight clans though there is positive proof of the existence of seven Neither is it certain that at the separation every clan was represented in every nation Among the Mohawks and Oneidas there is no positive proof of the existence of more than three clans the Wolf Bear and Tortoise though there is presumptive evidence of the existence of several others See Morgan eighty one note The eight clans of the Iroquois were as follows Wolf Bear Beaver Tortoise Deer Snipe Heron Hawk Morgan seventy nine The clans of the Snipe and the Heron are the same designated in an early French document as La famille du Petit Pluvier and La famille du Grand Pluvier New York Colonial Documents IX forty seven The anonymous author of this document adds a ninth clan that of the Potato meaning the wild Indian potato Glycine apios This clan if it existed was very inconspicuous and of little importance Remarkable analogies exist between Iroquois clanship and that of other tribes The eight clans of the Iroquois were separated into two divisions four in each Originally marriage was interdicted between all the members of the same division but in time the interdict was limited to the members of the individual clans Another tribe the Choctaws remote from the Iroquois and radically different in language had also eight clans similarly divided with a similar interdict of marriage Gallatin Synopsis one hundred nine The Creeks according to the account given by their old chief Sekopechi to mister D W Eakins were divided into nine clans named in most cases from animals clanship being transmitted as usual through the female The clans were by no means equal in numbers influence or honor So marked were the distinctions among them that some of the early writers recognize only the three most conspicuous those of the Tortoise the Bear and the Wolf To some of the clans in each nation belonged the right of giving a chief to the nation and to the league Others had the right of giving three or in one case four chiefs while others could give none As Indian clanship was but an extension of the family relation these chiefs were in a certain sense hereditary but the law of inheritance though binding was extremely elastic and capable of stretching to the farthest limits of the clan The chief was almost invariably succeeded by a near relative always through the female as a brother by the same mother or a nephew by the sister s side But if these were manifestly unfit they were passed over and a chief was chosen at a council of the clan from among remoter kindred In these cases the successor is said to have been nominated by the matron of the late chief s household Lafitau I four hundred seventy one Be this as it may the choice was never adverse to the popular inclination The new chief was raised up or installed by a formal council of the sachems of the league and on entering upon his office he dropped his own name and assumed that which since the formation of the league had belonged to this especial chieftainship The number of these principal chiefs or as they have been called by way of distinction sachems varied in the several nations from eight to fourteen The sachems of the five nations fifty in all assembled in council formed the government of the confederacy All met as equals but a peculiar dignity was ever attached to the Atotarho of the Onondagas There was a class of subordinate chiefs in no sense hereditary but rising to office by address ability or valor Yet the rank was clearly defined and the new chief installed at a formal council This class embodied as might be supposed the best talent of the nation and the most prominent warriors and orators of the Iroquois have belonged to it In its character and functions however it was purely civil Like the sachems these chiefs held their councils and exercised an influence proportionate to their number and abilities There was another council between which and that of the subordinate chiefs the line of demarcation seems not to have been very definite The Jesuit Lafitau calls it the senate Familiar with the Iroquois at the height of their prosperity he describes it as the central and controlling power so far at least as the separate nations were concerned In its character it was essentially popular but popular in the best sense and one which can find its application only in a small community Any man took part in it whose age and experience qualified him to do so It was merely the gathered wisdom of the nation Lafitau compares it to the Roman Senate in the early and rude age of the Republic and affirms that it loses nothing by the comparison He thus describes it It is a greasy assemblage sitting sur leur derriere crouched like apes their knees as high as their ears or lying some on their bellies some on their backs each with a pipe in his mouth discussing affairs of state with as much coolness and gravity as the Spanish Junta or the Grand Council of Venice Lafitau I four hundred seventy eight The young warriors had also their councils so too had the women and the opinions and wishes of each were represented by means of deputies before the senate or council of the old men as well as before the grand confederate council of the sachems The government of this unique republic resided wholly in councils By councils all questions were settled all regulations established social political military and religious The war path the chase the council fire in these was the life of the Iroquois and it is hard to say to which of the three he was most devoted The great council of the fifty sachems formed as we have seen the government of the league Whenever a subject arose before any of the nations of importance enough to demand its assembling the sachems of that nation might summon their colleagues by means of runners bearing messages and belts of wampum The usual place of meeting was the valley of Onondaga the political as well as geographical centre of the confederacy Thither if the matter were one of deep and general interest not the sachems alone but the greater part of the population gathered from east and west swarming in the hospitable lodges of the town or bivouacked by thousands in the surrounding fields and forests While the sachems deliberated in the council house the chiefs and old men the warriors and often the women were holding their respective councils apart and their opinions laid by their deputies before the council of sachems were never without influence on its decisions The utmost order and deliberation reigned in the council with rigorous adherence to the Indian notions of parliamentary propriety The conference opened with an address to the spirits or the chief of all the spirits There was no heat in debate No speaker interrupted another Each gave his opinion in turn supporting it with what reason or rhetoric he could command but not until he had stated the subject of discussion in full to prove that he understood it repeating also the arguments pro and con of previous speakers Thus their debates were excessively prolix and the consumption of tobacco was immoderate The result however was a thorough sifting of the matter in hand while the practised astuteness of these savage politicians was a marvel to their civilized contemporaries It is by a most subtle policy says Lafitau that they have taken the ascendant over the other nations divided and overcome the most warlike made themselves a terror to the most remote and now hold a peaceful neutrality between the French and English courted and feared by both Lafitau I four hundred eighty Many other French writers speak to the same effect The following are the words of the soldier historian La Potherie after describing the organization of the league C est donc la cette politique qui les unit si bien a peu pres comme tous les ressorts d une horloge qui par une liaison admirable de toutes les parties qui les composent contribuent toutes unanimement au merveilleux effet qui en resulte Hist de l Amerique Septentrionale III thirty two He adds Les Francois ont avoue eux memes qu ils etoient nez pour la guerre quelques maux qu ils nous ayent faits nous les avons toujours estimez Ibid two La Potherie s book was published in seventeen twenty two Unlike the Hurons they required an entire unanimity in their decisions The ease and frequency with which a requisition seemingly so difficult was fulfilled afford a striking illustration of Indian nature on one side so stubborn tenacious and impracticable on the other so pliant and acquiescent An explanation of this harmony is to be found also in an intense spirit of nationality for never since the days of Sparta were individual life and national life more completely fused into one The sachems of the league were likewise as we have seen sachems of their respective nations yet they rarely spoke in the councils of the subordinate chiefs and old men except to present subjects of discussion Lafitau I four hundred seventy nine Their influence in these councils was however great and even paramount for they commonly succeeded in securing to their interest some of the most dexterous and influential of the conclave through whom while they themselves remained in the background they managed the debates The following from Lafitau is very characteristic Ce que je dis de leur zele pour le bien public n est cependant pas si universel que plusieurs ne pensent a leur interets particuliers que les Chefs sachems principalement ne fassent jouer plusieurs ressorts secrets pour venir a bout de leurs intrigues Il y en a tel dont l adresse joue si bien a coup sur qu il fait deliberer le Conseil plusieurs jours de suite sur une matiere dont la determination est arretee entre lui les principales tetes avant d avoir ete mise sur le tapis Cependant comme les Chefs s entre regardent qu aucun ne veut paroitre se donner une superiorite qui puisse piquer la jalousie ils se menagent dans les Conseils plus que les autres quoiqu ils en soient l ame leur politique les oblige a y parler peu a ecouter plutot le sentiment d autrui qu a y dire le leur mais chacun a un homme a sa main qui est comme une espece de Brulot qui etant sans consequence pour sa personne hazarde en pleine liberte tout ce qu il juge a propos selon qu il l a concerte avec le Chef meme pour qui il agit Moeurs des Sauvages I four hundred eighty one There was a class of men among the Iroquois always put forward on public occasions to speak the mind of the nation or defend its interests Nearly all of them were of the number of the subordinate chiefs Nature and training had fitted them for public speaking and they were deeply versed in the history and traditions of the league They were in fact professed orators high in honor and influence among the people To a huge stock of conventional metaphors the use of which required nothing but practice they often added an astute intellect an astonishing memory and an eloquence which deserved the name In one particular the training of these savage politicians was never surpassed They had no art of writing to record events or preserve the stipulations of treaties Memory therefore was tasked to the utmost and developed to an extraordinary degree They had various devices for aiding it such as bundles of sticks and that system of signs emblems and rude pictures which they shared with other tribes Their famous wampum belts were so many mnemonic signs each standing for some act speech treaty or clause of a treaty These represented the public archives and were divided among various custodians each charged with the memory and interpretation of those assigned to him The meaning of the belts was from time to time expounded in their councils In conferences with them nothing more astonished the French Dutch and English officials than the precision with which before replying to their addresses the Indian orators repeated them point by point It was only in rare cases that crime among the Iroquois or Hurons was punished by public authority Murder the most heinous offence except witchcraft recognized among them was rare If the slayer and the slain were of the same household or clan the affair was regarded as a family quarrel to be settled by the immediate kin on both sides This under the pressure of public opinion was commonly effected without bloodshed by presents given in atonement But if the murderer and his victim were of different clans or different nations still more if the slain was a foreigner the whole community became interested to prevent the discord or the war which might arise All directed their efforts not to bring the murderer to punishment but to satisfy the injured parties by a vicarious atonement Lalemant while inveighing against a practice which made the public and not the criminal answerable for an offence admits that heinous crimes were more rare than in France where the guilty party himself was punished Lettre au P Provincial fifteen May sixteen forty five To this end contributions were made and presents collected Their number and value were determined by established usage Among the Hurons thirty presents of very considerable value were the price of a man s life That of a woman s was fixed at forty by reason of her weakness and because on her depended the continuance and increase of the population This was when the slain belonged to the nation If of a foreign tribe his death demanded a higher compensation since it involved the danger of war Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty eight eighty These presents were offered in solemn council with prescribed formalities The relatives of the slain might refuse them if they chose and in this case the murderer was given them as a slave but they might by no means kill him since in so doing they would incur public censure and be compelled in their turn to make atonement Besides the principal gifts there was a great number of less value all symbolical and each delivered with a set form of words as By this we wash out the blood of the slain By this we cleanse his wound By this we clothe his corpse with a new shirt By this we place food on his grave and so in endless prolixity through particulars without number Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty eight gives a description of one of these ceremonies at length Those of the Iroquois on such occasions were similar Many other tribes had the same custom but attended with much less form and ceremony Compare Perrot seventy three seventy six The Hurons were notorious thieves and perhaps the Iroquois were not much better though the contrary has been asserted Among both the robbed was permitted not only to retake his property by force if he could but to strip the robber of all he had This apparently acted as a restraint in favor only of the strong leaving the weak a prey to the plunderer but here the tie of family and clan intervened to aid him Relatives and clansmen espoused the quarrel of him who could not right himself The proceedings for detecting thieves were regular and methodical after established customs According to Bressani no thief ever inculpated the innocent Witches with whom the Hurons and Iroquois were grievously infested were objects of utter abomination to both and any one might kill them at any time If any person was guilty of treason or by his character and conduct made himself dangerous or obnoxious to the public the council of chiefs and old men held a secret session on his case condemned him to death and appointed some young man to kill him The executioner watching his opportunity brained or stabbed him unawares usually in the dark porch of one of the houses Acting by authority he could not be held answerable and the relatives of the slain had no redress even if they desired it The council however commonly obviated all difficulty in advance by charging the culprit with witchcraft thus alienating his best friends The military organization of the Iroquois was exceedingly imperfect and derived all its efficiency from their civil union and their personal prowess There were two hereditary war chiefs both belonging to the Senecas but except on occasions of unusual importance it does not appear that they took a very active part in the conduct of wars The Iroquois lived in a state of chronic warfare with nearly all the surrounding tribes except a few from whom they exacted tribute Any man of sufficient personal credit might raise a war party when he chose He proclaimed his purpose through the village sang his war songs struck his hatchet into the war post and danced the war dance Any who chose joined him and the party usually took up their march at once with a little parched corn meal and maple sugar as their sole provision On great occasions there was concert of action the various parties meeting at a rendezvous and pursuing the march together The leaders of war parties like the orators belonged in nearly all cases to the class of subordinate chiefs The Iroquois had a discipline suited to the dark and tangled forests where they fought Here they were a terrible foe in an open country against a trained European force they were despite their ferocious valor far less formidable In observing this singular organization one is struck by the incongruity of its spirit and its form A body of hereditary oligarchs was the head of the nation yet the nation was essentially democratic Not that the Iroquois were levellers None were more prompt to acknowledge superiority and defer to it whether established by usage and prescription or the result of personal endowment Yet each man whether of high or low degree had a voice in the conduct of affairs and was never for a moment divorced from his wild spirit of independence Where there was no property worthy the name authority had no fulcrum and no hold The constant aim of sachems and chiefs was to exercise it without seeming to do so They had no insignia of office They were no richer than others indeed they were often poorer spending their substance in largesses and bribes to strengthen their influence They hunted and fished for subsistence they were as foul greasy and unsavory as the rest yet in them withal was often seen a native dignity of bearing which ochre and bear s grease could not hide and which comported well with their strong symmetrical and sometimes majestic proportions To the institutions traditions rites usages and festivals of the league the Iroquois was inseparably wedded He clung to them with Indian tenacity and he clings to them still His political fabric was one of ancient ideas and practices crystallized into regular and enduring forms In its component parts it has nothing peculiar to itself All its elements are found in other tribes most of them belong to the whole Indian race Undoubtedly there was a distinct and definite effort of legislation but Iroquois legislation invented nothing Like all sound legislation it built of materials already prepared It organized the chaotic past and gave concrete forms to Indian nature itself The people have dwindled and decayed but banded by its ties of clan and kin the league in feeble miniature still subsists and the degenerate Iroquois looks back with a mournful pride to the glory of the past Would the Iroquois left undisturbed to work out their own destiny ever have emerged from the savage state Advanced as they were beyond most other American tribes there is no indication whatever of a tendency to overpass the confines of a wild hunter and warrior life They were inveterately attached to it impracticable conservatists of barbarism and in ferocity and cruelty they matched the worst of their race Nor did the power of expansion apparently belonging to their system ever produce much result Between the years seventeen twelve and seventeen fifteen the Tuscaroras a kindred people were admitted into the league as a sixth nation but they were never admitted on equal terms Long after in the period of their decline several other tribes were announced as new members of the league but these admissions never took effect The Iroquois were always reluctant to receive other tribes or parts of tribes collectively into the precincts of the Long House Yet they constantly practised a system of adoptions from which though cruel and savage they drew great advantages Their prisoners of war when they had burned and butchered as many of them as would serve to sate their own ire and that of their women were divided man by man woman by woman and child by child adopted into different families and clans and thus incorporated into the nation It was by this means and this alone that they could offset the losses of their incessant wars Early in the eighteenth century and ever long before a vast proportion of their population consisted of adopted prisoners Relation sixteen sixty seven anonymous The Iroquois were at the height of their prosperity about the year sixteen fifty Morgan reckons their number at this time at twenty five thousand souls but this is far too high an estimate The author of the Relation of sixteen sixty makes their whole number of warriors twenty two hundred Le Mercier in the Relation of sixteen sixty five says twenty three fifty In the Journal of Greenhalgh an Englishman who visited them in sixteen seventy seven their warriors are set down at twenty one fifty Du Chesneau in sixteen eighty one estimates them at two thousand De la Barre in sixteen eighty four at twenty six hundred they having been strengthened by adoptions A memoir addressed to the Marquis de Seignelay in sixteen eighty seven again makes them two thousand See N Y colonel Docs IX one hundred sixty two one hundred ninety six three hundred twenty one These estimates imply a total population of ten or twelve thousand The anonymous writer of the Relation of sixteen sixty may well remark It is marvellous that so few should make so great a havoc and strike such terror into so many tribes It remains to speak of the religious and superstitious ideas which so deeply influenced Indian life RELIGION AND SUPERSTITIONS The religious belief of the North American Indians seems on a first view anomalous and contradictory It certainly is so if we adopt the popular impression Romance Poetry and Rhetoric point on the one hand to the august conception of a one all ruling Deity a Great Spirit omniscient and omnipresent and we are called to admire the untutored intellect which could conceive a thought too vast for Socrates and Plato On the other hand we find a chaos of degrading ridiculous and incoherent superstitions A closer examination will show that the contradiction is more apparent than real We will begin with the lowest forms of Indian belief and thence trace it upward to the highest conceptions to which the unassisted mind of the savage attained To the Indian the material world is sentient and intelligent Birds beasts and reptiles have ears for human prayers and are endowed with an influence on human destiny A mysterious and inexplicable power resides in inanimate things They too can listen to the voice of man and influence his life for evil or for good Lakes rivers and waterfalls are sometimes the dwelling place of spirits but more frequently they are themselves living beings to be propitiated by prayers and offerings The lake has a soul and so has the river and the cataract Each can hear the words of men and each can be pleased or offended In the silence of a forest the gloom of a deep ravine resides a living mystery indefinite but redoubtable Through all the works of Nature or of man nothing exists however seemingly trivial that may not be endowed with a secret power for blessing or for bane Men and animals are closely akin Each species of animal has its great archetype its progenitor or king who is supposed to exist somewhere prodigious in size though in shape and nature like his subjects A belief prevails vague but perfectly apparent that men themselves owe their first parentage to beasts birds or reptiles as bears wolves tortoises or cranes and the names of the totemic clans borrowed in nearly every case from animals are the reflection of this idea This belief occasionally takes a perfectly definite shape There was a tradition among Northern and Western tribes that men were created from the carcasses of beasts birds and fishes by Manabozho a mythical personage to be described hereafter The Amikouas or People of the Beaver an Algonquin tribe of Lake Huron claimed descent from the carcass of the great original beaver or father of the beavers They believed that the rapids and cataracts on the French River and the Upper Ottawa were caused by dams made by their amphibious ancestor See the tradition in Perrot Memoire sur les Moeurs Coustumes et Relligion des Sauvages de l Amerique Septentrionale p twenty Charlevoix tells the same story Each Indian was supposed to inherit something of the nature of the animal whence he sprung An Indian hunter was always anxious to propitiate the animals he sought to kill He has often been known to address a wounded bear in a long harangue of apology McKinney Tour to the Lakes two hundred eighty four mentions the discomposure of a party of Indians when shown a stuffed moose Thinking that its spirit would be offended at the indignity shown to its remains they surrounded it making apologetic speeches and blowing tobacco smoke at it as a propitiatory offering The bones of the beaver were treated with especial tenderness and carefully kept from the dogs lest the spirit of the dead beaver or his surviving brethren should take offence This superstition was very prevalent and numerous examples of it occur in old and recent writers from Father Le Jeune to Captain Carver This solicitude was not confined to animals but extended to inanimate things A remarkable example occurred among the Hurons a people comparatively advanced who to propitiate their fishing nets and persuade them to do their office with effect married them every year to two young girls of the tribe with a ceremony more formal than that observed in the case of mere human wedlock one The fish too no less than the nets must be propitiated and to this end they were addressed every evening from the fishing camp by one of the party chosen for that function who exhorted them to take courage and be caught assuring them that the utmost respect should be shown to their bones The harangue which took place after the evening meal was made in solemn form and while it lasted the whole party except the speaker were required to lie on their backs silent and motionless around the fire two one There are frequent allusions to this ceremony in the early writers The Algonquins of the Ottawa practised it as well as the Hurons Lalemant in his chapter Du Regne de Satan en ces Contrees Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty nine says that it took place yearly in the middle of March As it was indispensable that the brides should be virgins mere children were chosen The net was held between them and its spirit or oki was harangued by one of the chiefs who exhorted him to do his part in furnishing the tribe with food Lalemant was told that the spirit of the net had once appeared in human form to the Algonquins complaining that he had lost his wife and warning them that unless they could find him another equally immaculate they would catch no more fish two Sagard Le Grand Voyage du Pays des Hurons two hundred fifty seven Other old writers make a similar statement Besides ascribing life and intelligence to the material world animate and inanimate the Indian believes in supernatural existences known among the Algonquins as Manitous and among the Iroquois and Hurons as Okies or Otkons These words comprehend all forms of supernatural being from the highest to the lowest with the exception possibly of certain diminutive fairies or hobgoblins and certain giants and anomalous monsters which appear under various forms grotesque and horrible in the Indian fireside legends Many tribes have tales of diminutive beings which in the absence of a better word may be called fairies In the Travels of Lewis and Clarke there is mention of a hill on the Missouri supposed to be haunted by them These Western fairies correspond to the Puck Wudj Ininee of Ojibwa tradition As an example of the monsters alluded to see the Saginaw story of the Weendigoes in Schoolcraft Algic Researches II one hundred five There are local manitous of streams rocks mountains cataracts and forests The conception of these beings betrays for the most part a striking poverty of imagination In nearly every case when they reveal themselves to mortal sight they bear the semblance of beasts reptiles or birds in shapes unusual or distorted The figure of a large bird is perhaps the most common as for example the good spirit of Rock Island He was white with wings like a swan but ten times larger Autobiography of Blackhawk seventy There are other manitous without local habitation some good some evil countless in number and indefinite in attributes They fill the world and control the destinies of men that is to say of Indians for the primitive Indian holds that the white man lives under a spiritual rule distinct from that which governs his own fate These beings also appear for the most part in the shape of animals Sometimes however they assume human proportions but more frequently they take the form of stones which being broken are found full of living blood and flesh Each primitive Indian has his guardian manitou to whom he looks for counsel guidance and protection These spiritual allies are gained by the following process At the age of fourteen or fifteen the Indian boy blackens his face retires to some solitary place and remains for days without food Superstitious expectancy and the exhaustion of abstinence rarely fail of their results His sleep is haunted by visions and the form which first or most often appears is that of his guardian manitou a beast a bird a fish a serpent or some other object animate or inanimate An eagle or a bear is the vision of a destined warrior a wolf of a successful hunter while a serpent foreshadows the future medicine man or according to others portends disaster one The young Indian thenceforth wears about his person the object revealed in his dream or some portion of it as a bone a feather a snake skin or a tuft of hair This in the modern language of the forest and prairie is known as his medicine The Indian yields to it a sort of worship propitiates it with offerings of tobacco thanks it in prosperity and upbraids it in disaster two If his medicine fails to bring the desired success he will sometimes discard it and adopt another The superstition now becomes mere fetich worship since the Indian regards the mysterious object which he carries about him rather as an embodiment than as a representative of a supernatural power one Compare Cass in North American Review Second Series XIII one hundred A turkey buzzard according to him is the vision of a medicine man I once knew an old Dahcotah chief who was greatly respected but had never been to war though belonging to a family of peculiarly warlike propensities The reason was that in his initiatory fast he had dreamed of an antelope the peace spirit of his people Women fast as well as men always at the time of transition from childhood to maturity In the Narrative of John Tanner there is an account of an old woman who had fasted in her youth for ten days and throughout her life placed the firmest faith in the visions which had appeared to her at that time Among the Northern Algonquins the practice down to a recent day was almost universal two The author has seen a Dahcotah warrior open his medicine bag talk with an air of affectionate respect to the bone feather or horn within and blow tobacco smoke upon it as an offering Medicines are acquired not only by fasting but by casual dreams and otherwise They are sometimes even bought and sold For a curious account of medicine bags and fetich worship among the Algonquins of Gaspe see Le Clerc Nouvelle Relation de la Gaspesie Chap XIII Indian belief recognizes also another and very different class of beings Besides the giants and monsters of legendary lore other conceptions may be discerned more or less distinct and of a character partly mythical Of these the most conspicuous is that remarkable personage of Algonquin tradition called Manabozho Messou Michabou Nanabush or the Great Hare As each species of animal has its archetype or king so among the Algonquins Manabozho is king of all these animal kings Tradition is diverse as to his origin According to the most current belief his father was the West Wind and his mother a great granddaughter of the Moon His character is worthy of such a parentage Sometimes he is a wolf a bird or a gigantic hare surrounded by a court of quadrupeds sometimes he appears in human shape majestic in stature and wondrous in endowment a mighty magician a destroyer of serpents and evil manitous sometimes he is a vain and treacherous imp full of childish whims and petty trickery the butt and victim of men beasts and spirits His powers of transformation are without limit his curiosity and malice are insatiable and of the numberless legends of which he is the hero the greater part are as trivial as they are incoherent one It does not appear that Manabozho was ever an object of worship yet despite his absurdity tradition declares him to be chief among the manitous in short the Great Spirit Presque toutes les Nations Algonquines ont donne le nom de Grand Lievre au Premier Esprit quelques uns l appellent Michabou Manabozho Charlevoix Journal Historique three hundred forty four It was he who restored the world submerged by a deluge He was hunting in company with a certain wolf who was his brother or by other accounts his grandson when his quadruped relative fell through the ice of a frozen lake and was at once devoured by certain serpents lurking in the depths of the waters Manabozho intent on revenge transformed himself into the stump of a tree and by this artifice surprised and slew the king of the serpents as he basked with his followers in the noontide sun The serpents who were all manitous caused in their rage the waters of the lake to deluge the earth Manabozho climbed a tree which in answer to his entreaties grew as the flood rose around it and thus saved him from the vengeance of the evil spirits Submerged to the neck he looked abroad on the waste of waters and at length descried the bird known as the loon to whom he appealed for aid in the task of restoring the world The loon dived in search of a little mud as material for reconstruction but could not reach the bottom A musk rat made the same attempt but soon reappeared floating on his back and apparently dead Manabozho however on searching his paws discovered in one of them a particle of the desired mud and of this together with the body of the loon created the world anew two one mister Schoolcraft has collected many of these tales See his Algic Researches Vol I Compare the stories of Messou given by Le Jeune Relations sixteen thirty three sixteen thirty four and the account of Nanabush by Edwin James in his notes to Tanner s Narrative of Captivity and Adventures during a Thirty Years Residence among the Indians also the account of the Great Hare in the Memoire of Nicolas Perrot Chaps I II two This is a form of the story still current among the remoter Algonquins Compare the story of Messou in Le Jeune Relation sixteen thirty three sixteen It is substantially the same There are various forms of this tradition in some of which Manabozho appears not as the restorer but as the creator of the world forming mankind from the carcasses of beasts birds and fishes one Other stories represent him as marrying a female musk rat by whom he became the progenitor of the human race two one In the beginning of all things Manabozho in the form of the Great Hare was on a raft surrounded by animals who acknowledged him as their chief No land could be seen Anxious to create the world the Great Hare persuaded the beaver to dive for mud but the adventurous diver floated to the surface senseless The otter next tried and failed like his predecessor The musk rat now offered himself for the desperate task He plunged and after remaining a day and night beneath the surface reappeared floating on his back beside the raft apparently dead and with all his paws fast closed On opening them the other animals found in one of them a grain of sand and of this the Great Hare created the world Perrot Memoire Chap I two Le Jeune Relation sixteen thirty three sixteen The musk rat is always a conspicuous figure in Algonquin cosmogony It is said that Messou or Manabozho once gave to an Indian the gift of immortality tied in a bundle enjoining him never to open it The Indian s wife however impelled by curiosity one day cut the string the precious gift flew out and Indians have ever since been subject to death Le Jeune Relation sixteen thirty four thirteen Searching for some higher conception of supernatural existence we find among a portion of the primitive Algonquins traces of a vague belief in a spirit dimly shadowed forth under the name of Atahocan to whom it does not appear that any attributes were ascribed or any worship offered and of whom the Indians professed to know nothing whatever one but there is no evidence that this belief extended beyond certain tribes of the Lower saint Lawrence Others saw a supreme manitou in the Sun two The Algonquins believed also in a malignant manitou in whom the early missionaries failed not to recognize the Devil but who was far less dreaded than his wife She wore a robe made of the hair of her victims for she was the cause of death and she it was whom by yelling drumming and stamping they sought to drive away from the sick Sometimes at night she was seen by some terrified squaw in the forest in shape like a flame of fire and when the vision was announced to the circle crouched around the lodge fire they burned a fragment of meat to appease the female fiend one Le Jeune Relation sixteen thirty three sixteen Relation sixteen thirty four thirteen two Biard Relation sixteen eleven Chap VIII This belief was very prevalent The Ottawas according to Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty eight seventy seven were accustomed to invoke the Maker of Heaven at their feasts but they recognized as distinct persons the Maker of the Earth the Maker of Winter the God of the Waters and the Seven Spirits of the Wind He says at the same time The people of these countries have received from their ancestors no knowledge of a God and he adds that there is no sentiment of religion in this invocation The East the West the North and the South were vaguely personified as spirits or manitous Some of the winds too were personal existences The West Wind as we have seen was father of Manabozho There was a Summer Maker and a Winter Maker and the Indians tried to keep the latter at bay by throwing firebrands into the air When we turn from the Algonquin family of tribes to that of the Iroquois we find another cosmogony and other conceptions of spiritual existence While the earth was as yet a waste of waters there was according to Iroquois and Huron traditions a heaven with lakes streams plains and forests inhabited by animals by spirits and as some affirm by human beings Here a certain female spirit named Ataentsic was once chasing a bear which slipping through a hole fell down to the earth Ataentsic s dog followed when she herself struck with despair jumped after them Others declare that she was kicked out of heaven by the spirit her husband for an amour with a man while others again hold the belief that she fell in the attempt to gather for her husband the medicinal leaves of a certain tree Be this as it may the animals swimming in the watery waste below saw her falling and hastily met in council to determine what should be done The case was referred to the beaver The beaver commended it to the judgment of the tortoise who thereupon called on the other animals to dive bring up mud and place it on his back Thus was formed a floating island on which Ataentsic fell and here being pregnant she was soon delivered of a daughter who in turn bore two boys whose paternity is unexplained They were called Taouscaron and Jouskeha and presently fell to blows Jouskeha killing his brother with the horn of a stag The back of the tortoise grew into a world full of verdure and life and Jouskeha with his grandmother Ataentsic ruled over its destinies The above is the version of the story given by Brebeuf Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty six eighty six Cramoisy No two Indians told it precisely alike though nearly all the Hurons and Iroquois agreed as to its essential points Compare Vanderdonck Cusick Sagard and other writers According to Vanderdonck Ataentsic became mother of a deer a bear and a wolf by whom she afterwards bore all the other animals mankind included Brebeuf found also among the Hurons a tradition inconsistent with that of Ataentsic and bearing a trace of Algonquin origin It declares that in the beginning a man a fox and a skunk found themselves together on an island and that the man made the world out of mud brought him by the skunk The Delawares an Algonquin tribe seem to have borrowed somewhat of the Iroquois cosmogony since they believed that the earth was formed on the back of a tortoise According to some Jouskeha became the father of the human race but in the third generation a deluge destroyed his posterity so that it was necessary to transform animals into men Charlevoix III three hundred forty five He is the Sun she is the Moon He is beneficent but she is malignant like the female demon of the Algonquins They have a bark house made like those of the Iroquois at the end of the earth and they often come to feasts and dances in the Indian villages Jouskeha raises corn for himself and makes plentiful harvests for mankind Sometimes he is seen thin as a skeleton with a spike of shrivelled corn in his hand or greedily gnawing a human limb and then the Indians know that a grievous famine awaits them He constantly interposes between mankind and the malice of his wicked grandmother whom at times he soundly cudgels It was he who made lakes and streams for once the earth was parched and barren all the water being gathered under the armpit of a colossal frog but Jouskeha pierced the armpit and let out the water No prayers were offered to him his benevolent nature rendering them superfluous Compare Brebeuf as before cited and Sagard Voyage des Hurons p two hundred twenty eight The early writers call Jouskeha the creator of the world and speak of him as corresponding to the vague Algonquin deity Atahocan Another deity appears in Iroquois mythology with equal claims to be regarded as supreme He is called Areskoui or Agreskoui and his most prominent attributes are those of a god of war He was often invoked and the flesh of animals and of captive enemies was burned in his honor Father Jogues saw a female prisoner burned to Areskoui and two bears offered to him to atone for the sin of not burning more captives Lettre de Jogues six Aug sixteen forty three Like Jouskeha he was identified with the sun and he is perhaps to be regarded as the same being under different attributes Among the Iroquois proper or Five Nations there was also a divinity called Tarenyowagon or Teharonhiawagon one whose place and character it is very difficult to determine In some traditions he appears as the son of Jouskeha He had a prodigious influence for it was he who spoke to men in dreams The Five Nations recognized still another superhuman personage plainly a deified chief or hero This was Taounyawatha or Hiawatha said to be a divinely appointed messenger who made his abode on earth for the political and social instruction of the chosen race and whose counterpart is to be found in the traditions of the Peruvians Mexicans and other primitive nations two one Le Mercier Relation sixteen seventy sixty six Dablon Relation sixteen seventy one seventeen Compare Cusick Megapolensis and Vanderdonck Some writers identify Tarenyowagon and Hiawatha Vanderdonck assumes that Areskoui is the Devil and Tarenyowagon is God Thus Indian notions are often interpreted by the light of preconceived ideas two For the tradition of Hiawatha see Clark History of Onondaga I twenty one It will also be found in Schoolcraft s Notes on the Iroquois and in his History Condition and Prospects of Indian Tribes The Iroquois name for God is Hawenniio sometimes written Owayneo but this use of the word is wholly due to the missionaries Hawenniio is an Iroquois verb and means he rules he is master There is no Iroquois word which in its primitive meaning can be interpreted the Great Spirit or God On this subject see Etudes Philologiques sur quelques Langues Sauvages Montreal eighteen sixty six where will also be found a curious exposure of a few of Schoolcraft s ridiculous blunders in this connection Close examination makes it evident that the primitive Indian s idea of a Supreme Being was a conception no higher than might have been expected The moment he began to contemplate this object of his faith and sought to clothe it with attributes it became finite and commonly ridiculous The Creator of the World stood on the level of a barbarous and degraded humanity while a natural tendency became apparent to look beyond him to other powers sharing his dominion The Indian belief if developed would have developed into a system of polytheism Some of the early writers could discover no trace of belief in a supreme spirit of any kind Perrot after a life spent among the Indians ignores such an idea Allouez emphatically denies that it existed among the tribes of Lake Superior Relation sixteen sixty seven eleven He adds however that the Sacs and Foxes believed in a great genie who lived not far from the French settlements Ibid twenty one In the primitive Indian s conception of a God the idea of moral good has no part His deity does not dispense justice for this world or the next but leaves mankind under the power of subordinate spirits who fill and control the universe Nor is the good and evil of these inferior beings a moral good and evil The good spirit is the spirit that gives good luck and ministers to the necessities and desires of mankind the evil spirit is simply a malicious agent of disease death and mischance In no Indian language could the early missionaries find a word to express the idea of God Manitou and Oki meant anything endowed with supernatural powers from a snake skin or a greasy Indian conjurer up to Manabozho and Jouskeha The priests were forced to use a circumlocution The Great Chief of Men or He who lives in the Sky See Divers Sentimens appended to the Relation of sixteen thirty five sec twenty seven and also many other passages of early missionaries Yet it should seem that the idea of a supreme controlling spirit might naturally arise from the peculiar character of Indian belief The idea that each race of animals has its archetype or chief would easily suggest the existence of a supreme chief of the spirits or of the human race a conception imperfectly shadowed forth in Manabozho The Jesuit missionaries seized this advantage If each sort of animal has its king they urged so too have men and as man is above all the animals so is the spirit that rules over men the master of all the other spirits The Indian mind readily accepted the idea and tribes in no sense Christian quickly rose to the belief in one controlling spirit The Great Spirit became a distinct existence a pervading power in the universe and a dispenser of justice Many tribes now pray to him though still clinging obstinately to their ancient superstitions and with some as the heathen portion of the modern Iroquois he is clothed with attributes of moral good In studying the writers of the last and of the present century it is to be remembered that their observations were made upon savages who had been for generations in contact immediate or otherwise with the doctrines of Christianity Many observers have interpreted the religious ideas of the Indians after preconceived ideas of their own and it may safely be affirmed that an Indian will respond with a grunt of acquiescence to any question whatever touching his spiritual state Loskiel and the simple minded Heckewelder write from a missionary point of view Adair to support a theory of descent from the Jews the worthy theologian Jarvis to maintain his dogma that all religious ideas of the heathen world are perversions of revelation and so in a greater or less degree of many others By far the most close and accurate observers of Indian superstition were the French and Italian Jesuits of the first half of the seventeenth century Their opportunities were unrivalled and they used them in a spirit of faithful inquiry accumulating facts and leaving theory to their successors Of recent American writers no one has given so much attention to the subject as mister Schoolcraft but in view of his opportunities and his zeal his results are most unsatisfactory The work in six large quarto volumes History Condition and Prospects of Indian Tribes published by Government under his editorship includes the substance of most of his previous writings It is a singularly crude and illiterate production stuffed with blunders and contradictions giving evidence on every page of a striking unfitness either for historical or philosophical inquiry and taxing to the utmost the patience of those who would extract what is valuable in it from its oceans of pedantic verbiage The primitive Indian believed in the immortality of the soul one but he did not always believe in a state of future reward and punishment Nor when such a belief existed was the good to be rewarded a moral good or the evil to be punished a moral evil Skilful hunters brave warriors men of influence and consideration went after death to the happy hunting ground while the slothful the cowardly and the weak were doomed to eat serpents and ashes in dreary regions of mist and darkness In the general belief however there was but one land of shades for all alike The spirits in form and feature as they had been in life wended their way through dark forests to the villages of the dead subsisting on bark and rotten wood On arriving they sat all day in the crouching posture of the sick and when night came hunted the shades of animals with the shades of bows and arrows among the shades of trees and rocks for all things animate and inanimate were alike immortal and all passed together to the gloomy country of the dead one The exceptions are exceedingly rare Father Gravier says that a Peoria Indian once told him that there was no future life It would be difficult to find another instance of the kind The belief respecting the land of souls varied greatly in different tribes and different individuals Among the Hurons there were those who held that departed spirits pursued their journey through the sky along the Milky Way while the souls of dogs took another route by certain constellations known as the Way of the Dogs Sagard Voyage des Hurons two hundred thirty three At intervals of ten or twelve years the Hurons the Neutrals and other kindred tribes were accustomed to collect the bones of their dead and deposit them with great ceremony in a common place of burial The whole nation was sometimes assembled at this solemnity and hundreds of corpses brought from their temporary resting places were inhumed in one capacious pit From this hour the immortality of their souls began They took wing as some affirmed in the shape of pigeons while the greater number declared that they journeyed on foot and in their own likeness to the land of shades bearing with them the ghosts of the wampum belts beaver skins bows arrows pipes kettles beads and rings buried with them in the common grave The practice of burying treasures with the dead is not peculiar to the North American aborigines Thus the London Times of Oct twenty five eighteen eighty five describing the funeral rites of Lord Palmerston says And as the words Dust to dust ashes to ashes were pronounced the chief mourner as a last precious offering to the dead threw into the grave several diamond and gold rings But as the spirits of the old and of children are too feeble for the march they are forced to stay behind lingering near their earthly villages where the living often hear the shutting of their invisible cabin doors and the weak voices of the disembodied children driving birds from their corn fields Brebeuf Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty six ninety nine Cramoisy An endless variety of incoherent fancies is connected with the Indian idea of a future life They commonly owe their origin to dreams often to the dreams of those in extreme sickness who on awaking supposed that they had visited the other world and related to the wondering bystanders what they had seen The Indian land of souls is not always a region of shadows and gloom The Hurons sometimes represented the souls of their dead those of their dogs included as dancing joyously in the presence of Ataentsic and Jouskeha According to some Algonquin traditions heaven was a scene of endless festivity the ghosts dancing to the sound of the rattle and the drum and greeting with hospitable welcome the occasional visitor from the living world for the spirit land was not far off and roving hunters sometimes passed its confines unawares Most of the traditions agree however that the spirits on their journey heavenward were beset with difficulties and perils There was a swift river which must be crossed on a log that shook beneath their feet while a ferocious dog opposed their passage and drove many into the abyss This river was full of sturgeon and other fish which the ghosts speared for their subsistence Beyond was a narrow path between moving rocks which each instant crashed together grinding to atoms the less nimble of the pilgrims who essayed to pass The Hurons believed that a personage named Oscotarach or the Head Piercer dwelt in a bark house beside the path and that it was his office to remove the brains from the heads of all who went by as a necessary preparation for immortality This singular idea is found also in some Algonquin traditions according to which however the brain is afterwards restored to its owner On Indian ideas of another life compare Sagard the Jesuit Relations Perrot Charlevoix and Lafitau with Tanner James Schoolcraft and the Appendix to Morse s Indian Report Le Clerc recounts a singular story current in his time among the Algonquins of Gaspe and Northern New Brunswick The favorite son of an old Indian died whereupon the father with a party of friends set out for the land of souls to recover him It was only necessary to wade through a shallow lake several days journey in extent This they did sleeping at night on platforms of poles which supported them above the water At length they arrived and were met by Papkootparout the Indian Pluto who rushed on them in a rage with his war club upraised but presently relenting changed his mind and challenged them to a game of ball They proved the victors and won the stakes consisting of corn tobacco and certain fruits which thus became known to mankind The bereaved father now begged hard for his son s soul and Papkootparout at last gave it to him in the form and size of a nut which by pressing it hard between his hands he forced into a small leather bag The delighted parent carried it back to earth with instructions to insert it in the body of his son who would thereupon return to life When the adventurers reached home and reported the happy issue of their journey there was a dance of rejoicing and the father wishing to take part in it gave his son s soul to the keeping of a squaw who stood by Being curious to see it she opened the bag on which it escaped at once and took flight for the realms of Papkootparout preferring them to the abodes of the living Le Clerc Nouvelle Relation de la Gaspesie three hundred ten three hundred twenty eight Dreams were to the Indian a universal oracle They revealed to him his guardian spirit taught him the cure of his diseases warned him of the devices of sorcerers guided him to the lurking places of his enemy or the haunts of game and unfolded the secrets of good and evil destiny The dream was a mysterious and inexorable power whose least behests must be obeyed to the letter a source in every Indian town of endless mischief and abomination There were professed dreamers and professed interpreters of dreams One of the most noted festivals among the Hurons and Iroquois was the Dream Feast a scene of frenzy where the actors counterfeited madness and the town was like a bedlam turned loose Each pretended to have dreamed of something necessary to his welfare and rushed from house to house demanding of all he met to guess his secret requirement and satisfy it Believing that the whole material world was instinct with powers to influence and control his fate that good and evil spirits and existences nameless and indefinable filled all Nature that a pervading sorcery was above below and around him and that issues of life and death might be controlled by instruments the most unnoticeable and seemingly the most feeble the Indian lived in perpetual fear The turning of a leaf the crawling of an insect the cry of a bird the creaking of a bough might be to him the mystic signal of weal or woe An Indian community swarmed with sorcerers medicine men and diviners whose functions were often united in the same person The sorcerer by charms magic songs magic feasts and the beating of his drum had power over the spirits and those occult influences inherent in animals and inanimate things He could call to him the souls of his enemies They appeared before him in the form of stones He chopped and bruised them with his hatchet blood and flesh issued forth and the intended victim however distant languished and died Like the sorcerer of the Middle Ages he made images of those he wished to destroy and muttering incantations punctured them with an awl whereupon the persons represented sickened and pined away The Indian doctor relied far more on magic than on natural remedies Dreams beating of the drum songs magic feasts and dances and howling to frighten the female demon from his patient were his ordinary methods of cure The prophet or diviner had various means of reading the secrets of futurity such as the flight of birds and the movements of water and fire There was a peculiar practice of divination very general in the Algonquin family of tribes among some of whom it still subsists A small conical lodge was made by planting poles in a circle lashing the tops together at the height of about seven feet from the ground and closely covering them with hides The prophet crawled in and closed the aperture after him He then beat his drum and sang his magic songs to summon the spirits whose weak shrill voices were soon heard mingled with his lugubrious chanting while at intervals the juggler paused to interpret their communications to the attentive crowd seated on the ground without During the whole scene the lodge swayed to and fro with a violence which has astonished many a civilized beholder and which some of the Jesuits explain by the ready solution of a genuine diabolic intervention This practice was first observed by Champlain See Pioneers of France in the New World From his time to the present numerous writers have remarked upon it Le Jeune in the Relation of sixteen thirty seven treats it at some length The lodge was sometimes of a cylindrical instead of a conical form The sorcerers medicine men and diviners did not usually exercise the function of priests Each man sacrificed for himself to the powers he wished to propitiate whether his guardian spirit the spirits of animals or the other beings of his belief The most common offering was tobacco thrown into the fire or water scraps of meat were sometimes burned to the manitous and on a few rare occasions of public solemnity a white dog the mystic animal of many tribes was tied to the end of an upright pole as a sacrifice to some superior spirit or to the sun with which the superior spirits were constantly confounded by the primitive Indian In recent times when Judaism and Christianity have modified his religious ideas it has been and still is the practice to sacrifice dogs to the Great Spirit On these public occasions the sacrificial function is discharged by chiefs or by warriors appointed for the purpose Many of the Indian feasts were feasts of sacrifice sometimes to the guardian spirit of the host sometimes to an animal of which he has dreamed sometimes to a local or other spirit The food was first offered in a loud voice to the being to be propitiated after which the guests proceeded to devour it for him This unique method of sacrifice was practised at war feasts and similar solemnities For an excellent account of Indian religious feasts see Perrot Chap V One of the most remarkable of Indian sacrifices was that practised by the Hurons in the case of a person drowned or frozen to death The flesh of the deceased was cut off and thrown into a fire made for the purpose as an offering of propitiation to the spirits of the air or water What remained of the body was then buried near the fire Brebeuf Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty six one hundred eight The tribes of Virginia as described by Beverly and others not only had priests who offered sacrifice but idols and houses of worship Among the Hurons and Iroquois and indeed all the stationary tribes there was an incredible number of mystic ceremonies extravagant puerile and often disgusting designed for the cure of the sick or for the general weal of the community Most of their observances seem originally to have been dictated by dreams and transmitted as a sacred heritage from generation to generation They consisted in an endless variety of dances masqueradings and nondescript orgies and a scrupulous adherence to all the traditional forms was held to be of the last moment as the slightest failure in this respect might entail serious calamities If children were seen in their play imitating any of these mysteries they were grimly rebuked and punished In many tribes secret magical societies existed and still exist into which members are initiated with peculiar ceremonies These associations are greatly respected and feared They have charms for love war and private revenge and exert a great and often a very mischievous influence The societies of the Metai and the Wabeno among the Northern Algonquins are conspicuous examples while other societies of similar character have for a century been known to exist among the Dahcotah The Friendly Society of the Spirit of which the initiatory ceremonies were seen and described by Carver Travels two hundred seventy one preserves to this day its existence and its rites A notice of the superstitious ideas of the Indians would be imperfect without a reference to the traditionary tales through which these ideas are handed down from father to son Some of these tales can be traced back to the period of the earliest intercourse with Europeans One at least of those recorded by the first missionaries on the Lower saint Lawrence is still current among the tribes of the Upper Lakes Many of them are curious combinations of beliefs seriously entertained with strokes intended for humor and drollery which never fail to awaken peals of laughter in the lodge circle Giants dwarfs cannibals spirits beasts birds and anomalous monsters transformations tricks and sorcery form the staple of the story Some of the Iroquois tales embody conceptions which however preposterous are of a bold and striking character but those of the Algonquins are to an incredible degree flimsy silly and meaningless nor are those of the Dahcotah tribes much better In respect to this wigwam lore there is a curious superstition of very wide prevalence The tales must not be told in summer since at that season when all Nature is full of life the spirits are awake and hearing what is said of them may take offence whereas in winter they are fast sealed up in snow and ice and no longer capable of listening The prevalence of this fancy among the Algonquins in the remote parts of Canada is well established The writer found it also among the extreme western bands of the Dahcotah He tried in the month of July to persuade an old chief a noted story teller to tell him some of the tales but though abundantly loquacious in respect to his own adventures and even his dreams the Indian obstinately refused saying that winter was the time for the tales and that it was bad to tell them in summer mister Schoolcraft has published a collection of Algonquin tales under the title of Algic Researches Most of them were translated by his wife an educated Ojibwa half breed This book is perhaps the best of mister Schoolcraft s works though its value is much impaired by the want of a literal rendering and the introduction of decorations which savor more of a popular monthly magazine than of an Indian wigwam missus Eastman s interesting Legends of the Sioux Dahcotah is not free from the same defect Other tales are scattered throughout the works of mister Schoolcraft and various modern writers Some are to be found in the works of Lafitau and the other Jesuits But few of the Iroquois legends have been printed though a considerable number have been written down The singular History of the Five Nations by the old Tuscarora Indian Cusick gives the substance of some of them Others will be found in Clark s History of Onondaga It is obvious that the Indian mind has never seriously occupied itself with any of the higher themes of thought The beings of its belief are not impersonations of the forces of Nature the courses of human destiny or the movements of human intellect will and passion In the midst of Nature the Indian knew nothing of her laws His perpetual reference of her phenomena to occult agencies forestalled inquiry and precluded inductive reasoning If the wind blew with violence it was because the water lizard which makes the wind had crawled out of his pool if the lightning was sharp and frequent it was because the young of the thunder bird were restless in their nest if a blight fell upon the corn it was because the Corn Spirit was angry and if the beavers were shy and difficult to catch it was because they had taken offence at seeing the bones of one of their race thrown to a dog Well and even highly developed in a few instances I allude especially to the Iroquois with respect to certain points of material concernment the mind of the Indian in other respects was and is almost hopelessly stagnant The very traits that raise him above the servile races are hostile to the kind and degree of civilization which those races so easily attain His intractable spirit of independence and the pride which forbids him to be an imitator reinforce but too strongly that savage lethargy of mind from which it is so hard to rouse him No race perhaps ever offered greater difficulties to those laboring for its improvement To sum up the results of this examination the primitive Indian was as savage in his religion as in his life He was divided between fetich worship and that next degree of religious development which consists in the worship of deities embodied in the human form His conception of their attributes was such as might have been expected His gods were no whit better than himself Even when he borrows from Christianity the idea of a Supreme and Universal Spirit his tendency is to reduce Him to a local habitation and a bodily shape and this tendency disappears only in tribes that have been long in contact with civilized white men The primitive Indian yielding his untutored homage to One All pervading and Omnipotent Spirit is a dream of poets rhetoricians and sentimentalists THE JESUITS IN NORTH AMERICA CHAPTER I sixteen thirty four NOTRE DAME DES ANGES QUEBEC IN sixteen thirty four FATHER LE JEUNE THE MISSION HOUSE ITS DOMESTIC ECONOMY THE JESUITS AND THEIR DESIGNS Opposite Quebec lies the tongue of land called Point Levi One who in the summer of the year sixteen thirty four stood on its margin and looked northward across the saint Lawrence would have seen at the distance of a mile or more a range of lofty cliffs rising on the left into the bold heights of Cape Diamond and on the right sinking abruptly to the bed of the tributary river saint Charles Beneath these cliffs at the brink of the saint Lawrence he would have descried a cluster of warehouses sheds and wooden tenements Immediately above along the verge of the precipice he could have traced the outlines of a fortified work with a flagstaff and a few small cannon to command the river while at the only point where Nature had made the heights accessible a zigzag path connected the warehouses and the fort Now embarked in the canoe of some Montagnais Indian let him cross the saint Lawrence land at the pier and passing the cluster of buildings climb the pathway up the cliff Pausing for rest and breath he might see ascending and descending the tenants of this outpost of the wilderness a soldier of the fort or an officer in slouched hat and plume a factor of the fur company owner and sovereign lord of all Canada a party of Indians a trader from the upper country one of the precursors of that hardy race of coureurs de bois destined to form a conspicuous and striking feature of the Canadian population next perhaps would appear a figure widely different The close black cassock the rosary hanging from the waist and the wide black hat looped up at the sides proclaimed the Jesuit Father Le Jeune Superior of the Residence of Quebec And now that we may better know the aspect and condition of the infant colony and incipient mission we will follow the priest on his way Mounting the steep path he reached the top of the cliff some two hundred feet above the river and the warehouses On the left lay the fort built by Champlain covering a part of the ground now forming Durham Terrace and the Place d Armes Its ramparts were of logs and earth and within was a turreted building of stone used as a barrack as officers quarters and for other purposes Compare the various notices in Champlain sixteen thirty two with that of Du Creux Historia Canadensis two hundred four Near the fort stood a small chapel newly built The surrounding country was cleared and partially cultivated yet only one dwelling house worthy the name appeared It was a substantial cottage where lived Madame Hebert widow of the first settler of Canada with her daughter her son in law Couillard and their children good Catholics all who two years before when Quebec was evacuated by the English one wept for joy at beholding Le Jeune and his brother Jesuit De Noue crossing their threshold to offer beneath their roof the long forbidden sacrifice of the Mass There were inclosures with cattle near at hand and the house with its surroundings betokened industry and thrift one See Pioneers of France in the New World Hebert s cottage seems to have stood between Ste Famille and Couillard Streets as appears by a contract of sixteen thirty four cited by M Ferland Thence Le Jeune walked on across the site of the modern market place and still onward near the line of the cliffs which sank abruptly on his right Beneath lay the mouth of the saint Charles and beyond the wilderness shore of Beauport swept in a wide curve eastward to where far in the distance the Gulf of Montmorenci yawned on the great river The settlement of Beauport was begun this year or the year following by the Sieur Giffard to whom a large tract had been granted here Langevin Notes sur les Archives de N D de Beauport five The priest soon passed the clearings and entered the woods which covered the site of the present suburb of saint John Thence he descended to a lower plateau where now lies the suburb of saint Roch and still advancing reached a pleasant spot at the extremity of the Pointe aux Lievres a tract of meadow land nearly inclosed by a sudden bend of the saint Charles Here lay a canoe or skiff and paddling across the narrow stream Le Jeune saw on the meadow two hundred yards from the bank a square inclosure formed of palisades like a modern picket fort of the Indian frontier one Within this inclosure were two buildings one of which had been half burned by the English and was not yet repaired It served as storehouse stable workshop and bakery Opposite stood the principal building a structure of planks plastered with mud and thatched with long grass from the meadows It consisted of one story a garret and a cellar and contained four principal rooms of which one served as chapel another as refectory another as kitchen and the fourth as a lodging for workmen The furniture of all was plain in the extreme Until the preceding year the chapel had had no other ornament than a sheet on which were glued two coarse engravings but the priests had now decorated their altar with an image of a dove representing the Holy Ghost an image of Loyola another of Xavier and three images of the Virgin Four cells opened from the refectory the largest of which was eight feet square In these lodged six priests while two lay brothers found shelter in the garret The house had been hastily built eight years before and now leaked in all parts Such was the Residence of Notre Dame des Anges Here was nourished the germ of a vast enterprise and this was the cradle of the great mission of New France two one This must have been very near the point where the streamlet called the River Lairet enters the saint Charles The place has a triple historic interest The wintering place of Cartier in fifteen thirty five six see Pioneers of France seems to have been here Here too in seventeen fifty nine Montcalm s bridge of boats crossed the saint Charles and in a large intrenchment which probably included the site of the Jesuit mission house the remnants of his shattered army rallied after their defeat on the Plains of Abraham See the very curious Narrative of the Chevalier Johnstone published by the Historical Society of Quebec two The above particulars are gathered from the Relations of sixteen twenty six Lalemant and sixteen thirty two sixteen thirty three sixteen thirty four sixteen thirty five Le Jeune but chiefly from a long letter of the Father Superior to the Provincial of the Jesuits at Paris containing a curiously minute report of the state of the mission It was sent from Quebec by the returning ships in the summer of sixteen thirty four and will be found in Carayon Premiere Mission des Jesuites au Canada one hundred twenty two The original is in the archives of the Order at Rome Of the six Jesuits gathered in the refectory for the evening meal one was conspicuous among the rest a tall strong man with features that seemed carved by Nature for a soldier but which the mental habits of years had stamped with the visible impress of the priesthood This was Jean de Brebeuf descendant of a noble family of Normandy and one of the ablest and most devoted zealots whose names stand on the missionary rolls of his Order His companions were Masse Daniel Davost De Noue and the Father Superior Le Jeune Masse was the same priest who had been the companion of Father Biard in the abortive mission of Acadia See Pioneers of France in the New World By reason of his useful qualities Le Jeune nicknamed him le Pere Utile At present his special function was the care of the pigs and cows which he kept in the inclosure around the buildings lest they should ravage the neighboring fields of rye barley wheat and maize one De Noue had charge of the eight or ten workmen employed by the mission who gave him at times no little trouble by their repinings and complaints two They were forced to hear mass every morning and prayers every evening besides an exhortation on Sunday Some of them were for returning home while two or three of a different complexion wished to be Jesuits themselves The Fathers in their intervals of leisure worked with their men spade in hand For the rest they were busied in preaching singing vespers saying mass and hearing confessions at the fort of Quebec catechizing a few Indians and striving to master the enormous difficulties of the Huron and Algonquin languages one Le P Masse que je nomme quelquefois en riant le Pere Utile est bien cognu de V R Il a soin des choses domestiques et du bestail que nous avons en quoy il a tres bien reussy Lettre du P Paul le Jeune au R P Provincial in Carayon one hundred twenty two Le Jeune does not fail to send an inventory of the bestail to his Superior namely Deux grosses truies qui nourissent chacune quatre petits cochons deux vaches deux petites genisses et un petit taureau two The methodical Le Jeune sets down the causes of their discontent under six different heads each duly numbered Thus one C est le naturel des artisans de se plaindre et de gronder two La diversite des gages les fait murmurer et cetera Well might Father Le Jeune write to his Superior The harvest is plentiful and the laborers few These men aimed at the conversion of a continent From their hovel on the saint Charles they surveyed a field of labor whose vastness might tire the wings of thought itself a scene repellent and appalling darkened with omens of peril and woe They were an advance guard of the great army of Loyola strong in a discipline that controlled not alone the body and the will but the intellect the heart the soul and the inmost consciousness The lives of these early Canadian Jesuits attest the earnestness of their faith and the intensity of their zeal but it was a zeal bridled curbed and ruled by a guiding hand Their marvellous training in equal measure kindled enthusiasm and controlled it roused into action a mighty power and made it as subservient as those great material forces which modern science has learned to awaken and to govern They were drilled to a factitious humility prone to find utterance in expressions of self depreciation and self scorn which one may often judge unwisely when he condemns them as insincere They were devoted believers not only in the fundamental dogmas of Rome but in those lesser matters of faith which heresy despises as idle and puerile superstitions One great aim engrossed their lives For the greater glory of God ad majorem Dei gloriam they would act or wait dare suffer or die yet all in unquestioning subjection to the authority of the Superiors in whom they recognized the agents of Divine authority itself CHAPTER II LOYOLA AND THE JESUITS CONVERSION OF LOYOLA FOUNDATION OF THE SOCIETY OF JESUS PREPARATION OF THE NOVICE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ORDER THE CANADIAN JESUITS It was an evil day for new born Protestantism when a French artilleryman fired the shot that struck down Ignatius Loyola in the breach of Pampeluna A proud noble an aspiring soldier a graceful courtier an ardent and daring gallant was metamorphosed by that stroke into the zealot whose brain engendered and brought forth the mighty Society of Jesus His story is a familiar one how in the solitude of his sick room a change came over him upheaving like an earthquake all the forces of his nature how in the cave of Manresa the mysteries of Heaven were revealed to him how he passed from agonies to transports from transports to the calm of a determined purpose The soldier gave himself to a new warfare In the forge of his great intellect heated but not disturbed by the intense fires of his zeal was wrought the prodigious enginery whose power has been felt to the uttermost confines of the world Loyola s training had been in courts and camps of books he knew little or nothing He had lived in the unquestioning faith of one born and bred in the very focus of Romanism and thus at the age of about thirty his conversion found him It was a change of life and purpose not of belief He presumed not to inquire into the doctrines of the Church It was for him to enforce those doctrines and to this end he turned all the faculties of his potent intellect and all his deep knowledge of mankind He did not aim to build up barren communities of secluded monks aspiring to heaven through prayer penance and meditation but to subdue the world to the dominion of the dogmas which had subdued him to organize and discipline a mighty host controlled by one purpose and one mind fired by a quenchless zeal or nerved by a fixed resolve yet impelled restrained and directed by a single master hand The Jesuit is no dreamer he is emphatically a man of action action is the end of his existence It was an arduous problem which Loyola undertook to solve to rob a man of volition yet to preserve in him nay to stimulate those energies which would make him the most efficient instrument of a great design To this end the Jesuit novitiate and the constitutions of the Order are directed The enthusiasm of the novice is urged to its intensest pitch then in the name of religion he is summoned to the utter abnegation of intellect and will in favor of the Superior in whom he is commanded to recognize the representative of God on earth Thus the young zealot makes no slavish sacrifice of intellect and will at least so he is taught for he sacrifices them not to man but to his Maker No limit is set to his submission if the Superior pronounces black to be white he is bound in conscience to acquiesce Those who wish to know the nature of the Jesuit virtue of obedience will find it set forth in the famous Letter on Obedience of Loyola Loyola s book of Spiritual Exercises is well known In these exercises lies the hard and narrow path which is the only entrance to the Society of Jesus The book is to all appearance a dry and superstitious formulary but in the hands of a skilful director of consciences it has proved of terrible efficacy The novice in solitude and darkness day after day and night after night ponders its images of perdition and despair He is taught to hear in imagination the howlings of the damned to see their convulsive agonies to feel the flames that burn without consuming to smell the corruption of the tomb and the fumes of the infernal pit He must picture to himself an array of adverse armies one commanded by Satan on the plains of Babylon one encamped under Christ about the walls of Jerusalem and the perturbed mind humbled by long contemplation of its own vileness is ordered to enroll itself under one or the other banner Then the choice made it is led to a region of serenity and celestial peace and soothed with images of divine benignity and grace These meditations last without intermission about a month and under an astute and experienced directorship they have been found of such power that the Manual of Spiritual Exercises boasts to have saved souls more in number than the letters it contains To this succeed two years of discipline and preparation directed above all things else to perfecting the virtues of humility and obedience The novice is obliged to perform the lowest menial offices and the most repulsive duties of the sick room and the hospital and he is sent forth for weeks together to beg his bread like a common mendicant He is required to reveal to his confessor not only his sins but all those hidden tendencies instincts and impulses which form the distinctive traits of character He is set to watch his comrades and his comrades are set to watch him Each must report what he observes of the acts and dispositions of the others and this mutual espionage does not end with the novitiate but extends to the close of life The characteristics of every member of the Order are minutely analyzed and methodically put on record This horrible violence to the noblest qualities of manhood joined to that equivocal system of morality which eminent casuists of the Order have inculcated must it may be thought produce deplorable effects upon the characters of those under its influence Whether this has been actually the case the reader of history may determine It is certain however that the Society of Jesus has numbered among its members men whose fervent and exalted natures have been intensified without being abased by the pressure to which they have been subjected It is not for nothing that the Society studies the character of its members so intently and by methods so startling It not only uses its knowledge to thrust into obscurity or cast out altogether those whom it discovers to be dull feeble or unwilling instruments of its purposes but it assigns to every one the task to which his talents or his disposition may best adapt him to one the care of a royal conscience whereby unseen his whispered word may guide the destiny of nations to another the instruction of children to another a career of letters or science and to the fervent and the self sacrificing sometimes also to the restless and uncompliant the distant missions to the heathen The Jesuit was and is everywhere in the school room in the library in the cabinets of princes and ministers in the huts of savages in the tropics in the frozen North in India in China in Japan in Africa in America now as a Christian priest now as a soldier a mathematician an astrologer a Brahmin a mandarin under countless disguises by a thousand arts luring persuading or compelling souls into the fold of Rome Of this vast mechanism for guiding and governing the minds of men this mighty enginery for subduing the earth to the dominion of an idea this harmony of contradictions this moral Proteus the faintest sketch must now suffice A disquisition on the Society of Jesus would be without end No religious order has ever united in itself so much to be admired and so much to be detested Unmixed praise has been poured on its Canadian members It is not for me to eulogize them but to portray them as they were CHAPTER III sixteen thirty two sixteen thirty three PAUL LE JEUNE LE JEUNE S VOYAGE HIS FIRST PUPILS HIS STUDIES HIS INDIAN TEACHER WINTER AT THE MISSION HOUSE LE JEUNE S SCHOOL REINFORCEMENTS In another narrative we have seen how the Jesuits supplanting the Recollet friars their predecessors had adopted as their own the rugged task of Christianizing New France We have seen too how a descent of the English or rather of Huguenots fighting under English colors had overthrown for a time the miserable little colony with the mission to which it was wedded and how Quebec was at length restored to France and the broken thread of the Jesuit enterprise resumed Pioneers of France It was then that Le Jeune had embarked for the New World He was in his convent at Dieppe when he received the order to depart and he set forth in haste for Havre filled he assures us with inexpressible joy at the prospect of a living or a dying martyrdom At Rouen he was joined by De Noue with a lay brother named Gilbert and the three sailed together on the eighteenth of April sixteen thirty two The sea treated them roughly Le Jeune was wretchedly sea sick and the ship nearly foundered in a gale At length they came in sight of that miserable country as the missionary calls the scene of his future labors It was in the harbor of Tadoussac that he first encountered the objects of his apostolic cares for as he sat in the ship s cabin with the master it was suddenly invaded by ten or twelve Indians whom he compares to a party of maskers at the Carnival Some had their cheeks painted black their noses blue and the rest of their faces red Others were decorated with a broad band of black across the eyes and others again with diverging rays of black red and blue on both cheeks Their attire was no less uncouth Some of them wore shaggy bear skins reminding the priest of the pictures of saint John the Baptist After a vain attempt to save a number of Iroquois prisoners whom they were preparing to burn alive on shore Le Jeune and his companions again set sail and reached Quebec on the fifth of July Having said mass as already mentioned under the roof of Madame Hebert and her delighted family the Jesuits made their way to the two hovels built by their predecessors on the saint Charles which had suffered woful dilapidation at the hands of the English Here they made their abode and applied themselves with such skill as they could command to repair the shattered tenements and cultivate the waste meadows around The beginning of Le Jeune s missionary labors was neither imposing nor promising He describes himself seated with a small Indian boy on one side and a small negro on the other the latter of whom had been left by the English as a gift to Madame Hebert As neither of the three understood the language of the others the pupils made little progress in spiritual knowledge The missionaries it was clear must learn Algonquin at any cost and to this end Le Jeune resolved to visit the Indian encampments Hearing that a band of Montagnais were fishing for eels on the saint Lawrence between Cape Diamond and the cove which now bears the name of Wolfe he set forth for the spot on a morning in October As with toil and trepidation he scrambled around the foot of the cape whose precipices with a chaos of loose rocks thrust themselves at that day into the deep tidewater he dragged down upon himself the trunk of a fallen tree which in its descent well nigh swept him into the river The peril past he presently reached his destination Here among the lodges of bark were stretched innumerable strings of hide from which hung to dry an incredible multitude of eels A boy invited him into the lodge of a withered squaw his grandmother who hastened to offer him four smoked eels on a piece of birch bark while other squaws of the household instructed him how to roast them on a forked stick over the embers All shared the feast together his entertainers using as napkins their own hair or that of their dogs while Le Jeune intent on increasing his knowledge of Algonquin maintained an active discourse of broken words and pantomime Le Jeune Relation sixteen thirty three two The lesson however was too laborious and of too little profit to be often repeated and the missionary sought anxiously for more stable instruction To find such was not easy The interpreters Frenchmen who in the interest of the fur company had spent years among the Indians were averse to Jesuits and refused their aid There was one resource however of which Le Jeune would fain avail himself An Indian called Pierre by the French had been carried to France by the Recollet friars instructed converted and baptized He had lately returned to Canada where to the scandal of the Jesuits he had relapsed into his old ways retaining of his French education little besides a few new vices He still haunted the fort at Quebec lured by the hope of an occasional gift of wine or tobacco but shunned the Jesuits of whose rigid way of life he stood in horror As he spoke good French and good Indian he would have been invaluable to the embarrassed priests at the mission Le Jeune invoked the aid of the Saints The effect of his prayers soon appeared he tells us in a direct interposition of Providence which so disposed the heart of Pierre that he quarrelled with the French commandant who thereupon closed the fort against him He then repaired to his friends and relatives in the woods but only to encounter a rebuff from a young squaw to whom he made his addresses On this he turned his steps towards the mission house and being unfitted by his French education for supporting himself by hunting begged food and shelter from the priests Le Jeune gratefully accepted him as a gift vouchsafed by Heaven to his prayers persuaded a lackey at the fort to give him a cast off suit of clothes promised him maintenance and installed him as his teacher Seated on wooden stools by the rough table in the refectory the priest and the Indian pursued their studies How thankful I am writes Le Jeune to those who gave me tobacco last year At every difficulty I give my master a piece of it to make him more attentive Relation sixteen thirty three seven He continues Ie ne scaurois assez rendre graces a Nostre Seigneur de cet heureux rencontre Que Dieu soit beny pour vn iamais sa prouidence est adorable et sa bonte n a point de limites Meanwhile winter closed in with a severity rare even in Canada The saint Lawrence and the saint Charles were hard frozen rivers forests and rocks were mantled alike in dazzling sheets of snow The humble mission house of Notre Dame des Anges was half buried in the drifts which heaped up in front where a path had been dug through them rose two feet above the low eaves The priests sitting at night before the blazing logs of their wide throated chimney heard the trees in the neighboring forest cracking with frost with a sound like the report of a pistol Le Jeune s ink froze and his fingers were benumbed as he toiled at his declensions and conjugations or translated the Pater Noster into blundering Algonquin The water in the cask beside the fire froze nightly and the ice was broken every morning with hatchets The blankets of the two priests were fringed with the icicles of their congealed breath and the frost lay in a thick coating on the lozenge shaped glass of their cells Le Jeune Relation sixteen thirty three fourteen fifteen By day Le Jeune and his companion practised with snow shoes with all the mishaps which attend beginners the trippings the falls and headlong dives into the soft drifts amid the laughter of the Indians Their seclusion was by no means a solitude Bands of Montagnais with their sledges and dogs often passed the mission house on their way to hunt the moose They once invited De Noue to go with them and he scarcely less eager than Le Jeune to learn their language readily consented In two or three weeks he appeared sick famished and half dead with exhaustion Not ten priests in a hundred writes Le Jeune to his Superior could bear this winter life with the savages But what of that It was not for them to falter They were but instruments in the hands of God to be used broken and thrown aside if such should be His will Voila mon Reuerend Pere vn eschantillon de ce qu il faut souffrir courant apres les Sauuages Il faut prendre sa vie et tout ce qu on a et le ietter a l abandon pour ainsi dire se contentant d vne croix bien grosse et bien pesante pour toute richesse Il est bien vray que Dieu ne se laisse point vaincre et que plus on quitte plus on trouue plus on perd plus on gaigne mais Dieu se cache par fois et alors le Calice est bien amer Le Jeune Relation sixteen thirty three nineteen An Indian made Le Jeune a present of two small children greatly to the delight of the missionary who at once set himself to teaching them to pray in Latin As the season grew milder the number of his scholars increased for when parties of Indians encamped in the neighborhood he would take his stand at the door and like Xavier at Goa ring a bell At this a score of children would gather around him and he leading them into the refectory which served as his school room taught them to repeat after him the Pater Aye and Credo expounded the mystery of the Trinity showed them the sign of the cross and made them repeat an Indian prayer the joint composition of Pierre and himself then followed the catechism the lesson closing with singing the Pater Noster translated by the missionary into Algonquin rhymes and when all was over he rewarded each of his pupils with a porringer of peas to insure their attendance at his next bell ringing I ay commence a appeller quelques enfans auec vne petite clochette La premiere fois i en auois six puis douze puis quinze puis vingt et davantage ie leur fais dire le Pater Aue et Credo et cetera Nous finissons par le Pater Noster que i ay compose quasi en rimes en leur langue que ie leur fais chanter et pour derniere conclusion ie leur fais donner chacun vne escuellee de pois qu ils mangent de bon appetit et cetera Le Jeune Relation sixteen thirty three twenty three It was the end of May when the priests one morning heard the sound of cannon from the fort and were gladdened by the tidings that Samuel de Champlain had arrived to resume command at Quebec bringing with him four more Jesuits Brebeuf Masse Daniel and Davost See Pioneers of France Brebeuf from the first turned his eyes towards the distant land of the Hurons a field of labor full of peril but rich in hope and promise Le Jeune s duties as Superior restrained him from wanderings so remote His apostleship must be limited for a time to the vagabond hordes of Algonquins who roamed the forests of the lower saint Lawrence and of whose language he had been so sedulous a student His difficulties had of late been increased by the absence of Pierre who had run off as Lent drew near standing in dread of that season of fasting Masse brought tidings of him from Tadoussac whither he had gone and where a party of English had given him liquor destroying the last trace of Le Jeune s late exhortations God forgive those writes the Father who introduced heresy into this country If this savage corrupted as he is by these miserable heretics had any wit he would be a great hindrance to the spread of the Faith It is plain that he was given us not for the good of his soul but only that we might extract from him the principles of his language Relation sixteen thirty three twenty nine Pierre had two brothers One well known as a hunter was named Mestigoit the other was the most noted medicine man or as the Jesuits called him sorcerer in the tribe of the Montagnais Like the rest of their people they were accustomed to set out for their winter hunt in the autumn after the close of their eel fishery Le Jeune despite the experience of De Noue had long had a mind to accompany one of these roving bands partly in the hope that in some hour of distress he might touch their hearts or by a timely drop of baptismal water dismiss some dying child to paradise but chiefly with the object of mastering their language Pierre had rejoined his brothers and as the hunting season drew near they all begged the missionary to make one of their party not as he thought out of any love for him but solely with a view to the provisions with which they doubted not he would be well supplied Le Jeune distrustful of the sorcerer demurred but at length resolved to go CHAPTER IV sixteen thirty three sixteen thirty four LE JEUNE AND THE HUNTERS LE JEUNE JOINS THE INDIANS THE FIRST ENCAMPMENT THE APOSTATE FOREST LIFE IN WINTER THE INDIAN HUT THE SORCERER HIS PERSECUTION OF THE PRIEST EVIL COMPANY MAGIC INCANTATIONS CHRISTMAS STARVATION HOPES OF CONVERSION BACKSLIDING PERIL AND ESCAPE OF LE JEUNE HIS RETURN On a morning in the latter part of October Le Jeune embarked with the Indians twenty in all men women and children No other Frenchman was of the party Champlain bade him an anxious farewell and commended him to the care of his red associates who had taken charge of his store of biscuit flour corn prunes and turnips to which in an evil hour his friends had persuaded him to add a small keg of wine The canoes glided along the wooded shore of the Island of Orleans and the party landed towards evening on the small island immediately below Le Jeune was delighted with the spot and the wild beauties of the autumnal sunset His reflections however were soon interrupted While the squaws were setting up their bark lodges and Mestigoit was shooting wild fowl for supper Pierre returned to the canoes tapped the keg of wine and soon fell into the mud helplessly drunk Revived by the immersion he next appeared at the camp foaming at the mouth threw down the lodges overset the kettle and chased the shrieking squaws into the woods His brother Mestigoit rekindled the fire and slung the kettle anew when Pierre who meanwhile had been raving like a madman along the shore reeled in a fury to the spot to repeat his former exploit Mestigoit anticipated him snatched the kettle from the fire and threw the scalding contents in his face He was never so well washed before in his life says Le Jeune he lost all the skin of his face and breast Would to God his heart had changed also one He roared in his frenzy for a hatchet to kill the missionary who therefore thought it prudent to spend the night in the neighboring woods Here he stretched himself on the earth while a charitable squaw covered him with a sheet of birch bark Though my bed he writes had not been made up since the creation of the world it was not hard enough to prevent me from sleeping Iamais il ne fut si bien laue il changea de peau en la face et en tout l estomach pleust a Dieu que son ame eust change aussi bien que son corps Relation sixteen thirty four fifty nine Such was his initiation into Indian winter life Passing over numerous adventures by water and land we find the party on the twelfth of November leaving their canoes on an island and wading ashore at low tide over the flats to the southern bank of the saint Lawrence As two other bands had joined them their number was increased to forty five persons Now leaving the river behind they entered those savage highlands whence issue the springs of the saint John a wilderness of rugged mountain ranges clad in dense continuous forests with no human tenant but this troop of miserable rovers and here and there some kindred band as miserable as they Winter had set in and already dead Nature was sheeted in funereal white Lakes and ponds were frozen rivulets sealed up torrents encased with stalactites of ice the black rocks and the black trunks of the pine trees were beplastered with snow and its heavy masses crushed the dull green boughs into the drifts beneath The forest was silent as the grave Through this desolation the long file of Indians made its way all on snow shoes each man woman and child bending under a heavy load or dragging a sledge narrow but of prodigious length They carried their whole wealth with them on their backs or on their sledges kettles axes hides of meat if such they had and huge rolls of birch bark for covering their wigwams The Jesuit was loaded like the rest The dogs alone floundered through the drifts unburdened There was neither path nor level ground Descending climbing stooping beneath half fallen trees clambering over piles of prostrate trunks struggling through matted cedar swamps threading chill ravines and crossing streams no longer visible they toiled on till the day began to decline then stopped to encamp one Burdens were thrown down and sledges unladen The squaws with knives and hatchets cut long poles of birch and spruce saplings while the men with snow shoes for shovels cleared a round or square space in the snow which formed an upright wall three or four feet high inclosing the area of the wigwam On one side a passage was cut for an entrance and the poles were planted around the top of the wall of snow sloping and converging On these poles were spread the sheets of birch bark a bear skin was hung in the passage way for a door the bare ground within and the surrounding snow were covered with spruce boughs and the work was done one S il arriuoit quelque degel o Dieu quelle peine Il me sembloit que ie marchois sur vn chemin de verre qui se

which Le Jeune spent with travel and weakened by precarious and unaccustomed fare had the choice of shivering in idleness or taking part in a labor which fatigued without warming his exhausted frame The sorcerer s wife was in far worse case Though in the extremity of a mortal sickness they left her lying in the snow till the wigwam was made without a word on her part of remonstrance or complaint Le Jeune to the great ire of her husband sometimes spent the interval in trying to convert her but she proved intractable and soon died unbaptized Thus lodged they remained so long as game could be found within a circuit of ten or twelve miles and then subsistence failing removed to another spot Early in the winter they hunted the beaver and the Canada porcupine and later in the season of deep snows chased the moose and the caribou Put aside the bear skin and enter the hut Here in a space some thirteen feet square were packed nineteen savages men women and children with their dogs crouched squatted coiled like hedgehogs or lying on their backs with knees drawn up perpendicularly to keep their feet out of the fire Le Jeune always methodical arranges the grievances inseparable from these rough quarters under four chief heads Cold Heat Smoke and Dogs The bark covering was full of crevices through which the icy blasts streamed in upon him from all sides and the hole above at once window and chimney was so large that as he lay he could watch the stars as well as in the open air While the fire in the midst fed with fat pine knots scorched him on one side on the other he had much ado to keep himself from freezing At times however the crowded hut seemed heated to the temperature of an oven But these evils were light when compared to the intolerable plague of smoke During a snow storm and often at other times the wigwam was filled with fumes so dense stifling and acrid that all its inmates were forced to lie flat on their faces breathing through mouths in contact with the cold earth Their throats and nostrils felt as if on fire their scorched eyes streamed with tears and when Le Jeune tried to read the letters of his breviary seemed printed in blood The dogs were not an unmixed evil for by sleeping on and around him they kept him warm at night but as an offset to this good service they walked ran and jumped over him as he lay snatched the food from his birchen dish or in a mad rush at some bone or discarded morsel now and then overset both dish and missionary Sometimes of an evening he would leave the filthy den to read his breviary in peace by the light of the moon In the forest around sounded the sharp crack of frost riven trees and from the horizon to the zenith shot up the silent meteors of the northern lights in whose fitful flashings the awe struck Indians beheld the dancing of the spirits of the dead The cold gnawed him to the bone and his devotions over he turned back shivering The illumined hut from many a chink and crevice shot forth into the gloom long streams of light athwart the twisted boughs He stooped and entered All within glowed red and fiery around the blazing pine knots where like brutes in their kennel were gathered the savage crew He stepped to his place over recumbent bodies and leggined and moccasined limbs and seated himself on the carpet of spruce boughs Here a tribulation awaited him the crowning misery of his winter quarters worse as he declares than cold heat and dogs Of the three brothers who had invited him to join the party one we have seen was the hunter Mestigoit another the sorcerer and the third Pierre whom by reason of his falling away from the Faith Le Jeune always mentions as the Apostate He was a weak minded young Indian wholly under the influence of his brother the sorcerer who if not more vicious was far more resolute and wily From the antagonism of their respective professions the sorcerer hated the priest who lost no opportunity of denouncing his incantations and who ridiculed his perpetual singing and drumming as puerility and folly The former being an indifferent hunter and disabled by a disease which he had contracted depended for subsistence on his credit as a magician and in undermining it Le Jeune not only outraged his pride but threatened his daily bread one He used every device to retort ridicule on his rival At the outset he had proffered his aid to Le Jeune in his study of the Algonquin and like the Indian practical jokers of Acadia in the case of Father Biard See Pioneers of France two hundred sixty eight palmed off upon him the foulest words in the language as the equivalent of things spiritual Thus it happened that while the missionary sought to explain to the assembled wigwam some point of Christian doctrine he was interrupted by peals of laughter from men children and squaws And now as Le Jeune took his place in the circle the sorcerer bent upon him his malignant eyes and began that course of rude bantering which filled to overflowing the cup of the Jesuit s woes All took their cue from him and made their afflicted guest the butt of their inane witticisms Look at him His face is like a dog s His head is like a pumpkin He has a beard like a rabbit s The missionary bore in silence these and countless similar attacks indeed so sorely was he harassed that lest he should exasperate his tormentor he sometimes passed whole days without uttering a word two one Ie ne laissois perdre aucune occasion de le conuaincre de niaiserie et de puerilite mettant au iour l impertinence de ses superstitions or c estoit luy arracher l ame

incessament de mille brocards de mille injures je me suis veu en tel estat que pour ne les aigrir je passois les jours entiers sans ouvrir la bouche Here follows the abuse in the original Indian with French translations Le Jeune s account of his experiences is singularly graphic The following is his summary of his annoyances Or ce miserable homme the sorcerer la fumee m ont este les deux plus grands tourmens que i aye endure parmy ces Barbares ny le froid ny le chaud ny l incommodite des chiens ny coucher a l air ny dormir sur un lict de terre ny la posture qu il faut tousiours tenir dans

comparaison de la fumee de la malice du Sorcier Relation sixteen thirty four two hundred one Cramoisy Le Jeune a man of excellent observation already knew his red associates well enough to understand that their rudeness did not of necessity imply ill will The rest of the party in their turn fared no better They rallied and bantered each other incessantly with as little forbearance and as little malice as a troop of unbridled schoolboys one No one took offence To have done so would have been to bring upon one s self genuine contumely This motley household was a model of harmony True they showed no tenderness or consideration towards the sick and disabled but for the rest each shared with all in weal or woe the famine of one was the famine of the whole and the smallest portion of food was distributed in fair and equal partition Upbraidings and complaints were unheard they bore each other s foibles with wondrous equanimity and while persecuting Le Jeune with constant importunity for tobacco and for everything else he had they never begged among themselves one Leur vie se passe a manger a ire et a railler les vns des autres et de tous les peuples qu ils cognoissent ils n ont rien de serieux sinon par fois l exterieur faisans parmy nous les graues et les retenus mais entr eux sont de vrais badins de vrais enfans qui ne demandent qu a rire Relation sixteen thirty four thirty When the fire burned well and food was abundant their conversation such as it was was incessant They used no oaths for their language supplied none doubtless because their mythology had no beings sufficiently distinct to swear by Their expletives were foul words of which they had a superabundance and which men women and children alike used with a frequency and hardihood that amazed and scandalized the priest one Nor was he better pleased with their postures in which they consulted nothing but their ease Thus of an evening when the wigwam was heated to suffocation the sorcerer in the closest possible approach to nudity lay on his back with his right knee planted upright and his left leg crossed on it discoursing volubly to the company who on their part listened in postures scarcely less remote from decency one Aussi leur disois je par fois que si les pourceaux et les chiens scauoient parler ils tiendroient leur langage Les filles et les ieunes femmes sont a l exterieur tres honnestement couuertes mais entre elles leurs discours sont puants comme des cloaques Relation sixteen thirty four thirty two The social manners of remote tribes of the present time correspond perfectly with Le Jeune s account of those of the Montagnais There was one point touching which Le Jeune and his Jesuit brethren had as yet been unable to solve their doubts Were the Indian sorcerers mere impostors or were they in actual league with the Devil That the fiends who possess this land of darkness make their power felt by action direct and potential upon the persons of its wretched inhabitants there is argues Le Jeune good reason to conclude since it is a matter of grave notoriety that the fiends who infest Brazil are accustomed cruelly to beat and otherwise torment the natives of that country as many travellers attest A Frenchman worthy of credit pursues the Father has told me that he has heard with his own ears the voice of the Demon and the sound of the blows which he discharges upon these his miserable slaves and in reference to this a very remarkable fact has been reported to me namely that when a Catholic approaches the Devil takes flight and beats these wretches no longer but that in presence of a Huguenot he does not stop beating them Surquoy on me rapporte vne chose tres remarquable c est que le Diable s enfuit et ne frappe point ou cesse de frapper ces miserables quand vn Catholique entre en leur compagnie et qu il ne laisse point de les battre en la presence d vn Huguenot d ou vient qu vn iour se voyans battus en la compagnie d vn certain Francois ils luy dirent Nous nous estonnons qua le diable nous batte toy estant auec nous veu qu il n oseroit le faire quand tes compagnons sont presents Luy se douta incontinent que cela

iamais plus aucun Demon ne molesta Ameriquain en sa compagnie d ou vient qu il se fit Catholique selon la promesse qu il en auoit faicte Mais retournons a nostre discours Relation sixteen thirty four twenty two Thus prone to believe in the immediate presence of the nether powers Le Jeune watched the sorcerer with an eye prepared to discover in his conjurations the signs of a genuine diabolic agency His observations however led him to a different result and he could detect in his rival nothing but a vile compound of impostor and dupe The sorcerer believed in the efficacy of his own magic and was continually singing and beating his drum to cure the disease from which he was suffering Towards the close of the winter Le Jeune fell sick and in his pain and weakness nearly succumbed under the nocturnal uproar of the sorcerer who hour after hour sang and drummed without mercy sometimes yelling at the top of his throat then hissing like a serpent then striking his drum on the ground as if in a frenzy then leaping up raving about the wigwam and calling on the women and children to join him in singing Now ensued a hideous din for every throat was strained to the utmost and all were beating with sticks or fists on the bark of the hut to increase the noise with the charitable object of aiding the sorcerer to conjure down his malady or drive away the evil spirit that caused it He had an enemy a rival sorcerer whom he charged with having caused by charms the disease that afflicted him He therefore announced that he should kill him As the rival dwelt at Gaspe a hundred leagues off the present execution of the threat might appear difficult but distance was no bar to the vengeance of the sorcerer Ordering all the children and all but one of the women to leave the wigwam he seated himself with the woman who remained on the ground in the centre while the men of the party together with those from other wigwams in the neighborhood sat in a ring around Mestigoit the sorcerer s brother then brought in the charm consisting of a few small pieces of wood some arrow heads a broken knife and an iron hook which he wrapped in a piece of hide The woman next rose and walked around the hut behind the company Mestigoit and the sorcerer now dug a large hole with two pointed stakes the whole assembly singing drumming and howling meanwhile with a deafening uproar The hole made the charm wrapped in the hide was thrown into it Pierre the Apostate then brought a sword and a knife to the sorcerer who seizing them leaped into the hole and with furious gesticulation hacked and stabbed at the charm yelling with the whole force of his lungs At length he ceased displayed the knife and sword stained with blood proclaimed that he had mortally wounded his enemy and demanded if none present had heard his death cry The assembly more occupied in making noises than in listening for them gave no reply till at length two young men declared that they had heard a faint scream as if from a great distance whereat a shout of gratulation and triumph rose from all the company Le magicien tout glorieux dit que son homme est frappe qu il mourra bien tost demande si on n a point entendu ses cris tout le monde dit que non horsmis deux ieunes hommes ses parens qui disent auoir ouy des plaintes fort sourdes et comme de loing O qu ils le firent aise Se tournant vers moy il se mit a rire

ils mais c est le Manitou c est a dire le Diable qui apporte son sang pardessous la terre Relation sixteen thirty four twenty one There was a young prophet or diviner in one of the neighboring huts of whom the sorcerer took counsel as to the prospect of his restoration to health The divining lodge was formed in this instance of five or six upright posts planted in a circle and covered with a blanket The prophet ensconced himself within and after a long interval of singing the spirits declared their presence by their usual squeaking utterances from the recesses of the mystic tabernacle Their responses were not unfavorable and the sorcerer drew much consolation from the invocations of his brother impostor See Introduction Also Pioneers of France three hundred fifteen Besides his incessant endeavors to annoy Le Jeune the sorcerer now and then tried to frighten him On one occasion when a period of starvation had been followed by a successful hunt the whole party assembled for one of the gluttonous feasts usual with them at such times While the guests sat expectant and the squaws were about to ladle out the banquet the sorcerer suddenly leaped up exclaiming that he had lost his senses and that knives and hatchets must be kept out of his way as he had a mind to kill somebody Then rolling his eyes towards Le Jeune he began a series of frantic gestures and outcries then stopped abruptly and stared into vacancy silent and motionless then resumed his former clamor raged in and out of the hut and seizing some of its supporting poles broke them as if in an uncontrollable frenzy The missionary though alarmed sat reading his breviary as before When however on the next morning the sorcerer began again to play the maniac the thought occurred to him that some stroke of fever might in truth have touched his brain Accordingly he approached him and felt his pulse which he found in his own words as cool as a fish The pretended madman looked at him with astonishment and giving over the attempt to frighten him presently returned to his senses The Indians it is well known ascribe mysterious and supernatural powers to the insane and respect them accordingly The Neutral Nation see Introduction The Huron Iroquois Family p xliv was full of pretended madmen who raved about the villages throwing firebrands and making other displays of frenzy Le Jeune robbed of his sleep by the ceaseless thumping of the sorcerer s drum and the monotonous cadence of his medicine songs improved the time in attempts to convert him I began he says by evincing a great love for him and by praises which I threw to him as a bait whereby I might catch him in the net of truth one But the Indian though pleased with the Father s flatteries was neither caught nor conciliated Ie commencay par vn temoignage de grand amour en son endroit et par des louanges que ie luy iettay comme vne amorce pour le prendre dans les filets de la verite Ie luy fis entendre que si vn esprit capable des choses grandes comme le sien cognoissoit Dieu que tous les Sauuages induis par son exemple le voudroient aussi cognoistre Relation sixteen thirty four seventy one Nowhere was his magic in more requisition than in procuring a successful chase to the hunters a point of vital interest since on it hung the lives of the whole party They often however returned empty handed and for one two or three successive days no other food could be had than the bark of trees or scraps of leather So long as tobacco lasted they found solace in their pipes which seldom left their lips Unhappy infidels writes Le Jeune who spend their lives in smoke and their eternity in flames As Christmas approached their condition grew desperate Beavers and porcupines were scarce and the snow was not deep enough for hunting the moose Night and day the medicine drums and medicine songs resounded from the wigwams mingled with the wail of starving children The hunters grew weak and emaciated and as after a forlorn march the wanderers encamped once more in the lifeless forest the priest remembered that it was the eve of Christmas The Lord gave us for our supper a porcupine large as a sucking pig and also a rabbit It was not much it is true for eighteen or nineteen persons but the Holy Virgin and saint Joseph her glorious spouse were not so well treated on this very day in the stable of Bethlehem Pour nostre souper N S nous donna vn Porc espic gros comme vn cochon de lait et vn lieure c estoit peu pour dix huit ou vingt personnes que nous estions il est vray mais la saincte Vierge et son glorieux Espoux sainct Ioseph ne furent pas si bien traictez a mesme iour dans l estable de Bethleem Relation sixteen thirty four seventy four On Christmas Day the despairing hunters again unsuccessful came to pray succor from Le Jeune Even the Apostate had become tractable and the famished sorcerer was ready to try the efficacy of an appeal to the deity of his rival A bright hope possessed the missionary He composed two prayers which with the aid of the repentant Pierre he translated into Algonquin Then he hung against the side of the hut a napkin which he had brought with him and against the napkin a crucifix and a reliquary and this done caused all the Indians to kneel before them with hands raised and clasped He now read one of the prayers and required the Indians to repeat the other after him promising to renounce their superstitions and obey Christ whose image they saw before them if he would give them food and save them from perishing The pledge given he dismissed the hunters with a benediction At night they returned with game enough to relieve the immediate necessity All was hilarity The kettles were slung and the feasters assembled Le Jeune rose to speak when Pierre who having killed nothing was in ill humor said with a laugh that the crucifix and the prayer had nothing to do with their good luck while the sorcerer his jealousy reviving as he saw his hunger about to be appeased called out to the missionary Hold your tongue You have no sense As usual all took their cue from him They fell to their repast with ravenous jubilation and the disappointed priest sat dejected and silent Repeatedly before the spring they were thus threatened with starvation Nor was their case exceptional It was the ordinary winter life of all those Northern tribes who did not till the soil but lived by hunting and fishing alone The desertion or the killing of the aged sick and disabled occasional cannibalism and frequent death from famine were natural incidents of an existence which during half the year was but a desperate pursuit of the mere necessaries of life under the worst conditions of hardship suffering and debasement At the beginning of April after roaming for five months among forests and mountains the party made their last march regained the bank of the saint Lawrence and waded to the island where they had hidden their canoes Le Jeune was exhausted and sick and Mestigoit offered to carry him in his canoe to Quebec This Indian was by far the best of the three brothers and both Pierre and the sorcerer looked to him for support He was strong active and daring a skilful hunter and a dexterous canoeman Le Jeune gladly accepted his offer embarked with him and Pierre on the dreary and tempestuous river and after a voyage full of hardship during which the canoe narrowly escaped being ground to atoms among the floating ice landed on the Island of Orleans six miles from Quebec The afternoon was stormy and dark and the river was covered with ice sweeping by with the tide They were forced to encamp At midnight the moon had risen the river was comparatively unencumbered and they embarked once more The wind increased and the waves tossed furiously Nothing saved them but the skill and courage of Mestigoit At length they could see the rock of Quebec towering through the gloom but piles of ice lined the shore while floating masses were drifting down on the angry current The Indian watched his moment shot his canoe through them gained the fixed ice leaped out and shouted to his companions to follow Pierre scrambled up but the ice was six feet out of the water and Le Jeune s agility failed him He saved himself by clutching the ankle of Mestigoit by whose aid he gained a firm foothold at the top and for a moment the three voyagers aghast at the narrowness of their escape stood gazing at each other in silence It was three o clock in the morning when Le Jeune knocked at the door of his rude little convent on the saint Charles and the Fathers springing in joyful haste from their slumbers embraced their long absent Superior with ejaculations of praise and benediction CHAPTER V sixteen thirty three sixteen thirty four THE HURON MISSION PLANS OF CONVERSION AIMS AND MOTIVES INDIAN DIPLOMACY HURONS AT QUEBEC COUNCILS THE JESUIT CHAPEL LE BORGNE THE JESUITS THWARTED THEIR PERSEVERANCE THE JOURNEY TO THE HURONS JEAN DE BREBEUF THE MISSION BEGUN Le Jeune had learned the difficulties of the Algonquin mission To imagine that he recoiled or faltered would be an injustice to his Order but on two points he had gained convictions first that little progress could be made in converting these wandering hordes till they could be settled in fixed abodes and secondly that their scanty numbers their geographical position and their slight influence in the politics of the wilderness offered no flattering promise that their conversion would be fruitful in further triumphs of the Faith It was to another quarter that the Jesuits looked most earnestly By the vast lakes of the West dwelt numerous stationary populations and particularly the Hurons on the lake which bears their name Here was a hopeful basis of indefinite conquests for the Hurons won over the Faith would spread in wider and wider circles embracing one by one the kindred tribes the Tobacco Nation the Neutrals the Eries and the Andastes Nay in His own time God might lead into His fold even the potent and ferocious Iroquois The way was pathless and long by rock and torrent and the gloom of savage forests The goal was more dreary yet Toil hardship famine filth sickness solitude insult all that is most revolting to men nurtured among arts and letters all that is most terrific to monastic credulity such were the promise and the reality of the Huron mission In the eyes of the Jesuits the Huron country was the innermost stronghold of Satan his castle and his donjon keep Une des principales forteresses comme un donjon des Demons Lalemant Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty nine one hundred Cramoisy All the weapons of his malice were prepared against the bold invader who should assail him in this the heart of his ancient domain Far from shrinking the priest s zeal rose to tenfold ardor He signed the cross invoked saint Ignatius saint Francis Xavier or saint Francis Borgia kissed his reliquary said nine masses to the Virgin and stood prompt to battle with all the hosts of Hell A life sequestered from social intercourse and remote from every prize which ambition holds worth the pursuit or a lonely death under forms perhaps the most appalling these were the missionaries alternatives Their maligners may taunt them if they will with credulity superstition or a blind enthusiasm but slander itself cannot accuse them of hypocrisy or ambition Doubtless in their propagandism they were acting in concurrence with a mundane policy but for the present at least this policy was rational and humane They were promoting the ends of commerce and national expansion The foundations of French dominion were to be laid deep in the heart and conscience of the savage His stubborn neck was to be subdued to the yoke of the Faith The power of the priest established that of the temporal ruler was secure These sanguinary hordes weaned from intestine strife were to unite in a common allegiance to God and the King Mingled with French traders and French settlers softened by French manners guided by French priests ruled by French officers their now divided bands would become the constituents of a vast wilderness empire which in time might span the continent Spanish civilization crushed the Indian English civilization scorned and neglected him French civilization embraced and cherished him Policy and commerce then built their hopes on the priests These commissioned interpreters of the Divine Will accredited with letters patent from Heaven and affiliated to God s anointed on earth would have pushed to its most unqualified application the Scripture metaphor of the shepherd and the sheep They would have tamed the wild man of the woods to a condition of obedience unquestioning passive and absolute repugnant to manhood and adverse to the invigorating and expansive spirit of modern civilization Yet full of error and full of danger as was their system they embraced its serene and smiling falsehoods with the sincerity of martyrs and the self devotion of saints We have spoken already of the Hurons of their populous villages on the borders of the great Fresh Sea their trade their rude agriculture their social life their wild and incongruous superstitions and the sorcerers diviners and medicine men who lived on their credulity See Introduction Iroquois hostility left open but one avenue to their country the long and circuitous route which eighteen years before had been explored by Champlain Pioneers of France three hundred sixty four up the river Ottawa across Lake Nipissing down French River and along the shores of the great Georgian Bay of Lake Huron a route as difficult as it was tedious Midway on Allumette Island in the Ottawa dwelt the Algonquin tribe visited by Champlain in sixteen thirteen and who amazed at the apparition of the white stranger thought that he had fallen from the clouds Pioneers of France three hundred forty eight Like other tribes of this region they were keen traders and would gladly have secured for themselves the benefits of an intermediate traffic between the Hurons and the French receiving the furs of the former in barter at a low rate and exchanging them with the latter at their full value From their position they could at any time close the passage of the Ottawa but as this would have been a perilous exercise of their rights one they were forced to act with discretion An opportunity for the practice of their diplomacy had lately occurred On or near the Ottawa at some distance below them dwelt a small Algonquin tribe called La Petite Nation One of this people had lately killed a Frenchman and the murderer was now in the hands of Champlain a prisoner at the fort of Quebec The savage politicians of Allumette Island contrived as will soon be seen to turn this incident to profit one Nevertheless the Hurons always passed this way as a matter of favor and gave yearly presents to the Algonquins of the island in acknowledgment of the privilege Le Jeune Relation sixteen thirty six seventy By the unwritten laws of the Hurons and Algonquins every tribe had the right even in full peace of prohibiting the passage of every other tribe across its territory In ordinary cases such prohibitions were quietly submitted to Ces Insulaires voudraient bien que les Hurons ne vinssent point aux Francois que les Francois n allassent point aux Hurons afin d emporter

before me See also Pioneers of France three hundred forty seven In the July that preceded Le Jeune s wintering with the Montagnais a Huron Indian well known to the French came to Quebec with the tidings that the annual canoe fleet of his countrymen was descending the saint Lawrence On the twenty eighth the river was alive with them A hundred and forty canoes with six or seven hundred savages landed at the warehouses beneath the fortified rock of Quebec and set up their huts and camp sheds on the strand now covered by the lower town The greater number brought furs and tobacco for the trade others came as sight seers others to gamble and others to steal one accomplishments in which the Hurons were proficient their gambling skill being exercised chiefly against each other and their thieving talents against those of other nations one Quelques vns d entre eux ne viennent a la traite auec les Francois que pour iouer d autres pour voir quelques vns pour derober et les plus sages et les plus riches pour trafiquer Le Jeune Relation sixteen thirty three thirty four The routine of these annual visits was nearly uniform On the first day the Indians built their huts on the second they held their council with the French officers at the fort on the third and fourth they bartered their furs and tobacco for kettles hatchets knives cloth beads iron arrow heads coats shirts and other commodities on the fifth they were feasted by the French and at daybreak of the next morning they embarked and vanished like a flight of birds Comme une volee d oiseaux Le Jeune Relation sixteen thirty three one hundred ninety Cramoisy The tobacco brought to the French by the Hurons may have been raised by the adjacent tribe of the Tionnontates who cultivated it largely for sale See Introduction On the second day then the long file of chiefs and warriors mounted the pathway to the fort tall well moulded figures robed in the skins of the beaver and the bear each wild visage glowing with paint and glistening with the oil which the Hurons extracted from the seeds of the sunflower The lank black hair of one streamed loose upon his shoulders that of another was close shaven except an upright ridge which bristling like the crest of a dragoon s helmet crossed the crown from the forehead to the neck while that of a third hung long and flowing from one side but on the other was cut short Sixty chiefs and principal men with a crowd of younger warriors formed their council circle in the fort those of each village grouped together and all seated on the ground with a gravity of bearing sufficiently curious to those who had seen the same men in the domestic circle of their lodge fires Here too were the Jesuits robed in black anxious and intent and here was Champlain who as he surveyed the throng recognized among the elder warriors not a few of those who eighteen years before had been his companions in arms on his hapless foray against the Iroquois See Pioneers of France three hundred seventy Their harangues of compliment being made and answered and the inevitable presents given and received Champlain introduced to the silent conclave the three missionaries Brebeuf Daniel and Davost To their lot had fallen the honors dangers and woes of the Huron mission These are our fathers he said We love them more than we love ourselves The whole French nation honors them They do not go among you for your furs They have left their friends and their country to show you the way to heaven If you love the French as you say you love them then love and honor these our fathers Le Jeune Relation sixteen thirty three two hundred seventy four Cramoisy Mercure Francais sixteen thirty four eight hundred forty five Two chiefs rose to reply and each lavished all his rhetoric in praises of Champlain and of the French Brebeuf rose next and spoke in broken Huron the assembly jerking in unison from the bottom of their throats repeated ejaculations of applause Then they surrounded him and vied with each other for the honor of carrying him in their canoes In short the mission was accepted and the chiefs of the different villages disputed among themselves the privilege of receiving and entertaining the three priests On the last of July the day of the feast of saint Ignatius Champlain and several masters of trading vessels went to the house of the Jesuits in quest of indulgences and here they were soon beset by a crowd of curious Indians who had finished their traffic and were making a tour of observation Being excluded from the house they looked in at the windows of the room which served as a chapel and Champlain amused at their exclamations of wonder gave one of them a piece of citron The Huron tasted it and enraptured demanded what it was Champlain replied laughing that it was the rind of a French pumpkin The fame of this delectable production was instantly spread abroad and at every window eager voices and outstretched hands petitioned for a share of the marvellous vegetable They were at length allowed to enter the chapel which had lately been decorated with a few hangings images and pieces of plate These unwonted splendors filled them with admiration They asked if the dove over the altar was the bird that makes the thunder and pointing to the images of Loyola and Xavier inquired if they were okies or spirits nor was their perplexity much diminished by Brebeuf s explanation of their true character Three images of the Virgin next engaged their attention and in answer to their questions they were told that they were the mother of Him who made the world This greatly amused them and they demanded if he had three mothers Oh exclaims the Father Superior had we but images of all the holy mysteries of our faith They are a great assistance for they speak their own lesson Relation sixteen thirty three thirty eight The mission was not doomed long to suffer from a dearth of these inestimable auxiliaries The eve of departure came The three priests packed their baggage and Champlain paid their passage or in other words made presents to the Indians who were to carry them in their canoes They lodged that night in the storehouse of the fur company around which the Hurons were encamped and Le Jeune and De Noue stayed with them to bid them farewell in the morning At eleven at night they were roused by a loud voice in the Indian camp and saw Le Borgne the one eyed chief of Allumette Island walking round among the huts haranguing as he went Brebeuf listening caught the import of his words We have begged the French captain to spare the life of the Algonquin of the Petite Nation whom he keeps in prison but he will not listen to us The prisoner will die Then his people will revenge him They will try to kill the three black robes whom you are about to carry to your country If you do not defend them the French will be angry and charge you with their death But if you do then the Algonquins will make war on you and the river will be closed If the French captain will not let the prisoner go then leave the three black robes where they are for if you take them with you they will bring you to trouble Such was the substance of Le Borgne s harangue The anxious priests hastened up to the fort gained admittance and roused Champlain from his slumbers He sent his interpreter with a message to the Hurons that he wished to speak to them before their departure and accordingly in the morning an Indian crier proclaimed through their camp that none should embark till the next day Champlain convoked the chiefs and tried persuasion promises and threats but Le Borgne had been busy among them with his intrigues and now he declared in the council that unless the prisoner were released the missionaries would be murdered on their way and war would ensue The politic savage had two objects in view On the one hand he wished to interrupt the direct intercourse between the French and the Hurons and on the other he thought to gain credit and influence with the nation of the prisoner by effecting his release His first point was won Champlain would not give up the murderer knowing those with whom he was dealing too well to take a course which would have proclaimed the killing of a Frenchman a venial offence The Hurons thereupon refused to carry the missionaries to their country coupling the refusal with many regrets and many protestations of love partly no doubt sincere for the Jesuits had contrived to gain no little favor in their eyes The council broke up the Hurons embarked and the priests returned to their convent Here under the guidance of Brebeuf they employed themselves amid their other avocations in studying the Huron tongue A year passed and again the Indian traders descended from their villages In the meanwhile grievous calamities had befallen the nation They had suffered deplorable reverses at the hands of the Iroquois while a pestilence similar to that which a few years before had swept off the native populations of New England had begun its ravages among them They appeared at Three Rivers this year the place of trade in small numbers and in a miserable state of dejection and alarm Du Plessis Bochart commander of the French fleet called them to a council harangued them feasted them and made them presents but they refused to take the Jesuits In private however some of them were gained over then again refused then at the eleventh hour a second time consented On the eve of embarkation they once more wavered All was confusion doubt and uncertainty when Brebeuf bethought him of a vow to saint Joseph The vow was made At once he says the Indians became tractable the Fathers embarked and amid salvos of cannon from the ships set forth for the wild scene of their apostleship They reckoned the distance at nine hundred miles but distance was the least repellent feature of this most arduous journey Barefoot lest their shoes should injure the frail vessel each crouched in his canoe toiling with unpractised hands to propel it Before him week after week he saw the same lank unkempt hair the same tawny shoulders and long naked arms ceaselessly plying the paddle The canoes were soon separated and for more than a month the Frenchmen rarely or never met Brebeuf spoke a little Huron and could converse with his escort but Daniel and Davost were doomed to a silence unbroken save by the occasional unintelligible complaints and menaces of the Indians of whom many were sick with the epidemic and all were terrified desponding and sullen Their only food was a pittance of Indian corn crushed between two stones and mixed with water The toil was extreme Brebeuf counted thirty five portages where the canoes were lifted from the water and carried on the shoulders of the voyagers around rapids or cataracts More than fifty times besides they were forced to wade in the raging current pushing up their empty barks or dragging them with ropes Brebeuf tried to do his part but the boulders and sharp rocks wounded his naked feet and compelled him to desist He and his companions bore their share of the baggage across the portages sometimes a distance of several miles Four trips at the least were required to convey the whole The way was through the dense forest incumbered with rocks and logs tangled with roots and underbrush damp with perpetual shade and redolent of decayed leaves and mouldering wood one The Indians themselves were often spent with fatigue Brebeuf a man of iron frame and a nature unconquerably resolute doubted if his strength would sustain him to the journey s end He complains that he had no moment to read his breviary except by the moonlight or the fire when stretched out to sleep on a bare rock by some savage cataract of the Ottawa or in a damp nook of the adjacent forest one Adioustez a ces difficultez qu il faut coucher sur la terre nue ou sur quelque dure roche faute

as well as several of their countrymen who accompanied them suffered more or less at the hands of their ill humored conductors one Davost s Indian robbed him of a part of his baggage threw a part into the river including most of the books and writing materials of the three priests and then left him behind among the Algonquins of Allumette Island He found means to continue the journey and at length reached the Huron towns in a lamentable state of bodily prostration Daniel too was deserted but fortunately found another party who received him into their canoe A young Frenchman named Martin was abandoned among the Nipissings another named Baron on reaching the Huron country was robbed by his conductors of all he had except the weapons in his hands Of these he made good use compelling the robbers to restore a part of their plunder one En ce voyage il nous a fallu tous commencer par ces experiences a porter la Croix que Nostre Seigneur nous presente pour son honneur et pour le salut de

Jesuits of Paris called Instruction pour les Peres de nostre Compagnie qui seront enuoiez aux Hurons and containing directions for their conduct on this route by the Ottawa It is highly characteristic both of the missionaries and of the Indians Some of the points are in substance as follows You should love the Indians like brothers with whom you are to spend the rest of your life Never make them wait for you in embarking Take a flint and steel to light their pipes and kindle their fire at night for these little services win their hearts Try to eat their sagamite as they cook it bad and dirty as it is Fasten up the skirts of your cassock that you may not carry water or sand into the canoe Wear no shoes or stockings in the canoe but you may put them on in crossing the portages Do not make yourself troublesome even to a single Indian Do not ask them too many questions Bear their faults in silence and appear always cheerful Buy fish for them from the tribes you will pass and for this purpose take with you some awls beads knives and fish hooks Be not ceremonious with the Indians take at once what they offer you ceremony offends them Be very careful when in the canoe that the brim of your hat does not annoy them Perhaps it would be better to wear your night cap There is no such thing as impropriety among Indians Remember that it is Christ and his cross that you are seeking and if you aim at anything else you will get nothing but affliction for body and mind Descending French River and following the lonely shores of the great Georgian Bay the canoe which carried Brebeuf at length neared its destination thirty days after leaving Three Rivers Before him stretched in savage slumber lay the forest shore of the Hurons Did his spirit sink as he approached his dreary home oppressed with a dark foreboding of what the future should bring forth There is some reason to think so Yet it was but the shadow of a moment for his masculine heart had lost the sense of fear and his intrepid nature was fired with a zeal before which doubts and uncertainties fled like the mists of the morning Not the grim enthusiasm of negation tearing up the weeds of rooted falsehood or with bold hand felling to the earth the baneful growth of overshadowing abuses his was the ancient faith uncurtailed redeemed from the decay of centuries kindled with a new life and stimulated to a preternatural growth and fruitfulness Brebeuf and his Huron companions having landed the Indians throwing the missionary s baggage on the ground left him to his own resources and without heeding his remonstrances set forth for their respective villages some twenty miles distant Thus abandoned the priest kneeled not to implore succor in his perplexity but to offer thanks to the Providence which had shielded him thus far Then rising he pondered as to what course he should take He knew the spot well It was on the borders of the small inlet called Thunder Bay In the neighboring Huron town of Toanche he had lived three years preaching and baptizing one but Toanche had now ceased to exist Here Etienne Brule Champlain s adventurous interpreter had recently been murdered by the inhabitants who in excitement and alarm dreading the consequences of their deed had deserted the spot and built at the distance of a few miles a new town called Ihonatiria Concerning Brule see Pioneers of France three hundred seventy seven three hundred eighty Brebeuf hid his baggage in the woods including the vessels for the Mass more precious than all the rest and began his search for this new abode He passed the burnt remains of Toanche saw the charred poles that had formed the frame of his little chapel of bark and found as he thought the spot where Brule had fallen two Evening was near when after following bewildered and anxious a gloomy forest path he issued upon a wild clearing and saw before him the bark roofs of Ihonatiria one From sixteen twenty six to sixteen twenty nine There is no record of the events of this first mission which was ended with the English occupation of Quebec Brebeuf had previously spent the winter of sixteen twenty five twenty six among the Algonquins like Le Jeune in sixteen thirty three thirty four Lettre du P Charles Lalemant au T R P Mutio Vitelleschi one Aug sixteen twenty six in Carayon two Ie vis pareillement l endroit ou le pauure Estienne Brule

again they cried recognizing in the distance the stately figure robed in black that advanced from the border of the forest They led him to the town and the whole population swarmed about him After a short rest he set out with a number of young Indians in quest of his baggage returning with it at one o clock in the morning There was a certain Awandoay in the village noted as one of the richest and most hospitable of the Hurons a distinction not easily won where hospitality was universal His house was large and amply stored with beans and corn and though his prosperity had excited the jealousy of the villagers he had recovered their good will by his generosity With him Brebeuf made his abode anxiously waiting week after week the arrival of his companions One by one they appeared Daniel weary and worn Davost half dead with famine and fatigue and their French attendants each with his tale of hardship and indignity At length all were assembled under the roof of the hospitable Indian and once more the Huron mission was begun CHAPTER VI sixteen thirty four sixteen thirty five BREBEUF AND HIS ASSOCIATES THE HURON MISSION HOUSE ITS INMATES ITS FURNITURE ITS GUESTS THE JESUIT AS A TEACHER AS AN ENGINEER BAPTISMS HURON VILLAGE LIFE FESTIVITIES AND SORCERIES THE DREAM FEAST THE PRIESTS ACCUSED OF MAGIC THE DROUGHT AND THE RED CROSS Where should the Fathers make their abode Their first thought had been to establish themselves at a place called by the French Rochelle the largest and most important town of the Huron confederacy but Brebeuf now resolved to remain at Ihonatiria Here he was well known and here too he flattered himself seeds of the Faith had been planted which with good nurture would in time yield fruit By the ancient Huron custom when a man or a family wanted a house the whole village joined in building one In the present case not Ihonatiria only but the neighboring town of Wenrio also took part in the work though not without the expectation of such gifts as the priests had to bestow Before October the task was finished The house was constructed after the Huron model See Introduction It was thirty six feet long and about twenty feet wide framed with strong sapling poles planted in the earth to form the sides with the ends bent into an arch for the roof the whole lashed firmly together braced with cross poles and closely covered with overlapping sheets of bark Without the structure was strictly Indian but within the priests with the aid of their tools made innovations which were the astonishment of all the country They divided their dwelling by transverse partitions into three apartments each with its wooden door a wondrous novelty in the eyes of their visitors The first served as a hall an anteroom and a place of storage for corn beans and dried fish The second the largest of the three was at once kitchen workshop dining room drawing room school room and bed chamber The third was the chapel Here they made their altar and here were their images pictures and sacred vessels Their fire was on the ground in the middle of the second apartment the smoke escaping by a hole in the roof At the sides were placed two wide platforms after the Huron fashion four feet from the earthen floor On these were chests in which they kept their clothing and vestments and beneath them they slept reclining on sheets of bark and covered with skins and the garments they wore by day Rude stools a hand mill a large Indian mortar of wood for crushing corn and a clock completed the furniture of the room There was no lack of visitors for the house of the black robes contained marvels one the fame of which was noised abroad to the uttermost confines of the Huron nation Chief among them was the clock The guests would sit in expectant silence by the hour squatted on the ground waiting to hear it strike They thought it was alive and asked what it ate As the last stroke sounded one of the Frenchmen would cry Stop and to the admiration of the company the obedient clock was silent The mill was another wonder and they were never tired of turning it Besides these there was a prism and a magnet also a magnifying glass wherein a flea was transformed to a frightful monster and a multiplying lens which showed them the same object eleven times repeated All this says Brebeuf serves to gain their affection and make them more docile in respect to the admirable and incomprehensible mysteries of our Faith for the opinion they have of our genius and capacity makes them believe whatever we tell them Brebeuf Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty six thirty three one Ils ont pense qu elle entendoit principalement quand pour rire quelqu vn de nos Francois s escrioit au dernier coup de marteau c est assez sonne et que tout aussi tost elle

frequent question for by this title of honor they designated the clock When he strikes twelve times he says Hang on the kettle and when he strikes four times he says Get up and go home Both interpretations were well remembered At noon visitors were never wanting to share the Fathers sagamite but at the stroke of four all rose and departed leaving the missionaries for a time in peace Now the door was barred and gathering around the fire they discussed the prospects of the mission compared their several experiences and took counsel for the future But the standing topic of their evening talk was the Huron language Concerning this each had some new discovery to relate some new suggestion to offer and in the task of analyzing its construction and deducing its hidden laws these intelligent and highly cultivated minds found a congenial employment Lalemant Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty nine seventeen Cramoisy But while zealously laboring to perfect their knowledge of the language they spared no pains to turn their present acquirements to account Was man woman or child sick or suffering they were always at hand with assistance and relief adding as they saw opportunity explanations of Christian doctrine pictures of Heaven and Hell and exhortations to embrace the Faith Their friendly offices did not cease here but included matters widely different The Hurons lived in constant fear of the Iroquois At times the whole village population would fly to the woods for concealment or take refuge in one of the neighboring fortified towns on the rumor of an approaching war party The Jesuits promised them the aid of the four Frenchmen armed with arquebuses who had come with them from Three Rivers They advised the Hurons to make their palisade forts not as hitherto in a circular form but rectangular with small flanking towers at the corners for the arquebuse men The Indians at once saw the value of the advice and soon after began to act on it in the case of their great town of Ossossane or Rochelle Brebeuf Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty six eighty six At every opportunity the missionaries gathered together the children of the village at their house On these occasions Brebeuf for greater solemnity put on a surplice and the close angular cap worn by Jesuits in their convents First he chanted the Pater Noster translated by Father Daniel into Huron rhymes the children chanting in their turn Next he taught them the sign of the cross made them repeat the Ave the Credo and the Commandments questioned them as to past instructions gave them briefly a few new ones and dismissed them with a present of two or three beads raisins or prunes A great emulation was kindled among this small fry of heathendom The priests with amusement and delight saw them gathered in groups about the village vying with each other in making the sign of the cross or in repeating the rhymes they had learned At times the elders of the people the repositories of its ancient traditions were induced to assemble at the house of the Jesuits who explained to them the principal points of their doctrine and invited them to a discussion The auditors proved pliant to a fault responding Good or That is true to every proposition but when urged to adopt the faith which so readily met their approval they had always the same reply It is good for the French but we are another people with different customs On one occasion Brebeuf appeared before the chiefs and elders at a solemn national council described Heaven and Hell with images suited to their comprehension asked to which they preferred to go after death and then in accordance with the invariable Huron custom in affairs of importance presented a large and valuable belt of wampum as an invitation to take the path to Paradise Brebeuf Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty six eighty one For the use of wampum belts see Introduction Notwithstanding all their exhortations the Jesuits for the present baptized but few Indeed during the first year or more they baptized no adults except those apparently at the point of death for with excellent reason they feared backsliding and recantation They found especial pleasure in the baptism of dying infants rescuing them from the flames of perdition and changing them to borrow Le Jeune s phrase from little Indians into little angels Le seiziesme du mesme mois deux petits Sauvages furent changes en deux petits Anges Relation sixteen thirty six eighty nine Cramoisy O mon cher frere vous pourrois je expliquer quelle consolation ce m etoit quand je voyois un pauure

beyond heretic appreciation La joye qu on a quand on a baptise un Sauvage qui se meurt peu apres qui s envole droit au Ciel pour devenir un Ange certainement c est un joye qui surpasse tout ce qu on se peut imaginer Le Jeune Relation sixteen thirty five two hundred twenty one Cramoisy The Fathers slumbers were brief and broken Winter was the season of Huron festivity and as they lay stretched on their hard couch suffocating with smoke and tormented by an inevitable multitude of fleas the thumping of the drum resounded all night long from a neighboring house mingled with the sound of the tortoise shell rattle the stamping of moccasined feet and the cadence of voices keeping time with the dancers Again some ambitious villager would give a feast and invite all the warriors of the neighboring towns or some grand wager of gambling with its attendant drumming singing and outcries filled the night with discord But these were light annoyances compared with the insane rites to cure the sick prescribed by the medicine men or ordained by the eccentric inspiration of dreams In one case a young sorcerer by alternate gorging and fasting both in the interest of his profession joined with excessive exertion in singing to the spirits contracted a disorder of the brain which caused him in mid winter to run naked about the village howling like a wolf The whole population bestirred itself to effect a cure The patient had or pretended to have a dream in which the conditions of his recovery were revealed to him These were equally ridiculous and difficult but the elders met in council and all the villagers lent their aid till every requisition was fulfilled and the incongruous mass of gifts which the madman s dream had demanded were all bestowed upon him This cure failing a medicine feast was tried then several dances in succession As the patient remained as crazy as before preparations were begun for a grand dance more potent than all the rest Brebeuf says that except the masquerades of the Carnival among Christians he never saw a folly equal to it Some he adds had sacks over their heads with two holes for the eyes Some were as naked as your hand with horns or feathers on their heads their bodies painted white and their faces black as devils Others were daubed with red black and white In short every one decked himself as extravagantly as he could to dance in this ballet and contribute something towards the health of the sick man Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty six one hundred sixteen This remedy also failing a crowning effort of the medical art was essayed Brebeuf does not describe it for fear as he says of being tedious but for the time the village was a pandemonium one This with other ceremonies was supposed to be ordered by a certain image like a doll which a sorcerer placed in his tobacco pouch whence it uttered its oracles at the same time moving as if alive Truly writes Brebeuf here is nonsense enough but I greatly fear there is something more dark and mysterious in it one Suffit pour le present de dire en general que iamais les Bacchantes forcenees du temps passe ne firent rien de plus furieux en leurs orgyes C est icy a s entretuer disent ils par des sorts qu ils s entreiettent dont la composition est d ongles d Ours de dents de Loup d ergots d Aigles de certaines pierres et de nerfs de Chien c est a rendre du sang par la bouche et par les narines ou plustost d vne poudre rouge qu ils prennent subtilement estans tombez sous le sort et blessez et dix mille autres sottises que ie laisse volontiers Brebeuf Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty six one hundred seventeen But all these ceremonies were outdone by the grand festival of the Ononhara or Dream Feast esteemed the most powerful remedy in cases of sickness or when a village was infested with evil spirits The time and manner of holding it were determined at a solemn council This scene of madness began at night Men women and children all pretending to have lost their senses rushed shrieking and howling from house to house upsetting everything in their way throwing firebrands beating those they met or drenching them with water and availing themselves of this time of license to take a safe revenge on any who had ever offended them This scene of frenzy continued till daybreak No corner of the village was secure from the maniac crew In the morning there was a change They ran from house to house accosting the inmates by name and demanding of each the satisfaction of some secret want revealed to the pretended madman in a dream but of the nature of which he gave no hint whatever The person addressed thereupon threw to him at random any article at hand as a hatchet a kettle or a pipe and the applicant continued his rounds till the desired gift was hit upon when he gave an outcry of delight echoed by gratulatory cries from all present If after all his efforts he failed in obtaining the object of his dream he fell into a deep dejection convinced that some disaster was in store for him Brebeuf s account of the Dream Feast is brief The above particulars are drawn chiefly from Charlevoix Journal Historique three hundred fifty six and Sagard Voyage du Pays des Hurons two hundred eighty See also Lafitau and other early writers This ceremony was not confined to the Hurons but prevailed also among the Iroquois and doubtless other kindred tribes The Jesuit Dablon saw it in perfection at Onondaga It usually took place in February occupying about three days and was often attended with great indecencies The word ononhara means turning of the brain The approach of summer brought with it a comparative peace Many of the villagers dispersed some to their fishing some to expeditions of trade and some to distant lodges by their detached corn fields The priests availed themselves of the respite to engage in those exercises of private devotion which the rule of saint Ignatius enjoins About midsummer however their quiet was suddenly broken The crops were withering under a severe drought a calamity which the sandy nature of the soil made doubly serious The sorcerers put forth their utmost power and from the tops of the houses yelled incessant invocations to the spirits All was in vain the pitiless sky was cloudless There was thunder in the east and thunder in the west but over Ihonatiria all was serene A renowned rain maker seeing his reputation tottering under his repeated failures bethought him of accusing the Jesuits and gave out that the red color of the cross which stood before their house scared the bird of thunder and caused him to fly another way one On this a clamor arose The popular ire turned against the priests and the obnoxious cross was condemned to be hewn down Aghast at the threatened sacrilege they attempted to reason away the storm assuring the crowd that the lightning was not a bird but certain hot and fiery exhalations which being imprisoned darted this way and that trying to escape As this philosophy failed to convince the hearers the missionaries changed their line of defence one The following is the account of the nature of thunder given to Brebeuf on a former occasion by another sorcerer It is a man in the form of a turkey cock The sky is his palace and he remains in it when the air is clear When the clouds begin to grumble he descends to the earth to gather up snakes and other objects which the Indians call okies The lightning flashes whenever he opens or closes his wings If the storm is more violent than usual it is because his young are with him and aiding in the noise as well as they can Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty six one hundred fourteen The word oki is here used to denote any object endued with supernatural power A belief similar to the above exists to this day among the Dacotahs Some of the Hurons and Iroquois however held that the thunder was a giant in human form According to one story he vomited from time to time a number of snakes which falling to the earth caused the appearance of lightning You say that the red color of the cross frightens the bird of thunder Then paint the cross white and see if the thunder will come This was accordingly done but the clouds still kept aloof The Jesuits followed up their advantage Your spirits cannot help you and your sorcerers have deceived you with lies Now ask the aid of Him who made the world and perhaps He will listen to your prayers And they added that if the Indians would renounce their sins and obey the true God they would make a procession daily to implore his favor towards them There was no want of promises The processions were begun as were also nine masses to saint Joseph and as heavy rains occurred soon after the Indians conceived a high idea of the efficacy of the French medicine Nous deuons aussi beaucoup au glorieux sainct Ioseph espoux de Nostre Dame et protecteur des Hurons dont nous auons touche au doigt l assistance plusieurs fois Ce fut vne chose remarquable que le iour de sa feste et durant l Octaue les commoditez nous venoient de toutes parts Brebeuf Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty five forty one The above extract is given as one out of many illustrations of the confidence with which the priests rested on the actual and direct aid of their celestial guardians To saint Joseph in particular they find no words for their gratitude In spite of the hostility of the sorcerers and the transient commotion raised by the red cross the Jesuits had gained the confidence and good will of the Huron population Their patience their kindness their intrepidity their manifest disinterestedness the blamelessness of their lives and the tact which in the utmost fervors of their zeal never failed them had won the hearts of these wayward savages and chiefs of distant villages came to urge that they would make their abode with them Brebeuf preserves a speech made to him by one of these chiefs as a specimen of Huron eloquence Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty six one hundred twenty three As yet the results of the mission had been faint and few but the priests toiled on courageously high in hope that an abundant harvest of souls would one day reward their labors CHAPTER VII sixteen thirty six sixteen thirty seven THE FEAST OF THE DEAD HURON GRAVES PREPARATION FOR THE CEREMONY DISINTERMENT THE MOURNING THE FUNERAL MARCH THE GREAT SEPULCHRE FUNERAL GAMES ENCAMPMENT OF THE MOURNERS GIFTS HARANGUES FRENZY OF THE CROWD THE CLOSING SCENE ANOTHER RITE THE CAPTIVE IROQUOIS THE SACRIFICE Mention has been made of those great depositories of human bones found at the present day in the ancient country of the Hurons See Introduction They have been a theme of abundant speculation one yet their origin is a subject not of conjecture but of historic certainty The peculiar rites to which they owe their existence were first described at length by Brebeuf who in the summer of the year sixteen thirty six saw them at the town of Ossossane one Among those who have wondered and speculated over these remains is mister Schoolcraft A slight acquaintance with the early writers would have solved his doubts The Jesuits had long been familiar with the ordinary rites of sepulture among the Hurons the corpse placed in a crouching posture in the midst of the circle of friends and relatives the long measured wail of the mourners the speeches in praise of the dead and consolation to the living the funeral feast the gifts at the place of burial the funeral games where the young men of the village contended for prizes and the long period of mourning to those next of kin The body was usually laid on a scaffold or more rarely in the earth This however was not its final resting place At intervals of ten or twelve years each of the four nations which composed the Huron Confederacy gathered together its dead and conveyed them all to a common place of sepulture Here was celebrated the great Feast of the Dead in the eyes of the Hurons their most solemn and important ceremonial In the spring of sixteen thirty six the chiefs and elders of the Nation of the Bear the principal nation of the Confederacy and that to which Ihonatiria belonged assembled in a general council to prepare for the great solemnity There was an unwonted spirit of dissension Some causes of jealousy had arisen and three or four of the Bear villages announced their intention of holding their Feast of the Dead apart from the rest As such a procedure was thought abhorrent to every sense of propriety and duty the announcement excited an intense feeling yet Brebeuf who was present describes the debate which ensued as perfectly calm and wholly free from personal abuse or recrimination The secession however took place and each party withdrew to its villages to gather and prepare its dead The corpses were lowered from their scaffolds and lifted from their graves Their coverings were removed by certain functionaries appointed for the office and the hideous relics arranged in a row surrounded by the weeping shrieking howling concourse The spectacle was frightful Here were all the village dead of the last twelve years The priests connoisseurs in such matters regarded it as a display of mortality so edifying that they hastened to summon their French attendants to contemplate and profit by it Each family reclaimed its own and immediately addressed itself to removing what remained of flesh from the bones These after being tenderly caressed with tears and lamentations were wrapped in skins and adorned with pendent robes of fur In the belief of the mourners they were sentient and conscious A soul was thought still to reside in them one and to this notion very general among Indians is in no small degree due that extravagant attachment to the remains of their dead which may be said to mark the race one In the general belief the soul took flight after the great ceremony was ended Many thought that there were two souls one remaining with the bones while the other went to the land of spirits These relics of mortality together with the recent corpses which were allowed to remain entire but which were also wrapped carefully in furs were now carried to one of the largest houses and hung to the numerous cross poles which like rafters supported the roof Here the concourse of mourners seated themselves at a funeral feast and as the squaws of the household distributed the food a chief harangued the assembly lamenting the loss of the deceased and extolling their virtues This solemnity over the mourners began their march for Ossossane the scene of the final rite The bodies remaining entire were borne on a kind of litter while the bundles of bones were slung at the shoulders of the relatives like fagots Thus the procession slowly defiled along the forest pathways with which the country of the Hurons was everywhere intersected and as they passed beneath the dull shadow of the pines they uttered at intervals in unison a dreary wailing cry designed to imitate the voices of disembodied souls winging their way to the land of spirits and believed to have an effect peculiarly soothing to the conscious relics which each man bore When at night they stopped to rest at some village on the way the inhabitants came forth to welcome them with a grave and mournful hospitality From every town of the Nation of the Bear except the rebellious few that had seceded processions like this were converging towards Ossossane This chief town of the Hurons stood on the eastern margin of Nottawassaga Bay encompassed with a gloomy wilderness of fir and pine Thither on the urgent invitation of the chiefs the Jesuits repaired The capacious bark houses were filled to overflowing and the surrounding woods gleamed with camp fires for the processions of mourners were fast arriving and the throng was swelled by invited guests of other tribes Funeral games were in progress the young men and women practising archery and other exercises for prizes offered by the mourners in the name of their dead relatives Funeral games were not confined to the Hurons and Iroquois Perrot mentions having seen them among the Ottawas An illustrated description of them will be found in Lafitau Some of the chiefs conducted Brebeuf and his companions to the place prepared for the ceremony It was a cleared area in the forest many acres in extent In the midst was a pit about ten feet deep and thirty feet wide Around it was reared a high and strong scaffolding and on this were planted numerous upright poles with cross poles extended between for hanging the funeral gifts and the remains of the dead Meanwhile there was a long delay The Jesuits were lodged in a house where more than a hundred of these bundles of mortality were hanging from the rafters Some were mere shapeless rolls others were made up into clumsy effigies adorned with feathers beads and belts of dyed porcupine quills Amidst this throng of the living and the dead the priests spent a night which the imagination and the senses conspired to render almost insupportable At length the officiating chiefs gave the word to prepare for the ceremony The relics were taken down opened for the last time and the bones caressed and fondled by the women amid paroxysms of lamentation one Then all the processions were formed anew and each bearing its dead moved towards the area prepared for the last solemn rites As they reached the ground they defiled in order each to a spot assigned to it on the outer limits of the clearing Here the bearers of the dead laid their bundles on the ground while those who carried the funeral gifts outspread and displayed them for the admiration of the beholders Their number was immense and their value relatively very great Among them were many robes of beaver and other rich furs collected and preserved for years with a view to this festival Fires were now lighted kettles slung and around the entire circle of the clearing the scene was like a fair or caravansary This continued till three o clock in the afternoon when the gifts were repacked and the bones shouldered afresh Suddenly at a signal from the chiefs the crowd ran forward from every side towards the scaffold like soldiers to the assault of a town scaled it by rude ladders with which it was furnished and hung their relics and their gifts to the forest of poles which surmounted it Then the ladders were removed and a number of chiefs standing on the scaffold harangued the crowd below praising the dead and extolling the gifts which the relatives of the departed now bestowed in their names upon their surviving friends one I admiray la tendresse d vne femme enuers son pere et ses enfans elle est fille d vn Capitaine qui est mort

hundred thirty four During these harangues other functionaries were lining the grave throughout with rich robes of beaver skin Three large copper kettles were next placed in the middle one and then ensued a scene of hideous confusion The bodies which had been left entire were brought to the edge of the grave flung in and arranged in order at the bottom by ten or twelve Indians stationed there for the purpose amid the wildest excitement and the uproar of many hundred mingled voices two When this part of the work was done night was fast closing in The concourse bivouacked around the clearing and lighted their camp fires under the brows of the forest which hedged in the scene of the dismal solemnity Brebeuf and his companions withdrew to the village where an hour before dawn they were roused by a clamor which might have wakened the dead One of the bundles of bones tied to a pole on the scaffold had chanced to fall into the grave This accident had precipitated the closing act and perhaps increased its frenzy Guided by the unearthly din and the broad glare of flames fed with heaps of fat pine logs the priests soon reached the spot and saw what seemed in their eyes an image of Hell All around blazed countless fires and the air resounded with discordant outcries three The naked multitude on under and around the scaffold were flinging the remains of their dead discharged from their envelopments of skins pell mell into the pit where Brebeuf discerned men who as the ghastly shower fell around them arranged the bones in their places with long poles All was soon over earth logs and stones were cast upon the grave and the clamor subsided into a funereal chant so dreary and lugubrious that it seemed to the Jesuits the wail of despairing souls from the abyss of perdition

another they were widely prevalent Bartram found them among the Floridian tribes Traces of a similar practice have been observed in recent times among the Dacotahs Remains of places of sepulture evidently of kindred origin have been found in Tennessee Missouri Kentucky and Ohio Many have been discovered in several parts of New York especially near the River Niagara See Squier Aboriginal Monuments of New York This was the eastern extremity of the ancient territory of the Neuters One of these deposits is said to have contained the bones of several thousand individuals There is a large mound on Tonawanda Island said by the modern Senecas to be a Neuter burial place See Marshall Historical Sketches of the Niagara Frontier eight In Canada West they are found throughout the region once occupied by the Neuters and are frequent in the Huron district doctor Tache writes to me I have inspected sixteen bone pits in the Huron country the situation of which is indicated on the little pencil map I send you They contain from six hundred to twelve hundred skeletons each of both sexes and all ages all mixed together purposely With one exception these pits also contain pipes of stone or clay small earthen pots shells and wampum wrought of these shells copper ornaments beads of glass and other trinkets Some pits contained articles of copper of aboriginal Mexican fabric This remarkable fact together with the frequent occurrence in these graves of large conch shells of which wampum was made and which could have been procured only from the Gulf of Mexico or some part of the southern coast of the United States proves the extent of the relations of traffic by which certain articles were passed from tribe to tribe over a vast region The transmission of pipes from the famous Red Pipe Stone Quarry of the saint Peter s to tribes more than a thousand miles distant is an analogous modern instance though much less remarkable The Tache Museum at the Laval University of Quebec contains a large collection of remains from these graves In one instance the human bones are of a size that may be called gigantic In nearly every case the Huron graves contain articles of use or ornament of European workmanship From this it may be inferred that the nation itself or its practice of inhumation does not date back to a period long before the arrival of the French The Northern Algonquins had also a solemn Feast of the Dead but it was widely different from that of the Hurons See the very curious account of it by Lalemant Relation des Hurons sixteen forty two ninety four ninety five Such was the origin of one of those strange sepulchres which are the wonder and perplexity of the modern settler in the abandoned forests of the Hurons The priests were soon to witness another and a more terrible rite yet one in which they found a consolation since it signalized the saving of a soul the snatching from perdition of one of that dreaded race into whose very midst they hoped with devoted daring to bear hereafter the cross of salvation A band of Huron warriors had surprised a small party of Iroquois killed several and captured the rest One of the prisoners was led in triumph to a village where the priests then were He had suffered greatly his hands especially were frightfully lacerated Now however he was received with every mark of kindness Take courage said a chief addressing him you are among friends The best food was prepared for him and his captors vied with each other in offices of good will This pretended kindness in the treatment of a prisoner destined to the torture was not exceptional The Hurons sometimes even supplied their intended victim with a temporary wife He had been given according to Indian custom to a warrior who had lost a near relative in battle and the captive was supposed to be adopted in place of the slain His actual doom was however not for a moment in doubt The Huron received him affectionately and having seated him in his lodge addressed him in a tone of extreme kindness My nephew when I heard that you were coming I was very glad thinking that you would remain with me to take the place of him I have lost But now that I see your condition and your hands crushed and torn so that you will never use them I change my mind Therefore take courage and prepare to die tonight like a brave man The prisoner coolly asked what should be the manner of his death By fire was the reply It is well returned the Iroquois Meanwhile the sister of the slain Huron in whose place the prisoner was to have been adopted brought him a dish of food and her eyes flowing with tears placed it before him with an air of the utmost tenderness while at the same time the warrior brought him a pipe wiped the sweat from his brow and fanned him with a fan of feathers About noon he gave his farewell feast after the custom of those who knew themselves to be at the point of death All were welcome to this strange banquet and when the company were gathered the host addressed them in a loud firm voice My brothers I am about to die Do your worst to me I do not fear torture or death Some of those present seemed to have visitings of real compassion and a woman asked the priests if it would be wrong to kill him and thus save him from the fire The Jesuits had from the first lost no opportunity of accosting him while he grateful for a genuine kindness amid the cruel hypocrisy that surrounded him gave them an attentive ear till at length satisfied with his answers they baptized him His eternal bliss secure all else was as nothing and they awaited the issue with some degree of composure A crowd had gathered from all the surrounding towns and after nightfall the presiding chief harangued them exhorting them to act their parts well in the approaching sacrifice since they would be looked upon by the Sun and the God of War Areskoui see Introduction He was often regarded as identical with the Sun The semi sacrificial character of the torture in this case is also shown by the injunction que pour ceste nuict on n allast point folastrer dans les bois Le Mercier Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty seven one hundred fourteen It is needless to dwell on the scene that ensued It took place in the lodge of the great war chief Atsan Eleven fires blazed on the ground along the middle of this capacious dwelling The platforms on each side were closely packed with spectators and betwixt these and the fires the younger warriors stood in lines each bearing lighted pine knots or rolls of birch bark The heat the smoke the glare of flames the wild yells contorted visages and furious gestures of these human devils as their victim goaded by their torches bounded through the fires again and again from end to end of the house transfixed the priests with horror But when as day dawned the last spark of life had fled they consoled themselves with the faith that the tortured wretch had found his rest at last in Paradise Le Mercier s long and minute account of the torture of this prisoner is too revolting to be dwelt upon One of the most atrocious features of the scene was the alternation of raillery and ironical compliment which attended it throughout as well as the pains taken to preserve life and consciousness in the victim as long as possible Portions of his flesh were afterwards devoured CHAPTER VIII

missions of the forest More Jesuits crossed the sea to urge on the work of conversion These were no stern exiles seeking on barbarous shores an asylum for a persecuted faith Rank wealth power and royalty itself smiled on their enterprise and bade them God speed Yet withal a fervor more intense a self abnegation more complete a self devotion more constant and enduring will scarcely find its record on the page of human history Holy Mother Church linked in sordid wedlock to governments and thrones numbered among her servants a host of the worldly and the proud whose service of God was but the service of themselves and many too who in the sophistry of the human heart thought themselves true soldiers of Heaven while earthly pride interest and passion were the life springs of their zeal This mighty Church of Rome in her imposing march along the high road of history heralded as infallible and divine astounds the gazing world with prodigies of contradiction now the protector of the oppressed now the right arm of tyrants now breathing charity and love now dark with the passions of Hell now beaming with celestial truth now masked in hypocrisy and lies now a virgin now a harlot an imperial queen and a tinselled actress Clearly she is of earth not of heaven and her transcendently dramatic life is a type of the good and ill the baseness and nobleness the foulness and purity the love and hate the pride passion truth falsehood fierceness and tenderness that battle in the restless heart of man It was her nobler and purer part that gave life to the early missions of New France That gloomy wilderness those hordes of savages had nothing to tempt the ambitious the proud the grasping or the indolent Obscure toil solitude privation hardship and death were to be the missionary s portion He who set sail for the country of the Hurons left behind him the world and all its prizes True he acted under orders obedient like a soldier to the word of command but the astute Society of Jesus knew its members weighed each in the balance gave each his fitting task and when the word was passed to embark for New France it was but the response to a secret longing of the fervent heart The letters of these priests departing for the scene of their labors breathe a spirit of enthusiastic exaltation which to a colder nature and a colder faith may sometimes seem overstrained but which is in no way disproportionate to the vastness of the effort and the sacrifice demanded of them The following are passages from letters of missionaries at this time See Divers Sentimens appended to the Relation of sixteen thirty five On dit que les premiers qui fondent les Eglises d ordinaire sont saincts cette pensee m attendrit si fort le coeur que quoy que ie me voye icy fort inutile dans ceste

eyes towards the mission of the Hurons for here the largest harvest promised to repay their labor and here hardships and dangers most abounded Two Jesuits Pijart and Le Mercier had been sent thither in sixteen thirty five and in midsummer of the next year three more arrived Jogues Chatelain and Garnier When after their long and lonely journey they reached Ihonatiria one by one they were received by their brethren with scanty fare indeed but with a fervor of affectionate welcome which more than made amends for among these priests united in a community of faith and enthusiasm there was far more than the genial comradeship of men joined in a common enterprise of self devotion and peril one On their way they had met Daniel and Davost descending to Quebec to establish there a seminary of Huron children a project long cherished by Brebeuf and his companions one Ie luy preparay de ce que nous auions pour le receuoir mais quel festin vne poignee de petit poisson sec auec vn peu de farine i

six Scarcely had the new comers arrived when they were attacked by a contagious fever which turned their mission house into a hospital Jogues Garnier and Chatelain fell ill in turn and two of their domestics also were soon prostrated though the only one of the number who could hunt fortunately escaped Those who remained in health attended the sick and the sufferers vied with each other in efforts often beyond their strength to relieve their companions in misfortune Lettre de Brebeuf au T R P Mutio Vitelleschi twenty Mai sixteen thirty seven in Carayon one hundred fifty seven Le Mercier Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty seven one hundred twenty one hundred twenty three The disease in no case proved fatal but scarcely had health begun to return to their household when an unforeseen calamity demanded the exertion of all their energies The pestilence which for two years past had from time to time visited the Huron towns now returned with tenfold violence and with it soon appeared a new and fearful scourge the small pox Terror was universal The contagion increased as autumn advanced and when winter came far from ceasing as the priests had hoped its ravages were appalling The season of Huron festivity was turned to a season of mourning and such was the despondency and dismay that suicide became frequent The Jesuits singly or in pairs journeyed in the depth of winter from village to village ministering to the sick and seeking to commend their religious teachings by their efforts to relieve bodily distress Happily perhaps for their patients they had no medicine but a little senna A few raisins were left however and one or two of these with a spoonful of sweetened water were always eagerly accepted by the sufferers who thought them endowed with some mysterious and sovereign efficacy No house was left unvisited As the missionary physician at once to body and soul entered one of these smoky dens he saw the inmates their heads muffled in their robes of skins seated around the fires in silent dejection Everywhere was heard the wail of sick and dying children and on or under the platforms at the sides of the house crouched squalid men and women in all the stages of the distemper The Father approached made inquiries spoke words of kindness administered his harmless remedies or offered a bowl of broth made from game brought in by the Frenchman who hunted for the mission Game was so scarce in the Huron country that it was greatly prized as a luxury Le Mercier speaks of an Indian sixty years of age who walked twelve miles to taste the wild fowl killed by the French hunter The ordinary food was corn beans pumpkins and fish The body cared for he next addressed himself to the soul This life is short and very miserable It matters little whether we live or die The patient remained silent or grumbled his dissent The Jesuit after enlarging for a time in broken Huron on the brevity and nothingness of mortal weal or woe passed next to the joys of Heaven and the pains of Hell which he set forth with his best rhetoric His pictures of infernal fires and torturing devils were readily comprehended if the listener had consciousness enough to comprehend anything but with respect to the advantages of the French Paradise he was slow of conviction I wish to go where my relations and ancestors have gone was a common reply Heaven is a good place for Frenchmen said another but I wish to be among Indians for the French will give me nothing to eat when I get there It was scarcely possible to convince the Indians that there was but one God for themselves and the whites The proposition was met by such arguments as this If we had been of one father we should know how to make knives and coats as well as you Le Mercier Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty seven one hundred forty seven Often the patient was stolidly silent sometimes he was hopelessly perverse and contradictory Again Nature triumphed over Grace Which will you choose demanded the priest of a dying woman Heaven or Hell Hell if my children are there as you say returned the mother Do they hunt in Heaven or make war or go to feasts asked an anxious inquirer Oh no replied the Father Then returned the querist I will not go It is not good to be lazy But above all other obstacles was the dread of starvation in the regions of the blest Nor when the dying Indian had been induced at last to express a desire for Paradise was it an easy matter to bring him to a due contrition for his sins for he would deny with indignation that he had ever committed any When at length as sometimes happened all these difficulties gave way and the patient had been brought to what seemed to his instructor a fitting frame for baptism the priest with contentment at his heart brought water in a cup or in the hollow of his hand touched his forehead with the mystic drop and snatched him from an eternity of woe But the convert even after his baptism did not always manifest a satisfactory spiritual condition Why did you baptize that Iroquois asked one of the dying neophytes speaking of the prisoner recently tortured he will get to Heaven before us and when he sees us coming he will drive us out Most of the above traits are drawn from Le Mercier s report of sixteen thirty seven The rest are from Brebeuf Thus did these worthy priests too conscientious to let these unfortunates die in peace follow them with benevolent persecutions to the hour of their death It was clear to the Fathers that their ministrations were valued solely because their religion was supposed by many to be a medicine or charm efficacious against famine disease and death They themselves indeed firmly believed that saints and angels were always at hand with temporal succors for the faithful At their intercession saint Joseph had interposed to procure a happy delivery to a squaw in protracted pains of childbirth Brebeuf Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty six eighty nine Another woman was delivered on touching a relic of saint Ignatius Ibid ninety and they never doubted that in the hour of need the celestial powers would confound the unbeliever with intervention direct and manifest At the town of Wenrio the people after trying in vain all the feasts dances and preposterous ceremonies by which their medicine men sought to stop the pest resolved to essay the medicine of the French and to that end called the priests to a council What must we do that your God may take pity on us Brebeuf s answer was uncompromising Believe in Him keep His commandments abjure your faith in dreams take but one wife and be true to her give up your superstitious feasts renounce your assemblies of debauchery eat no human flesh never give feasts to demons and make a vow that if God will deliver you from this pest you will build a chapel to offer Him thanksgiving and praise Le Mercier Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty seven one hundred fourteen one hundred sixteen Cramoisy The terms were too hard They would fain bargain to be let off with building the chapel alone but Brebeuf would bate them nothing and the council broke up in despair At Ossossane a few miles distant the people in a frenzy of terror accepted the conditions and promised to renounce their superstitions and reform their manners It was a labor of Hercules a cleansing of Augean stables but the scared savages were ready to make any promise that might stay the pestilence One of their principal sorcerers proclaimed in a loud voice through the streets of the town that the God of the French was their master and that thenceforth all must live according to His will What consolation exclaims Le Mercier to see God glorified by the lips of an imp of Satan Le Mercier Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty seven one hundred twenty seven one hundred twenty eight Cramoisy Their joy was short The proclamation was on the twelfth of December On the twenty first a noted sorcerer came to Ossossane He was of a dwarfish hump backed figure most rare among this symmetrical people with a vicious face and a dress consisting of a torn and shabby robe of beaver skin Scarcely had he arrived when with ten or twelve other savages he ensconced himself in a kennel of bark made for the occasion In the midst were placed several stones heated red hot On these the sorcerer threw tobacco producing a stifling fumigation in the midst of which for a full half hour he sang at the top of his throat those boastful yet meaningless rhapsodies of which Indian magical songs are composed Then came a grand medicine feast and the disappointed Jesuits saw plainly that the objects of their spiritual care unwilling to throw away any chance of cure were bent on invoking aid from God and the Devil at once The hump backed sorcerer became a thorn in the side of the Fathers who more than half believed his own account of his origin He was he said not a man but an oki a spirit or as the priests rendered it a demon and had dwelt with other okies under the earth when the whim seized him to become a man Therefore he ascended to the upper world in company with a female spirit They hid beside a path and when they saw a woman passing they entered her womb After a time they were born but not until the male oki had quarrelled with and strangled his female companion who came dead into the world Le Mercier Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty seven seventy two Cramoisy This petit sorcier is often mentioned elsewhere The character of the sorcerer seems to have comported reasonably well with this story of his origin He pretended to have an absolute control over the pestilence and his prescriptions were scrupulously followed He had several conspicuous rivals besides a host of humbler competitors One of these magician doctors who was nearly blind made for himself a kennel at the end of his house where he fasted for seven days See Introduction On the sixth day the spirits appeared and among other revelations told him that the disease could be frightened away by means of images of straw like scarecrows placed on the tops of the houses Within forty eight hours after this announcement the roofs of Onnentisati and the neighboring villages were covered with an army of these effigies The Indians tried to persuade the Jesuits to put them on the mission house but the priests replied that the cross before their door was a better protector and for further security they set another on their roof declaring that they would rely on it to save them from infection Qu en vertu de ce signe nous ne redoutions point les demons et esperions que Dieu preserueroit nostre petite maison de cette maladie contagieuse Le Mercier Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty seven one hundred fifty The Indians on their part anxious that their scarecrows should do their office well addressed them in loud harangues and burned offerings of tobacco to them Ibid one hundred fifty seven There was another sorcerer whose medical practice was so extensive that unable to attend to all his patients he sent substitutes to the surrounding towns first imparting to them his own mysterious power One of these deputies came to Ossossane while the priests were there The principal house was thronged with expectant savages anxiously waiting his arrival A chief carried before him a kettle of mystic water with which the envoy sprinkled the company one at the same time fanning them with the wing of a wild turkey Then came a grand medicine feast followed by a medicine dance of women one The idea seems to have been taken from the holy water of the French Le Mercier says that a Huron who had been to Quebec once asked him the use of the vase of water at the door of the chapel The priest told him that it was to frighten away the devils On this he begged earnestly to have some of it Opinion was divided as to the nature of the pest but the greater number were agreed that it was a malignant oki who came from Lake Huron one As it was of the last moment to conciliate or frighten him no means to these ends were neglected Feasts were held for him at which to do him honor each guest gorged himself like a vulture A mystic fraternity danced with firebrands in their mouths while other dancers wore masks and pretended to be hump backed Tobacco was burned to the Demon of the Pest no less than to the scarecrows which were to frighten him A chief climbed to the roof of a house and shouted to the invisible monster If you want flesh go to our enemies go to the Iroquois while to add terror to persuasion the crowd in the dwelling below yelled with all the force of their lungs and beat furiously with sticks on the walls of bark one Many believed that the country was bewitched by wicked sorcerers one of whom it was said had been seen at night roaming around the villages vomiting fire Le Mercier Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty seven one hundred thirty four This superstition of sorcerers vomiting fire was common among the Iroquois of New York Others held that a sister of Etienne Brule caused the evil in revenge for the death of her brother murdered some years before She was said to have been seen flying over the country breathing forth pestilence Besides these public efforts to stay the pestilence the sufferers each for himself had their own methods of cure dictated by dreams or prescribed by established usage Thus two of the priests entering a house saw a sick man crouched in a corner while near him sat three friends Before each of these was placed a huge portion of food enough the witness declares for four and though all were gorged to suffocation with starting eyeballs and distended veins they still held staunchly to their task resolved at all costs to devour the whole in order to cure the patient who meanwhile ceased not in feeble tones to praise their exertions and implore them to persevere En fin il leur fallut rendre gorge ce qu ils firent a diuerses reprises ne laissants pas pour cela de continuer a vuider leur plat Le Mercier Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty seven one hundred forty two This beastly superstition exists in some tribes at the present day A kindred superstition once fell under the writer s notice in the case of a wounded Indian who begged of every one he met to drink a large bowl of water in order that he the Indian might be cured Turning from these eccentricities of the noble savage one to the zealots who were toiling according to their light to snatch him from the clutch of Satan we see the irrepressible Jesuits roaming from town to town in restless quest of subjects for baptism In the case of adults they thought some little preparation essential but their efforts to this end even with the aid of saint Joseph whom they constantly invoked two were not always successful and cheaply as they offered salvation they sometimes railed to find a purchaser With infants however a simple drop of water sufficed for the transfer from a prospective Hell to an assured Paradise The Indians who at first had sought baptism as a cure now began to regard it as a cause of death and when the priest entered a lodge where a sick child lay in extremity the scowling parents watched him with jealous distrust lest unawares the deadly drop should be applied The Jesuits were equal to the emergency Father Le Mercier will best tell his own story one In the midst of these absurdities we find recorded one of the best traits of the Indian character At Ihonatiria a house occupied by a family of orphan children was burned to the ground leaving the inmates destitute The villagers united to aid them Each contributed something and they were soon better provided for than before two C est nostre refuge ordinaire en semblables necessitez et d ordinaire auec tels succez que nous auons sujet d en benir Dieu a iamais qui nous fait cognoistre en cette barbarie le credit de ce S Patriarche aupres de son infinie misericorde Le Mercier Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty seven one hundred fifty three In the case of a woman at Onnentisati Dieu nous inspira de luy vouer quelques Messes en l honneur de S Joseph The effect was prompt In half an hour the woman was ready for baptism On the same page we have another subject secured to Heaven sans doute par les merites du glorieux Patriarche S Joseph On the third of May Father Pierre Pijart baptized at Anonatea a little child two months old in manifest danger of death without being seen by the parents who would not give their consent This is the device which he used Our sugar does wonders for us He pretended to make the child drink a little sugared water and at the same time dipped a finger in it As the father of the infant began to suspect something and called out to him not to baptize it he gave the spoon to a woman who was near and said to her Give it to him yourself She approached and found the child asleep and at the same time Father Pijart under pretence of seeing if he was really asleep touched his face with his wet finger and baptized him At the end of forty eight hours he went to Heaven Some days before the missionary had used the same device industrie for baptizing a little boy six or seven years old His father who was very sick had several times refused to receive baptism and when asked if he would not be glad to have his son baptized he had answered No At least said Father Pijart you will not object to my giving him a little sugar No but you must not baptize him The missionary gave it to him once then again and at the third spoonful before he had put the sugar into the water he let a drop of it fall on the child at the same time pronouncing the sacramental words A little girl who was looking at him cried out Father he is baptizing him The child s father was much disturbed but the missionary said to him Did you not see that I was giving him sugar The child died soon after but God showed His grace to the father who is now in perfect health Le Mercier Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty seven one hundred sixty five Various other cases of the kind are mentioned in the Relations That equivocal morality lashed by the withering satire of Pascal a morality built on the doctrine that all means are permissible for saving souls from perdition and that sin itself is no sin when its object is the greater glory of God found far less scope in the rude wilderness of the Hurons than among the interests ambitions and passions of civilized life Nor were these men chosen from the purest of their Order personally well fitted to illustrate the capabilities of this elastic system Yet now and then by the light of their own writings we may observe that the teachings of the school of Loyola had not been wholly without effect in the formation of their ethics But when we see them in the gloomy February of sixteen thirty seven and the gloomier months that followed toiling on foot from one infected town to another wading through the sodden snow under the bare and dripping forests drenched with incessant rains till they descried at length through the storm the clustered dwellings of some barbarous hamlet when we see them entering one after another these wretched abodes of misery and darkness and all for one sole end the baptism of the sick and dying we may smile at the futility of the object but we must needs admire the self sacrificing zeal with which it was pursued CHAPTER IX sixteen thirty seven CHARACTER OF THE CANADIAN JESUITS JEAN DE BREBEUF CHARLES GARNIER JOSEPH MARIE CHAUMONOT NOEL CHABANEL ISAAC JOGUES OTHER JESUITS NATURE OF THEIR FAITH SUPERNATURALISM VISIONS MIRACLES Before pursuing farther these obscure but noteworthy scenes in the drama of human history it will be well to indicate so far as there are means of doing so the distinctive traits of some of the chief actors Mention has often been made of Brebeuf that masculine apostle of the Faith the Ajax of the mission Nature had given him all the passions of a vigorous manhood and religion had crushed them curbed them or tamed them to do her work like a dammed up torrent sluiced and guided to grind and saw and weave for the good of man Beside him in strange contrast stands his company laborer Charles Garnier Both were of noble birth and gentle nurture but here the parallel ends Garnier s face was beardless though he was above thirty years old For this he was laughed at by his friends in Paris but admired by the Indians who thought him handsome C est pourquoi j ai bien gagne quitter la France ou vous me fesiez la guerre de n avoir point de barbe car c est ce qui me fait estimes beau des Sauvages Lettres de Garnier MSS His constitution bodily or mental was by no means robust From boyhood he had shown a delicate and sensitive nature a tender conscience and a proneness to religious emotion He had never gone with his schoolmates to inns and other places of amusement but kept his pocket money to give to beggars One of his brothers relates of him that seeing an obscene book he bought and destroyed it lest other boys should be injured by it He had always wished to be a Jesuit and after a novitiate which is described as most edifying he became a professed member of the Order The Church indeed absorbed the greater part if not the whole of this pious family one brother being a Carmelite another a Capuchin and a third a Jesuit while there seems also to have been a fourth under vows Of Charles Garnier there remain twenty four letters written at various times to his father and two of his brothers chiefly during his missionary life among the Hurons They breathe the deepest and most intense Roman Catholic piety and a spirit enthusiastic yet sad as of one renouncing all the hopes and prizes of the world and living for Heaven alone The affections of his sensitive nature severed from earthly objects found relief in an ardent adoration of the Virgin Mary With none of the bone and sinew of rugged manhood he entered not only without hesitation but with eagerness on a life which would have tried the boldest and sustained by the spirit within him he was more than equal to it His fellow missionaries thought him a saint and had he lived a century or two earlier he would perhaps have been canonized yet while all his life was a willing martyrdom one can discern amid his admirable virtues some slight lingerings of mortal vanity Thus in three several letters he speaks of his great success in baptizing and plainly intimates that he had sent more souls to Heaven than the other Jesuits The above sketch of Garnier is drawn from various sources Observations du P Henri de saint Joseph Carme sur son Frere le P Charles Garnier MS Abrege de la Vie du R Pere Charles Garnier MS This unpublished sketch bears the signature of the Jesuit Ragueneau with the date sixteen fifty two For the opportunity of consulting it I am indebted to reverend Felix Martin S J Lettres du P Charles Garnier MSS These embrace his correspondence from the Huron country and are exceedingly characteristic and striking There is another letter in Carayon Premiere Mission Garnier s family was wealthy as well as noble Its members seem to have been strongly attached to each other and the young priest s father was greatly distressed at his departure for Canada Next appears a young man of about twenty seven years Joseph Marie Chaumonot Unlike Brebeuf and Garnier he was of humble origin his father being a vine dresser and his mother the daughter of a poor village schoolmaster At an early age they sent him to Chatillon on the Seine where he lived with his uncle a priest who taught him to speak Latin and awakened his religious susceptibilities which were naturally strong This did not prevent him from yielding to the persuasions of one of his companions to run off to Beaune a town of Burgundy where the fugitives proposed to study music under the Fathers of the Oratory To provide funds for the journey he stole a sum of about the value of a dollar from his uncle the priest This act which seems to have been a mere peccadillo of boyish levity determined his future career Finding himself in total destitution at Beaune he wrote to his mother for money and received in reply an order from his father to come home Stung with the thought of being posted as a thief in his native village he resolved not to do so but to set out forthwith on a pilgrimage to Rome and accordingly tattered and penniless he took the road for the sacred city Soon a conflict began within him between his misery and the pride which forbade him to beg The pride was forced to succumb He begged from door to door slept under sheds by the wayside or in haystacks and now and then found lodging and a meal at a convent Thus sometimes alone sometimes with vagabonds whom he met on the road he made his way through Savoy and Lombardy in a pitiable condition of destitution filth and disease At length he reached Ancona when the thought occured to him of visiting the Holy House of Loretto and imploring the succor of the Virgin Mary Nor were his hopes disappointed He had reached that renowned shrine knelt paid his devotions and offered his prayer when as he issued from the door of the chapel he was accosted by a young man whom he conjectures to have been an angel descended to his relief and who was probably some penitent or devotee bent on works of charity or self mortification With a voice of the greatest kindness he proffered his aid to the wretched boy whose appearance was alike fitted to awaken pity and disgust The conquering of a natural repugnance to filth in the interest of charity and humility is a conspicuous virtue in most of the Roman Catholic saints and whatever merit may attach to it was acquired in an extraordinary degree by the young man in question Apparently he was a physician for he not only restored the miserable wanderer to a condition of comparative decency but cured him of a grievous malady the result of neglect Chaumonot went on his way thankful to his benefactor and overflowing with an enthusiasm of gratitude to Our Lady of Loretto Si la moindre dame m avoit fait rendre ce service par le dernier de ses valets n aurois je pas dus lui en rendre toutes les reconnoissances possibles Et si apres une telle charite elle s etoit offerte a me servir toujours de mesme comment aurois je du l honorer lui obeir l aimer toute ma vie Pardon Reine des Anges et des hommes pardon de ce qu apres avoir recu de vous tant de marques par lesquelles vous m avez convaincu que vous m avez adopte pour votre fils j ai eu l ingratitude pendant des annees entieres de me comporter encore plutot en esclave de Satan qu en enfant d une Mere Vierge O que vous etes bonne et charitable puisque quelques obstacles que mes peches ayent pu mettre a vos graces vous n avez jamais cesse de m attirer au bien jusque la que vous m avez fait admettre dans la Sainte Compagnie de Jesus votre fils Chaumonot Vie twenty The above is from the very curious autobiography written by Chaumonot at the command of his Superior in sixteen eighty eight The original manuscript is at the Hotel Dieu of Quebec mister Shea has printed it As he journeyed towards Rome an old burgher at whose door he had begged employed him as a servant He soon became known to a Jesuit to whom he had confessed himself in Latin and as his acquirements were considerable for his years he was eventually employed as teacher of a low class in one of the Jesuit schools Nature had inclined him to a life of devotion He would fain be a hermit and to that end practised eating green ears of wheat but finding he could not swallow them conceived that he had mistaken his vocation Then a strong desire grew up within him to become a Recollet a Capuchin or above all a Jesuit and at length the wish of his heart was answered At the age of twenty one he was admitted to the Jesuit novitiate one Soon after its close a small duodecimo volume was placed in his hands It was a Relation of the Canadian mission and contained one of those narratives of Brebeuf which have been often cited in the preceding pages Its effect was immediate Burning to share those glorious toils the young priest asked to be sent to Canada and his request was granted one His age when he left his uncle the priest is not mentioned But he must have been a mere child for at the end of his novitiate he had forgotten his native language and was forced to learn it a second time Jamais y eut il homme sur terre plus oblige que moi a la Sainte Famille de Jesus de Marie et de Joseph Marie en me guerissant de ma vilaine galle ou teigne me delivra d une infinite de peines et d incommodites corporelles que cette hideuse maladie qui me rongeoit m avoit cause Joseph m ayant obtenu la grace d etre incorpore a un corps aussi saint qu est celui des Jesuites m a preserve d une infinite de miseres spirituelles de tentations tres dangereuses et de peches tres enormes Jesus n ayant pas permis que j entrasse dans aucun autre ordre qu en celui qu il honore tout a la fois de son beau nom de sa douce presence et de sa protection speciale O Jesus O Marie O Joseph qui meritoit moins que moi vos divines faveurs et envers qui avez vous ete plus prodigue Chaumonot Vie thirty seven Before embarking he set out with the Jesuit Poncet who was also destined for Canada on a pilgrimage from Rome to the shrine of Our Lady of Loretto They journeyed on foot begging alms by the way Chaumonot was soon seized with a pain in the knee so violent that it seemed impossible to proceed At San Severino where they lodged with the Barnabites he bethought him of asking the intercession of a certain poor woman of that place who had died some time before with the reputation of sanctity Accordingly he addressed to her his prayer promising to publish her fame on every possible occasion if she would obtain his cure from God Je me recommandai a elle en lui promettant de la faire connoitre dans toutes les occasions que j en aurois jamais si elle vn obtenoit de Dieu ma guerison Chaumonot Vie forty six The intercession was accepted the offending limb became sound again and the two pilgrims pursued their journey They reached Loretto and kneeling before the Queen of Heaven implored her favor and aid while Chaumonot overflowing with devotion to this celestial mistress of his heart conceived the purpose of building in Canada a chapel to her honor after the exact model of the Holy House of Loretto They soon afterwards embarked together and arrived among the Hurons early in the autumn of sixteen thirty nine Noel Chabanel came later to the mission for he did not reach the Huron country until sixteen forty three He detested the Indian life the smoke the vermin the filthy food the impossibility of privacy He could not study by the smoky lodge fire among the noisy crowd of men and squaws with their dogs and their restless screeching children He had a natural inaptitude to learning the language and labored at it for five years with scarcely a sign of progress The Devil whispered a suggestion into his ear Let him procure his release from these barren and revolting toils and return to France where congenial and useful employments awaited him Chabanel refused to listen and when the temptation still beset him he bound himself by a solemn vow to remain in Canada to the day of his death Abrege de la Vie du Pere Noel Chabanel MS This anonymous paper bears the signature of Ragueneau in attestation of its truth See also Ragueneau Relation sixteen fifty seventeen eighteen Chabanel s vow is here given verbatim Isaac Jogues was of a character not unlike Garnier Nature had given him no especial force of intellect or constitutional energy yet the man was indomitable and irrepressible as his history will show We have but few means of characterizing the remaining priests of the mission otherwise than as their traits appear on the field of their labors Theirs was no faith of abstractions and generalities For them heaven was very near to earth touching and mingling with it at many points On high God the Father sat enthroned and nearer to human sympathies Divinity incarnate in the Son with the benign form of his immaculate mother and her spouse saint Joseph the chosen patron of New France Interceding saints and departed friends bore to the throne of grace the petitions of those yet lingering in mortal bondage and formed an ascending chain from earth to heaven These priests lived in an atmosphere of supernaturalism Every day had its miracle Divine power declared itself in action immediate and direct controlling guiding or reversing the laws of Nature The missionaries did not reject the ordinary cures for disease or wounds but they relied far more on a prayer to the Virgin a vow to saint Joseph or the promise of a neuvaine or nine days devotion to some other celestial personage while the touch of a fragment of a tooth or bone of some departed saint was of sovereign efficacy to cure sickness solace pain or relieve a suffering squaw in the throes of childbirth Once Chaumonot having a headache remembered to have heard of a sick man who regained his health by commending his case to saint Ignatius and at the same time putting a medal stamped with his image into his mouth Accordingly he tried a similar experiment putting into his mouth a medal bearing a representation of the Holy Family which was the object of his especial devotion The next morning found him cured Chaumonot Vie seventy three The relation between this world and the next was sometimes of a nature curiously intimate Thus when Chaumonot heard of Garnier s death he immediately addressed his departed colleague and promised him the benefit of all the good works which he Chaumonot might perform during the next week provided the defunct missionary would make him heir to his knowledge of the Huron tongue one And he ascribed to the deceased Garnier s influence the mastery of that language which he afterwards acquired one Je n eus pas plutot appris sa glorieuse mort que je lui promis tout ce que je ferois de bien pendant huit jours a condition qu il me feroit son heritier dans la connoissance parfaite qu il avoit du Huron Chaumonot Vie sixty one The efforts of the missionaries for the conversion of the savages were powerfully seconded from the other world and the refractory subject who was deaf to human persuasions softened before the superhuman agencies which the priest invoked to his aid As these may be supposed to be exploded ideas of the past the writer may recall an incident of his youth while spending a few days in the convent of the Passionists near the Coliseum at Rome These worthy monks after using a variety of arguments for his conversion expressed the hope that a miraculous interposition would be vouchsafed to that end and that the Virgin would manifest herself to him in a nocturnal vision To this end they gave him a small brass medal stamped with her image to be worn at his neck while they were to repeat a certain number of Aves and Paters in which he was urgently invited to join as the result of which it was hoped the Virgin would appear on the same night No vision however occurred It is scarcely necessary to add that signs and voices from another world visitations from Hell and visions from Heaven were incidents of no rare occurrence in the lives of these ardent apostles To Brebeuf whose deep nature like a furnace white hot glowed with the still intensity of his enthusiasm they were especially frequent Demons in troops appeared before him sometimes in the guise of men sometimes as bears wolves or wildcats He called on God and the apparitions vanished Death like a skeleton sometimes menaced him and once as he faced it with an unquailing eye it fell powerless at his feet A demon in the form of a woman assailed him with the temptation which beset saint Benedict among the rocks of Subiaco but Brebeuf signed the cross and the infernal siren melted into air He saw the vision of a vast and gorgeous palace and a miraculous voice assured him that such was to be the reward of those who dwelt in savage hovels for the cause of God Angels appeared to him and more than once saint Joseph and the Virgin were visibly present before his sight Once when he was among the Neutral Nation in the winter of sixteen forty he beheld the ominous apparition of a great cross slowly approaching from the quarter where lay the country of the Iroquois He told the vision to his comrades What was it like How large was it they eagerly demanded Large enough replied the priest to crucify us all one To explain such phenomena is the province of psychology and not of history Their occurrence is no matter of surprise and it would be superfluous to doubt that they were recounted in good faith and with a full belief in their reality one Quelques Remarques sur la Vie du Pere Jean de Brebeuf MS On the margin of this paper opposite several of the statements repeated above are the words signed by Ragueneau Ex ipsius autographo indicating that the statements were made in writing by Brebeuf himself Still other visions are recorded by Chaumonot as occurring to Brebeuf when they were together in the Neutral country See also the long notice of Brebeuf written by his colleague Ragueneau in the Relation of sixteen forty nine and Tanner Societas Jesu Militans five hundred thirty three In these enthusiasts we shall find striking examples of one of the morbid forces of human nature yet in candor let us do honor to what was genuine in them that principle of self abnegation which is the life of true religion and which is vital no less to the highest forms of heroism CHAPTER X sixteen thirty seven sixteen forty PERSECUTION OSSOSSANE THE NEW CHAPEL A TRIUMPH OF THE FAITH THE NETHER POWERS SIGNS OF A TEMPEST SLANDERS RAGE AGAINST THE JESUITS THEIR BOLDNESS AND PERSISTENCY NOCTURNAL COUNCIL DANGER OF THE PRIESTS BREBEUF S LETTER NARROW ESCAPES WOES AND CONSOLATIONS The town of Ossossane or Rochelle stood as we have seen on the borders of Lake Huron at the skirts of a gloomy wilderness of pine Thither in May sixteen thirty seven repaired Father Pijart to found in this one of the largest of the Huron towns the new mission of the Immaculate Conception The doctrine of the immaculate conception of the Virgin recently sanctioned by the Pope has long been a favorite tenet of the Jesuits The Indians had promised Brebeuf to build a house for the black robes and Pijart found the work in progress There were at this time about fifty dwellings in the town each containing eight or ten families The quadrangular fort already alluded to had now been completed by the Indians under the instruction of the priests Lettres de Garnier MSS It was of upright pickets ten feet high with flanking towers at two angles The new mission house was about seventy feet in length No sooner had the savage workmen secured the bark covering on its top and sides than the priests took possession and began their preparations for a notable ceremony At the farther end they made an altar and hung such decorations as they had on the rough walls of bark throughout half the length of the structure This formed their chapel On the altar was a crucifix with vessels and ornaments of shining metal while above hung several pictures among them a painting of Christ and another of the Virgin both of life size There was also a representation of the Last Judgment wherein dragons and serpents might be seen feasting on the entrails of the wicked while demons scourged them into the flames of Hell The entrance was adorned with a quantity of tinsel together with green boughs skilfully disposed Nostre Chapelle estoit extraordinairement bien ornee

sixteen thirty seven one hundred seventy five one hundred seventy six In his Relation of the next year he recurs to the subject and describes the pictures displayed on this memorable occasion Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty eight thirty three Never before were such splendors seen in the land of the Hurons Crowds gathered from afar and gazed in awe and admiration at the marvels of the sanctuary A woman came from a distant town to behold it and tremulous between curiosity and fear thrust her head into the mysterious recess declaring that she would see it though the look should cost her life Ibid sixteen thirty seven one hundred seventy six One is forced to wonder at if not to admire the energy with which these priests and their scarcely less zealous attendants one toiled to carry their pictures and ornaments through the most arduous of journeys where the traveller was often famished from the sheer difficulty of transporting provisions one The Jesuits on these distant missions were usually attended by followers who had taken no vows and could leave their service at will but whose motives were religious and not mercenary Probably this was the character of their attendants in the present case They were known as donnes or given men It appears from a letter of the Jesuit Du Peron that twelve hired laborers were soon after sent up to the mission A great event had called forth all this preparation Of the many baptisms achieved by the Fathers in the course of their indefatigable ministry the subjects had all been infants or adults at the point of death but at length a Huron in full health and manhood respected and influential in his tribe had been won over to the Faith and was now to be baptized with solemn ceremonial in the chapel thus gorgeously adorned It was a strange scene Indians were there in throngs and the house was closely packed warriors old and young glistening in grease and sunflower oil with uncouth locks a trifle less coarse than a horse s mane and faces perhaps smeared with paint in honor of the occasion wenches in gay attire hags muffled in a filthy discarded deer skin their leathery visages corrugated with age and malice and their hard glittering eyes riveted on the spectacle before them The priests no longer in their daily garb of black but radiant in their surplices the genuflections the tinkling of the bell the swinging of the censer the sweet odors so unlike the fumes of the smoky lodge fires the mysterious elevation of the Host for a mass followed the baptism and the agitation of the neophyte whose Indian imperturbability fairly deserted him all these combined to produce on the minds of the savage beholders an impression that seemed to promise a rich harvest for the Faith To the Jesuits it was a day of triumph and of hope The ice had been broken the wedge had entered light had dawned at last on the long night of heathendom But there was one feature of the situation which in their rejoicing they overlooked The Devil had taken alarm He had borne with reasonable composure the loss of individual souls snatched from him by former baptisms but here was a convert whose example and influence threatened to shake his Huron empire to its very foundation In fury and fear he rose to the conflict and put forth all his malice and all his hellish ingenuity Such at least is the explanation given by the Jesuits of the scenes that followed one Whether accepting it or not let us examine the circumstances which gave rise to it one Several of the Jesuits allude to this supposed excitement among the tenants of the nether world Thus Le Mercier says Le Diable se sentoit presse de pres il ne pouuoit supporter le Baptesme solennel de quelques Sauuages des plus signalez Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty eight thirty three Several other baptisms of less note followed that above described Garnier writing to his brother repeatedly alludes to the alarm excited in Hell by the recent successes of the mission and adds Vous pouvez juger quelle consolation nous etoit ce de voir le diable s armer contre nous et se servir de ses esclaves pour nous attaquer et tacher de nous perdre en haine de J C The mysterious strangers garbed in black who of late years had made their abode among them from motives past finding out marvellous in knowledge careless of life had awakened in the breasts of the Hurons mingled emotions of wonder perplexity fear respect and awe From the first they had held them answerable for the changes of the weather commending them when the crops were abundant and upbraiding them in times of scarcity They thought them mighty magicians masters of life and death and they came to them for spells sometimes to destroy their enemies and sometimes to kill grasshoppers And now it was whispered abroad that it was they who had bewitched the nation and caused the pest which threatened to exterminate it It was Isaac Jogues who first heard this ominous rumor at the town of Onnentisati and it proceeded from the dwarfish sorcerer already mentioned who boasted himself a devil incarnate The slander spread fast and far Their friends looked at them askance their enemies clamored for their lives Some said that they concealed in their houses a corpse which infected the country a perverted notion derived from some half instructed neophyte concerning the body of Christ in the Eucharist Others ascribed the evil to a serpent others to a spotted frog others to a demon which the priests were supposed to carry in the barrel of a gun Others again gave out that they had pricked an infant to death with awls in the forest in order to kill the Huron children by magic Perhaps observes Father Le Mercier the Devil was enraged because we had placed a great many of these little innocents in Heaven Le diable enrageoit peutestre de ce que nous avions place dans le ciel quantite de ces petits innocens Le Mercier Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty eight twelve Cramoisy The picture of the Last Judgment became an object of the utmost terror It was regarded as a charm The dragons and serpents were supposed to be the demons of the pest and the sinners whom they were so busily devouring to represent its victims On the top of a spruce tree near their house at Ihonatiria the priests had fastened a small streamer to show the direction of the wind This too was taken for a charm throwing off disease and death to all quarters The clock once an object of harmless wonder now excited the wildest alarm and the Jesuits were forced to stop it since when it struck it was supposed to sound the signal of death At sunset one would have seen knots of Indians their faces dark with dejection and terror listening to the measured sounds which issued from within the neighboring house of the mission where with bolted doors the priests were singing litanies mistaken for incantations by the awe struck savages Had the objects of these charges been Indians their term of life would have been very short The blow of a hatchet stealthily struck in the dusky entrance of a lodge would have promptly avenged the victims of their sorcery and delivered the country from peril But the priests inspired a strange awe Nocturnal councils were held their death was decreed and as they walked their rounds whispering groups of children gazed after them as men doomed to die But who should be the executioner They were reviled and upbraided The Indian boys threw sticks at them as they passed and then ran behind the houses When they entered one of these pestiferous dens this impish crew clambered on the roof to pelt them with snowballs through the smoke holes The old squaw who crouched by the fire scowled on them with mingled anger and fear and cried out Begone there are no sick ones here The invalids wrapped their heads in their blankets and when the priest accosted some dejected warrior the savage looked gloomily on the ground and answered not a word Yet nothing could divert the Jesuits from their ceaseless quest of dying subjects for baptism and above all of dying children They penetrated every house in turn When through the thin walls of bark they heard the wail of a sick infant no menace and no insult could repel them from the threshold They pushed boldly in asked to buy some trifle spoke of late news of Iroquois forays of anything in short except the pestilence and the sick child conversed for a while till suspicion was partially lulled to sleep and then pretending to observe the sufferer for the first time approached it felt its pulse and asked of its health Now while apparently fanning the heated brow the dexterous visitor touched it with a corner of his handkerchief which he had previously dipped in water murmured the baptismal words with motionless lips and snatched another soul from the fangs of the Infernal Wolf one Thus with the patience of saints the courage of heroes and an intent truly charitable did the Fathers put forth a nimble fingered adroitness that would have done credit to the profession of which the function is less to dispense the treasures of another world than to grasp those which pertain to this one Ce loup infernal is a title often bestowed in the Relations on the Devil The above details are gathered from the narratives of Brebeuf Le Mercier and Lalemant and letters published and unpublished of several other Jesuits In another case an Indian girl was carrying on her back a sick child two months old Two Jesuits approached and while one of them amused the girl with his rosary l autre le baptise lestement le pauure petit n attendoit que ceste faueur du Ciel pour s y enuoler The Huron chiefs were summoned to a great council to discuss the state of the nation The crisis demanded all their wisdom for while the continued ravages of disease threatened them with annihilation the Iroquois scalping parties infested the outskirts of their towns and murdered them in their fields and forests The assembly met in August sixteen thirty seven and the Jesuits knowing their deep stake in its deliberations failed not to be present with a liberal gift of wampum to show their sympathy in the public calamities In private they sought to gain the good will of the deputies one by one but though they were successful in some cases the result on the whole was far from hopeful In the intervals of the council Brebeuf discoursed to the crowd of chiefs on the wonders of the visible heavens the sun the moon the stars and the planets They were inclined to believe what he told them for he had lately to their great amazement accurately predicted an eclipse From the fires above he passed to the fires beneath till the listeners stood aghast at his hideous pictures of the flames of perdition the only species of Christian instruction which produced any perceptible effect on this unpromising auditory The council opened on the evening of the fourth of August with all the usual ceremonies and the night was spent in discussing questions of treaties and alliances with a deliberation and good sense which the Jesuits could not help admiring Le Mercier Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty eight thirty eight A few days after the assembly took up the more exciting question of the epidemic and its causes Deputies from three of the four Huron nations were present each deputation sitting apart The Jesuits were seated with the Nation of the Bear in whose towns their missions were established Like all important councils the session was held at night It was a strange scene The light of the fires flickered aloft into the smoky vault and among the soot begrimed rafters of the great council house one and cast an uncertain gleam on the wild and dejected throng that filled the platforms and the floor I think I never saw anything more lugubrious writes Le Mercier they looked at each other like so many corpses or like men who already feel the terror of death When they spoke it was only with sighs each reckoning up the sick and dead of his own family All this was to excite each other to vomit poison against us one It must have been the house of a chief The Hurons unlike some other tribes had no houses set apart for public occasions A grisly old chief named Ontitarac withered with age and stone blind but renowned in past years for eloquence and counsel opened the debate in a loud though tremulous voice First he saluted each of the three nations present then each of the chiefs in turn congratulated them that all were there assembled to deliberate on a subject of the last importance to the public welfare and exhorted them to give it a mature and calm consideration Next rose the chief whose office it was to preside over the Feast of the Dead He painted in dismal colors the woful condition of the country and ended with charging it all upon the sorceries of the Jesuits Another old chief followed him My brothers he said you know well that I am a war chief and very rarely speak except in councils of war but I am compelled to speak now since nearly all the other chiefs are dead and I must utter what is in my heart before I follow them to the grave Only two of my family are left alive and perhaps even these will not long escape the fury of the pest I have seen other diseases ravaging the country but nothing that could compare with this In two or three moons we saw their end but now we have suffered for a year and more and yet the evil does not abate And what is worst of all we have not yet discovered its source Then with words of studied moderation alternating with bursts of angry invective he proceeded to accuse the Jesuits of causing by their sorceries the unparalleled calamities that afflicted them and in support of his charge he adduced a prodigious mass of evidence When he had spent his eloquence Brebeuf rose to reply and in a few words exposed the absurdities of his statements whereupon another accuser brought a new array of charges A clamor soon arose from the whole assembly and they called upon Brebeuf with one voice to give up a certain charmed cloth which was the cause of their miseries In vain the missionary protested that he had no such cloth The clamor increased If you will not believe me said Brebeuf go to our house search everywhere and if you are not sure which is the charm take all our clothing and all our cloth and throw them into the lake Sorcerers always talk in that way was the reply Then what will you have me say demanded Brebeuf Tell us the cause of the pest Brebeuf replied to the best of his power mingling his explanations with instructions in Christian doctrine and exhortations to embrace the Faith He was continually interrupted and the old chief Ontitarac still called upon him to produce the charmed cloth Thus the debate continued till after midnight when several of the assembly seeing no prospect of a termination fell asleep and others went away One old chief as he passed out said to Brebeuf If some young man should split your head we should have nothing to say The priest still continued to harangue the diminished conclave on the necessity of obeying God and the danger of offending Him when the chief of Ossossane called out impatiently What sort of men are these They are always saying the same thing and repeating the same words a hundred times They are never done with telling us about their Oki and what he demands and what he forbids and Paradise and Hell The above account of the council is drawn from Le Mercier Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty eight Chap II See also Bressani Relation Abregee one hundred sixty three Here was the end of this miserable council writes Le Mercier and if less evil came of it than was designed we owe it after God to the Most Holy Virgin to whom we had made a vow of nine masses in honor of her immaculate conception The Fathers had escaped for the time but they were still in deadly peril They had taken pains to secure friends in private and there were those who were attached to their interests yet none dared openly take their part The few converts they had lately made came to them in secret and warned them that their death was determined upon Their house was set on fire in public every face was averted from them and a new council was called to pronounce the decree of death They appeared before it with a front of such unflinching assurance that their judges Indian like postponed the sentence Yet it seemed impossible that they should much longer escape Brebeuf therefore wrote a letter of farewell to his Superior Le Jeune at Quebec and confided it to some converts whom he could trust to be carried by them to its destination We are perhaps he says about to give our blood and our lives in the cause of our Master Jesus Christ It seems that His goodness will accept this sacrifice as regards me in expiation of my great and numberless sins and that He will thus crown the past services and ardent desires of all our Fathers here Blessed be His name forever that He has chosen us among so many better than we to aid him to bear His cross in this land In all things His holy will be done He then acquaints Le Jeune that he has directed the sacred vessels and all else belonging to the service of the altar to be placed in case of his death in the hands of Pierre the convert whose baptism has been described and that especial care will be taken to preserve the dictionary and other writings on the Huron language The letter closes with a request for masses and prayers The following is the conclusion of the letter Le Mercier Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty eight forty three En tout sa sainte volonte soit faite s il veut que des ceste heure nous mourions o la bonne heure pour nous s il veut nous reseruer a d autres trauaux qu il soit beny si vous

Octobre I ay laisse en la Residence de sainct Ioseph les Peres Pierre Pijart et Isaac Iogves dans les mesmes sentimens The imperilled Jesuits now took a singular but certainly a very wise step They gave one of those farewell feasts festins d adieu which Huron custom enjoined on those about to die whether in the course of Nature or by public execution Being interpreted it was a declaration that the priests knew their danger and did not shrink from it It might have the effect of changing overawed friends into open advocates and even of awakening a certain sympathy in the breasts of an assembly on whom a bold bearing could rarely fail of influence The house was packed with feasters and Brebeuf addressed them as usual on his unfailing themes of God Paradise and Hell The throng listened in gloomy silence and each when he had emptied his bowl rose and departed leaving his entertainers in utter doubt as to his feelings and intentions From this time forth however the clouds that overhung the Fathers became less dark and threatening Voices were heard in their defence and looks were less constantly averted They ascribed the change to the intercession of saint Joseph to whom they had vowed a nine days devotion By whatever cause produced the lapse of a week wrought a hopeful improvement in their prospects and when they went out of doors in the morning it was no longer with the expectation of having a hatchet struck into their brains as they crossed the threshold Tant y a que depuis le six de Nouembre que nous acheuasmes nos Messes votiues son honneur nous auons

sixteen thirty eight forty four The persecution of the Jesuits as sorcerers continued in an intermittent form for years and several of them escaped very narrowly In a house at Ossossane a young Indian rushed suddenly upon Francois Du Peron and lifted his tomahawk to brain him when a squaw caught his hand Paul Ragueneau wore a crucifix from which hung the image of a skull An Indian thinking it a charm snatched it from him The priest tried to recover it when the savage his eyes glittering with murder brandished his hatchet to strike Ragueneau stood motionless waiting the blow His assailant forbore and withdrew muttering Pierre Chaumonot was emerging from a house at the Huron town called by the Jesuits saint Michel where he had just baptized a dying girl when her brother standing hidden in the doorway struck him on the head with a stone Chaumonot severely wounded staggered without falling when the Indian sprang upon him with his tomahawk The bystanders arrested the blow Francois Le Mercier in the midst of a crowd of Indians in a house at the town called saint Louis was assailed by a noted chief who rushed in raving like a madman and in a torrent of words charged upon him all the miseries of the nation Then snatching a brand from the fire he shook it in the Jesuit s face and told him that he should be burned alive Le Mercier met him with looks as determined as his own till abashed at his undaunted front and bold denunciations the Indian stood confounded The above incidents are from Le Mercier Lalemant Bressani the autobiography of Chaumonot the unpublished writings of Garnier and the ancient manuscript volume of memoirs of the early Canadian missionaries at saint Mary s College Montreal The belief that their persecutions were owing to the fury of the Devil driven to desperation by the home thrusts he had received at their hands was an unfailing consolation to the priests Truly writes Le Mercier it is an unspeakable happiness for us in the midst of this barbarism to hear the roaring of the demons and to see Earth and Hell raging against a handful of men who will not even defend themselves one In all the copious records of this dark period not a line gives occasion to suspect that one of this loyal band flinched or hesitated The iron Brebeuf the gentle Garnier the all enduring Jogues the enthusiastic Chaumonot Lalemant Le Mercier Chatelain Daniel

defendre Relation des Hurons sixteen forty thirty one Cramoisy Father Jerome Lalemant in his journal of sixteen thirty nine is disposed to draw an evil augury for the mission from the fact that as yet no priest had been put to death inasmuch as it is a received maxim that the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church one He consoles himself with the hope that the daily life of the missionaries may be accepted as a living martyrdom since abuse and threats without end the smoke fleas filth and dogs of the Indian lodges which are he says little images of Hell cold hunger and ceaseless anxiety and all these continued for years are a portion to which many might prefer the stroke of a tomahawk Reasonable as the Father s hope may be its expression proved needless in the sequel for the Huron

forty PRIEST AND PAGAN DU PERON S JOURNEY DAILY LIFE OF THE JESUITS THEIR MISSIONARY EXCURSIONS CONVERTS AT OSSOSSANE MACHINERY OF CONVERSION CONDITIONS OF BAPTISM BACKSLIDERS THE CONVERTS AND THEIR COUNTRYMEN THE CANNIBALS AT saint JOSEPH We have already touched on the domestic life of the Jesuits That we may the better know them we will follow one of their number on his journey towards the scene of his labors and observe what awaited him on his arrival Father Francois Pu Peron came up the Ottawa in a Huron canoe in September sixteen thirty eight and was well treated by the Indian owner of the vessel Lalemant and Le Moyne who had set out from Three Rivers before him did not fare so well The former was assailed by an Algonquin of Allumette Island who tried to strangle him in revenge for the death of a child which a Frenchman in the employ of the Jesuits had lately bled but had failed to restore to health by the operation Le Moyne was abandoned by his Huron conductors and remained for a fortnight by the bank of the river with a French attendant who supported him by hunting Another Huron belonging to the flotilla that carried Du Peron then took him into his canoe but becoming tired of him was about to leave him on a rock in the river when his brother priest bribed the savage with a blanket to carry him to his journey s end It was midnight on the twenty ninth of September when Du Peron landed on the shore of Thunder Bay after paddling without rest since one o clock of the preceding morning The night was rainy and Ossossane was about fifteen miles distant His Indian companions were impatient to reach their towns the rain prevented the kindling of a fire while the priest who for a long time had not heard mass was eager to renew his communion as soon as possible Hence tired and hungry as he was he shouldered his sack and took the path for Ossossane without breaking his fast He toiled on half spent amid the ceaseless pattering trickling and whispering of innumerable drops among innumerable leaves till as day dawned he reached a clearing and descried through the mists a cluster of Huron houses Faint and bedrenched he entered the principal one and was greeted with the monosyllable Shay Welcome A squaw spread a mat for him by the fire roasted four ears of Indian corn before the coals baked two squashes in the embers ladled from her kettle a dish of sagamite and offered them to her famished guest Missionaries seem to have been a novelty at this place for while the Father breakfasted a crowd chiefly of children gathered about him and stared at him in silence One examined the texture of his cassock another put on his hat a third took the shoes from his feet and tried them on her own Du Peron requited his entertainers with a few trinkets and begged by signs a guide to Ossossane An Indian accordingly set out with him and conducted him to the mission house which he reached at six o clock in the evening Here he found a warm welcome and little other refreshment In respect to the commodities of life the Jesuits were but a step in advance of the Indians Their house though well ventilated by numberless crevices in its bark walls always smelt of smoke and when the wind was in certain quarters was filled with it to suffocation At their meals the Fathers sat on logs around the fire over which their kettle was slung in the Indian fashion Each had his wooden platter which from the difficulty of transportation was valued in the Huron country at the price of a robe of beaver skin or a hundred francs Nos plats quoyque de bois nous coutent plus cher que Les votres ils sont de la valeur d une robe de castor c est a dire cent francs Lettre du P Du Peron a son Frere twenty seven Avril sixteen thirty nine The Father s appraisement seems a little questionable Their food consisted of sagamite or mush made of pounded Indian corn boiled with scraps of smoked fish Chaumonot compares it to the paste used for papering the walls of houses The repast was occasionally varied by a pumpkin or squash baked in the ashes or in the season by Indian corn roasted in the ear They used no salt whatever They could bring their cumbrous pictures ornaments and vestments through the savage journey of the Ottawa but they could not bring the common necessaries of life By day they read and studied by the light that streamed in through the large smoke holes in the roof at night by the blaze of the fire Their only candles were a few of wax for the altar They cultivated a patch of ground but raised nothing on it except wheat for making the sacramental bread Their food was supplied by the Indians to whom they gave in return cloth knives awls needles and various trinkets Their supply of wine for the Eucharist was so scanty that they limited themselves to four or five drops for each mass The above particulars are drawn from a long letter of Francois Du Peron to his brother Joseph Imbert Du Peron dated at La Conception Ossossane April twenty seven sixteen thirty nine and from a letter equally long of Chaumonot to Father Philippe Nappi dated Du Pays des Hurons May twenty six sixteen forty Both are in Carayon These private letters of the Jesuits of which many are extant in some cases written on birch bark are invaluable as illustrations of the subject The Jesuits soon learned to make wine from wild grapes Those in Maine and Acadia at a later period made good candles from the waxy fruit of the shrub known locally as the bayberry Their life was regulated with a conventual strictness At four in the morning a bell roused them from the sheets of bark on which they slept Masses private devotions reading religious books and breakfasting filled the time until eight when they opened their door and admitted the Indians As many of these proved intolerable nuisances they took what Lalemant calls the honnete liberty of turning out the most intrusive and impracticable an act performed with all tact and courtesy and rarely taken in dudgeon Having thus winnowed their company they catechized those that remained as opportunity offered In the intervals the guests squatted by the fire and smoked their pipes As among the Spartan virtues of the Hurons that of thieving was especially conspicuous it was necessary that one or more of the Fathers should remain on guard at the house all day The rest went forth on their missionary labors baptizing and instructing as we have seen To each priest who could speak Huron one was assigned a certain number of houses in some instances as many as forty and as these often had five or six fires with two families to each his spiritual flock was as numerous as it was intractable It was his care to see that none of the number died without baptism and by every means in his power to commend the doctrines of his faith to the acceptance of those in health one At the end of the year sixteen thirty eight there were seven priests who spoke Huron and three who had begun to learn it At dinner which was at two o clock grace was said in Huron for the benefit of the Indians present and a chapter of the Bible was read aloud during the meal At four or five according to the season the Indians were dismissed the door closed and the evening spent in writing reading studying the language devotion and conversation on the affairs of the mission The local missions here referred to embraced Ossossane and the villages of the neighborhood but the priests by no means confined themselves within these limits They made distant excursions two in company until every house in every Huron town had heard the annunciation of the new doctrine On these journeys they carried blankets or large mantles at their backs for sleeping in at night besides a supply of needles awls beads and other small articles to pay for their lodging and entertainment for the Hurons hospitable without stint to each other expected full compensation from the Jesuits At Ossossane the house of the Jesuits no longer served the double purpose of dwelling and chapel In sixteen thirty eight they had in their pay twelve artisans and laborers sent up from Quebec Du Peron in Carayon one hundred seventy three who had built before the close of the year a chapel of wood La chapelle est faite d une charpente bien jolie semblable presque en facon et grandeur a notre chapelle de saint Julien Ibid one hundred eighty three Hither they removed their pictures and ornaments and here in winter several fires were kept burning for the comfort of the half naked converts Lalemant Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty nine sixty two Of these they now had at Ossossane about sixty a large though evidently not a very solid nucleus for the Huron church and they labored hard and anxiously to confirm and multiply them Of a Sunday morning in winter one could have seen them coming to mass often from a considerable distance as naked says Lalemant as your hand except a skin over their backs like a mantle and in the coldest weather a few skins around their feet and legs They knelt mingled with the French mechanics before the altar very awkwardly at first for the posture was new to them and all received the sacrament together a spectacle which as the missionary chronicler declares repaid a hundred times all the labor of their conversion Lalemant Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty nine sixty two Some of the principal methods of conversion are curiously illustrated in a letter written by Garnier to a friend in France Send me he says a picture of Christ without a beard Several Virgins are also requested together with a variety of souls in perdition ames damnees most of them to be mounted in a portable form Particular directions are given with respect to the demons dragons flames and other essentials of these works of art Of souls in bliss ames bienheureuses he thinks that one will be enough All the pictures must be in full face not in profile and they must look directly at the beholder with open eyes The colors should be bright and there must be no flowers or animals as these distract the attention of the Indians Garnier Lettre seventeenme MS These directions show an excellent knowledge of Indian peculiarities The Indian dislike of a beard is well known Catlin the painter once caused a fatal quarrel among a party of Sioux by representing one of them in profile whereupon he was jibed by a rival as being but half a man The first point with the priests was of course to bring the objects of their zeal to an acceptance of the fundamental doctrines of the Roman Church but as the mind of the savage was by no means that beautiful blank which some have represented it there was much to be erased as well as to be written They must renounce a host of superstitions to which they were attached with a strange tenacity or which may rather be said to have been ingrained in their very natures Certain points of Christian morality were also strongly urged by the missionaries who insisted that the convert should take but one wife and not cast her off without grave cause and that he should renounce the gross license almost universal among the Hurons Murder cannibalism and several other offences were also forbidden Yet while laboring at the work of conversion with an energy never surpassed and battling against the powers of darkness with the mettle of paladins the Jesuits never had the folly to assume towards the Indians a dictatorial or overbearing tone Gentleness kindness and patience were the rule of their intercourse one They studied the nature of the savage and conformed themselves to it with an admirable tact Far from treating the Indian as an alien and barbarian they would fain have adopted him as a countryman and they proposed to the Hurons that a number of young Frenchmen should settle among them and marry their daughters in solemn form The listeners were gratified at an overture so flattering But what is the use they demanded of so much ceremony If the Frenchmen want our women they are welcome to come and take them whenever they please as they always used to do Le Mercier Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty seven one hundred sixty one The following passage from the Divers Sentimens before cited will illustrate this point Pour conuertir les Sauuages il n y faut pas tant de science que de bonte et vertu bien solide Les quatre Elemens d vn homme Apostolique en la Nouuelle France sont l Affabilite l Humilite la Patience et vne Charite genereuse Le zele trop ardent brusle plus qu il n eschauffe et gaste tout il faut vne grande magnanimite et condescendance pour attirer peu a peu ces Sauuages Ils n entendent pas bien nostre Theologie mais ils entendent parfaictement bien nostre humilite et nostre affabilite et se laissent gaigner So too Brebeuf in a letter to Vitelleschi General of the Jesuits see Carayon one hundred sixty three Ce qu il faut demander avant tout des ouvriers destines a cette mission c est une douceur inalterable et une patience a toute epreuve The Fathers are well agreed that their difficulties did not arise from any natural defect of understanding on the part of the Indians who according to Chaumonot were more intelligent than the French peasantry and who in some instances showed in their way a marked capacity It was the inert mass of pride sensuality indolence and superstition that opposed the march of the Faith and in which the Devil lay intrenched as behind impregnable breastworks In this connection the following specimen of Indian reasoning is worth noting At the height of the pestilence a Huron said to one of the priests I see plainly that your God is angry with us because we will not believe and obey him Ihonatiria where you first taught his word is entirely ruined Then you came here to Ossossane and we would not listen so Ossossane is ruined too This year you have been all through our country and found scarcely any who would do what God commands therefore the pestilence is everywhere After premises so hopeful the Fathers looked for a satisfactory conclusion but the Indian proceeded My opinion is that we ought to shut you out from all the houses and stop our ears when you speak of God so that we cannot hear Then we shall not be so guilty of rejecting the truth and he will not punish us so cruelly Lalemant Relation des Hurons sixteen forty eighty It soon became evident that it was easier to make a convert than to keep him Many of the Indians clung to the idea that baptism was a safeguard against pestilence and misfortune and when the fallacy of this notion was made apparent their zeal cooled Their only amusements consisted of feasts dances and games many of which were to a greater or less degree of a superstitious character and as the Fathers could rarely prove to their own satisfaction the absence of the diabolic element in any one of them they proscribed the whole indiscriminately to the extreme disgust of the neophyte His countrymen too beset him with dismal prognostics as You will kill no more game All your hair will come out before spring and so forth Various doubts also assailed him with regard to the substantial advantages of his new profession and several converts were filled with anxiety in view of the probable want of tobacco in Heaven saying that they could not do without it Lalemant Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty nine eighty Nor was it pleasant to these incipient Christians as they sat in class listening to the instructions of their teacher to find themselves and him suddenly made the targets of a shower of sticks snowballs corn cobs and other rubbish flung at them by a screeching rabble of vagabond boys Ibid seventy eight Yet while most of the neophytes demanded an anxious and diligent cultivation there were a few of excellent promise and of one or two especially the Fathers in the fulness of their satisfaction assure us again and again that they were savage only in name From June sixteen thirty nine to June sixteen forty about a thousand persons were baptized Of these two hundred and sixty were infants and many more were children Very many died soon after baptism Of the whole number less than twenty were baptized in health a number much below that of the preceding year The following is a curious case of precocious piety It is that of a child at saint Joseph Elle n a que deux ans et fait joliment le signe de la croix et prend elle meme de l eau benite et une fois se mit a crier sortant de la Chapelle a cause que sa mere qui la portoit ne lui avoit donne le loisir d en prendre Il l a fallu reporter en prendre Lettres de Garnier MSS As the town of Ihonatiria where the Jesuits had made their first abode was ruined by the pestilence the mission established there and known by the name of saint Joseph was removed in the summer of sixteen thirty eight to Teanaustaye a large town at the foot of a range of hills near the southern borders of the Huron territory The Hurons this year had had unwonted successes in their war with the Iroquois and had taken at various times nearly a hundred prisoners Many of these were brought to the seat of the new mission of saint Joseph and put to death with frightful tortures though not before several had been converted and baptized The torture was followed in spite of the remonstrances of the priests by those cannibal feasts customary with the Hurons on such occasions Once when the Fathers had been strenuous in their denunciations a hand of the victim duly prepared was flung in at their door as an invitation to join in the festivity As the owner of the severed member had been baptized they dug a hole in their chapel and buried it with solemn rites of sepulture Lalemant Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty nine seventy CHAPTER XII sixteen thirty nine sixteen forty THE TOBACCO NATION THE NEUTRALS A CHANGE OF PLAN SAINTE MARIE MISSION OF THE TOBACCO NATION WINTER JOURNEYING RECEPTION OF THE MISSIONARIES SUPERSTITIOUS TERRORS PERIL OF GARNIER AND JOGUES MISSION OF THE NEUTRALS HURON INTRIGUES MIRACLES FURY OF THE INDIANS INTERVENTION OF SAINT MICHAEL RETURN TO SAINTE MARIE INTREPIDITY OF THE PRIESTS THEIR MENTAL EXALTATION It had been the first purpose of the Jesuits to form permanent missions in each of the principal Huron towns but before the close of the year sixteen thirty nine the difficulties and risks of this scheme had become fully apparent They resolved therefore to establish one central station to be a base of operations and as it were a focus whence the light of the Faith should radiate through all the wilderness around It was to serve at once as residence fort magazine hospital and convent Hence the priests would set forth on missionary expeditions far and near and hither they might retire as to an asylum in times of sickness or extreme peril Here the neophytes could be gathered together safe from perverting influences and here in time a Christian settlement Hurons mingled with Frenchmen might spring up and thrive under the shadow of the cross The site of the new station was admirably chosen The little river Wye flows from the southward into the Matchedash Bay of Lake Huron and at about a mile from its mouth passes through a small lake The Jesuits made choice of the right bank of the Wye where it issues from this lake gained permission to build from the Indians though not without difficulty and began their labors with an abundant energy and a very deficient supply of workmen and tools The new establishment was called Sainte Marie The house at Teanaustaye and the house and chapel at Ossossane were abandoned and all was concentrated at this spot On one hand it had a short water communication with Lake Huron and on the other its central position gave the readiest access to every part of the Huron territory During the summer before the priests had made a survey of their field of action visited all the Huron towns and christened each of them with the name of a saint This heavy draft on the calendar was followed by another for the designation of the nine towns of the neighboring and kindred people of the Tobacco Nation See Introduction The Huron towns were portioned into four districts while those of the Tobacco Nation formed a fifth and each district was assigned to the charge of two or more priests In November and December they began their missionary excursions for the Indians were now gathered in their settlements and journeyed on foot through the denuded forests in mud and snow bearing on their backs the vessels and utensils necessary for the service of the altar The new and perilous mission of the Tobacco Nation fell to Garnier and Jogues They were well chosen and yet neither of them was robust by nature in body or mind though Jogues was noted for personal activity The Tobacco Nation lay at the distance of a two days journey from the Huron towns among the mountains at the head of Nottawassaga Bay The two missionaries tried to find a guide at Ossossane but none would go with them and they set forth on their wild and unknown pilgrimage alone The forests were full of snow and the soft moist flakes were still falling thickly obscuring the air beplastering the gray trunks weighing to the earth the boughs of spruce and pine and hiding every footprint of the narrow path The Fathers missed their way and toiled on till night shaking down at every step from the burdened branches a shower of fleecy white on their black cassocks Night overtook them in a spruce swamp Here they made a fire with great difficulty cut the evergreen boughs piled them for a bed and lay down The storm presently ceased and praised be God writes one of the travellers we passed a very good night Jogues and Garnier in Lalemant Relation des Hurons sixteen forty ninety five In the morning they breakfasted on a morsel of corn bread and resuming their journey fell in with a small party of Indians whom they followed all day without food At eight in the evening they reached the first Tobacco town a miserable cluster of bark cabins hidden among forests and half buried in snow drifts where the savage children seeing the two black apparitions screamed that Famine and the Pest were coming Their evil fame had gone before them They were unwelcome guests nevertheless shivering and famished as they were in the cold and darkness they boldly pushed their way into one of these dens of barbarism It was precisely like a Huron house Five or six fires blazed on the earthen floor and around them were huddled twice that number of families sitting crouching standing or flat on the ground old and young women and men children and dogs mingled pell mell The scene would have been a strange one by daylight it was doubly strange by the flicker and glare of the lodge fires Scowling brows sidelong looks of distrust and fear the screams of scared children the scolding of squaws the growling of wolfish dogs this was the greeting of the strangers The chief man of the household treated them at first with the decencies of Indian hospitality but when he saw them kneeling in the litter and ashes at their devotions his suppressed fears found vent and he began a loud harangue addressed half to them and half to the Indians Now what are these okies doing They are making charms to kill us and destroy all that the pest has spared in this house I heard that they were sorcerers and now when it is too late I believe it Lalemant Relation des Hurons sixteen forty ninety six It is wonderful that the priests escaped the tomahawk Nowhere is the power of courage faith and an unflinching purpose more strikingly displayed than in the record of these missions In other Tobacco towns their reception was much the same but at the largest called by them saint Peter and saint Paul they fared worse They reached it on a winter afternoon Every door of its capacious bark houses was closed against them and they heard the squaws within calling on the young men to go out and split their heads while children screamed abuse at the black robed sorcerers As night approached they left the town when a band of young men followed them hatchet in hand to put them to death Darkness the forest and the mountain favored them and eluding their pursuers they escaped Thus began the mission of the Tobacco Nation In the following November a yet more distant and perilous mission was begun Brebeuf and Chaumonot set out for the Neutral Nation This fierce people as we have already seen occupied that part of Canada which lies immediately north of Lake Erie while a wing of their territory extended across the Niagara into Western New York one In their athletic proportions the ferocity of their manners and the extravagance of their superstitions no American tribe has ever exceeded them They carried to a preposterous excess the Indian notion that insanity is endowed with a mysterious and superhuman power Their country was full of pretended maniacs who to propitiate their guardian spirits or okies and acquire the mystic virtue which pertained to madness raved stark naked through the villages scattering the brands of the lodge fires and upsetting everything in their way one Introduction The river Niagara was at this time sixteen forty well known to the Jesuits though none of them had visited it Lalemant speaks of it as the famous river of this nation the Neutrals The following translation from his Relation of sixteen forty one shows that both Lake Ontario and Lake Erie had already taken their present names This river the Niagara is the same by which our great lake of the Hurons or Fresh Sea discharges itself in the first place into Lake Erie le lac d Erie or the Lake of the Cat Nation Then it enters the territories of the Neutral Nation and takes the name of Onguiaahra Niagara until it discharges itself into Ontario or the Lake of saint Louis whence at last issues the river which passes before Quebec and is called the saint Lawrence He makes no allusion to the cataract which is first mentioned as follows by Ragueneau in the Relation of sixteen forty eight Nearly south of this same Neutral Nation there is a great lake about two hundred leagues in circuit named Erie Erie which is formed by the discharge of the Fresh Sea and which precipitates itself by a cataract of frightful height into a third lake named Ontario which we call Lake saint Louis Relation des Hurons sixteen forty eight forty six The two priests left Sainte Marie on the second of November found a Huron guide at saint Joseph and after a dreary march of five days through the forest reached the first Neutral town Advancing thence they visited in turn eighteen others and their progress was a storm of maledictions Brebeuf especially was accounted the most pestilent of sorcerers The Hurons restrained by a superstitious awe and unwilling to kill the priests lest they should embroil themselves with the French at Quebec conceived that their object might be safely gained by stirring up the Neutrals to become their executioners To that end they sent two emissaries to the Neutral towns who calling the chiefs and young warriors to a council denounced the Jesuits as destroyers of the human race and made their auditors a gift of nine French hatchets on condition that they would put them to death It was now that Brebeuf fully conscious of the danger half starved and half frozen driven with revilings from every door struck and spit upon by pretended maniacs beheld in a vision that great cross which as we have seen moved onward through the air above the wintry forests that stretched towards the land of the Iroquois See ante chapter nine second last paragraph page one hundred nine Chaumonot records yet another miracle One evening when all the chief men of the town were deliberating in council whether to put us to death Father Brebeuf while making his examination of conscience as we were together at prayers saw the vision of a spectre full of fury menacing us both with three javelins which he held in his hands Then he hurled one of them at us but a more powerful hand caught it as it flew and this took place a second and a third time as he hurled his two remaining javelins Late at night our host came back from the council where the two Huron emissaries had made their gift of hatchets to have us killed He wakened us to say that three times we had been at the point of death for the young men had offered three times to strike the blow and three times the old men had dissuaded them This explained the meaning of Father Brebeuf s vision Chaumonot Vie fifty five They had escaped for the time but the Indians agreed among themselves that thenceforth no one should give them shelter At night pierced with cold and faint with hunger they found every door closed against them They stood and watched saw an Indian issue from a house and by a quick movement pushed through the half open door into this abode of smoke and filth The inmates aghast at their boldness stared in silence Then a messenger ran out to carry the tidings and an angry crowd collected Go out and leave our country said an old chief or we will put you into the kettle and make a feast of you I have had enough of the dark colored flesh of our enemies said a young brave I wish to know the taste of white meat and I will eat yours A warrior rushed in like a madman drew his bow and aimed the arrow at Chaumonot I looked at him fixedly writes the Jesuit and commended myself in full confidence to saint Michael Without doubt this great archangel saved us for almost immediately the fury of the warrior was appeased and the rest of our enemies soon began to listen to the explanation we gave them of our visit to their country Ibid fifty seven The mission was barren of any other fruit than hardship and danger and after a stay of four months the two priests resolved to return On the way they met a genuine act of kindness A heavy snow storm arresting their progress a Neutral woman took them into her lodge entertained them for two weeks with her best fare persuaded her father and relatives to befriend them and aided them to make a vocabulary of the dialect Bidding their generous hostess farewell they journeyed northward through the melting snows of spring and reached Sainte Marie in safety Lalemant in his Relation of sixteen forty one gives the narrative of this mission at length His account coincides perfectly with the briefer notice of Chaumonot in his Autobiography Chaumonot describes the difficulties of the journey very graphically in a letter to his friend Father Nappi dated Aug three sixteen forty preserved in Carayon See also the next letter Brebeuf au T R P Mutio Vitelleschi twenty Aout sixteen forty one The Recollet La Roche Dallion had visited the Neutrals fourteen years before see Introduction note and like his two successors had been seriously endangered by Huron intrigues The Jesuits had borne all that the human frame seems capable of bearing They had escaped as by miracle from torture and death Did their zeal flag or their courage fail A fervor intense and unquenchable urged them on to more distant and more deadly ventures The beings so near to mortal sympathies so human yet so divine in whom their faith impersonated and dramatized the great principles of Christian truth virgins saints and angels hovered over them and held before their raptured sight crowns of glory and garlands of immortal bliss They burned to do to suffer and to die and now from out a living martyrdom they turned their heroic gaze towards an horizon dark with perils yet more appalling and saw in hope the day when they should bear the cross into the blood stained dens of the Iroquois This zeal was in no degree due to success for in sixteen forty one after seven years of toil the mission counted only about fifty living converts a falling off from former years But in this exaltation and tension of the powers was there no moment when the recoil of Nature claimed a temporary sway When an exile from his kind alone beneath the desolate rock and the gloomy pine trees the priest gazed forth on the pitiless wilderness and the hovels of its dark and ruthless tenants his thoughts it may be flew longingly beyond those wastes of forest and sea that lay between him and the home of his boyhood Or rather led by a deeper attraction they revisited the ancient centre of his faith and he seemed to stand once more in that gorgeous temple where shrined in lazuli and gold rest the hallowed bones of Loyola Column and arch and dome rise upon his vision radiant in painted light and trembling with celestial music Again he kneels before the altar from whose tablature beams upon him that loveliest of shapes in which the imagination of man has embodied the spirit of Christianity The illusion overpowers him A thrill shakes his frame and he bows in reverential rapture No longer a memory no longer a dream but a visioned presence distinct and luminous in the forest shades the Virgin stands before him Prostrate on the rocky earth he adores the benign angel of his ecstatic faith then turns with rekindled fervors to his stern apostleship Now by the shores of Thunder Bay the Huron traders freight their birch vessels for their yearly voyage and embarked with them let us too revisit the rock of

rock together Montmagny saw a crucifix planted by the path He instantly fell on his knees before it and nobles soldiers sailors and priests imitated his example The Jesuits sang Te Deum at the church and the cannon roared from the adjacent fort Here the new governor was scarcely installed when a Jesuit came in to ask if he would be godfather to an Indian about to be baptized Most gladly replied the pious Montmagny He repaired on the instant to the convert s hut with a company of gayly apparelled gentlemen and while the inmates stared in amazement at the scarlet and embroidery he bestowed on

packet of letters that was placed in his hands bearing the signatures of nuns priests soldiers courtiers and princesses A great interest in the mission had been kindled in France Le Jeune s printed

and State linked in alliance close and potential played faithfully into each other s hands and that enthusiasm in which the Jesuit saw the direct inspiration of God was fostered by all the prestige of royalty and all the patronage of power And as often happens where the interests of a hierarchy are identified with the interests of a ruling class religion was become a fashion as graceful and as comforting as the courtier s embroidered mantle or the court lady s robe of fur Such we may well believe was the complexion of the enthusiasm which animated some of Le Jeune s noble and princely correspondents But there were deeper fervors glowing in the still depths of convent cells and kindling the breasts of their inmates with quenchless longings Yet we hear of no zeal for the mission among religious communities of men The Jesuits regarded the field as their own and desired no rivals They looked forward to the day when Canada should be another Paraguay Que si celuy qui a escrit cette lettre a leu la Relation de ce qui se passe au Paraguais qu il a veu ce qui se fera un jour en la Nouuelle France Le Jeune Relation sixteen thirty seven three hundred four Cramoisy It was to the combustible hearts of female recluses that the torch was most busily applied and here accordingly blazed forth a prodigious and amazing flame If all had their pious will writes Le Jeune Quebec would soon be flooded with nuns Chaulmer Le Nouveau Monde Chrestien forty one is eloquent on this theme Both Montmagny and De Lisle were half churchmen for both were Knights of Malta More and more the powers spiritual engrossed the colony As nearly as might be the sword itself was in priestly hands The Jesuits were all in all Authority absolute and without appeal was vested in a council composed of the governor Le Jeune and the syndic an official supposed to represent the interests of the inhabitants Le Clerc Etablissement de la Foy Chap XV There was no tribunal of justice and the governor pronounced summarily on all complaints The church adjoined the fort and before it was planted a stake bearing a placard with a prohibition against blasphemy drunkenness or neglect of mass and other religious rites To the stake was also attached a chain and iron collar and hard by was a wooden horse whereon a culprit was now and then mounted by way of example and warning Le Jeune Relation sixteen thirty six one hundred fifty three one hundred fifty four Cramoisy In a community so absolutely priest governed overt offences were however rare and except on the annual arrival of the ships from France when the rock swarmed with godless sailors Quebec was a model of decorum and wore as its chroniclers tell us an aspect unspeakably edifying In the year sixteen forty various new establishments of religion and charity might have been seen at Quebec There was the beginning of a college and a seminary for Huron children an embryo Ursuline convent an incipient hospital and a new Algonquin mission at a place called Sillery four miles distant Champlain s fort had been enlarged and partly rebuilt in stone by Montmagny who had also laid out streets on the site of the future city though as yet the streets had no houses Behind the fort and very near it stood the church and a house for the Jesuits Both were of pine wood and this year sixteen forty both were burned to the ground to be afterwards rebuilt in stone The Jesuits however continued to occupy their rude mission house of Notre Dame des Anges on the saint Charles where we first found them The country around Quebec was still an unbroken wilderness with the exception of a small clearing made by the Sieur Giffard on his seigniory of Beauport another made by M de Puiseaux between Quebec and Sillery and possibly one or two feeble attempts in other quarters one The total population did not much exceed two hundred including women and children Of this number by far the greater part were agents of the fur company known as the Hundred Associates and men in their employ Some of these had brought over their families The remaining inhabitants were priests nuns and a very few colonists one For Giffard Puiseaux and other colonists compare Langevin Notes sur les Archives de Notre Dame de Beauport five six seven Ferland Notes sur les Archives de N D de Quebec twenty two twenty four eighteen sixty three Ibid Cours d Histoire du Canada I two hundred sixty six Le Jeune Relation sixteen thirty six forty five Faillon Histoire de la Colonie Francaise I c iv v The Company of the Hundred Associates was bound by its charter to send to Canada four thousand colonists before the year sixteen forty three See Pioneers of France three hundred ninety nine It had neither the means nor the will to fulfil this engagement Some of its members were willing to make personal sacrifices for promoting the missions and building up a colony purely Catholic Others thought only of the profits of trade and the practical affairs of the company had passed entirely into the hands of this portion of its members They sought to evade obligations the fulfilment of which would have ruined them Instead of sending out colonists they granted lands with the condition that the grantees should furnish a certain number of settlers to clear and till them and these were to be credited to the Company one The grantees took the land but rarely fulfilled the condition Some of these grants were corrupt and iniquitous Thus a son of Lauson president of the Company received in the name of a third person a tract of land on the south side of the saint Lawrence of sixty leagues front To this were added all the islands in that river excepting those of Montreal and Orleans together with the exclusive right of fishing in it through its whole extent two Lauson sent out not a single colonist to these vast concessions one This appears in many early grants of the Company Thus in a grant to Simon Le Maitre Jan fifteen sixteen thirty six

Archives du Seminaire de Villemarie cited by Faillon I three hundred fifty Lauson s father owned Montreal The son s grant extended from the River saint Francis to a point far above Montreal La Fontaine Memoire sur la Famille de Lauson There was no real motive for emigration No persecution expelled the colonist from his home for none but good Catholics were tolerated in New France The settler could not trade with the Indians except on condition of selling again to the Company at a fixed price He might hunt but he could not fish and he was forced to beg or buy food for years before he could obtain it from that rude soil in sufficient quantity for the wants of his family The Company imported provisions every year for those in its employ and of these supplies a portion was needed for the relief of starving settlers Giffard and his seven men on his seigniory of Beauport were for some time the only settlers excepting perhaps the Hebert family who could support themselves throughout the year The rigor of the climate repelled the emigrant nor were the attractions which Father Le Jeune held forth piety freedom and independence of a nature to entice him across the sea when it is remembered that this freedom consisted in subjection to the arbitrary will of a priest and a soldier and in the liability should he forget to go to mass of being made fast to a post with a collar and chain like a dog Aside from the fur trade of the Company the whole life of the colony was in missions convents religious schools and hospitals Here on the rock of Quebec were the appendages useful and otherwise of an old established civilization While as yet there were no inhabitants and no immediate hope of any there were institutions for the care of children the sick and the decrepit All these were supported by a charity in most cases precarious The Jesuits relied chiefly on the Company who by the terms of their patent were obliged to maintain religious worship one Of the origin of the convent hospital and seminary I shall soon have occasion to speak one It is a principle of the Jesuits that each of its establishments shall find a support of its own and not be a burden on the general funds of the Society The Relations are full of appeals to the charity of devout persons in behalf of the missions Of what use to the country at this period could have been two communities of cloistered nuns asks the modern historian of the Ursulines of Quebec And he answers by citing the words of Pope Gregory the Great who when Rome was ravaged by famine pestilence and the barbarians declared that his only hope was in the prayers of the three thousand nuns then assembled in the holy city Les Ursulines de Quebec Introd XI Quebec wore an aspect half military half monastic At sunrise and sunset a squad of soldiers in the pay of the Company paraded in the fort and as in Champlain s time the bells of the church rang morning noon and night Confessions masses and penances were punctiliously observed and from the governor to the meanest laborer the Jesuit watched and guided all The social atmosphere of New England itself was not more suffocating By day and by night at home at church or at his daily work the colonist lived under the eyes of busy and over zealous priests At times the denizens of Quebec grew restless In sixteen thirty nine deputies were covertly sent to beg relief in France and to represent the hell in which the consciences of the colony were kept by the union of the temporal and spiritual authority in the same hands Pour leur representer la gehenne ou estoient les consciences de la Colonie de se voir gouverne par les mesmes personnes pour le spirituel et pour le temporel Le Clerc I four hundred seventy eight In sixteen forty two partial and ineffective measures were taken with the countenance of Richelieu for introducing into New France an Order less greedy of seigniories and endowments than the Jesuits and less prone to political encroachment one No favorable result followed and the colony remained as before in a pitiful state of cramping and dwarfing vassalage one Declaration de Pierre Breant par devant les Notaires du Roy MS The Order was that of the Capuchins who like the Recollets are a branch of the Franciscans Their introduction into Canada was prevented but they established themselves in Maine This is the view of a heretic It was the aim of the founders of New France to build on a foundation purely and supremely Catholic What this involved is plain for no degree of personal virtue is a guaranty against the evils which attach to the temporal rule of ecclesiastics Burning with love and devotion to Christ and his immaculate Mother the fervent and conscientious priest regards with mixed pity and indignation those who fail in this supreme allegiance Piety and charity alike demand that he should bring back the rash wanderer to the fold of his divine Master and snatch him from the perdition into which his guilt must otherwise plunge him And while he the priest himself yields reverence and obedience to the Superior in whom he sees the representative of Deity it behooves him in his degree to require obedience from those whom he imagines that God has confided to his guidance His conscience then acts in perfect accord with the love of power innate in the human heart These allied forces mingle with a perplexing subtlety pride disguised even from itself walks in the likeness of love and duty and a thousand times on the pages of history we find Hell beguiling the virtues of Heaven to do its work The instinct of domination is a weed that grows rank in the shadow of the temple climbs over it possesses it covers its ruin and feeds on its decay The unchecked sway of priests has always been the most mischievous of tyrannies and even were they all well meaning and sincere it would be so still To the Jesuits the atmosphere of Quebec was well nigh celestial In the climate of New France they write one learns perfectly to seek only God to have no desire but God no purpose but for God And again To live in New France is in truth to live in the bosom of God If adds Le Jeune any one of those who die in this country goes to perdition I think he will be doubly guilty La Nouuelle France est vn vray climat ou on apprend parfaictement bien a ne chercher que Dieu ne desirer que Dieu seul auoir l

saint Joseph the patron of New France there was a show of fireworks to do him honor In the forty volumes of the Jesuit Relations there is but one pictorial illustration and this represents the pyrotechnic contrivance in question together with a figure of the Governor in the act of touching it off Relation sixteen thirty seven eight The Relations as originally published comprised about forty volumes But what is more curious a Catholic writer of the present day the Abbe Faillon in an elaborate and learned work dilates at length on the details of the display and this too with a gravity which evinces his conviction that squibs rockets blue lights and serpents are important instruments for the saving of souls Histoire de la Colonie Francaise I two hundred ninety one two hundred ninety

birth there was a dramatic performance in which an unbeliever speaking Algonquin for the profit of the Indians present was hunted into Hell by fiends Vimont Relation sixteen forty six Religious

convent with Indian children in French gowns then all the Indian girls and women dressed after their own way then the priests then the Governor and finally the whole French population male and female except the artillery men at the fort who saluted with their cannon the cross and banner borne at the head of the procession When all was over the Governor and the Jesuits rewarded the Indians with a

trinkets with which Le Jeune rewards his most proficient pupils Le Jeune Relation sixteen thirty seven one hundred twenty two Cramoisy We have seen the methods of conversion practised among the Hurons

thirty two Cramoisy The preparation of the convert for baptism was often very slight A dying Algonquin who though meagre as a skeleton had thrown himself with a last effort of expiring ferocity on an Iroquois prisoner and torn off his ear with his teeth was baptized almost immediately one In the case of converts in health there was far more preparation yet these often apostatized The various objects of instruction may all be included in one comprehensive word submission an abdication of will and judgment in favor of the spiritual director who was the interpreter and vicegerent of God The director s function consisted in the enforcement of dogmas by which he had himself been subdued in which he believed profoundly and to which he often clung with an absorbing enthusiasm The Jesuits an Order thoroughly and vehemently reactive had revived in Europe the mediaeval type of Christianity with all its attendant superstitions Of these the Canadian missions bear abundant marks Yet on the whole the labors of the missionaries tended greatly to the benefit of the Indians Reclaimed as the Jesuits tried to reclaim them from their wandering life settled in habits of peaceful industry and reduced to a passive and childlike obedience they would have gained more than enough to compensate them for the loss of their ferocious and miserable independence At least they would have escaped annihilation The Society of Jesus aspired to the mastery of all New France but the methods of its ambition were consistent with a Christian benevolence Had this been otherwise it would have employed other instruments It would not have chosen a Jogues or a Garnier The Society had men for every work and it used them wisely It utilized the apostolic virtues of its Canadian missionaries fanned their enthusiasm and decorated itself with their martyr crowns With joy and gratulation it saw them rival in another hemisphere the noble memory of its saint and hero Francis Xavier Enemies of the Jesuits while denouncing them in unmeasured terms speak in strong eulogy of many of the Canadian missionaries See for example Steinmetz History of the Jesuits II four hundred fifteen one Ce seroit vne

well acquainted with it as the Dutch had once given him so much that they were forced to tie him hand and foot to prevent him from doing mischief Faillon II forty three I have spoken of the colonists as living in a state of temporal and spiritual vassalage To this there was one exception a small class of men whose home was the forest and their companions savages They followed the Indians in their roamings lived with them grew familiar with their language allied themselves with their women and often became oracles in the camp and leaders on the war path Champlain s bold interpreter Etienne Brule whose adventures I have recounted elsewhere Pioneers of France three hundred seventy seven may be taken as a type of this class Of the rest the most conspicuous were Jean Nicollet Jacques Hertel Francois Marguerie and Nicolas Marsolet one Doubtless when they returned from their rovings they often had pressing need of penance and absolution yet for the most part they were good Catholics and some of them were zealous for the missions Nicollet and others were at times settled as interpreters at Three Rivers and Quebec Several of them were men of great intelligence and an invincible courage From hatred of restraint and love of a wild and adventurous independence they encountered privations and dangers scarcely less than those to which the Jesuit exposed himself from motives widely different he from religious zeal charity and the hope of Paradise they simply because they liked it Some of the best families of Canada claim descent from this vigorous and hardy stock one See Ferland

LA PELTRIE Quebec as we have seen had a seminary a hospital and a convent before it had a population It will be well to observe the origin of these institutions The Jesuits from the first had cherished the plan of a seminary for Huron boys at Quebec The Governor and the Company favored the design since not only would it be an efficient means of spreading the Faith and attaching the tribe to the French interest but the children would be pledges for the good behavior of the parents and hostages for the safety of missionaries and traders in the Indian towns M de Montmagny cognoit bien l importance de ce Seminaire pour la gloire de Nostre Seigneur et pour le commerce de ces Messieurs Relation sixteen thirty seven two hundred nine Cramoisy In the summer of sixteen thirty six Father Daniel descending from the Huron country worn emaciated his cassock patched and tattered and his shirt in rags brought with him a boy to whom two others were soon added and through the influence of the interpreter Nicollet the number was afterwards increased by several more One of them ran away two ate themselves to death a fourth was carried home by his father while three of those remaining stole a canoe loaded it with all they could lay their hands upon and escaped in triumph with their plunder Le Jeune Relation sixteen thirty seven fifty five fifty nine Ibid Relation sixteen thirty eight twenty three The beginning was not hopeful but the Jesuits persevered and at length established their seminary on a firm basis The Marquis de Gamache had given the Society six thousand crowns for founding a college at Quebec In sixteen thirty seven a year before the building of Harvard College the Jesuits began a wooden structure in the rear of the fort and here within one inclosure was the Huron seminary and the college for French boys Meanwhile the female children of both races were without instructors but a remedy was at hand At Alencon in sixteen oh three was born Marie Madeleine de Chauvigny a scion of the haute noblesse of Normandy Seventeen years later she was a young lady abundantly wilful and superabundantly enthusiastic one who in other circumstances might perhaps have made a romantic elopement and a mesalliance one But her impressible and ardent nature was absorbed in other objects Religion and its ministers possessed her wholly and all her enthusiasm was spent on works of charity and devotion Her father passionately fond of her resisted her inclination for the cloister and sought to wean her back to the world but she escaped from the chateau to a neighboring convent where she resolved to remain Her father followed carried her home and engaged her in a round of fetes and hunting parties in the midst of which she found herself surprised into a betrothal to M de la Peltrie a young gentleman of rank and character The marriage proved a happy one and Madame de la Peltrie with an excellent grace bore her part in the world she had wished to renounce After a union of five years her husband died and she was left a widow and childless at the age of twenty two She returned to the religious ardors of her girlhood again gave all her thoughts to devotion and charity and again resolved to be a nun She had heard of Canada and when Le Jeune s first Relations appeared she read them with avidity Alas wrote the Father is there no charitable and virtuous lady who will come to this country to gather up the blood of Christ by teaching His word to the little Indian girls His appeal found a prompt and vehement response from the breast of Madame de la Peltrie Thenceforth she thought of nothing but Canada In the midst of her zeal a fever seized her The physicians despaired but at the height of the disease the patient made a vow to saint Joseph that should God restore her to health she would build a house in honor of Him in Canada and give her life and her wealth to the instruction of Indian girls On the following morning say her biographers the fever had left her one There is a portrait of her taken at a later period of which a photograph is before me She has a semi religious dress hands clasped in prayer large dark eyes a smiling and mischievous mouth and a face somewhat pretty and very coquettish An engraving from the portrait is prefixed to the Notice Biographique de Madame de la Peltrie in Les Ursulines de Quebec I three hundred forty eight Meanwhile her relatives or those of her husband had confirmed her pious purposes by attempting to thwart them They pronounced her a romantic visionary incompetent to the charge of her property Her father too whose fondness for her increased with his advancing age entreated her to remain with him while he lived and to defer the execution of her plans till he should be laid in his grave From entreaties he passed to commands and at length threatened to disinherit her if she persisted The virtue of obedience for which she is extolled by her clerical biographers however abundantly exhibited in respect to those who held charge of her conscience was singularly wanting towards the parent who in the way of Nature had the best claim to its exercise and Madame de la Peltrie was more than ever resolved to go to Canada Her father on his part was urgent that she should marry again On this she took counsel of a Jesuit one who having seriously reflected before God suggested a device which to the heretical mind is a little startling but which commended itself to Madame de la Peltrie as fitted at once to soothe the troubled spirit of her father and to save her from the sin involved in the abandonment of her pious designs one Partagee ainsi entre l amour filial et la religion en proie aux plus poignantes angoisses elle s adressa a un religieux de la Compagnie de Jesus dont elle connaissait la prudence consommee et le supplia de l eclairer de ses lumieres Ce religieux apres y avoir serieusement reflechi devant Dieu lui repondit qu il croyait avoir trouve un moyen de tout concilier Casgrain Vie de Marie de l Incarnation two hundred forty three Among her acquaintance was M de Bernieres a gentleman of high rank great wealth and zealous devotion She wrote to him explained the situation and requested him to feign a marriage with her His sense of honor recoiled moreover in the fulness of his zeal he had made a vow of chastity and an apparent breach of it would cause scandal He consulted his spiritual director and a few intimate friends All agreed that the glory of God was concerned and that it behooved him to accept the somewhat singular overtures of the young widow one and request her hand from her father M de Chauvigny who greatly esteemed Bernieres was delighted and his delight was raised to transport at the dutiful and modest acquiescence of his daughter two A betrothal took place all was harmony and for a time no more was said of disinheriting Madame de la Peltrie or putting her in wardship one Enfin apres avoir longtemps implore les lumieres du ciel il remit toute l affaire entre les mains de son directeur et de quelques amis intimes Tous d un commun accord lui declarerent que la gloire de Dieu y etait interessee et qu il devait accepter Ibid two hundred forty four two The prudent young widow answered him with much respect and modesty that as she knew M de Bernieres to be a favorite with him she also preferred him to all others The above is from a letter of Marie de l Incarnation translated by Mother saint Thomas of the Ursuline convent of Quebec in her Life of Madame de la Peltrie forty one Compare Les Ursulines de Quebec ten and the Notice Biographique in the same volume Bernieres s scruples returned Divided between honor and conscience he postponed the marriage until at length M de Chauvigny conceived misgivings and again began to speak of disinheriting his daughter unless the engagement was fulfilled one Bernieres yielded and went with Madame de la Peltrie to consult the most eminent divines two A sham marriage took place and she and her accomplice appeared in public as man and wife Her relatives however had already renewed their attempts to deprive her of the control of her property A suit of what nature does not appear had been decided against her at Caen and she had appealed to the Parliament of Normandy Her lawyers were in despair but as her biographer justly observes the saints have resources which others have not A vow to saint Joseph secured his intercession and gained her case Another thought now filled her with agitation Her plans were laid and the time of action drew near How could she endure the distress of her father when he learned that she had deluded him with a false marriage and that she and all that was hers were bound for the wilderness of Canada Happily for him he fell ill and died in ignorance of the deceit that had been practised upon him three one Our virtuous widow did not lose courage As she had given her confidence to M de Bernieres she informed him of all that passed while she flattered her father each day telling him that this nobleman was too honorable to fail in keeping his word saint Thomas Life of Madame de la Peltrie forty two two He Bernieres went to stay at the house of a mutual friend where they had frequent opportunities of seeing each other and consulting the most eminent divines on the means of effecting this pretended marriage Ibid forty three three It will be of interest to observe the view taken of this pretended marriage by Madame de la Peltrie s Catholic biographers Charlevoix tells the story without comment but with apparent approval Sainte Foi in his Premieres Ursulines de France says that as God had taken her under His guidance we should not venture to criticize her Casgrain in his Vie de Marie de l Incarnation remarks Une telle conduite peut encore aujourd hui paraitre etrange a bien des personnes mais outre que l avenir fit bien voir que c etait une inspiration du ciel nous pouvons repondre avec un savant et pieux auteur que nous ne devons point juger ceux que Dieu se charge lui meme de conduire p two hundred forty seven Mother saint Thomas highly approves the proceeding and says Thus ended the pretended engagement of this virtuous lady and gentleman which caused at the time so much inquiry and excitement among the nobility in France and which after a lapse of two hundred years cannot fail exciting feelings of admiration in the heart of every virtuous woman Surprising as it may appear the book from which the above is taken was written a few years since in so called English for the instruction of the pupils in the Ursuline Convent at Quebec Whatever may be thought of the quality of Madame de la Peltrie s devotion there can be no reasonable doubt of its sincerity or its ardor and yet one can hardly fail to see in her the signs of that restless longing for eclat which with some women is a ruling passion When in company with Bernieres she passed from Alencon to Tours and from Tours to Paris an object of attention to nuns priests and prelates when the Queen herself summoned her to an interview it may be that the profound contentment of soul ascribed to her had its origin in sources not exclusively of the spirit At Tours she repaired to the Ursuline convent The Superior and all the nuns met her at the entrance of the cloister and separating into two rows as she appeared sang the Veni Creator while the bell of the monastery sounded its loudest peal Then they led her in triumph to their church sang Te Deum and while the honored guest knelt before the altar all the sisterhood knelt around her in a semicircle Their hearts beat high within them That day they were to know who of their number were chosen for the new convent of Quebec of which Madame de la Peltrie was to be the foundress and when their devotions were over they flung themselves at her feet each begging with tears that the lot might fall on her Aloof from this throng of enthusiastic suppliants stood a young nun Marie de saint Bernard too timid and too modest to ask the boon for which her fervent heart was longing It was granted without asking This delicate girl was chosen and chosen wisely Casgrain Vie de Marie de l Incarnation two hundred seventy one two hundred seventy three There is a long account of Marie de saint Bernard by Ragueneau in the Relation of sixteen fifty two Here it is said that she showed an unaccountable indifference as to whether she went to Canada or not which however was followed by an ardent desire to go There was another nun who stood apart silent and motionless a stately figure with features strongly marked and perhaps somewhat masculine one but if so they belied her for Marie de l Incarnation was a woman to the core For her there was no need of entreaties for she knew that the Jesuits had made her their choice as Superior of the new convent She was born forty years before at Tours of a good bourgeois family As she grew up towards maturity her qualities soon declared themselves She had uncommon talents and strong religious susceptibilities joined to a vivid imagination an alliance not always desirable under a form of faith where both are excited by stimulants so many and so powerful Like Madame de la Peltrie she married at the desire of her parents in her eighteenth year The marriage was not happy Her biographers say that there was no fault on either side Apparently it was a severe case of incompatibility She sought her consolation in the churches and kneeling in dim chapels held communings with Christ and the angels At the end of two years her husband died leaving her with an infant son She gave him to the charge of her sister abandoned herself to solitude and meditation and became a mystic of the intense and passional school Yet a strong maternal instinct battled painfully in her breast with a sense of religious vocation Dreams visions interior voices ecstasies revulsions periods of rapture and periods of deep dejection made up the agitated tissue of her life She fasted wore hair cloth scourged herself washed dishes among the servants and did their most menial work She heard in a trance a miraculous voice It was that of Christ promising to become her spouse Months and years passed full of troubled hopes and fears when again the voice sounded in her ear with assurance that the promise was fulfilled and that she was indeed his bride Now ensued phenomena which are not infrequent among Roman Catholic female devotees when unmarried or married unhappily and which have their source in the necessities of a woman s nature To her excited thought her divine spouse became a living presence and her language to him as recorded by herself is that of the most intense passion She went to prayer agitated and tremulous as if to a meeting with an earthly lover O my Love she exclaimed when shall I embrace you Have you no pity on me in the torments that I suffer Alas alas my Love my Beauty my Life instead of healing my pain you take pleasure in it Come let me embrace you and die in your sacred arms And again she writes Then as I was spent with fatigue I was forced to say My divine Love since you wish me to live I pray you let me rest a little that I may the better serve you and I promised him that afterward I would suffer myself to consume in his chaste and divine embraces two one There is an engraved portrait of her taken some years later of which a photograph is before me When she was in the world her stately proportions are said to have attracted general attention Her family name was Marie Guyard She was born on the eighteenth of October fifteen ninety nine two Allant a l oraison je tressaillois en moi meme et disois Allons dans la solitude mon cher amour afin que je vous

plaisez a mes maux Venez donc que je vous embrasse et que je meure entre vos bras sacrez The above passages from various pages of her journal will suffice though they give but an inadequate idea of these strange extravagances What is most astonishing is that a man of sense like Charlevoix in his Life of Marie de l Incarnation should extract them in full as matter of edification and evidence of saintship Her recent biographer the Abbe Casgrain refrains from quoting them though he mentions them approvingly as evincing fervor The Abbe Racine in his Discours a l Occasion du one hundred ninety twoeme Anniversaire de l heureuse Mort de la Ven Mere de l Incarnation delivered at Quebec in eighteen sixty four speaks of them as transcendent proofs of the supreme favor of Heaven Some of the pupils of Marie de l Incarnation also had mystical marriages with Christ and the impassioned rhapsodies of one of them being overheard she nearly lost her character as it was thought that she was apostrophsizing an earthly lover Clearly here is a case for the physiologist as well as the theologian and the holy widow as her biographers call her becomes an example and a lamentable one of the tendency of the erotic principle to ally itself with high religious excitement But the wings of imagination will tire and droop the brightest dream land of contemplative fancy grow dim and an abnormal tension of the faculties find its inevitable reaction at last From a condition of highest exaltation a mystical heaven of light and glory the unhappy dreamer fell back to a dreary earth or rather to an abyss of darkness and misery Her biographers tell us that she became a prey to dejection and thoughts of infidelity despair estrangement from God aversion to mankind pride vanity impurity and a supreme disgust at the rites of religion Exhaustion produced common sense and the dreams which had been her life now seemed a tissue of illusions Her confessor became a weariness to her and his words fell dead on her ear Indeed she conceived a repugnance to the holy man Her old and favorite confessor her oracle guide and comforter had lately been taken from her by promotion in the Church which may serve to explain her dejection and the new one jealous of his predecessor told her that all his counsels had been visionary and dangerous to her soul Having overwhelmed her with this announcement he left her apparently out of patience with her refractory and gloomy mood and she remained for several months deprived of spiritual guidance Casgrain one hundred ninety five one hundred ninety seven Two years elapsed before her mind recovered its tone when she soared once more in the seventh heaven of imaginative devotion Marie de l Incarnation we have seen was unrelenting in every practice of humiliation dressed in mean attire did the servants work nursed sick beggars and in her meditations taxed her brain with metaphysical processes of self annihilation And yet when one reads her Spiritual Letters the conviction of an enormous spiritual pride in the writer can hardly be repressed She aspired to that inner circle of the faithful that aristocracy of devotion which while the common herd of Christians are busied with the duties of life eschews the visible and the present and claims to live only for God In her strong maternal affection she saw a lure to divert her from the path of perfect saintship Love for her child long withheld her from becoming a nun but at last fortified by her confessor she left him to his fate took the vows and immured herself with the Ursulines of Tours The boy frenzied by his desertion and urged on by indignant relatives watched his opportunity and made his way into the refectory of the convent screaming to the horrified nuns to give him back his mother As he grew older her anxiety increased and at length she heard in her seclusion that he had fallen into bad company had left the relative who had sheltered him and run off no one knew whither The wretched mother torn with anguish hastened for consolation to her confessor who met her with stern upbraidings Yet even in this her intensest ordeal her enthusiasm and her native fortitude enabled her to maintain a semblance of calmness till she learned that the boy had been found and brought back Strange as it may seem this woman whose habitual state was one of mystical abstraction was gifted to a rare degree with the faculties most useful in the practical affairs of life She had spent several years in the house of her brother in law Here on the one hand her vigils visions and penances set utterly at nought the order of a well governed family while on the other she made amends to her impatient relative by able and efficient aid in the conduct of his public and private affairs Her biographers say and doubtless with truth that her heart was far away from these mundane interests yet her talent for business was not the less displayed Her spiritual guides were aware of it and saw clearly that gifts so useful to the world might be made equally useful to the Church Hence it was that she was chosen Superior of the convent which Madame de la Peltrie was about to endow at Quebec The combination of religious enthusiasm however extravagant and visionary with a talent for business is not very rare Nearly all the founders of monastic Orders are examples of it Yet it was from heaven itself that Marie de l Incarnation received her first vocation to Canada The miracle was in this wise In a dream she beheld a lady unknown to her She took her hand and the two journeyed together westward towards the sea They soon met one of the Apostles clothed all in white who with a wave of his hand directed them on their way They now entered on a scene of surpassing magnificence Beneath their feet was a pavement of squares of white marble spotted with vermilion and intersected with lines of vivid scarlet and all around stood monasteries of matchless architecture But the two travellers without stopping to admire moved swiftly on till they beheld the Virgin seated with her Infant Son on a small temple of white marble which served her as a throne She seemed about fifteen years of age and was of a ravishing beauty Her head was turned aside she was gazing fixedly on a wild waste of mountains and valleys half concealed in mist Marie de l Incarnation approached with outstretched arms adoring The vision bent towards her and smiling kissed her three times whereupon in a rapture the dreamer awoke Marie de l Incarnation recounts this dream at great length in her letters and Casgrain copies the whole verbatim as a revelation from God She told the vision to Father Dinet a Jesuit of Tours He was at no loss for an interpretation The land of mists and mountains was Canada and thither the Virgin called her Yet one mystery remained unsolved Who was the unknown companion of her dream Several years had passed and signs from heaven and inward voices had raised to an intense fervor her zeal for her new vocation when for the first time she saw Madame de la Peltrie on her visit to the convent at Tours and recognized on the instant the lady of her nocturnal vision No one can be surprised at this who has considered with the slightest attention the phenomena of religious enthusiasm On the fourth of May sixteen thirty nine Madame de la Peltrie Marie de l Incarnation Marie de saint Bernard and another Ursuline embarked at Dieppe for Canada In the ship were also three young hospital nuns sent out to found at Quebec a Hotel Dieu endowed by the famous niece of Richelieu the Duchesse d Aiguillon Juchereau Histoire de l Hotel Dieu ae Quebec four Here too were the Jesuits Chaumonot and Poncet on the way to their mission together with Father Vimont who was to succeed Le Jeune in his post of Superior To the nuns pale from their cloistered seclusion there was a strange and startling novelty in this new world of life and action the ship the sailors the shouts of command the flapping of sails the salt wind and the boisterous sea The voyage was long and tedious Sometimes they lay in their berths sea sick and woe begone sometimes they sang in choir on deck or heard mass in the cabin Once on a misty morning a wild cry of alarm startled crew and passengers alike A huge iceberg was drifting close upon them The peril was extreme Madame de la Peltrie clung to Marie de l Incarnation who stood perfectly calm and gathered her gown about her feet that she might drown with decency It is scarcely necessary to say that they were saved by a vow to the Virgin and saint Joseph Vimont offered it in behalf of all the company and the ship glided into the open sea unharmed They arrived at Tadoussac on the fifteenth of July and the nuns ascended to Quebec in a small craft deeply laden with salted codfish on which uncooked they subsisted until the first of August when they reached their destination Cannon roared welcome from the fort and batteries all labor ceased the storehouses were closed and the zealous Montmagny with a train of priests and soldiers met the new comers at the landing All the nuns fell prostrate and kissed the sacred soil of Canada one They heard mass at the church dined at the fort and presently set forth to visit the new settlement of Sillery four miles above Quebec one Juchereau fourteen Le Clerc II thirty three

river and the woody heights behind were clustered the small log cabins of a number of Algonquin converts together with a church a mission house and an infirmary the whole surrounded by a palisade It was to this place that the six nuns were now conducted by the Jesuits The scene delighted and edified them and in the transports of their zeal they seized and kissed every female Indian child on whom

nuns of the Hotel Dieu soon after took up their abode at Sillery whence they removed to a house built for them at Quebec by their foundress the Duchesse d Aiguillon The Ursulines in the absence of better quarters were lodged at first in a small wooden tenement under the rock of Quebec at the brink of the river Here they were soon beset with such a host of children that the floor of their wretched tenement was covered with beds and their toil had no respite Then came the small pox carrying death and terror among the neighboring Indians These thronged to Quebec in misery and desperation begging succor from the French The labors both of the Ursulines and of the hospital nuns were prodigious In the infected air of their miserable hovels where sick and dying savages covered the floor and were packed one above another in berths amid all that is most distressing and most revolting with little food and less sleep these women passed the rough beginning of their new life Several of them fell ill But the excess of the evil at length brought relief for so many of the Indians died in these pest houses that the survivors shunned them in horror But how did these women bear themselves amid toils so arduous A pleasant record has come down to us of one of them that fair and delicate girl Marie de saint Bernard called in the convent Sister saint Joseph who had been chosen at Tours as the companion of Marie de l Incarnation Another Ursuline writing at a period when the severity of their labors was somewhat relaxed says Her disposition is charming In our times of recreation she often makes us cry with laughing it would be hard to be melancholy when she is near Lettre de la Mere Ste Claire a une de ses Soeurs Ursulines de Paris Quebec two Sept sixteen forty See Les Ursulines de Quebec I thirty eight It was three years later before the Ursulines and their pupils took possession of a massive convent of stone built for them on the site which they still occupy Money had failed before the work was done and the interior was as unfinished as a barn The interior was finished after a year or two with cells as usual There were four chimneys with fireplaces burning a hundred and seventy five cords of wood in a winter and though the nuns were boxed up in beds which closed like chests Marie de l Incarnation complains bitterly of the cold See her letter of Aug twenty six sixteen forty four Beside the cloister stood a large ash tree and it stands there still Beneath its shade says the convent tradition Marie de l Incarnation and her nuns instructed the Indian children in the truths of salvation but it might seem rash to affirm that their teachings were always either wise or useful since Father Vimont tells us approvingly that they reared their pupils in so chaste a horror of the other sex that a little girl whom a man had playfully taken by the hand ran crying to a bowl of water to wash off the unhallowed influence Vimont Relation sixteen forty two one hundred twelve Cramoisy Now and henceforward one figure stands nobly conspicuous in this devoted sisterhood Marie de l Incarnation no longer lost in the vagaries of an insane mysticism but engaged in the duties of Christian charity and the responsibilities of an arduous post displays an ability a fortitude and an earnestness which command respect and admiration Her mental intoxication had ceased or recurred only at intervals and false excitements no longer sustained her She was racked with constant anxieties about her son and was often in a condition described by her biographers as a deprivation of all spiritual consolations Her position was a very difficult one She herself speaks of her life as a succession of crosses and humiliations Some of these were due to Madame de la Peltrie who in a freak of enthusiasm abandoned her Ursulines for a time as we shall presently see leaving them in the utmost destitution There were dissensions to be healed among them and money everything in short to be provided Marie de l Incarnation in her saddest moments neither failed in judgment nor slackened in effort She carried on a vast correspondence embracing every one in France who could aid her infant community with money or influence she harmonized and regulated it with excellent skill and in the midst of relentless austerities she was loved as a mother by her pupils and dependants Catholic writers extol her as a saint one Protestants may see in her a Christian heroine admirable with all her follies and her faults one There is a letter extant from Sister Anne de Ste Claire an Ursuline who came to Quebec in sixteen forty written soon after her arrival and containing curious evidence that a reputation of saintship already attached to Marie de l Incarnation When I spoke to her writes Sister Anne speaking of her first interview I perceived in the air a certain odor of sanctity which gave me the sensation of an agreeable perfume See the letter in a recent Catholic work Les Ursulines de Quebec I thirty eight where the passage is printed in Italics as worthy the especial attention of the pious reader The traditions of the Ursulines are full of the virtues of Madame de la Peltrie her humility her charity her penances and her acts of mortification No doubt with some little allowance these traditions are true but there is more of reason than of uncharitableness in the belief that her zeal would have been less ardent and sustained if it had had fewer spectators She was now fairly committed to the conventual life her enthusiasm was kept within prescribed bounds and she was no longer mistress of her own movements On the one hand she was anxious to accumulate merits against the Day of Judgment and on the other she had a keen appreciation of the applause which the sacrifice of her fortune and her acts of piety had gained for her Mortal vanity takes many shapes Sometimes it arrays itself in silk and jewels sometimes it walks in sackcloth and speaks the language of self abasement In the convent as in the world the fair devotee thirsted for admiration The halo of saintship glittered in her eyes like a diamond crown and she aspired to outshine her sisters in humility She was as sincere as Simeon Stylites on his column and like him found encouragement and comfort in the gazing and wondering eyes below Madame de la Peltrie died in her convent in sixteen seventy one Marie de l Incarnation died the following year She had the consolation of knowing that her son had fulfilled her ardent wishes and become a priest CHAPTER XV sixteen thirty six sixteen forty two VILLEMARIE DE MONTREAL DAUVERSIERE AND THE VOICE FROM HEAVEN ABBE OLIER THEIR SCHEMES THE SOCIETY OF NOTRE DAME DE MONTREAL MAISONNEUVE DEVOUT LADIES MADEMOISELLE MANCE MARGUERITE BOURGEOIS THE MONTREALISTS AT QUEBEC JEALOUSY QUARRELS ROMANCE AND DEVOTION EMBARKATION FOUNDATION OF MONTREAL We come now to an enterprise as singular in its character as it proved important in its results At La Fleche in Anjou dwelt one Jerome le Royer de la Dauversiere receiver of taxes His portrait shows us a round bourgeois face somewhat heavy perhaps decorated with a slight moustache and redeemed by bright and earnest eyes On his head he wears a black skull cap and over his ample shoulders spreads a stiff white collar of wide expanse and studious plainness Though he belonged to the noblesse his look is that of a grave burgher of good renown and sage deportment Dauversiere was however an enthusiastic devotee of mystical tendencies who whipped himself with a scourge of small chains till his shoulders were one wound wore a belt with more than twelve hundred sharp points and invented for himself other torments which filled his confessor with admiration Fancamp in Faillon Vie de Mlle Mance Introduction One day while at his devotions he heard an inward voice commanding him to become the founder of a new Order of hospital nuns and he was further ordered to establish on the island called Montreal in Canada a hospital or Hotel Dieu to be conducted by these nuns But Montreal was a wilderness and the hospital would have no patients Therefore in order to supply them the island must first be colonized Dauversiere was greatly perplexed On the one hand the voice of Heaven must be obeyed on the other he had a wife six children and a very moderate fortune Faillon Vie de Mlle Mance Introduction Dollier de Casson Hist de Montreal MS Les Veritables Motifs des Messieurs et Dames de Montreal twenty five Juchereau thirty three Again there was at Paris a young priest about twenty eight years of age Jean Jacques Olier afterwards widely known as founder of the Seminary of saint Sulpice Judged by his engraved portrait his countenance though marked both with energy and intellect was anything but prepossessing Every lineament proclaims the priest Yet the Abbe Olier has high titles to esteem He signalized his piety it is true by the most disgusting exploits of self mortification but at the same time he was strenuous in his efforts to reform the people and the clergy So zealous was he for good morals that he drew upon himself the imputation of a leaning to the heresy of the Jansenists a suspicion strengthened by his opposition to certain priests who to secure the faithful in their allegiance justified them in lives of licentiousness Faillon Vie de M Olier II one hundred eighty eight Yet Olier s catholicity was past attaintment and in his horror of Jansenists he yielded to the Jesuits alone He was praying in the ancient church of saint Germain des Pres when like Dauversiere he thought he heard a voice from Heaven saying that he was destined to be a light to the Gentiles It is recorded as a mystic coincidence attending this miracle that the choir was at that very time chanting the words Lumen ad revelationem Gentium one and it seems to have occurred neither to Olier nor to his biographer that falling on the ear of the rapt worshipper they might have unconsciously suggested the supposed revelation But there was a further miracle An inward voice told Olier that he was to form a society of priests and establish them on the island called Montreal in Canada for the propagation of the True Faith and writers old and recent assert that while both he and Dauversiere were totally ignorant of Canadian geography they suddenly found themselves in possession they knew not how of the most exact details concerning Montreal its size shape situation soil climate and productions one Memoires Autographes de M Olier cited by Faillon in Histoire de la Colonie Francaise I three hundred eighty four The annual volumes of the Jesuit Relations issuing from the renowned press of Cramoisy were at this time spread broadcast throughout France and in the circles of haute devotion Canada and its missions were everywhere the themes of enthusiastic discussion while Champlain in his published works had long before pointed out Montreal as the proper site for a settlement But we are entering a region of miracle and it is superfluous to look far for explanations The illusion in these cases is a part of the history Dauversiere pondered the revelation he had received and the more he pondered the more was he convinced that it came from God He therefore set out for Paris to find some means of accomplishing the task assigned him Here as he prayed before an image of the Virgin in the church of Notre Dame he fell into an ecstasy and beheld a vision I should he false to the integrity of history writes his biographer if I did not relate it here And he adds that the reality of this celestial favor is past doubting inasmuch as Dauversiere himself told it to his daughters Christ the Virgin and saint Joseph appeared before him He saw them distinctly Then he heard Christ ask three times of his Virgin Mother Where can I find a faithful servant On which the Virgin taking him Dauversiere by the hand replied See Lord here is that faithful servant and Christ with a benignant smile received him into his service promising to bestow on him wisdom and strength to do his work Faillon Vie de Mlle Mance Introduction xxviii The Abbe Ferland in his Histoire du Canada passes over the miracles in silence From Paris he went to the neighboring chateau of Meudon which overlooks the valley of the Seine not far from saint Cloud Entering the gallery of the old castle he saw a priest approaching him It was Olier Now we are told that neither of these men had ever seen or heard of the other and yet says the pious historian impelled by a kind of inspiration they knew each other at once even to the depths of their hearts saluted each other by name as we read of saint Paul the Hermit and saint Anthony and of saint Dominic and saint Francis and ran to embrace each other like two friends who had met after a long separation Ibid La Colonie Francaise I three hundred ninety Monsieur exclaimed Olier I know your design and I go to commend it to God at the holy altar And he went at once to say mass in the chapel Dauversiere received the communion at his hands and then they walked for three hours in the park discussing their plans They were of one mind in respect both to objects and means and when they parted Olier gave Dauversiere a hundred louis saying This is to begin the work of God They proposed to found at Montreal three religious communities three being the mystic number one of secular priests to direct the colonists and convert the Indians one of nuns to nurse the sick and one of nuns to teach the Faith to the children white and red To borrow their own phrases they would plant the banner of Christ in an abode of desolation and a haunt of demons and to this end a band of priests and women were to invade the wilderness and take post between the fangs of the Iroquois But first they must make a colony and to do so must raise money Olier had pious and wealthy penitents Dauversiere had a friend the Baron de Fancamp devout as himself and far richer Anxious for his soul and satisfied that the enterprise was an inspiration of God he was eager to bear part in it Olier soon found three others and the six together formed the germ of the Society of Notre Dame de Montreal Among them they raised the sum of seventy five thousand livres equivalent to about as many dollars at the present day Dollier de Casson Histoire de Montreal MS also Belmont Histoire du Canada two Juchereau doubles the sum Faillon agrees with Dollier On all that relates to the early annals of Montreal a flood of new light has been thrown by the Abbe Faillon As a priest of saint Sulpice he had ready access to the archives of the Seminaries of Montreal and Paris and to numerous other ecclesiastical depositories which would have been closed hopelessly against a layman and a heretic It is impossible to commend too highly the zeal diligence exactness and extent of his conscientious researches His credulity is enormous and he is completely in sympathy with the supernaturalists of whom he writes in other words he identifies himself with his theme and is indeed a fragment of the seventeenth century still extant in the nineteenth He is minute to prolixity and abounds in extracts and citations from the ancient manuscripts which his labors have unearthed In short the Abbe is a prodigy of patience and industry and if he taxes the patience of his readers he also rewards it abundantly Such of his original authorities as have proved accessible are before me including a considerable number of manuscripts Among these that of Dollier de Casson Histoire de Montreal as cited above is the most important The copy in my possession was made from the original in the Mazarin Library Now to look for a moment at their plan Their eulogists say and with perfect truth that from a worldly point of view it was mere folly The partners mutually bound themselves to seek no return for the money expended Their profit was to be reaped in the skies and indeed there was none to be reaped on earth The feeble settlement at Quebec was at this time in danger of utter ruin for the Iroquois enraged at the attacks made on them by Champlain had begun a fearful course of retaliation and the very existence of the colony trembled in the balance But if Quebec was exposed to their ferocious inroads Montreal was incomparably more so A settlement here would be a perilous outpost a hand thrust into the jaws of the tiger It would provoke attack and lie almost in the path of the war parties The associates could gain nothing by the fur trade for they would not be allowed to share in it On the other hand danger apart the place was an excellent one for a mission for here met two great rivers the saint Lawrence with its countless tributaries flowed in from the west while the Ottawa descended from the north and Montreal embraced by their uniting waters was the key to a vast inland navigation Thither the Indians would naturally resort and thence the missionaries could make their way into the heart of a boundless heathendom None of the ordinary motives of colonization had part in this design It owed its conception and its birth to religious zeal alone The island of Montreal belonged to Lauson former president of the great company of the Hundred Associates and as we have seen his son had a monopoly of fishing in the saint Lawrence Dauversiere and Fancamp after much diplomacy succeeded in persuading the elder Lauson to transfer his title to them and as there was a defect in it they also obtained a grant of the island from the Hundred Associates its original owners who however reserved to themselves its western extremity as a site for a fort and storehouses one At the same time the younger Lauson granted them a right of fishery within two leagues of the shores of the island for which they were to make a yearly acknowledgment of ten pounds of fish A confirmation of these grants was obtained from the King Dauversiere and his companions were now seigneurs of Montreal They were empowered to appoint a governor and to establish courts from which there was to be an appeal to the Supreme Court of Quebec supposing such to exist They were excluded from the fur trade and forbidden to build castles or forts other than such as were necessary for defence against the Indians Donation et Transport de la

de la Nouvelle France aux Sieurs Chevrier et le Royer MS Lettres de Ratification MS Acte qui prouve que les Sieurs Chevrier de Fancamps et Royer de la Dauversiere n ont stipule qu au nom de la Compagnie de Montreal MS From copies of other documents before me it appears that in sixteen fifty nine the reserved portion of the island was also ceded to the Company of Montreal See also Edits Ordonnances Royaux et cetera I twenty twenty six Quebec eighteen fifty four Their title assured they matured their plan First they would send out forty men to take possession of Montreal intrench themselves and raise crops Then they would build a house for the priests and two convents for the nuns Meanwhile Olier was toiling at Vaugirard on the outskirts of Paris to inaugurate the seminary of priests and Dauversiere at La Fleche to form the community of hospital nuns How the school nuns were provided for we shall see hereafter The colony it will be observed was for the convents not the convents for the colony The Associates needed a soldier governor to take charge of their forty men and directed as they supposed by Providence they found one wholly to their mind This was Paul de Chomedey Sieur de Maisonneuve a devout and valiant gentleman who in long service among the heretics of Holland had kept his faith intact and had held himself resolutely aloof from the license that surrounded him He loved his profession of arms and wished to consecrate his sword to the Church Past all comparison he is the manliest figure that appears in this group of zealots The piety of the design the miracles that inspired it the adventure and the peril all combined to charm him and he eagerly embraced the enterprise His father opposed his purpose but he met him with a text of saint Mark There is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father for my sake but he shall receive an hundred fold On this the elder Maisonneuve deceived by his own worldliness imagined that the plan covered some hidden speculation from which enormous profits were expected and therefore withdrew his opposition Faillon La Colonie Francaise I four hundred nine Their scheme was ripening fast when both Olier and Dauversiere were assailed by one of those revulsions of spirit to which saints of the ecstatic school are naturally liable Dauversiere in particular was a prey to the extremity of dejection uncertainty and misgiving What had he a family man to do with ventures beyond sea Was it not his first duty to support his wife and children Could he not fulfil all his obligations as a Christian by reclaiming the wicked and relieving the poor at La Fleche Plainly he had doubts that his vocation was genuine If we could raise the curtain of his domestic life perhaps we should find him beset by wife and daughters tearful and wrathful inveighing against his folly and imploring him to provide a support for them before squandering his money to plant a convent of nuns in a wilderness How long his fit of dejection lasted does not appear but at length one he set himself again to his appointed work Olier too emerging from the clouds and darkness found faith once more and again placed himself at the head of the great enterprise two one Faillon Vie de Mlle Mance Introduction xxxv two Faillon Vie de M Olier devotes twenty one pages to the history of his fit of nervous depression There was imperative need of more money and Dauversiere under judicious guidance was active in obtaining it This miserable victim of illusions had a squat uncourtly figure and was no proficient in the graces either of manners or of speech hence his success in commending his objects to persons of rank and wealth is set down as one of the many miracles which attended the birth of Montreal But zeal and earnestness are in themselves a power and the ground had been well marked out and ploughed for him in advance That attractive though intricate subject of study the female mind has always engaged the attention of priests more especially in countries where as in France women exert a strong social and political influence The art of kindling the flames of zeal and the more difficult art of directing and controlling them have been themes of reflection the most diligent and profound Accordingly we find that a large proportion of the money raised for this enterprise was contributed by devout ladies Many of them became members of the Association of Montreal which was eventually increased to about forty five persons chosen for their devotion and their wealth Olier and his associates had resolved though not from any collapse of zeal to postpone the establishment of the seminary and the college until after a settlement should be formed The hospital however might they thought be begun at once for blood and blows would be the assured portion of the first settlers At least a discreet woman ought to embark with the first colonists as their nurse and housekeeper Scarcely was the need recognized when it was supplied Mademoiselle Jeanne Mance was born of an honorable family of Nogent le Roi and in sixteen forty was thirty four years of age These Canadian heroines began their religious experiences early Of Marie de l Incarnation we read that at the age of seven Christ appeared to her in a vision Casgrain Vie de Marie de l Incarnation seventy eight and the biographer of Mademoiselle Mance assures us with admiring gravity that at the same tender age she bound herself to God by a vow of perpetual chastity Faillon Vie de Mlle Mance I three This singular infant in due time became a woman of a delicate constitution and manners graceful yet dignified Though an earnest devotee she felt no vocation for the cloister yet while still in the world she led the life of a nun The Jesuit Relations and the example of Madame de la Peltrie of whom she had heard inoculated her with the Canadian enthusiasm then so prevalent and under the pretence of visiting relatives she made a journey to Paris to take counsel of certain priests Of one thing she was assured the Divine will called her to Canada but to what end she neither knew nor asked to know for she abandoned herself as an atom to be borne to unknown destinies on the breath of God At Paris Father saint Jure a Jesuit assured her that her vocation to Canada was past doubt a call from Heaven while Father Rapin a Recollet spread abroad the fame of her virtues and introduced her to many ladies of rank wealth and zeal Then well supplied with money for any pious work to which she might be summoned she journeyed to Rochelle whence ships were to sail for New France Thus far she had been kept in ignorance of the plan with regard to Montreal but now Father La Place a Jesuit revealed it to her On the day after her arrival at Rochelle as she entered the Church of the Jesuits she met Dauversiere coming out Then says her biographer these two persons who had never seen nor heard of each other were enlightened supernaturally whereby their most hidden thoughts were mutually made known as had happened already with M Olier and this same M de la Dauversiere Faillon Vie de Mlle Mance I eighteen Here again the Abbe Ferland with his usual good sense tacitly rejects the supernaturalism A long conversation ensued between them and the delights of this interview were never effaced from the mind of Mademoiselle Mance She used to speak of it like a seraph writes one of her nuns and far better than many a learned doctor could have done La Soeur Morin Annales des Hospitalieres de Villemarie MS cited by Faillon She had found her destiny The ocean the wilderness the solitude the Iroquois nothing daunted her She would go to Montreal with Maisonneuve and his forty men Yet when the vessel was about to sail a new and sharp misgiving seized her How could she a woman not yet bereft of youth or charms live alone in the forest among a troop of soldiers Her scruples were relieved by two of the men who at the last moment refused to embark without their wives and by a young woman who impelled by enthusiasm escaped from her friends and took passage in spite of them in one of the vessels All was ready the ships set sail but Olier Dauversiere and Fancamp remained at home as did also the other Associates with the exception of Maisonneuve and Mademoiselle Mance In the following February an impressive scene took place in the Church of Notre Dame at Paris The Associates at this time numbering about forty five Dollier de Casson A D sixteen forty one forty two MS Vimont says thirty five with Olier at their head assembled before the altar of the Virgin and by a solemn ceremonial consecrated Montreal to the Holy Family Henceforth it was to be called Villemarie de Montreal Vimont Relation sixteen forty two

earth founders respectively of the three destined communities Olier Dauversiere and a maiden of Troyes Marguerite Bourgeoys the seminary to be consecrated to Christ the Hotel Dieu to saint Joseph and the college to the Virgin But we are anticipating a little for it was several years as yet before Marguerite Bourgeoys took an active part in the work of Montreal She was the daughter of a respectable tradesman and was now twenty two years of age Her portrait has come down to us and her face is a mirror of frankness loyalty and womanly tenderness Her qualities were those of good sense conscientiousness and a warm heart She had known no miracles ecstasies or trances and though afterwards when her religious susceptibilities had reached a fuller development a few such are recorded of her yet even the Abbe Faillon with the best intentions can credit her with but a meagre allowance of these celestial favors Though in the midst of visionaries she distrusted the supernatural and avowed her belief that in His government of the world God does not often set aside its ordinary laws Her religion was of the affections and was manifested in an absorbing devotion to duty She had felt no vocation to the cloister but had taken the vow of chastity and was attached as an externe to the Sisters of the Congregation of Troyes who were fevered with eagerness to go to Canada Marguerite however was content to wait until there was a prospect that she could do good by going and it was not till the year sixteen fifty three that renouncing an inheritance and giving all she had to the poor she embarked for the savage scene of her labors To this day in crowded school rooms of Montreal and Quebec fit monuments of her unobtrusive virtue her successors instruct the children of the poor and embalm the pleasant memory of Marguerite Bourgeoys In the martial figure of Maisonneuve and the fair form of this gentle nun we find the true heroes of Montreal For Marguerite Bourgeoys see her life by Faillon Maisonneuve with his forty men and four women reached Quebec too late to ascend to Montreal that season They encountered distrust jealousy and opposition The agents of the Company of the Hundred Associates looked on them askance and the Governor of Quebec Montmagny saw a rival governor in Maisonneuve Every means was used to persuade the adventurers to abandon their project and settle at Quebec Montmagny called a council of the principal persons of his colony who gave it as their opinion that the new comers had better exchange Montreal for the Island of Orleans where they would be in a position to give and receive succor while by persisting in their first design they would expose themselves to destruction and be of use to nobody Juchereau thirty two Faillon Colonie Francaise I four hundred twenty three Maisonneuve who was present expressed his surprise that they should assume to direct his affairs I have not come here he said to deliberate but to act It is my duty and my honor to found a colony at Montreal and I would go if every tree were an Iroquois La Tour Memoire de Laval Liv VIII Belmont Histoire du Canada three At Quebec there was little ability and no inclination to shelter the new colonists for the winter and they would have fared ill but for the generosity of M Puiseaux who lived not far distant at a place called saint Michel This devout and most hospitable person made room for them all in his rough but capacious dwelling Their neighbors were the hospital nuns then living at the mission of Sillery in a substantial but comfortless house of stone where amidst destitution sickness and irrepressible disgust at the filth of the savages whom they had in charge they were laboring day and night with devoted assiduity Among the minor ills which beset them were the eccentricities of one of their lay sisters crazed with religious enthusiasm who had the care of their poultry and domestic animals of which she was accustomed to inquire one by one if they loved God when not receiving an immediate answer in the affirmative she would instantly put them to death telling them that their impiety deserved no better fate Juchereau forty five A great mortification to these excellent nuns was the impossibility of keeping their white dresses clean among their Indian patients so that they were forced to dye them with butternut juice They were the Hospitalieres who had come over in sixteen thirty nine At saint Michel Maisonneuve employed his men in building boats to ascend to Montreal and in various other labors for the behoof of the future colony Thus the winter wore away but as celestial minds are not exempt from ire Montmagny and Maisonneuve fell into a quarrel The twenty fifth of January was Maisonneuve s fete day and as he was greatly beloved by his followers they resolved to celebrate the occasion Accordingly an hour and a half before daylight they made a general discharge of their muskets and cannon The sound reached Quebec two or three miles distant startling the Governor from his morning slumbers and his indignation was redoubled when he heard it again at night for Maisonneuve pleased at the attachment of his men had feasted them and warmed their hearts with a distribution of wine Montmagny jealous of his authority resented these demonstrations as an infraction of it affirming that they had no right to fire their pieces without his consent and arresting the principal offender one Jean Gory he put him in irons On being released a few days after his companions welcomed him with great rejoicing and Maisonneuve gave them all a feast He himself came in during the festivity drank the health of the company shook hands with the late prisoner placed him at the head of the table and addressed him as follows Jean Gory you have been put in irons for me you had the pain and I the affront For that I add ten crowns to your wages Then turning to the others My boys he said though Jean Gory has been misused you must not lose heart for that but drink all of you to the health of the man in irons When we are once at Montreal we shall be our own masters and can fire our cannon when we please

Montmagny was wroth when this was reported to him and on the ground that what had passed was contrary to the service of the King and the authority of the Governor he summoned Gory and six others before him and put them separately under oath Their evidence failed to establish a case against their commander but thenceforth there was great coldness between the powers of Quebec and Montreal Early in May Maisonneuve and his followers embarked They had gained an unexpected recruit during the winter in the person of Madame de la Peltrie The piety the novelty and the romance of their enterprise all had their charms for the fair enthusiast and an irresistible impulse imputed by a slandering historian to the levity of her sex La Tour Memoire de Laval Liv VIII urged her to share their fortunes Her zeal was more admired by the Montrealists whom she joined than by the Ursulines whom she abandoned She carried off all the furniture she had lent them and left them in the utmost destitution Charlevoix Vie de Marie de l Incarnation two hundred seventy nine Casgrain Vie de Marie de l Incarnation three hundred thirty three Nor did she remain quiet after reaching Montreal but was presently seized with a longing to visit the Hurons and preach the Faith in person to those benighted heathen It needed all the eloquence of a Jesuit lately returned from that most arduous mission to convince her that the attempt would be as useless as rash saint Thomas Life of Madame de la Peltrie ninety eight It was the eighth of May when Maisonneuve and his followers embarked at saint Michel and as the boats deep laden with men arms and stores moved slowly on their way the forest with leaves just opening in the warmth of spring lay on their right hand and on their left in a flattering semblance of tranquillity and peace But behind woody islets in tangled thickets and damp ravines and in the shade and stillness of the columned woods lurked everywhere a danger and a terror What shall we say of these adventurers of Montreal of these who bestowed their wealth and far more of these who sacrificed their peace and risked their lives on an enterprise at once so romantic and so devout Surrounded as they were with illusions false lights and false shadows breathing an atmosphere of miracle compassed about with angels and devils urged with stimulants most powerful though unreal their minds drugged as it were to preternatural excitement it is very difficult to judge of them High merit without doubt there was in some of their number but one may beg to be spared the attempt to measure or define it To estimate a virtue involved in conditions so anomalous demands perhaps a judgment more than human The Roman Church sunk in disease and corruption when the Reformation began was roused by that fierce trumpet blast to purge and brace herself anew Unable to advance she drew back to the fresher and comparatively purer life of the past and the fervors of mediaeval Christianity were renewed in the sixteenth century In many of its aspects this enterprise of Montreal belonged to the time of the first Crusades The spirit of Godfrey de Bouillon lived again in Chomedey de Maisonneuve and in Marguerite Bourgeoys was realized that fair ideal of Christian womanhood a flower of Earth expanding in the rays of Heaven which soothed with gentle influence the wildness of a barbarous age On the seventeenth of May sixteen forty two Maisonneuve s little flotilla a pinnace a flat bottomed craft moved by sails and two row boats Dollier de Casson A D sixteen forty one forty two MS approached Montreal and all on board raised in unison a hymn of praise Montmagny was with them to deliver the island in behalf of the Company of the Hundred Associates to Maisonneuve representative of the Associates of Montreal Le Clerc II fifty fifty one And here too was Father Vimont Superior of the missions for the Jesuits had been prudently invited to accept the spiritual charge of the young colony On the following day they glided along the green and solitary shores now thronged with the life of a busy city and landed on the spot which Champlain thirty one years before had chosen as the fit site of a settlement Pioneers of France three hundred thirty three It was the Place Royale of Champlain It was a tongue or triangle of land formed by the junction of a rivulet with the saint Lawrence and known afterwards as Point Calliere The rivulet was bordered by a meadow and beyond rose the forest with its vanguard of scattered trees Early spring flowers were blooming in the young grass and birds of varied plumage flitted among the boughs Dollier de Casson A D sixteen forty one forty two MS Maisonneuve sprang ashore and fell on his knees His followers imitated his example and all joined their voices in enthusiastic songs of thanksgiving Tents baggage arms and stores were landed An altar was raised on a pleasant spot near at hand and Mademoiselle Mance with Madame de la Peltrie aided by her servant Charlotte Barre decorated it with a taste which was the admiration of the beholders Morin Annales MS cited by Faillon La Colonie Francaise I four hundred forty also Dollier de Casson A D

willing spectator and Maisonneuve a warlike figure erect and tall his men clustering around him soldiers sailors artisans and laborers all alike soldiers at need They kneeled in reverent silence as the Host was raised aloft and when the rite was over the priest turned and addressed them You are a grain of mustard seed that shall rise and grow till its branches overshadow the earth You are few but your work is the work of God His smile is on you and your children shall fill the Land Dollier de Casson MS as above Vimont in the Relation of sixteen forty two p eighty seven briefly mentions the ceremony The afternoon waned the sun sank behind the western forest and twilight came on Fireflies were twinkling over the darkened meadow They caught them tied them with threads into shining festoons and hung them before the altar where the Host remained exposed Then they pitched their tents lighted their bivouac fires stationed their guards and lay down to rest Such was the birth night of Montreal The Associates of Montreal published in sixteen forty three a thick pamphlet in quarto entitled Les Veritables Motifs de Messieurs et Dames de la Societe de Notre Dame de Montreal pour la Conversion des Sauvages de la Nouvelle France It was written as an answer to aspersions cast upon them apparently by persons attached to the great Company of New France known as the Hundred Associates and affords a curious exposition of the spirit of their enterprise It is excessively rare but copies of the essential portions are before me The following is a characteristic extract Vous dites que l

BRETHREN HE RETURNS TO CANADA The waters of the saint Lawrence rolled through a virgin wilderness where in the vastness of the lonely woodlands civilized man found a precarious harborage at three points only at Quebec at Montreal and at Three Rivers Here and in the scattered missions was the whole of New France a population of some three hundred souls in all And now over these miserable settlements rose a war cloud of frightful portent It was thirty two years since Champlain had first attacked the Iroquois See Pioneers of France three hundred eighteen They had nursed their wrath for more than a generation and at length their hour was come The Dutch traders at Fort Orange now Albany had supplied them with fire arms The Mohawks the most easterly of the Iroquois nations had among their seven or eight hundred warriors no less than three hundred armed with the arquebuse a weapon somewhat like the modern carbine one They were masters of the thunderbolts which in the hands of Champlain had struck terror into their hearts one Vimont Relation sixteen forty three sixty two The Mohawks were the Agnies or Agneronons of the old French writers According to the Journal of New Netherland a contemporary Dutch document see Colonial Documents of New York I one hundred seventy nine the Dutch at Fort Orange had supplied the Mohawks with four hundred guns the profits of the trade which was free to the settlers blinding them to the danger We have surveyed in the introductory chapter the character and organization of this ferocious people their confederacy of five nations bound together by a peculiar tie of clanship their chiefs half hereditary half elective their government an oligarchy in form and a democracy in spirit their minds thoroughly savage yet marked here and there with traits of a vigorous development The war which they had long waged with the Hurons was carried on by the Senecas and the other Western nations of their league while the conduct of hostilities against the French and their Indian allies in Lower Canada was left to the Mohawks In parties of from ten to a hundred or more they would leave their towns on the River Mohawk descend Lake Champlain and the River Richelieu lie in ambush on the banks of the saint Lawrence and attack the passing boats or canoes Sometimes they hovered about the fortifications of Quebec and Three Rivers killing stragglers or luring armed parties into ambuscades They followed like hounds on the trail of travellers and hunters broke in upon unguarded camps at midnight and lay in wait for days and weeks to intercept the Huron traders on their yearly descent to Quebec Had they joined to their ferocious courage the discipline and the military knowledge that belong to civilization they could easily have blotted out New France from the map and made the banks of the saint Lawrence once more a solitude but though the most formidable of savages they were savages only In the early morning of the second of August sixteen forty two For the date see Lalemant Relation des Hurons sixteen forty seven eighteen twelve Huron canoes were moving slowly along the northern shore of the expansion of the saint Lawrence known as the Lake of saint Peter There were on board about forty persons including four Frenchmen one of them being the Jesuit Isaac Jogues whom we have already followed on his missionary journey to the towns of the Tobacco Nation In the interval he had not been idle During the last autumn sixteen forty one he with Father Charles Raymbault had passed along the shore of Lake Huron northward entered the strait through which Lake Superior discharges itself pushed on as far as the Sault Sainte Marie and preached the Faith to two thousand Ojibwas and other Algonquins there assembled Lalemant Relation des Hurons sixteen forty two ninety seven He was now on his return from a far more perilous errand The Huron mission was in a state of destitution There was need of clothing for the priests of vessels for the altars of bread and wine for the eucharist of writing materials in short of everything and early in the summer of the present year Jogues had descended to Three Rivers and Quebec with the Huron traders to procure the necessary supplies He had accomplished his task and was on his way back to the mission With him were a few Huron converts and among them a noted Christian chief Eustache Ahatsistari Others of the party were in course of instruction for baptism but the greater part were heathen whose canoes were deeply laden with the proceeds of their bargains with the French fur traders Jogues sat in one of the leading canoes He was born at Orleans in sixteen oh seven and was thirty five years of age His oval face and the delicate mould of his features indicated a modest thoughtful and refined nature He was constitutionally timid with a sensitive conscience and great religious susceptibilities He was a finished scholar and might have gained a literary reputation but he had chosen another career and one for which he seemed but ill fitted Physically however he was well matched with his work for though his frame was slight he was so active that none of the Indians could surpass him in running Buteux Narre de la Prise du Pere Jogues MS Memoire touchant le Pere Jogues MS There is a portrait of him prefixed to mister Shea s admirable edition in quarto of Jogues s Novum Belgium With him were two young men Rene Goupil and Guillaume Couture donnes of the mission that is to say laymen who from a religious motive and without pay had attached themselves to the service of the Jesuits Goupil had formerly entered upon the Jesuit novitiate at Paris but failing health had obliged him to leave it As soon as he was able he came to Canada offered his services to the Superior of the mission was employed for a time in the humblest offices and afterwards became an attendant at the hospital At length to his delight he received permission to go up to the Hurons where the surgical skill which he had acquired was greatly needed and he was now on his way thither Jogues Notice sur Rene Goupil His companion Couture was a man of intelligence and vigor and of a character equally disinterested For an account of him see Ferland Notes sur les Registres de N D de Quebec eighty three eighteen sixty three Both were like Jogues in the foremost canoes while the fourth Frenchman was with the unconverted Hurons in the rear The twelve canoes had reached the western end of the Lake of saint Peter where it is filled with innumerable islands Buteux Narre de le Prise du Pere Jogues MS This document leaves no doubt as to the locality The forest was close on their right they kept near the shore to avoid the current and the shallow water before them was covered with a dense growth of tall bulrushes Suddenly the silence was frightfully broken The war whoop rose from among the rushes mingled with the reports of guns and the whistling of bullets and several Iroquois canoes filled with warriors pushed out from their concealment and bore down upon Jogues and his companions The Hurons in the rear were seized with a shameful panic They leaped ashore left canoes baggage and weapons and fled into the woods The French and the Christian Hurons made fight for a time but when they saw another fleet of canoes approaching from the opposite shores or islands they lost heart and those escaped who could Goupil was seized amid triumphant yells as were also several of the Huron converts Jogues sprang into the bulrushes and might have escaped but when he saw Goupil and the neophytes in the clutches of the Iroquois he had no heart to abandon them but came out from his hiding place and gave himself up to the astonished victors A few of them had remained to guard the prisoners the rest were chasing the fugitives Jogues mastered his agony and began to baptize those of the captive converts who needed baptism Couture had eluded pursuit but when he thought of Jogues and of what perhaps awaited him he resolved to share his fate and turning retraced his steps As he approached five Iroquois ran forward to meet him and one of them snapped his gun at his breast but it missed fire In his confusion and excitement Couture fired his own piece and laid the savage dead The remaining four sprang upon him stripped off all his clothing tore away his finger nails with their teeth gnawed his fingers with the fury of famished dogs and thrust a sword through one of his hands Jogues broke from his guards and rushing to his friend threw his arms about his neck The Iroquois dragged him away beat him with their fists and war clubs till he was senseless and when he revived lacerated his fingers with their teeth as they had done those of Couture Then they turned upon Goupil and treated him with the same ferocity The Huron prisoners were left for the present unharmed More of them were brought in every moment till at length the number of captives amounted in all to twenty two while three Hurons had been killed in the fight and pursuit The Iroquois about seventy in number now embarked with their prey but not until they had knocked on the head an old Huron whom Jogues with his mangled hands had just baptized and who refused to leave the place Then under a burning sun they crossed to the spot on which the town of Sorel now stands at the mouth of the river Richelieu where they encamped The above with much of what follows rests on three documents The first is a long letter written in Latin by Jogues to the Father Provincial at Paris It is dated at Rensselaerswyck Albany Aug five sixteen forty three and is preserved in the Societas Jesu Militans of Tanner and in the Mortes Illustres et Gesta eorum de Societate Jesu et cetera of Alegambe There is a French translation in Martin s Bressani and an English translation by mister Shea in the New York Hist Coll of eighteen fifty seven The second document is an old manuscript entitled Narre de la Prise du Pere Jogues It was written by the Jesuit Buteux from the lips of Jogues Father Martin S J in whose custody it was kindly permitted me to have a copy made from it Besides these there is a long account in the Relation des Hurons of sixteen forty seven and a briefer one in that of sixteen forty four All these narratives show the strongest internal evidence of truth and are perfectly concurrent They are also supported by statements of escaped Huron prisoners and by several letters and memoirs of the Dutch at Rensselaerswyck Their course was southward up the River Richelieu and Lake Champlain thence by way of Lake George to the Mohawk towns The pain and fever of their wounds and the clouds of mosquitoes which they could not drive off left the prisoners no peace by day nor sleep by night On the eighth day they learned that a large Iroquois war party on their way to Canada were near at hand and they soon approached their camp on a small island near the southern end of Lake Champlain The warriors two hundred in number saluted their victorious countrymen with volleys from their guns then armed with clubs and thorny sticks ranged themselves in two lines between which the captives were compelled to pass up the side of a rocky hill On the way they were beaten with such fury that Jogues who was last in the line fell powerless drenched in blood and half dead As the chief man among the French captives he fared the worst His hands were again mangled and fire applied to his body while the Huron chief Eustache was subjected to tortures even more atrocious When at night the exhausted sufferers tried to rest the young warriors came to lacerate their wounds and pull out their hair and beards In the morning they resumed their journey And now the lake narrowed to the semblance of a tranquil river Before them was a woody mountain close on their right a rocky promontory and between these flowed a stream the outlet of Lake George On those rocks more than a hundred years after rose the ramparts of Ticonderoga They landed shouldered their canoes and baggage took their way through the woods passed the spot where the fierce Highlanders and the dauntless regiments of England breasted in vain the storm of lead and fire and soon reached the shore where Abercrombie landed and Lord Howe fell First of white men Jogues and his companions gazed on the romantic lake that bears the name not of its gentle discoverer but of the dull Hanoverian king Like a fair Naiad of the wilderness it slumbered between the guardian mountains that breathe from crag and forest the stern poetry of war But all then was solitude and the clang of trumpets the roar of cannon and the deadly crack of the rifle had never as yet awakened their angry echoes Lake George according to Jogues was called by the Mohawks Andiatarocte or Place where the Lake closes Andiataraque is found on a map of Sanson Spofford Gazetteer of New York article Lake George says that it was called Canideri oit or Tail of the Lake Father Martin in his notes on Bressani prefixes to this name that of Horicon but gives no original authority I have seen an old Latin map on which the name Horiconi is set down as belonging to a neighboring tribe This seems to be only a misprint for Horicoui that is Irocoui or Iroquois In an old English map prefixed to the rare tract A Treatise of New England the Lake of Hierocoyes is laid down The name Horicon as used by Cooper in his Last of the Mohicans seems to have no sufficient historical foundation In sixteen forty six the lake as we shall see was named Lac saint Sacrement Again the canoes were launched and the wild flotilla glided on its way now in the shadow of the heights now on the broad expanse now among the devious channels of the narrows beset with woody islets where the hot air was redolent of the pine the spruce and the cedar till they neared that tragic shore where in the following century New England rustics baffled the soldiers of Dieskau where Montcalm planted his batteries where the red cross waved so long amid the smoke and where at length the summer night was hideous with carnage and an honored name was stained with a memory of blood The allusion is of course to the siege of Fort William Henry in seventeen fifty seven and the ensuing massacre by Montcalm s Indians Charlevoix with his usual carelessness says that Jogues s captors took a circuitous route to avoid enemies In truth however they were not in the slightest danger of meeting any and they followed the route which before the present century was the great highway between Canada and New Holland or New York The Iroquois landed at or near the future site of Fort William Henry left their canoes and with their prisoners began their march for the nearest Mohawk town Each bore his share of the plunder Even Jogues though his lacerated hands were in a frightful condition and his body covered with bruises was forced to stagger on with the rest under a heavy load He with his fellow prisoners and indeed the whole party were half starved subsisting chiefly on wild berries They crossed the upper Hudson and in thirteen days after leaving the saint Lawrence neared the wretched goal of their pilgrimage a palisaded town standing on a hill by the banks of the River Mohawk The whoops of the victors announced their approach and the savage hive sent forth its swarms They thronged the side of the hill the old and the young each with a stick or a slender iron rod bought from the Dutchmen on the Hudson They ranged themselves in a double line reaching upward to the entrance of the town and through this narrow road of Paradise as Jogues calls it the captives were led in single file Couture in front after him a half score of Hurons then Goupil then the remaining Hurons and at last Jogues As they passed they were saluted with yells screeches and a tempest of blows One heavier than the others knocked Jogues s breath from his body and stretched him on the ground but it was death to lie there and regaining his feet he staggered on with the rest This practice of forcing prisoners to run the gauntlet was by no means peculiar to the Iroquois but was common to many tribes When they reached the town the blows ceased and they were all placed on a scaffold or high platform in the middle of the place The three Frenchmen had fared the worst and were frightfully disfigured Goupil especially was streaming with blood and livid with bruises from head to foot They were allowed a few minutes to recover their breath undisturbed except by the hootings and gibes of the mob below Then a chief called out Come let us caress these Frenchmen and the crowd knife in hand began to mount the scaffold They ordered a Christian Algonquin woman a prisoner among them to cut off Jogues s left thumb which she did and a thumb of Goupil was also severed a clam shell being used as the instrument in order to increase the pain It is needless to specify further the tortures to which they were subjected all designed to cause the greatest possible suffering without endangering life At night they were removed from the scaffold and placed in one of the houses each stretched on his back with his limbs extended and his ankles and wrists bound fast to stakes driven into the earthen floor The children now profited by the examples of their parents and amused themselves by placing live coals and red hot ashes on the naked bodies of the prisoners who bound fast and covered with wounds and bruises which made every movement a torture were sometimes unable to shake them off In the morning they were again placed on the scaffold where during this and the two following days they remained exposed to the taunts of the crowd Then they were led in triumph to the second Mohawk town and afterwards to the third one suffering at each a repetition of cruelties the detail of which would be as monotonous as revolting one The Mohawks had but three towns The first and the lowest on the river was Osseruenon the second two miles above was Andagaron and the third Teonontogen or as Megapolensis in his Sketch of the Mohawks writes the names Asserue Banagiro and Thenondiogo They all seem to have been fortified in the Iroquois manner and their united population was thirty five hundred or somewhat more At a later period seventeen twenty there were still three towns named respectively Teahtontaioga Ganowauga and Ganeganaga See the map in Morgan League of the Iroquois In a house in the town of Teonontogen Jogues was hung by the wrists between two of the upright poles which supported the structure in such a manner that his feet could not touch the ground and thus he remained for some fifteen minutes in extreme torture until as he was on the point of swooning an Indian with an impulse of pity cut the cords and released him While they were in this town four fresh Huron prisoners just taken were brought in and placed on the scaffold with the rest Jogues in the midst of his pain and exhaustion took the opportunity to convert them An ear of green corn was thrown to him for food and he discovered a few rain drops clinging to the husks With these he baptized two of the Hurons The remaining two received baptism soon after from a brook which the prisoners crossed on the way to another town Couture though he had incensed the Indians by killing one of their warriors had gained their admiration by his bravery and after torturing him most savagely they adopted him into one of their families in place of a dead relative Thenceforth he was comparatively safe Jogues and Goupil were less fortunate Three of the Hurons had been burned to death and they expected to share their fate A council was held to pronounce their doom but dissensions arose and no result was reached They were led back to the first village where they remained racked with suspense and half dead with exhaustion Jogues however lost no opportunity to baptize dying infants while Goupil taught children to make the sign of the cross On one occasion he made the sign on the forehead of a child grandson of an Indian in whose lodge they lived The superstition of the old savage was aroused Some Dutchmen had told him that the sign of the cross came from the Devil and would cause mischief He thought that Goupil was bewitching the child and resolving to rid himself of so dangerous a guest applied for aid to two young braves Jogues and Goupil clad in their squalid garb of tattered skins were soon after walking together in the forest that adjoined the town consoling themselves with prayer and mutually exhorting each other to suffer patiently for the sake of Christ and the Virgin when as they were returning reciting their rosaries they met the two young Indians and read in their sullen visages an augury of ill The Indians joined them and accompanied them to the entrance of the town where one of the two suddenly drawing a hatchet from beneath his blanket struck it into the head of Goupil who fell murmuring the name of Christ Jogues dropped on his knees and bowing his head in prayer awaited the blow when the murderer ordered him to get up and go home He obeyed but not until he had given absolution to his still breathing friend and presently saw the lifeless body dragged through the town amid hootings and rejoicings Jogues passed a night of anguish and desolation and in the morning reckless of life set forth in search of Goupil s remains Where are you going so fast demanded the old Indian his master Do you not see those fierce young braves who are watching to kill you Jogues persisted and the old man asked another Indian to go with him as a protector The corpse had been flung into a neighboring ravine at the bottom of which ran a torrent and here with the Indian s help Jogues found it stripped naked and gnawed by dogs He dragged it into the water and covered it with stones to save it from further mutilation resolving to return alone on the following day and secretly bury it But with the night there came a storm and when in the gray of the morning Jogues descended to the brink of the stream he found it a rolling turbid flood and the body was nowhere to be seen Had the Indians or the torrent borne it away Jogues waded into the cold current it was the first of October he sounded it with his feet and with his stick he searched the rocks the thicket the forest but all in vain Then crouched by the pitiless stream he mingled his tears with its waters and in a voice broken with groans chanted the service of the dead Jogues in Tanner Societas Militans five hundred nineteen Bressani two hundred sixteen Lalemant Relation sixteen forty seven twenty five twenty six Buteux Narre MS Jogues Notice sur Rene Goupil The Indians it proved and not the flood had robbed him of the remains of his friend Early in the spring when the snows were melting in the woods he was told by Mohawk children that the body was lying where it had been flung in a lonely spot lower down the stream He went to seek it found the scattered bones stripped by the foxes and the birds and tenderly gathering them up hid them in a hollow tree hoping that a day might come when he could give them a Christian burial in consecrated ground After the murder of Goupil Jogues s life hung by a hair He lived in hourly expectation of the tomahawk and would have welcomed it as a boon By signs and words he was warned that his hour was near but as he never shunned his fate it fled from him and each day with renewed astonishment he found himself still among the living Late in the autumn a party of the Indians set forth on their yearly deer hunt and Jogues was ordered to go with them Shivering and half famished he followed them through the chill November forest and shared their wild bivouac in the depths of the wintry desolation The game they took was devoted to Areskoui their god and eaten in his honor Jogues would not taste the meat offered to a demon and thus he starved in the midst of plenty At night when the kettle was slung and the savage crew made merry around their fire he crouched in a corner of the hut gnawed by hunger and pierced to the bone with cold They thought his presence unpropitious to their hunting and the women especially hated him His demeanor at once astonished and incensed his masters He brought them fire wood like a squaw he did their bidding without a murmur and patiently bore their abuse but when they mocked at his God and laughed at his devotions their slave assumed an air and tone of authority and sternly rebuked them Lalemant Relation sixteen forty seven forty one He would sometimes escape from this Babylon as he calls the hut and wander in the forest telling his beads and repeating passages of Scripture In a remote and lonely spot he cut the bark in the form of a cross from the trunk of a great tree and here he made his prayers This living martyr half clad in shaggy furs kneeling on the snow among the icicled rocks and beneath the gloomy pines bowing in adoration before the emblem of the faith in which was his only consolation and his only hope is alike a theme for the pen and a subject for the pencil The Indians at last grew tired of him and sent him back to the village Here he remained till the middle of March baptizing infants and trying to convert adults He told them of the sun moon planets and stars They listened with interest but when from astronomy he passed to theology he spent his breath in vain In March the old man with whom he lived set forth for his spring fishing taking with him his squaw and several children Jogues also was of the party They repaired to a lake perhaps Lake Saratoga four days distant Here they subsisted for some time on frogs the entrails of fish and other garbage Jogues passed his days in the forest repeating his prayers and carving the name of Jesus on trees as a terror to the demons of the wilderness A messenger at length arrived from the town and on the following day under the pretence that signs of an enemy had been seen the party broke up their camp and returned home in hot haste The messenger had brought tidings that a war party which had gone out against the French had been defeated and destroyed and that the whole population were clamoring to appease their grief by torturing Jogues to death This was the true cause of the sudden and mysterious return but when they reached the town other tidings had arrived The missing warriors were safe and on their way home in triumph with a large number of prisoners Again Jogues s life was spared but he was forced to witness the torture and butchery of the converts and allies of the French Existence became unendurable to him and he longed to die War parties were continually going out Should they be defeated and cut off he would pay the forfeit at the stake and if they came back as they usually did with booty and prisoners he was doomed to see his countrymen and their Indian friends mangled burned and devoured Jogues had shown no disposition to escape and great liberty was therefore allowed him He went from town to town giving absolution to the Christian captives and converting and baptizing the heathen On one occasion he baptized a woman in the midst of the fire under pretence of lifting a cup of water to her parched lips There was no lack of objects for his zeal A single war party returned from the Huron country with nearly a hundred prisoners who were distributed among the Iroquois towns and the greater part burned one Of the children of the Mohawks and their neighbors he had baptized before August about seventy insomuch that he began to regard his captivity as a Providential interposition for the saving of souls one The Dutch clergyman Megapolensis at this time living at Fort Orange bears the strongest testimony to the ferocity with which his friends the Mohawks treated their prisoners He mentions the same modes of torture which Jogues describes and is very explicit as to cannibalism The common people he says eat the arms buttocks and trunk but the chiefs eat the head and the heart Short Sketch of the Mohawk Indians This feast was of a religious character At the end of July he went with a party of Indians to a fishing place on the Hudson about twenty miles below Fort Orange While here he learned that another war party had lately returned with prisoners two of whom had been burned to death at Osseruenon On this his conscience smote him that he had not remained in the town to give the sufferers absolution or baptism and he begged leave of the old woman who had him in charge to return at the first opportunity A canoe soon after went up the river with some of the Iroquois and he was allowed to go in it When they reached Rensselaerswyck the Indians landed to trade with the Dutch and took Jogues with them The centre of this rude little settlement was Fort Orange a miserable structure of logs standing on a spot now within the limits of the city of Albany The site of the Phoenix Hotel Note by mister Shea to Jogues s Novum Belgium It contained several houses and other buildings and behind it was a small church recently erected and serving as the abode of the pastor Dominie Megapolensis known in our day as the writer of an interesting though short account of the Mohawks Some twenty five or thirty houses roughly built of boards and roofed with thatch were scattered at intervals on or near the borders of the Hudson above and below the fort Their inhabitants about a hundred in number were for the most part rude Dutch farmers tenants of Van Rensselaer the patroon or lord of the manor They raised wheat of which they made beer and oats with which they fed their numerous horses They traded too with the Indians who profited greatly by the competition among them receiving guns knives axes kettles cloth and beads at moderate rates in exchange for their furs one The Dutch were on excellent terms with their red neighbors met them in the forest without the least fear and sometimes intermarried with them They had known of Jogues s captivity and to their

persuaded them so far writes Van Curler that they promised not to kill them The French captives ran screaming after us and besought us to do all in our power to release them out of the hands of the barbarians At Fort Orange Jogues heard startling news The Indians of the village where he lived were he was told enraged against him and determined to burn him About the first of July a war party had set out for Canada and one of the warriors had offered to Jogues to be the bearer of a letter from him to the French commander at Three Rivers thinking probably to gain some advantage under cover of a parley Jogues knew that the French would be on their guard and he felt it his duty to lose no opportunity of informing them as to the state of affairs among the Iroquois A Dutchman gave him a piece of paper and he wrote a letter in a jargon of Latin French and Huron warning his countrymen to be on their guard as war parties were constantly going out and they could hope for no respite from attack until late in the autumn See a French rendering of the letter in Vimont Relation sixteen forty three p seventy five When the Iroquois reached the mouth of the River Richelieu where a small fort had been built by the French the preceding summer the messenger asked for a parley and gave Jogues s letter to the commander of the post who after reading it turned his cannon on the savages They fled in dismay leaving behind them their baggage and some of their guns and returning home in a fury charged Jogues with having caused their discomfiture Jogues had expected this result and was prepared to meet it but several of the principal Dutch settlers and among them Van Curler who had made the previous attempt to rescue him urged that his death was certain if he returned to the Indian town and advised him to make his escape In the Hudson opposite the settlement lay a small Dutch vessel nearly ready to sail Van Curler offered him a passage in her to Bordeaux or Rochelle representing that the opportunity was too good to be lost and making light of the prisoner s objection that a connivance in his escape on the part of the Dutch would excite the resentment of the Indians against them Jogues thanked him warmly but to his amazement asked for a night to consider the matter and take counsel of God in prayer He spent the night in great agitation tossed by doubt and full of anxiety lest his self love should beguile him from his duty Buteux Narre MS Was it not possible that the Indians might spare his life and that by a timely drop of water he might still rescue souls from torturing devils and eternal fires of perdition On the other hand would he not by remaining to meet a fate almost inevitable incur the guilt of suicide And even should he escape torture and death could he hope that the Indians would again permit him to instruct and baptize their prisoners Of his French companions one Goupil was dead while Couture had urged Jogues to flight saying that he would then follow his example but that so long as the Father remained a prisoner he Couture would share his fate Before morning Jogues had made his decision God he thought would be better pleased should he embrace the opportunity given him He went to find his Dutch friends and with a profusion of thanks accepted their offer They told him that a boat should be left for him on the shore and that he must watch his time and escape in it to the vessel where he would be safe He and his Indian masters were lodged together in a large building like a barn belonging to a Dutch farmer It was a hundred feet long and had no partition of any kind At one end the farmer kept his cattle at the other he slept with his wife a Mohawk squaw and his children while his Indian guests lay on the floor in the middle Buteux Narre MS As he is described as one of the principal persons of the colony it is clear that the civilization of Rensselaerswyck was not high In the evening Jogues in such a manner as not to excite the suspicion of the Indians went out to reconnoitre There was a fence around the house and as he was passing it a large dog belonging to the farmer flew at him and bit him very severely in the leg The Dutchman hearing the noise came out with a light led Jogues back into the building and bandaged his wound He seemed to have some suspicion of the prisoner s design for fearful perhaps that his escape might exasperate the Indians he made fast the door in such a manner that it could not readily be opened Jogues now lay down among the Indians who rolled in their blankets were stretched around him He was fevered with excitement and the agitation of his mind joined to the pain of his wound kept him awake all night About dawn while the Indians were still asleep a laborer in the employ of the farmer came in with a lantern and Jogues who spoke no Dutch gave him to understand by signs that he needed his help and guidance The man was disposed to aid him silently led the way out quieted the dogs and showed him the path to the river It was more than half a mile distant and the way was rough and broken Jogues was greatly exhausted and his wounded limb gave him such pain that he walked with the utmost difficulty When he reached the shore the day was breaking and he found to his dismay that the ebb of the tide had left the boat high and dry He shouted to the vessel but no one heard him His desperation gave him strength and by working the boat to and fro he pushed it at length little by little into the water entered it and rowed to the vessel The Dutch sailors received him kindly and hid him in the bottom of the hold placing a large box over the hatchway He remained two days half stifled in this foul lurking place while the Indians furious at his escape ransacked the settlement in vain to find him They came off to the vessel and so terrified the officers that Jogues was sent on shore at night and led to the fort Here he was hidden in the garret of a house occupied by a miserly old man to whose charge he was consigned Food was sent to him but as his host appropriated the larger part to himself Jogues was nearly starved There was a compartment of his garret separated from the rest by a partition of boards Here the old Dutchman who like many others of the settlers carried on a trade with the Mohawks kept a quantity of goods for that purpose and hither he often brought his customers The boards of the partition had shrunk leaving wide crevices and Jogues could plainly see the Indians as they passed between him and the light They on their part might as easily have seen him if he had not when he heard them entering the house hidden himself behind some barrels in the corner where he would sometimes remain crouched for hours in a constrained and painful posture half suffocated with heat and afraid to move a limb His wounded leg began to show dangerous symptoms but he was relieved by the care of a Dutch surgeon of the fort The minister Megapolensis also visited him and did all in his power for the comfort of his Catholic brother with whom he seems to have been well pleased and whom he calls a very learned scholar Megapolensis A Short Sketch of the Mohawk Indians When Jogues had remained for six weeks in this hiding place his Dutch friends succeeded in satisfying his Indian masters by the payment of a large ransom Lettre de Jogues a Lalemant Rennes Jan six sixteen forty four See Relation sixteen forty three p seventy nine Goods were given the Indians to the value of three hundred livres A vessel from Manhattan now New York soon after brought up an order from the Director General Kieft that he should be sent to him Accordingly he was placed in a small vessel which carried him down the Hudson The Dutch on board treated him with great kindness and to do him honor named after him one of the islands in the river At Manhattan he found a dilapidated fort garrisoned by sixty soldiers and containing a stone church and the Director General s house together with storehouses and barracks Near it were ranges of small houses occupied chiefly by mechanics and laborers while the dwellings of the remaining colonists numbering in all four or five hundred were scattered here and there on the island and the neighboring shores The settlers were of different sects and nations but chiefly Dutch Calvinists Kieft told his guest that eighteen different languages were spoken at Manhattan Jogues Novum Belgium The colonists were in the midst of a bloody Indian war brought on by their own besotted cruelty and while Jogues was at the fort some forty of the Dutchmen were killed on the neighboring farms and many barns and houses burned This war was with Algonquin tribes of the neighborhood See O Callaghan New Netherland I Chap III The Director General with a humanity that was far from usual with him exchanged Jogues s squalid and savage dress for a suit of Dutch cloth and gave him passage in a small vessel which was then about to sail The voyage was rough and tedious and the passenger slept on deck or on a coil of ropes suffering greatly from cold and often drenched by the waves that broke over the vessel s side At length she reached Falmouth on the southern coast of England when all the crew went ashore for a carouse leaving Jogues alone on board A boat presently came alongside with a gang of desperadoes who boarded her and rifled her of everything valuable threatened Jogues with a pistol and robbed him of his hat and coat He obtained some assistance from the crew of a French ship in the harbor and on the day before Christmas took passage in a small coal vessel for the neighboring coast of Brittany In the following afternoon he was set on shore a little to the north of Brest and seeing a peasant s cottage not far off he approached it and asked the way to the nearest church The peasant and his wife as the narrative gravely tells us mistook him by reason of his modest deportment for some poor but pious Irishman and asked him to share their supper after finishing his devotions an invitation which Jogues half famished as he was gladly accepted He reached the church in time for the evening mass and with an unutterable joy knelt before the altar and renewed the communion of which he had been deprived so long When he returned to the cottage the attention of his hosts was at once attracted to his mutilated and distorted hands They asked with amazement how he could have received such injuries and when they heard the story of his tortures their surprise and veneration knew no bounds Two young girls their daughters begged him to accept all they had to give a handful of sous while the peasant made known the character of his new guest to his neighbors A trader from Rennes brought a horse to the door and offered the use of it to Jogues to carry him to the Jesuit college in that town He gratefully accepted it and on the morning of the fifth of January sixteen forty four reached his destination He dismounted and knocked at the door of the college The porter opened it and saw a man wearing on his head an old woollen nightcap and in an attire little better than that of a beggar Jogues asked to see the Rector but the porter answered coldly that the Rector was busied in the Sacristy Jogues begged him to say that a man was at the door with news from Canada The missions of Canada were at this time an object of primal interest to the Jesuits and above all to the Jesuits of France A letter from Jogues written during his captivity had already reached France as had also the Jesuit Relation of sixteen forty three which contained a long account of his capture and he had no doubt been an engrossing theme of conversation in every house of the French Jesuits The Father Rector was putting on his vestments to say mass but when he heard that a poor man from Canada had asked for him at the door he postponed the service and went to meet him Jogues without discovering himself gave him a letter from the Dutch Director General attesting his character The Rector without reading it began to question him as to the affairs of Canada and at length asked him if he knew Father Jogues I knew him very well was the reply The Iroquois have taken him pursued the Rector Is he dead Have they murdered him No answered Jogues he is alive and at liberty and I am he And he fell on his knees to ask his Superior s blessing That night was a night of jubilation and thanksgiving in the college of Rennes For Jogues s arrival in Brittany see Lettre de Jogues a Lalemant Rennes Jan six sixteen forty four Lettre de Jogues a Rennes Jan five sixteen forty four in Relation sixteen forty three and the long account in the Relation of sixteen forty seven Jogues became a centre of curiosity and reverence He was summoned to Paris The Queen Anne of Austria wished to see him and when the persecuted slave of the Mohawks was conducted into her presence she kissed his mutilated hands while the ladies of the Court thronged around to do him homage We are told and no doubt with truth that these honors were unwelcome to the modest and single hearted missionary who thought only of returning to his work of converting the Indians A priest with any deformity of body is debarred from saying mass The teeth and knives of the Iroquois had inflicted an injury worse than the torturers imagined for they had robbed Jogues of the privilege which was the chief consolation of his life but the Pope by a special dispensation restored it to him and with the opening spring he sailed again for Canada CHAPTER XVII

Richelieu that is to say in all Canada no man could hunt fish till the fields or cut a tree in the forest without peril to his scalp The Iroquois were everywhere and nowhere A yell a volley of bullets a rush of screeching savages and all was over The soldiers hastened to the spot to find silence solitude and a mangled corpse I had as lief writes Father Vimont be beset by goblins as by the Iroquois The one are about as invisible as the other Our people on the Richelieu and at Montreal are kept in a closer confinement than ever were monks or nuns in our smallest convents in France The Confederates at this time were in a flush of unparalleled audacity They despised white men as base poltroons and esteemed themselves warriors and heroes destined to conquer all mankind one The fire arms with which the Dutch had rashly supplied them joined to their united councils their courage and ferocity gave them an advantage over the surrounding tribes which they fully understood Their passions rose with their sense of power They boasted that they would wipe the Hurons the Algonquins and the French from the face of the earth and carry the white girls meaning the nuns to their villages This last event indeed seemed more than probable and the Hospital nuns left their exposed station at Sillery and withdrew to the ramparts and palisades of Quebec The saint Lawrence and the Ottawa were so infested that communication with the Huron country was cut off and three times the annual packet of letters sent thither to the missionaries fell into the hands of the Iroquois one Bressani when a prisoner among them writes to this effect in a letter to his Superior See Relation Abregee one hundred thirty one The anonymous author of the Relation of sixteen sixty says that in their belief if their nation were destroyed a general confusion and overthrow of mankind must needs be the consequence Relation sixteen sixty six It was towards the close of the year sixteen forty that the scourge of Iroquois war had begun to fall heavily on the French At that time a party of their warriors waylaid and captured Thomas Godefroy and Francois Marguerie the latter a young man of great energy and daring familiar with the woods a master of the Algonquin language and a scholar of no mean acquirements During his captivity he wrote on a beaver skin a letter to the Dutch in French Latin and English To the great joy of the colonists he and his companion were brought back to Three Rivers by their captors and given up in the vain hope that the French would respond with a gift of fire arms Their demand for them being declined they broke off the parley in a rage fortified themselves fired on the French and withdrew under cover of night Open war now ensued and for a time all was bewilderment and terror How to check the inroads of an enemy so stealthy and so keen for blood was the problem that taxed the brain of Montmagny the Governor He thought he had found a solution when he conceived the plan of building a fort at the mouth of the River Richelieu by which the Iroquois always made their descents to the saint Lawrence Happily for the perishing colony the Cardinal de Richelieu in sixteen forty two sent out thirty or forty soldiers for its defence Faillon Colonie Francaise II two Vimont Relation sixteen forty two two forty four Ten times the number would have been scarcely sufficient but even this slight succor was hailed with delight and Montmagny was enabled to carry into effect his plan of the fort for which hitherto he had had neither builders nor garrison He took with him besides the new comers a body of soldiers and armed laborers from Quebec and with a force of about a hundred men in all Marie de l Incarnation Lettre Sept twenty nine sixteen forty two sailed for the Richelieu in a brigantine and two or three open boats On the thirteenth of August he reached his destination and landed where the town of Sorel now stands It was but eleven days before that Jogues and his companions had been captured and Montmagny s followers found ghastly tokens of the disaster The heads of the slain were stuck on poles by the side of the river and several trees from which portions of the bark had been peeled were daubed with the rude picture writing in which the victors recorded their exploit one Among the rest a representation of Jogues himself was clearly distinguishable The heads were removed the trees cut down and a large cross planted on the spot An altar was raised and all heard mass then a volley of musketry was fired and then they fell to their work They hewed an opening into the forest dug up the roots cleared the ground and cut shaped and planted palisades Thus a week passed and their defences were nearly completed when suddenly the war whoop rang in their ears and two hundred Iroquois rushed upon them from the borders of the clearing The Relation of sixteen forty two says three hundred Jogues who had been among them to his cost is the better authority one Vimont Relation sixteen forty two fifty two This practice was common to many tribes and is not yet extinct The writer has seen similar records made by recent war parties of Crows or Blackfeet in the remote West In this case the bark was removed from the trunks of large cotton wood trees and the pictures traced with charcoal and vermilion There were marks for scalps for prisoners and for the conquerors themselves It was the party of warriors that Jogues had met on an island in Lake Champlain But for the courage of Du Rocher a corporal who was on guard they would have carried all before them They were rushing through an opening in the palisade when he with a few soldiers met them with such vigor and resolution that they were held in check long enough for the rest to snatch their arms Montmagny who was on the river in his brigantine hastened on shore and the soldiers encouraged by his arrival fought with great determination The Iroquois on their part swarmed up to the palisade thrust their guns through the loop holes and fired on those within nor was it till several of them had been killed and others wounded that they learned to keep a more prudent distance A tall savage wearing a crest of the hair of some animal dyed scarlet and bound with a fillet of wampum leaped forward to the attack and was shot dead Another shared his fate with seven buck shot in his shield and as many in his body The French with shouts redoubled their fire and the Indians at length lost heart and fell back The wounded dropped guns shields and war clubs and the whole band withdrew to the shelter of a fort which they had built in the forest three miles above On the part of the French one man was killed and four wounded They had narrowly escaped a disaster which might have proved the ruin of the colony and they now gained time so far to strengthen their defences as to make them reasonably secure against any attack of savages one The new fort however did not effectually answer its purpose of stopping the inroads of the Iroquois They would land a mile or more above it carry their canoes through the forest across an intervening tongue of land and then launch them in the saint Lawrence while the garrison remained in total ignorance of their movements one Vimont Relation sixteen forty two fifty fifty one Assaults by Indians on fortified places are rare The Iroquois are known however to have made them with success in several cases some of the most remarkable of which will appear hereafter The courage of Indians is uncertain and spasmodic They are capable at times of a furious temerity approaching desperation but this is liable to sudden and extreme reaction Their courage too is much oftener displayed in covert than in open attacks While the French were thus beset their Indian allies fared still worse The effect of Iroquois hostilities on all the Algonquin tribes of Canada from the Saguenay to the Lake of the Nipissings had become frightfully apparent Famine and pestilence had aided the ravages of war till these wretched bands seemed in the course of rapid extermination Their spirit was broken They became humble and docile in the hands of the missionaries ceased their railings against the new doctrine and leaned on the French as their only hope in this extremity of woe Sometimes they would appear in troops at Sillery or Three Rivers scared out of their forests by the sight of an Iroquois footprint then some new terror would seize them and drive them back to seek a hiding place in the deepest thickets of the wilderness Their best hunting grounds were beset by the enemy They starved for weeks together subsisting on the bark of trees or the thongs of raw hide which formed the net work of their snow shoes The mortality among them was prodigious Where eight years ago writes Father Vimont one would see a hundred wigwams one now sees scarcely five or six A chief who once had eight hundred warriors has now but thirty or forty and in place of fleets of three or four hundred canoes we see less than a tenth of that number Relation sixteen forty four eight These Canadian tribes were undergoing that process of extermination absorption or expatriation which as there is reason to believe had for many generations formed the gloomy and meaningless history of the greater part of this continent Three or four hundred Dutch guns in the hands of the conquerors gave an unwonted quickness and decision to the work but in no way changed its essential character The horrible nature of this warfare can be known only through examples and of these one or two will suffice A band of Algonquins late in the autumn of sixteen forty one set forth from Three Rivers on their winter hunt and fearful of the Iroquois made their way far northward into the depths of the forests that border the Ottawa Here they thought themselves safe built their lodges and began to hunt the moose and beaver But a large party of their enemies with a persistent ferocity that is truly astonishing had penetrated even here found the traces of the snow shoes followed up their human prey and hid at nightfall among the rocks and thickets around the encampment At midnight their yells and the blows of their war clubs awakened their sleeping victims In a few minutes all were in their power They bound the prisoners hand and foot rekindled the fire slung the kettles cut the bodies of the slain to pieces and boiled and devoured them before the eyes of the wretched survivors In a word says the narrator they ate men with as much appetite and more pleasure than hunters eat a boar or a stag Vimont Relation sixteen forty two forty six Meanwhile they amused themselves with bantering their prisoners Uncle said one of them to an old Algonquin you are a dead man You are going to the land of souls Tell them to take heart they will have good company soon for we are going to send all the rest of your nation to join them This will be good news for them Vimont Relation sixteen forty two forty five This old man who is described as no less malicious than his captors and even more crafty soon after escaped and brought tidings of the disaster to the French In the following spring two women of the party also escaped and after suffering almost incredible hardships reached Three Rivers torn with briers nearly naked and in a deplorable state of bodily and mental exhaustion One of them told her story to Father Buteux who translated it into French and gave it to Vimont to be printed in the Relation of sixteen forty two Revolting as it is it is necessary to recount it Suffice it to say that it is sustained by the whole body of contemporary evidence in regard to the practices of the Iroquois and some of the neighboring tribes The conquerors feasted in the lodge till nearly daybreak and then after a short rest began their march homeward with their prisoners Among these were three women of whom the narrator was one who had each a child of a few weeks or months old At the first halt their captors took the infants from them tied them to wooden spits placed them to die slowly before a fire and feasted on them before the eyes of the agonized mothers whose shrieks supplications and frantic efforts to break the cords that bound them were met with mockery and laughter They are not men they are wolves sobbed the wretched woman as she told what had befallen her to the pitying Jesuit Vimont Relation sixteen forty two forty six At the Fall of the Chaudiere another of the women ended her woes by leaping into the cataract When they approached the first Iroquois town they were met at the distance of several leagues by a crowd of the inhabitants and among them a troop of women bringing food to regale the triumphant warriors Here they halted and passed the night in songs of victory mingled with the dismal chant of the prisoners who were forced to dance for their entertainment On the morrow they entered the town leading the captive Algonquins fast bound and surrounded by a crowd of men women and children all singing at the top of their throats The largest lodge was ready to receive them and as they entered the victims read their doom in the fires that blazed on the earthen floor and in the aspect of the attendant savages whom the Jesuit Father calls attendant demons that waited their coming The torture which ensued was but preliminary designed to cause all possible suffering without touching life It consisted in blows with sticks and cudgels gashing their limbs with knives cutting off their fingers with clam shells scorching them with firebrands and other indescribable torments one The women were stripped naked and forced to dance to the singing of the male prisoners amid the applause and laughter of the crowd They then gave them food to strengthen them for further suffering one Cette pauure creature qui s est sauuee a les deux pouces couppez ou plus tost hachez Quand ils me les eurent couppez disoit elle ils me les voulurent faire manger mais ie les mis sur mon giron et leur dis qu ils me tuassent s ils vouloient que ie ne leur pouuois obeir Buteux in Relation sixteen forty two forty seven On the following morning they were placed on a large scaffold in sight of the whole population It was a gala day Young and old were gathered from far and near Some mounted the scaffold and scorched them with torches and firebrands while the children standing beneath the bark platform applied fire to the feet of the prisoners between the crevices The Algonquin women were told to burn their husbands and companions and one of them obeyed vainly thinking to appease her tormentors The stoicism of one of the warriors enraged his captors beyond measure Scream why don t you scream they cried thrusting their burning brands at his naked body Look at me he answered you cannot make me wince If you were in my place you would screech like babies At this they fell upon him with redoubled fury till their knives and firebrands left in him no semblance of humanity He was defiant to the last and when death came to his relief they tore out his heart and devoured it then hacked him in pieces and made their feast of triumph on his mangled limbs The diabolical practices described above were not peculiar to the Iroquois The Neutrals and other kindred tribes were no whit less cruel It is a remark of mister Gallatin and I think a just one that the Indians west of the Mississippi are less ferocious than those east of it The burning of prisoners is rare among the prairie tribes but is not unknown An Ogillallah chief in whose lodge I lived for several weeks in eighteen forty six described to me with most expressive pantomime how he had captured and burned a warrior of the Snake Tribe in a valley of the Medicine Bow Mountains near which we were then encamped All the men and all the old women of the party were put to death in a similar manner though but few displayed the same amazing fortitude The younger women of whom there were about thirty after passing their ordeal of torture were permitted to live and disfigured as they were were distributed among the several villages as concubines or slaves to the Iroquois warriors Of this number were the narrator and her companion who being ordered to accompany a war party and carry their provisions escaped at night into the forest and reached Three Rivers as we have seen While the Indian allies of the French were wasting away beneath this atrocious warfare the French themselves and especially the travelling Jesuits had their full share of the infliction In truth the puny and sickly colony seemed in the gasps of dissolution The beginning of spring particularly was a season of terror and suspense for with the breaking up of the ice sure as a destiny came the Iroquois As soon as a canoe could float they were on the war path and with the cry of the returning wild fowl mingled the yell of these human tigers They did not always wait for the breaking ice but set forth on foot and when they came to open water made canoes and embarked Well might Father Vimont call the Iroquois the scourge of this infant church They burned hacked and devoured the neophytes exterminated whole villages at once destroyed the nations whom the Fathers hoped to convert and ruined that sure ally of the missions the fur trade Not the most hideous nightmare of a fevered brain could transcend in horror the real and waking perils with which they beset the path of these intrepid priests In the spring of sixteen forty four Joseph Bressani an Italian Jesuit born in Rome and now for two years past a missionary in Canada was ordered by his Superior to go up to the Hurons It was so early in the season that there seemed hope that he might pass in safety and as the Fathers in that wild mission had received no succor for three years Bressani was charged with letters to them and such necessaries for their use as he was able to carry With him were six young Hurons lately converted and a French boy in his service The party were in three small canoes Before setting out they all confessed and prepared for death They left Three Rivers on the twenty seventh of April and found ice still floating in the river and patches of snow lying in the naked forests On the first day one of the canoes overset nearly drowning Bressani who could not swim On the third day a snow storm began and greatly retarded their progress The young Indians foolishly fired their guns at the wild fowl on the river and the sound reached the ears of a war party of Iroquois one of ten that had already set forth for the saint Lawrence the Ottawa and the Huron towns Vimont Relation sixteen forty four forty one Hence it befell that as they crossed the mouth of a small stream entering the saint Lawrence twenty seven Iroquois suddenly issued from behind a point and attacked them in canoes One of the Hurons was killed and all the rest of the party captured without resistance On the fifteenth of July following Bressani wrote from the Iroquois country to the General of the Jesuits at Rome I do not know if your Paternity will recognize the handwriting of one whom you once knew very well The letter is soiled and ill written because the writer has only one finger of his right hand left entire and cannot prevent the blood from his wounds which are still open from staining the paper His ink is gunpowder mixed with water and his table is the earth This letter is printed anonymously in the Second Part Chap II of Bressani s Relation Abregee A comparison with Vimont s account in the Relation of sixteen forty four makes its authorship apparent Vimont s narrative agrees in all essential points His informant was vne personne digne de foy qui a este tesmoin oculaire de tout ce qu il a soufiert pendant sa captiuite Vimont Relation sixteen forty four forty three Then follows a modest narrative of what be endured at the hands of his captors First they thanked the Sun for their victory then plundered the canoes then cut up roasted and devoured the slain Huron before the eyes of the prisoners On the next day they crossed to the southern shore and ascended the River Richelieu as far as the rapids of Chambly whence they pursued their march on foot among the brambles rocks and swamps of the trackless forest When they reached Lake Champlain they made new canoes and re embarked landed at its southern extremity six days afterwards and thence made for the Upper Hudson Here they found a fishing camp of four hundred Iroquois and now Bressani s torments began in earnest They split his hand with a knife between the little finger and the ring finger then beat him with sticks till he was covered with blood and afterwards placed him on one of their torture scaffolds of bark as a spectacle to the crowd Here they stripped him and while he shivered with cold from head to foot they forced him to sing After about two hours they gave him up to the children who ordered him to dance at the same time thrusting sharpened sticks into his flesh and pulling out his hair and beard Sing cried one Hold your tongue screamed another and if he obeyed the first the second burned him We will burn you to death we will eat you I will eat one of your hands And I will eat one of your feet Ils me repetaient sans cesse Nous te brulerons nous te mangerons je te mangerai un pied et moi une main et cetera Bressani in Relation Abregee one hundred thirty seven These scenes were renewed every night for a week Every evening a chief cried aloud through the camp Come my children come and caress our prisoners and the savage crew thronged jubilant to a large hut where the captives lay They stripped off the torn fragment of a cassock which was the priest s only garment burned him with live coals and red hot stones forced him to walk on hot cinders burned off now a finger nail and now the joint of a finger rarely more than one at a time however for they economized their pleasures and reserved the rest for another day This torture was protracted till one or two o clock after which they left him on the ground fast bound to four stakes and covered only with a scanty fragment of deer skin one The other prisoners had their share of torture but the worst fell upon the Jesuit as the chief man of the party The unhappy boy who attended him though only twelve or thirteen years old was tormented before his eyes with a pitiless ferocity one Chaque nuit apres m avoir fait chanter et m avoir tourmente comme ie l ai dit ils passaient environ un quart d heure a me bruler un ongle ou un doigt Il ne m en reste maintenant qu un seul entier et encore ils en ont arrache l ongle avec les dents Un soir ils m enlevaient un ongle le lendemain la premiere phalange le jour suivant la seconde En six fois ils en brulerent presque six Aux mains seules ils m ont applique le feu et le fer plus de eighteen fois et i etais oblige de chanter pendant ce supplice Ils ne cessaient de me tourmenter qu a une ou deux heures de la nuit Bressani Relation Abregee one hundred twenty two Bressani speaks in another passage of tortures of a nature yet more excruciating They were similar to those alluded to by the anonymous author of the Relation of sixteen sixty Ie ferois rougir ce papier et les oreilles fremiroient si ie rapportois les horribles traitemens que les Agnieronnons the Mohawk nation of the Iroquois ont faits sur quelques captifs He adds that past ages have never heard of such Relation sixteen sixty seven eight At length they left this encampment and after a march of several days during which Bressani in wading a rocky stream fell from exhaustion and was nearly drowned they reached an Iroquois town It is needless to follow the revolting details of the new torments that succeeded They hung him by the feet with chains placed food for their dogs on his naked body that they might lacerate him as they ate and at last had reduced his emaciated frame to such a condition that even they themselves stood in horror of him I could not have believed he writes to his Superior that a man was so hard to kill He found among them those who from compassion or from a refinement of cruelty fed him for he could not feed himself They told him jestingly that they wished to fatten him before putting him to death The council that was to decide his fate met on the nineteenth of June when to the prisoner s amazement and as it seemed to their own surprise they resolved to spare his life He was given with due ceremony to an old woman to take the place of a deceased relative but since he was as repulsive in his mangled condition as by the Indian standard he was useless she sent her son with him to Fort Orange to sell him to the Dutch With the same humanity which they had shown in the case of Jogues they gave a generous ransom for him supplied him with clothing kept him till his strength was in some degree recruited and then placed him on board a vessel bound for Rochelle Here he arrived on the fifteenth of November and in the following spring maimed and disfigured but with health restored embarked to dare again the knives and firebrands of the Iroquois Immediately on his return to Canada he was ordered to set out again for the Hurons More fortunate than on his first attempt he arrived safely early in the autumn of sixteen forty five Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty six seventy three On Bressani besides the authorities cited see Du Creux Historia Canadensis three hundred ninety nine four hundred three Juchereau Histoire de l Hotel Dieu fifty three and Martin Biographie du P Francois Joseph Bressani prefixed to the Relation Abregee He made no converts while a prisoner but he baptized a Huron catechumen at the stake to the great fury of the surrounding Iroquois He has left besides his letters some interesting notes on his captivity preserved in the Relation Abregee It should be noticed in justice to the Iroquois that ferocious and cruel as past all denial they were they were not so bereft of the instincts of humanity as at first sight might appear An inexorable severity towards enemies was a very essential element in their savage conception of the character of the warrior Pity was a cowardly weakness at which their pride revolted This joined to their thirst for applause and their dread of ridicule made them smother every movement of compassion one and conspired with their native fierceness to form a character of unrelenting cruelty rarely equalled one Thus when Bressani tortured by the tightness of the cords that bound him asked an Indian to loosen them he would reply by mockery if others were present but if no one saw him he usually complied The perils which beset the missionaries did not spring from the fury of the Iroquois alone for Nature herself was armed with terror in this stern wilderness of New France On the thirtieth of January sixteen forty six Father Anne de Noue set out from Three Rivers to go to the fort built by the French at the mouth of the River Richelieu where he was to say mass and hear confessions De Noue was sixty three years old and had come to Canada in sixteen twenty five See Pioneers of France three hundred ninety three As an indifferent memory disabled him from mastering the Indian languages he devoted himself to the spiritual charge of the French and of the Indians about the forts within reach of an interpreter For the rest he attended the sick and in times of scarcity fished in the river or dug roots in the woods for the subsistence of his flock In short though sprung from a noble family of Champagne he shrank from no toil however humble to which his idea of duty or his vow of obedience called him He was peculiarly sensitive as regarded the cardinal Jesuit virtue of obedience and both Lalemant and Bressani say that at the age of sixty and upwards he was sometimes seen in tears when he imagined that he had not fulfilled to the utmost the commands of his Superior The old missionary had for companions two soldiers and a Huron Indian They were all on snow shoes and the soldiers dragged their baggage on small sledges Their highway was the saint Lawrence transformed to solid ice and buried like all the country beneath two or three feet of snow which far and near glared dazzling white under the clear winter sun Before night they had walked eighteen miles and the soldiers unused to snow shoes were greatly fatigued They made their camp in the forest on the shore of the great expansion of the saint Lawrence called the Lake of saint Peter dug away the snow heaped it around the spot as a barrier against the wind made their fire on the frozen earth in the midst and lay down to sleep At two o clock in the morning De Noue awoke The moon shone like daylight over the vast white desert of the frozen lake with its bordering fir trees bowed to the ground with snow and the kindly thought struck the Father that he might ease his companions by going in advance to Fort Richelieu and sending back men to aid them in dragging their sledges He knew the way well He directed them to follow the tracks of his snow shoes in the morning and not doubting to reach the fort before night left behind his blanket and his flint and steel For provisions he put a morsel of bread and five or six prunes in his pocket told his rosary and set forth Before dawn the weather changed The air thickened clouds hid the moon and a snow storm set in The traveller was in utter darkness He lost the points of the compass wandered far out on the lake and when day appeared could see nothing but the snow beneath his feet and the myriads of falling flakes that encompassed him like a curtain impervious to the sight Still he toiled on winding hither and thither and at times unwittingly circling back on his own footsteps At night he dug a hole in the snow under the shore of an island and lay down without fire food or blanket Meanwhile the two soldiers and the Indian unable to trace his footprints which the snow had hidden pursued their way for the fort but the Indian was ignorant of the country and the Frenchmen were unskilled They wandered from their course and at evening encamped on the shore of the island of saint Ignace at no great distance from De Noue Here the Indian trusting to his instinct left them and set forth alone in search of their destination which he soon succeeded in finding The palisades of the feeble little fort and the rude buildings within were whitened with snow and half buried in it Here amid the desolation a handful of men kept watch and ward against the Iroquois Seated by the blazing logs the Indian asked for De Noue and to his astonishment the soldiers of the garrison told him that he had not been seen The captain of the post was called all was anxiety but nothing could be done that night At daybreak parties went out to search The two soldiers were readily found but they looked in vain for the missionary All day they were ranging the ice firing their guns and shouting but to no avail and they returned disconsolate There was a converted Indian whom the French called Charles at the fort one of four who were spending the winter there On the next morning the second of February he and one of his companions together with Baron a French soldier resumed the search and guided by the slight depressions in the snow which had fallen on the wanderer s footprints the quick eyed savages traced him through all his windings found his camp by the shore of the island and thence followed him beyond the fort He had passed near without discovering it perhaps weakness had dimmed his sight stopped to rest at a point a league above and thence made his way about three leagues farther Here they found him He had dug a circular excavation in the snow and was kneeling in it on the earth His head was bare his eyes open and turned upwards and his hands clasped on his breast His hat and his snow shoes lay at his side The body was leaning slightly forward resting against the bank of snow before it and frozen to the hardness of marble Thus in an act of kindness and charity died the first martyr of the Canadian mission Lalemant Relation sixteen forty six nine Marie de l Incarnation Lettre ten Sept sixteen forty six Bressani Relation Abregee one hundred seventy five One of the Indians who found the body of De Noue was killed by the Iroquois at Ossossane in the Huron country three years after He received the death blow in a posture like that in which he had seen the dead missionary His body was found with the hands still clasped on the breast Lettre de Chaumonot a Lalemant one Juin sixteen forty nine The next death among the Jesuits was that of Masse who died at Sillery on the twelfth of May of this year sixteen forty six at the age of seventy two He had come with Biard to Acadia as early as sixteen eleven See Pioneers of France two hundred sixty two Lalemant in the Relation of sixteen forty six gives an account of him and speaks of penances which he imposed on himself some of which are to the last degree disgusting CHAPTER XVIII sixteen

BATTLE EXPLOIT OF MAISONNEUVE Let us now ascend to the island of Montreal Here as we have seen an association of devout and zealous persons had essayed to found a mission colony under the protection of the Holy Virgin and we left the adventurers after their landing bivouacked on the shore on an evening in May There was an altar in the open air decorated with a taste that betokened no less of good nurture than of piety and around it clustered the tents that sheltered the commandant Maisonneuve the two ladies Madame de la Peltrie and Mademoiselle Mance and the soldiers and laborers of the expedition In the morning they all fell to their work Maisonneuve hewing down the first tree and labored with such good will that their tents were soon inclosed with a strong palisade and their altar covered by a provisional chapel built in the Huron mode of bark Soon afterward their canvas habitations were supplanted by solid structures of wood and the feeble germ of a future city began to take root The Iroquois had not yet found them out nor did they discover them till they had had ample time to fortify themselves Meanwhile on a Sunday they would stroll at their leisure over the adjacent meadow and in the shade of the bordering forest where as the old chronicler tells us the grass was gay with wild flowers and the branches with the flutter and song of many strange birds Dollier de Casson MS The day of the Assumption of the Virgin was celebrated with befitting solemnity There was mass in their bark chapel then a Te Deum then public instruction of certain Indians who chanced to be at Montreal then a procession of all the colonists after vespers to the admiration of the redskinned beholders Cannon too were fired in honor of their celestial patroness Their thunder made all the island echo writes Father Vimont and the demons though used to thunderbolts were scared at a noise which told them of the love we bear our great Mistress and I have scarcely any doubt that the tutelary angels of the savages of New France have marked this day in the calendar of Paradise Vimont Relation sixteen forty two thirty eight Compare Le Clerc Premier Etablissement de la Foy II fifty one The summer passed prosperously but with the winter their faith was put to a rude test In December there was a rise of the saint Lawrence threatening to sweep away in a night the results of all their labor They fell to their prayers and Maisonneuve planted a wooden cross in face of the advancing deluge first making a vow that should the peril be averted he Maisonneuve would bear another cross on his shoulders up the neighboring mountain and place it on the summit The vow seemed in vain The flood still rose filled the fort ditch swept the foot of the palisade and threatened to sap the magazine but here it stopped and presently began to recede till at length it had withdrawn within its lawful channel and Villemarie was safe A little MS map in M Jacques Viger s copy of Le Petit Registre de la Cure de Montreal lays down the position and shape of the fort at this time and shows the spot where Maisonneuve planted the cross Now it remained to fulfil the promise from which such happy results had proceeded Maisonneuve set his men at work to clear a path through the forest to the top of the mountain A large cross was made and solemnly blessed by the priest then on the sixth of January the Jesuit Du Peron led the way followed in procession by Madame de la Peltrie the artisans and soldiers to the destined spot The commandant who with all the ceremonies of the Church had been declared First Soldier of the Cross walked behind the rest bearing on his shoulder a cross so heavy that it needed his utmost strength to climb the steep and rugged path They planted it on the highest crest and all knelt in adoration before it Du Peron said mass and Madame de la Peltrie always romantic and always devout received the sacrament on the mountain top a spectacle to the virgin world outstretched below Sundry relics of saints had been set in the wood of the cross which remained an object of pilgrimage to the pious colonists of Villemarie Vimont Relation sixteen forty three fifty two fifty three Peace and harmony reigned within the little fort and so edifying was the demeanor of the colonists so faithful were they to the confessional and so constant at mass that a chronicler of the day exclaims in a burst of enthusiasm that the deserts lately a resort of demons were now the abode of angels Veritables Motifs cited by Faillon I four hundred fifty three four hundred fifty four The two Jesuits who for the time were their pastors had them well in hand They dwelt under the same roof with most of their flock who lived in community in one large house and vied with each other in zeal for the honor of the Virgin and the conversion of the Indians At the end of August sixteen forty three a vessel arrived at Villemarie with a reinforcement commanded by Louis d Ailleboust de Coulonges a pious gentleman of Champagne and one of the Associates of Montreal Chaulmer one hundred one Juchereau ninety one Some years before he had asked in wedlock the hand of Barbe de Boulogne but the young lady had when a child in the ardor of her piety taken a vow of perpetual chastity By the advice of her Jesuit confessor she accepted his suit on condition that she should preserve to the hour of her death the state to which Holy Church has always ascribed a peculiar merit one D Ailleboust married her and when soon after he conceived the purpose of devoting his life to the work of the Faith in Canada he invited his maiden spouse to go with him She refused and forbade him to mention the subject again Her health was indifferent and about this time she fell ill As a last resort she made a promise to God that if He would restore her she would go to Canada with her husband and forthwith her maladies ceased Still her reluctance continued she hesitated and then refused again when an inward light revealed to her that it was her duty to cast her lot in the wilderness She accordingly embarked with d Ailleboust accompanied by her sister Mademoiselle Philippine de Boulogne who had caught the contagion of her zeal The presence of these damsels would to all appearance be rather a burden than a profit to the colonists beset as they then were by Indians and often in peril of starvation but the spectacle of their ardor as disinterested as it was extravagant would serve to exalt the religious enthusiasm in which alone was the life of Villemarie one Juchereau Histoire de l Hotel Dieu de Quebec two hundred seventy six The confessor told D Ailleboust that if he persuaded his wife to break her vow of continence God would chastise him terribly The nun historian adds that undeterred by the menace he tried and failed Their vessel passed in safety the Iroquois who watched the saint Lawrence and its arrival filled the colonists with joy D Ailleboust was a skilful soldier specially versed in the arts of fortification and under his direction the frail palisades which formed their sole defence were replaced by solid ramparts and bastions of earth He brought news that the unknown benefactress as a certain generous member of the Association of Montreal was called in ignorance of her name had given funds to the amount as afterwards appeared of forty two thousand livres for the building of a hospital at Villemarie Archives du Seminaire de Villemarie cited by Faillon I four hundred sixty six The amount of the gift was not declared until the next year The source of the gift was kept secret from a religious motive but it soon became known that it proceeded from Madame de Bullion a lady whose rank and wealth were exceeded only by her devotion It is true that the hospital was not wanted as no one was sick at Villemarie and one or two chambers would have sufficed for every prospective necessity but it will be remembered that the colony had been established in order that a hospital might be built and Madame de Bullion would not hear to any other application of her money Mademoiselle Mance wrote to her to urge that the money should be devoted to the Huron mission but she absolutely refused Dollier de Casson MS Instead therefore of tilling the land to supply their own pressing needs all the laborers of the settlement were set at this pious though superfluous task one There was no room in the fort which moreover was in danger of inundation and the hospital was accordingly built on higher ground adjacent To leave it unprotected would be to abandon its inmates to the Iroquois it was therefore surrounded by a strong palisade and in time of danger a part of the garrison was detailed to defend it Here Mademoiselle Mance took up her abode and waited the day when wounds or disease should bring patients to her empty wards one Journal des Superieurs des Jesuites MS The hospital was sixty feet long and twenty four feet wide with a kitchen a chamber for Mademoiselle Mance others for servants and two large apartments for the patients It was amply provided with furniture linen medicines and all necessaries and had also two oxen three cows and twenty sheep A small oratory of stone was built adjoining it The inclosure was four arpents in extent Archives du Seminaire de Villemarie cited by Faillon Dauversiere who had first conceived this plan of a hospital in the wilderness was a senseless enthusiast who rejected as a sin every protest of reason against the dreams which governed him yet one rational and practical element entered into the motives of those who carried the plan into execution The hospital was intended not only to nurse sick Frenchmen but to nurse and convert sick Indians in other words it was an engine of the mission From Maisonneuve to the humblest laborer these zealous colonists were bent on the work of conversion To that end the ladies made pilgrimages to the cross on the mountain sometimes for nine days in succession to pray God to gather the heathen into His fold The fatigue was great nor was the danger less and armed men always escorted them as a precaution against the Iroquois Morin Annales de l Hotel Dieu de saint Joseph MS cited by Faillon I four hundred fifty seven The male colonists were equally fervent and sometimes as many as fifteen or sixteen persons would kneel at once before the cross with the same charitable petition Marguerite Bourgeoys Ecrits Autographes MS extracts in Faillon I four hundred fifty eight The ardor of their zeal may be inferred from the fact that these pious expeditions consumed the greater part of the day when time and labor were of a value past reckoning to the little colony Besides their pilgrimages they used other means and very efficient ones to attract and gain over the Indians They housed fed and clothed them at every opportunity and though they were subsisting chiefly on provisions brought at great cost from France there was always a portion for the hungry savages who from time to time encamped near their fort If they could persuade any of them to be nursed they were consigned to the tender care of Mademoiselle Mance and if a party went to war their women and children were taken in charge till their return As this attention to their bodies had for its object the profit of their souls it was accompanied with incessant catechizing This with the other influences of the place had its effect and some notable conversions were made Among them was that of the renowned chief Tessouat or Le Borgne as the French called him a crafty and intractable savage whom to their own surprise they succeeded in taming and winning to the Faith Vimont Relation sixteen forty three fifty four fifty five Tessouat was chief of Allumette Island in the Ottawa His predecessor of the same name was Champlain s host in sixteen thirteen See Pioneers of France Chap XII He was christened with the name of Paul and his squaw with that of Madeleine Maisonneuve rewarded him with a gun and celebrated the day by a feast to all the Indians present It was the usual practice to give guns to converts pour attirer leur compatriotes a la Foy They were never given to heathen Indians It seems observes Vimont that our Lord wishes to make use of this method in order that Christianity may become acceptable in this country Relation sixteen forty three seventy one The French hoped to form an agricultural settlement of Indians in the neighborhood of Villemarie and they spared no exertion to this end giving them tools and aiding them to till the fields They might have succeeded but for that pest of the wilderness the Iroquois who hovered about them harassed them with petty attacks and again and again drove the Algonquins in terror from their camps Some time had elapsed as we have seen before the Iroquois discovered Villemarie but at length ten fugitive Algonquins chased by a party of them made for the friendly settlement as a safe asylum and thus their astonished pursuers became aware of its existence They reconnoitred the place and went back to their towns with the news Dollier de Casson MS From that time forth the colonists had no peace no more excursions for fishing and hunting no more Sunday strolls in woods and meadows The men went armed to their work and returned at the sound of a bell marching in a compact body prepared for an attack Early in June sixteen forty three sixty Hurons came down in canoes for traffic and on reaching the place now called Lachine at the head of the rapids of saint Louis and a few miles above Villemarie they were amazed at finding a large Iroquois war party in a fort hastily built of the trunks and boughs of trees Surprise and fright seem to have infatuated them They neither fought nor fled but greeted their inveterate foes as if they were friends and allies and to gain their good graces told them all they knew of the French settlement urging them to attack it and promising an easy victory Accordingly the Iroquois detached forty of their warriors who surprised six Frenchmen at work hewing timber within a gunshot of the fort killed three of them took the remaining three prisoners and returned in triumph The captives were bound with the usual rigor and the Hurons taunted and insulted them to please their dangerous companions Their baseness availed them little for at night after a feast of victory when the Hurons were asleep or off their guard their entertainers fell upon them and killed or captured the greater part The rest ran for Villemarie where as their treachery was as yet unknown they were received with great kindness I have followed Dollier de Casson Vimont s account is different He says that the Iroquois fell upon the Hurons at the outset and took twenty three prisoners killing many others after which they made the attack at Villemarie Relation sixteen forty three sixty two Faillon thinks that Vimont was unwilling to publish the treachery of the Hurons lest the interests of the Huron mission should suffer in consequence Belmont Histoire du Canada sixteen forty three confirms the account of the Huron treachery The next morning the Iroquois decamped carrying with them their prisoners and the furs plundered from the Huron canoes They had taken also and probably destroyed all the letters from the missionaries in the Huron country as well as a copy of their Relation of the preceding year Of the three French prisoners one escaped and reached Montreal the remaining two were burned alive At Villemarie it was usually dangerous to pass beyond the ditch of the fort or the palisades of the hospital Sometimes a solitary warrior would lie hidden for days without sleep and almost without food behind a log in the forest or in a dense thicket watching like a lynx for some rash straggler Sometimes parties of a hundred or more made ambuscades near by and sent a few of their number to lure out the soldiers by a petty attack and a flight The danger was much diminished however when the colonists received from France a number of dogs which proved most efficient sentinels and scouts Of the instinct of these animals the writers of the time speak with astonishment Chief among them was a bitch named Pilot who every morning made the rounds of the forests and fields about the fort followed by a troop of her offspring If one of them lagged behind she hit him to remind him of his duty and if any skulked and ran home she punished them severely in the same manner on her return When she discovered the Iroquois which she was sure to do by the scents if any were near she barked furiously and ran at once straight to the fort followed by the rest The Jesuit chronicler adds with an amusing naivete that while this was her duty her natural inclination was for hunting squirrels Lalemant Relation sixteen forty seven seventy four seventy five Son attrait naturel estoit la chasse aux ecurieux Dollier de Casson also speaks admiringly of her and her instinct Faillon sees in it a manifest proof of the protecting care of God over Villemarie Maisonneuve was as brave a knight of the cross as ever fought in Palestine for the sepulchre of Christ but he could temper his valor with discretion He knew that he and his soldiers were but indifferent woodsmen that their crafty foe had no equal in ambuscades and surprises and that while a defeat might ruin the French it would only exasperate an enemy whose resources in men were incomparably greater Therefore when the dogs sounded the alarm he kept his followers close and stood patiently on the defensive They chafed under this Fabian policy and at length imputed it to cowardice Their murmurings grew louder till they reached the ear of Maisonneuve The religion which animated him had not destroyed the soldierly pride which takes root so readily and so strongly in a manly nature and an imputation of cowardice from his own soldiers stung him to the quick He saw too that such an opinion of him must needs weaken his authority and impair the discipline essential to the safety of the colony On the morning of the thirtieth of March Pilot was heard barking with unusual fury in the forest eastward from the fort and in a few moments they saw her running over the clearing where the snow was still deep followed by her brood all giving tongue together The excited Frenchmen flocked about their commander Monsieur les ennemis sont dans le bois ne les irons nous jamais voir Dollier de Casson MS Maisonneuve habitually composed and calm answered sharply Yes you shall see the enemy Get yourselves ready at once and take care that you are as brave as you profess to be I shall lead you myself All was bustle in the fort Guns were loaded pouches filled and snow shoes tied on by those who had them and knew how to use them There were not enough however and many were forced to go without them When all was ready Maisonneuve sallied forth at the head of thirty men leaving d Ailleboust with the remainder to hold the fort They crossed the snowy clearing and entered the forest where all was silent as the grave They pushed on wading through the deep snow with the countless pitfalls hidden beneath it when suddenly they were greeted with the screeches of eighty Iroquois one who sprang up from their lurking places and showered bullets and arrows upon the advancing French The emergency called not for chivalry but for woodcraft and Maisonneuve ordered his men to take shelter like their assailants behind trees They stood their ground resolutely for a long time but the Iroquois pressed them close three of their number were killed others were wounded and their ammunition began to fail Their only alternatives were destruction or retreat and to retreat was not easy The order was given Though steady at first the men soon became confused and over eager to escape the galling fire which the Iroquois sent after them Maisonneuve directed them towards a sledge track which had been used in dragging timber for building the hospital and where the snow was firm beneath the foot He himself remained to the last encouraging his followers and aiding the wounded to escape The French as they struggled through the snow faced about from time to time and fired back to check the pursuit but no sooner had they reached the sledge track than they gave way to their terror and ran in a body for the fort Those within seeing this confused rush of men from the distance mistook them for the enemy and an over zealous soldier touched the match to a cannon which had been pointed to rake the sledge track Had not the piece missed fire from dampness of the priming he would have done more execution at one shot than the Iroquois in all the fight of that morning one Vimont Relation sixteen forty four forty two Dollier de Casson says two hundred but it is usually safe in these cases to accept the smaller number and Vimont founds his statement on the information of an escaped prisoner Maisonneuve was left alone retreating backwards down the track and holding his pursuers in check with a pistol in each hand They might easily have shot him but recognizing him as the commander of the French they were bent on taking him alive Their chief coveted this honor for himself and his followers held aloof to give him the opportunity He pressed close upon Maisonneuve who snapped a pistol at him which missed fire The Iroquois who had ducked to avoid the shot rose erect and sprang forward to seize him when Maisonneuve with his remaining pistol shot him dead Then ensued a curious spectacle not infrequent in Indian battles The Iroquois seemed to forget their enemy in their anxiety to secure and carry off the body of their chief and the French commander continued his retreat unmolested till he was safe under the cannon of the fort From that day he was a hero in the eyes of his men Dollier de Casson MS Vimont s mention of the affair is brief He says that two Frenchmen were made prisoners and burned Belmont Histoire du Canada sixteen forty five gives a succinct account of the fight and indicates the scene of it It seems to have been a little below the site of the Place d Armes on which stands the great Parish Church of Villemarie commonly known to tourists as the Cathedral Faillon thinks that Maisonneuve s exploit was achieved on this very spot Marguerite Bourgeoys also describes the affair in her unpublished writings Quebec and Montreal are happy in their founders Samuel de Champlain and Chomedey de Maisonneuve are among the names that shine with a fair and honest lustre on the infancy of nations CHAPTER XIX sixteen forty four sixteen forty five PEACE IROQUOIS PRISONERS PISKARET HIS EXPLOITS MORE PRISONERS IROQUOIS EMBASSY THE ORATOR THE GREAT COUNCIL SPEECHES OF KIOTSATON MUSTER OF SAVAGES PEACE CONFIRMED In the damp and freshness of a midsummer morning when the sun had not yet risen but when the river and the sky were red with the glory of approaching day the inmates of the fort at Three Rivers were roused by a tumult of joyous and exultant voices They thronged to the shore priests soldiers traders and officers mingled with warriors and shrill voiced squaws from Huron and Algonquin camps in the neighboring forest Close at hand they saw twelve or fifteen canoes slowly drifting down the current of the saint Lawrence manned by eighty young Indians all singing their songs of victory and striking their paddles against the edges of their bark vessels in cadence with their voices Among them three Iroquois prisoners stood upright singing loud and defiantly as men not fearing torture or death A few days before these young warriors in part Huron and in part Algonquin had gone out on the war path to the River Richelieu where they had presently found themselves entangled among several bands of Iroquois They withdrew in the night after a battle in the dark with an Iroquois canoe and as they approached Fort Richelieu had the good fortune to discover ten of their enemy ambuscaded in a clump of bushes and fallen trees watching to waylay some of the soldiers on their morning visit to the fishing nets in the river hard by They captured three of them and carried them back in triumph The victors landed amid screams of exultation Two of the prisoners were assigned to the Hurons and the third to the Algonquins who immediately took him to their lodges near the fort at Three Rivers and began the usual caress by burning his feet with red hot stones and cutting off his fingers Champfleur the commandant went out to them with urgent remonstrances and at length prevailed on them to leave their victim without further injury until Montmagny the Governor should arrive He came with all dispatch not wholly from a motive of humanity but partly in the hope that the three captives might be made instrumental in concluding a peace with their countrymen A council was held in the fort at Three Rivers Montmagny made valuable presents to the Algonquins and the Hurons to induce them to place the prisoners in his hands The Algonquins complied and the unfortunate Iroquois gashed maimed and scorched was given up to the French who treated him with the greatest kindness But neither the Governor s gifts nor his eloquence could persuade the Hurons to follow the example of their allies and they departed for their own country with their two captives promising however not to burn them but to use them for negotiations of peace With this pledge scarcely worth the breath that uttered it Montmagny was forced to content himself Vimont Relation sixteen forty four forty five forty nine Thus it appeared that the fortune of war did not always smile even on the Iroquois Indeed if there is faith in Indian tradition there had been a time scarcely half a century past when the Mohawks perhaps the fiercest and haughtiest of the confederate nations had been nearly destroyed by the Algonquins whom they now held in contempt one This people whose inferiority arose chiefly from the want of that compact organization in which lay the strength of the Iroquois had not lost their ancient warlike spirit and they had one champion of whom even the audacious confederates stood in awe His name was Piskaret and he dwelt on that great island in the Ottawa of which Le Borgne was chief He had lately turned Christian in the hope of French favor and countenance always useful to an ambitious Indian and perhaps too with an eye to the gun and powder horn which formed the earthly reward of the convert two Tradition tells marvellous stories of his exploits Once it is said he entered an Iroquois town on a dark night His first care was to seek out a hiding place and he soon found one in the midst of a large wood pile three Next he crept into a lodge and finding the inmates asleep killed them with his war club took their scalps and quietly withdrew to the retreat he had prepared In the morning a howl of lamentation and fury rose from the astonished villagers They ranged the fields and forests in vain pursuit of the mysterious enemy who remained all day in the wood pile whence at midnight he came forth and repeated his former exploit On the third night every family placed its sentinels and Piskaret stealthily creeping from lodge to lodge and reconnoitring each through crevices in the bark saw watchers everywhere At length he descried a sentinel who had fallen asleep near the entrance of a lodge though his companion at the other end was still awake and vigilant He pushed aside the sheet of bark that served as a door struck the sleeper a deadly blow yelled his war cry and fled like the wind All the village swarmed out in furious chase but Piskaret was the swiftest runner of his time and easily kept in advance of his pursuers When daylight came he showed himself from time to time to lure them on then yelled defiance and distanced them again At night all but six had given over the chase and even these exhausted as they were had begun to despair Piskaret seeing a hollow tree crept into it like a bear and hid himself while the Iroquois losing his traces in the dark lay down to sleep near by At midnight he emerged from his retreat stealthily approached his slumbering enemies nimbly brained them all with his war club and then burdened with a goodly bundle of scalps journeyed homeward in triumph four one Relation sixteen sixty six anonymous Both Parrot and La Potherie recount traditions of the ancient superiority of the Algonquins over the Iroquois who formerly it is said dwelt near Montreal and Three Rivers whence the Algonquins expelled them They withdrew first to the neighborhood of Lake Erie then to that of Lake Ontario their historic seat There is much to support the conjecture that the Indians found by Cartier at Montreal in fifteen thirty five were Iroquois See Pioneers of France one hundred eighty nine That they belonged to the same family of tribes is certain For the traditions alluded to see Perrot nine twelve seventy nine and La Potherie I two hundred eighty eight two hundred ninety five two Simon Pieskaret n estoit Chrestien qu en apparence et par police Lalemant Relation sixteen forty seven sixty eight He afterwards became a convert in earnest three Both the Iroquois and the Hurons collected great quantities of wood in their villages in the autumn four This story is told by La Potherie I two hundred ninety nine and more briefly by Perrot one hundred seven La Potherie writing more than half a century after the time in question represents the Iroquois as habitually in awe of the Algonquins In this all the contemporary writers contradict him This is but one of several stories that tradition has preserved of his exploits and with all reasonable allowances it is certain that the crafty and valiant Algonquin was the model of an Indian warrior That which follows rests on a far safer basis Early in the spring of sixteen forty five Piskaret with six other converted Indians some of them better Christians than he set out on a war party and after dragging their canoes over the frozen saint Lawrence launched them on the open stream of the Richelieu They ascended to Lake Champlain and hid themselves in the leafless forests of a large island watching patiently for their human prey One day they heard a distant shot Come friends said Piskaret let us get our dinner perhaps it will be the last for we must dine before we run Having dined to their contentment the philosophic warriors prepared for action One of them went to reconnoitre and soon reported that two canoes full of Iroquois were approaching the island Piskaret and his followers crouched in the bushes at the point for which the canoes were making and as the foremost drew near each chose his mark and fired with such good effect that of seven warriors all but one were killed The survivor jumped overboard and swam for the other canoe where he was taken in It now contained eight Iroquois who far from attempting to escape paddled in haste for a distant part of the shore in order to land give battle and avenge their slain comrades But the Algonquins running through the woods reached the landing before them and as one of them rose to fire they shot him In his fall he overset the canoe The water was shallow and the submerged warriors presently finding foothold waded towards the shore and made desperate fight The Algonquins had the advantage of position and used it so well that they killed all but three of their enemies and captured two of the survivors Next they sought out the bodies carefully scalped them and set out in triumph on their return To the credit of their Jesuit teachers they treated their prisoners with a forbearance hitherto without example One of them who was defiant and abusive received a blow to silence him but no further indignity was offered to either According to Marie de l Incarnation Lettre fourteen Sept sixteen forty five Piskaret was for torturing the captives but a convert named Bernard by the French protested against it As the successful warriors approached the little mission settlement of Sillery immediately above Quebec they raised their song of triumph and beat time with their paddles on the edges of their canoes while from eleven poles raised aloft eleven fresh scalps fluttered in the wind The Father Jesuit and all his flock were gathered on the strand to welcome them The Indians fired their guns and screeched in jubilation one Jean Baptiste a Christian chief of Sillery made a speech from the shore Piskaret replied standing upright in his canoe and to crown the occasion a squad of soldiers marching in haste from Quebec fired a salute of musketry to the boundless delight of the Indians Much to the surprise of the two captives there was no running of the gantlet no gnawing off of finger nails or cutting off of fingers but the scalps were hung like little flags over the entrances of the lodges and all Sillery betook itself to feasting and rejoicing Vimont Relation sixteen forty five nineteen twenty one One old woman indeed came to the Jesuit with a pathetic appeal Oh my Father let me caress these prisoners a little they have killed burned and eaten my father my husband and my children But the missionary answered with a lecture on the duty of forgiveness Vimont Relation sixteen forty five twenty one twenty two On the next day Montmagny came to Sillery and there was a grand council in the house of the Jesuits Piskaret in a solemn harangue delivered his captives to the Governor who replied with a speech of compliment and an ample gift The two Iroquois were present seated with a seeming imperturbability but great anxiety of heart and when at length they comprehended that their lives were safe one of them a man of great size and symmetry rose and addressed Montmagny Onontio one I am saved from the fire my body is delivered from death Onontio you have given me my life I thank you for it I will never forget it All my country will be grateful to you The earth will be bright the river calm and smooth there will be peace and friendship between us The shadow is before my eyes no longer The spirits of my ancestors slain by the Algonquins have disappeared Onontio you are good we are bad But our anger is gone I have no heart but for peace and rejoicing As he said this he began to dance holding his hands upraised as if apostrophizing the sky Suddenly he snatched a hatchet brandished it for a moment like a madman and then flung it into the fire saying as he did so Thus I throw down my anger thus I cast away the weapons of blood Farewell war Now I am your friend forever two one Onontio Great Mountain a translation of Montmagny s name It was the Iroquois name ever after for the Governor of Canada In the same manner Onas Feather or Quill became the official name of William Penn and all succeeding Governors of Pennsylvania We have seen that the Iroquois hereditary chiefs had official names which are the same to day that they were at the period of this narrative two Vimont Relation sixteen forty five twenty two twenty three He adds that if these people are barbarous in deed they have thoughts worthy of Greeks and Romans The two prisoners were allowed to roam at will about the settlement withheld from escaping by an Indian point of honor Montmagny soon after sent them to Three Rivers where the Iroquois taken during the last summer had remained all winter Champfleur the commandant now received orders to clothe equip and send him home with a message to his nation that Onontio made them a present of his life and that he had still two prisoners in his hands whom he would also give them if they saw fit to embrace this opportunity of making peace with the French and their Indian allies This was at the end of May On the fifth of July following the liberated Iroquois reappeared at Three Rivers bringing with him two men of renown ambassadors of the Mohawk nation There was a fourth man of the party and as they approached the Frenchmen on the shore recognized to their great delight Guillaume Couture the young man captured three years before with Father Jogues and long since given up as dead In dress and appearance he was an Iroquois He had gained a great influence over his captors and this embassy of peace was due in good measure to his persuasions Marie de l Incarnation Lettre fourteen Sept sixteen forty five The chief of the Iroquois Kiotsaton a tall savage covered from head to foot with belts of wampum stood erect in the prow of the sail boat which had brought him and his companions from Richelieu and in a loud voice announced himself as the accredited envoy of his nation The boat fired a swivel the fort replied with a cannon shot and the envoys landed in state Kiotsaton and his colleague were conducted to the room of the commandant where seated on the floor they were regaled sumptuously and presented in due course with pipes of tobacco They had never before seen anything so civilized and were delighted with their entertainment We are glad to see you said Champfleur to Kiotsaton you may be sure that you are safe here It is as if you were among your own people and in your own house Tell your chief that he lies replied the honored guest addressing the interpreter Champfleur though he probably knew that this was but an Indian mode of expressing dissent showed some little surprise when Kiotsaton after tranquilly smoking for a moment proceeded Your chief says it is as if I were in my own country This is not true for there I am not so honored and caressed He says it is as if I were in my own house but in my own house I am some times very ill served and here you feast me with all manner of good cheer From this and many other replies the French conceived that they had to do with a man of esprit Vimont Relation sixteen forty five twenty four He undoubtedly belonged to that class of professed orators who though rarely or never claiming the honors of hereditary chieftainship had great influence among the Iroquois and were employed in all affairs of embassy and negotiation They had memories trained to an astonishing tenacity were perfect in all the conventional metaphors in which the language of Indian diplomacy and rhetoric mainly consisted knew by heart the traditions of the nation and were adepts in the parliamentary usages which among the Iroquois were held little less than sacred The ambassadors were feasted for a week not only by the French but also by the Hurons and Algonquins and then the grand peace council took place Montmagny had come up from Quebec and with him the chief men of the colony It was a bright midsummer day and the sun beat hot upon the parched area of the fort where awnings were spread to shelter the assembly On one side sat Montmagny with officers and others who attended him Near him was Vimont Superior of the Mission and other Jesuits Jogues among the rest Immediately before them sat the Iroquois on sheets of spruce bark spread on the ground like mats for they had insisted on being near the French as a sign of the extreme love they had of late conceived towards them On the opposite side of the area were the Algonquins in their several divisions of the Algonquins proper the Montagnais and the Atticamegues one sitting lying or squatting on the ground On the right hand and on the left were Hurons mingled with Frenchmen In the midst was a large open space like the arena of a prize ring and here were planted two poles with a line stretched from one to the other on which in due time were to be hung the wampum belts that represented the words of the orator For the present these belts were in part hung about the persons of the two ambassadors and in part stored in a bag carried by one of them one The Atticamegues or tribe of the White Fish dwelt in the forests north of Three Rivers They much resembled their Montagnais kindred When all was ready Kiotsaton arose strode into the open space and raising his tall figure erect stood looking for a moment at the sun Then he gazed around on the assembly took a wampum belt in his hand and began Onontio give ear I am the mouth of all my nation When you listen to me you listen to all the Iroquois There is no evil in my heart My song is a song of peace We have many war songs in our country but we have thrown them all away and now we sing of nothing but gladness and rejoicing Hereupon he began to sing his countrymen joining with him He walked to and fro gesticulated towards the sky and seemed to apostrophize the sun then turning towards the Governor resumed his harangue First he thanked him for the life of the Iroquois prisoner released in the spring but blamed him for sending him home without company or escort Then he led forth the young Frenchman Guillaume Couture and tied a wampum belt to his arm With this he said I give you back this prisoner I did not say to him Nephew take a canoe and go home to Quebec I should have been without sense had I done so I should have been troubled in my heart lest some evil might befall him The prisoner whom you sent back to us suffered every kind of danger and hardship on the way Here he proceeded to represent the difficulties of the journey in pantomime so natural says Father Vimont that no actor in France could equal it He counterfeited the lonely traveller toiling up some rocky portage track with a load of baggage on his head now stopping as if half spent and now tripping against a stone Next he was in his canoe vainly trying to urge it against the swift current looking around in despair on the foaming rapids then recovering courage and paddling desperately for his life What did you mean demanded the orator resuming his harangue by sending a man alone among these dangers I have not done so Come nephew I said to the prisoner there before you pointing to Couture follow me I will see you home at the risk of my life And to confirm his words he hung another belt on the line The third belt was to declare that the nation of the speaker had sent presents to the other nations to recall their war parties in view of the approaching peace The fourth was an assurance that the memory of the slain Iroquois no longer stirred the living to vengeance I passed near the place where Piskaret and the Algonquins slew our warriors in the spring I saw the scene of the fight where the two prisoners here were taken I passed quickly I would not look on the blood of my people Their bodies lie there still I turned away my eyes that I might not be angry Then stooping he struck the ground and seemed to listen I heard the voice of my ancestors slain by the Algonquins crying to me in a tone of affection My grandson my grandson restrain your anger think no more of us for you cannot deliver us from death think of the living rescue them from the knife and the fire When I heard these voices I went on my way and journeyed hither to deliver those whom you still hold in captivity The fifth sixth and seventh belts were to open the passage by water from the French to the Iroquois to chase hostile canoes from the river smooth away the rapids and cataracts and calm the waves of the lake The eighth cleared the path by land You would have said writes Vimont that he was cutting down trees hacking off branches dragging away bushes and filling up holes Look exclaimed the orator when he had ended this pantomime the road is open smooth and straight and he bent towards the earth as if to see that no impediment remained There is no thorn or stone or log in the way Now you may see the smoke of our villages from Quebec to the heart of our country Another belt of unusual size and beauty was to bind the Iroquois the French and their Indian allies together as one man As he presented it the orator led forth a Frenchman and an Algonquin from among his auditors and linking his arms with theirs pressed them closely to his sides in token of indissoluble union The next belt invited the French to feast with the Iroquois Our country is full of fish venison moose beaver and game of every kind Leave these filthy swine that run about among your houses feeding on garbage and come and eat good food with us The road is open there is no danger There was another belt to scatter the clouds that the sun might shine on the hearts of the Indians and the French and reveal their sincerity and truth to all then others still to confirm the Hurons in thoughts of peace By the fifteenth belt Kiotsaton declared that the Iroquois had always wished to send home Jogues and Bressani to their friends and had meant to do so but that Jogues was stolen from them by the Dutch and they had given Bressani to them because he desired it If he had but been patient added the ambassador I would have brought him back myself Now I know not what has befallen him Perhaps he is drowned Perhaps he is dead Here Jogues said with a smile to the Jesuits near him They had the pile laid to burn me They would have killed me a hundred times if God had not saved my life Two or three more belts were hung on the line each with its appropriate speech and then the speaker closed his harangue I go to spend what remains of the summer in my own country in games and dances and rejoicing for the blessing of peace He had interspersed his discourse throughout with now a song and now a dance and the council ended in a general dancing in which Iroquois Hurons Algonquins Montagnais Atticamegues and French all took part after their respective fashions In spite of one or two palpable falsehoods that embellished his oratory the Jesuits were delighted with him Every one admitted says Vimont that he was eloquent and pathetic In short he showed himself an excellent actor for one who has had no instructor but Nature I gathered only a few fragments of his speech from the mouth of the interpreter who gave us but broken portions of it and did not translate consecutively Vimont describes the council at length in the Relation of sixteen forty five Marie de l Incarnation also describes it in a letter to her son of Sept fourteen sixteen forty five She evidently gained her information from Vimont and the other Jesuits present Two days after another council was called when the Governor gave his answer accepting the proffered peace and confirming his acceptance by gifts of considerable value He demanded as a condition that the Indian allies of the French should be left unmolested until their principal chiefs who were not then present should make a formal treaty with the Iroquois in behalf of their several nations Piskaret then made a present to wipe away the remembrance of the Iroquois he had slaughtered and the assembly was dissolved In the evening Vimont invited the ambassadors to the mission house and gave each of them a sack of tobacco and a pipe In return Kiotsaton made him a speech When I left my country I gave up my life I went to meet death and I owe it to you that I am yet alive I thank you that I still see the sun I thank you for all your words and acts of kindness I thank you for your gifts You have covered me with them from head to foot You left nothing free but my mouth and now you have stopped that with a handsome pipe and regaled it with the taste of the herb we love I bid you farewell not for a long time for you will hear from us soon Even if we should be drowned on our way home the winds and the waves will bear witness to our countrymen of your favors and I am sure that some good spirit has gone before us to tell them of the good news that we are about to bring Vimont Relation sixteen forty five twenty eight On the next day he and his companion set forth on their return Kiotsaton when he saw his party embarked turned to the French and Indians who lined the shore and said with a loud voice Farewell brothers I am one of your relations now Then turning to the Governor Onontio your name will be great over all the earth When I came hither I never thought to carry back my head I never thought to come out of your doors alive and now I return loaded with honors gifts and kindness Brothers to the Indians obey Onontio and the French Their hearts and their thoughts are good Be friends with them and do as they do You shall hear from us soon The Indians whooped and fired their guns there was a cannon shot from the fort and the sail boat that bore the distinguished visitors moved on its way towards the Richelieu But the work was not done There must be more councils speeches wampum belts and gifts of all kinds more feasts dances songs and uproar The Indians gathered at Three Rivers were not sufficient in numbers or in influence to represent their several tribes and more were on their way The principal men of the Hurons were to come down this year with Algonquins of many tribes from the North and the Northwest and Kiotsaton had promised that Iroquois ambassadors duly empowered should meet them at Three Rivers and make a solemn peace with them all under the eye of Onontio But what hope was there that this swarm of fickle and wayward savages could be gathered together at one time and at one place or that being there they could be restrained from cutting each other s throats Yet so it was and in this happy event the Jesuits saw the interposition of God wrought upon by the prayers of those pious souls in France who daily and nightly besieged Heaven with supplications for the welfare of the Canadian missions Vimont Relation sixteen forty five twenty nine First came a band of Montagnais next followed Nipissings Atticamegues and Algonquins of the Ottawa their canoes deep laden with furs Then on the tenth of September appeared the great fleet of the Hurons sixty canoes bearing a host of warriors among whom the French recognized the tattered black cassock of Father Jerome Lalemant There were twenty French soldiers too returning from the Huron country whither they had been sent the year before to guard the Fathers and their flock Three Rivers swarmed like an ant hill with savages The shore was lined with canoes the forests and the fields were alive with busy camps The trade was brisk and in its attendant speeches feasts and dances there was no respite But where were the Iroquois Montmagny and the Jesuits grew very anxious In a few days more the concourse would begin to disperse and the golden moment be lost It was a great relief when a canoe appeared with tidings that the promised embassy was on its way and yet more when on the seventeenth four Iroquois approached the shore and in a loud voice announced themselves as envoys of their nation The tumult was prodigious Montmagny s soldiers formed a double rank and the savage rabble with wild eyes and faces smeared with grease and paint stared over the shoulders and between the gun barrels of the musketeers as the ambassadors of their deadliest foe stalked with unmoved visages towards the fort Now council followed council with an insufferable prolixity of speech making There were belts to wipe out the memory of the slain belts to clear the sky smooth the rivers and calm the lakes a belt to take the hatchet from the hands of the Iroquois another to take away their guns another to take away their shields another to wash the war paint from their faces and another to break the kettle in which they boiled their prisoners Vimont Relation sixteen forty five thirty four In short there were belts past numbering each with its meaning sometimes literal sometimes figurative but all bearing upon the great work of peace At length all was ended The dances ceased the songs and the whoops died away and the great muster dispersed some to their smoky lodges on the distant shores of Lake Huron and some to frozen hunting grounds in northern forests There was peace in this dark and blood stained wilderness The lynx the panther and the wolf had made a covenant of love but who should be their surety A doubt and a fear mingled with the joy of the Jesuit Fathers and to their thanksgivings to God they joined a prayer that the hand which had given might still be stretched forth to preserve CHAPTER XX sixteen forty five sixteen forty six THE PEACE BROKEN UNCERTAINTIES THE MISSION OF JOGUES HE REACHES THE MOHAWKS HIS RECEPTION HIS RETURN HIS SECOND MISSION WARNINGS OF DANGER RAGE OF THE MOHAWKS MURDER OF JOGUES There is little doubt that the Iroquois negotiators acted for the moment in sincerity Guillaume Couture who returned with them and spent the winter in their towns saw sufficient proof that they sincerely desired peace And yet the treaty had a double defect First the wayward capricious and ungoverned nature of the Indian parties to it on both sides made a speedy rupture more than likely Secondly in spite of their own assertion to the contrary the Iroquois envoys represented not the confederacy of the five nations but only one of these nations the Mohawks for each of the members of this singular league could and often did make peace and war independently of the rest It was the Mohawks who had made war on the French and their Indian allies on the lower saint Lawrence They claimed as against the other Iroquois a certain right of domain to all this region and though the warriors of the four upper nations had sometimes poached on the Mohawk preserve by murdering both French and Indians at Montreal they employed their energies for the most part in attacks on the Hurons the Upper Algonquins and other tribes of the interior These attacks still continued unaffected by the peace with the Mohawks Imperfect however as the treaty was it was invaluable could it but be kept inviolate and to this end Montmagny the Jesuits and all the colony anxiously turned their thoughts The Mohawks were at this time more numerous as compared with the other four nations of the Iroquois than they were a few years later They seem to have suffered more reverses in war than any of the others At this time they may be reckoned at six or seven hundred warriors A war with the Mohegans and another with the Andastes besides their war with the Algonquins and the French of Canada soon after told severely on their strength The following are estimates of the numbers of the Iroquois warriors made in sixteen sixty by the author of the Relation of that year and by Wentworth Greenhalgh in sixteen seventy seven from personal inspection sixteen sixty sixteen seventy seven Mohawks five hundred three hundred Oneidas one hundred two hundred Onondagas three hundred three hundred fifty Cayugas three hundred three hundred Senecas one thousand one thousand twenty two hundred twenty one fifty It was to hold the Mohawks to their faith that Couture had bravely gone back to winter among them but an agent of more acknowledged weight was needed and Father Isaac Jogues was chosen No white man Couture excepted knew their language and their character so well His errand was half political half religious for not only was he to be the bearer of gifts wampum belts and messages from the Governor but he was also to found a new mission christened in advance with a prophetic name the Mission of the Martyrs For two years past Jogues had been at Montreal and it was here that he received the order of his Superior to proceed to the Mohawk towns At first nature asserted itself and he recoiled involuntarily at the thought of the horrors of which his scarred body and his mutilated hands were a living memento Lettre du P Isaac Jogues au B P Jerosme L Allemant Montreal two Mai sixteen forty six MS It was a transient weakness and he prepared to depart with more than willingness giving thanks to Heaven that he had been found worthy to suffer and to die for the saving of souls and the greater glory of God He felt a presentiment that his death was near and wrote to a friend I shall go and shall not return Ibo et non redibo Lettre du P Jogues au R P No date An Algonquin convert gave him sage advice Say nothing about the Faith at first for there is nothing so repulsive in the beginning as our doctrine which seems to destroy everything that men hold dear and as your long cassock preaches as well as your lips you had better put on a short coat Jogues therefore exchanged the uniform of Loyola for a civilian s doublet and hose for observes his Superior one should be all things to all men that he may gain them all to Jesus Christ Lalemant Relation sixteen forty six fifteen It would be well if the application of the maxim had always been as harmless Jogues left Three Rivers about the middle of May with the Sieur Bourdon engineer to the Governor two Algonquins with gifts to confirm the peace and four Mohawks as guides and escort He passed the Richelieu and Lake Champlain well remembered scenes of former miseries and reached the foot of Lake George on the eve of Corpus Christi Thence he called the lake Lac saint Sacrement and this name it preserved until a century after an ambitious Irishman in compliment to the sovereign from whom he sought advancement gave it the name it bears mister Shea very reasonably suggests that a change from Lake George to Lake Jogues would be equally easy and appropriate From Lake George they crossed on foot to the Hudson where being greatly fatigued by their heavy loads of gifts they borrowed canoes at an Iroquois fishing station and descended to Fort Orange Here Jogues met the Dutch friends to whom he owed his life and who now kindly welcomed and entertained him After a few days he left them and ascended the River Mohawk to the first Mohawk town Crowds gathered from the neighboring towns to gaze on the man whom they had known as a scorned and abused slave and who now appeared among them as the ambassador of a power which hitherto indeed they had despised but which in their present mood they were willing to propitiate There was a council in one of the lodges and while his crowded auditory smoked their pipes Jogues stood in the midst and harangued them He offered in due form the gifts of the Governor with the wampum belts and their messages of peace while at every pause his words were echoed by a unanimous grunt of applause from the attentive concourse Peace speeches were made in return and all was harmony When however the Algonquin deputies stood before the council they and their gifts were coldly received The old hate maintained by traditions of mutual atrocity burned fiercely under a thin semblance of peace and though no outbreak took place the prospect of the future was very ominous The business of the embassy was scarcely finished when the Mohawks counselled Jogues and his companions to go home with all despatch saying that if they waited longer they might meet on the way warriors of the four upper nations who would inevitably kill the two Algonquin deputies if not the French also Jogues therefore set out on his return but not until despite the advice of the Indian convert he had made the round of the houses confessed and instructed a few Christian prisoners still remaining here and baptized several dying Mohawks Then he and his party crossed through the forest to the southern extremity of Lake George made bark canoes and descended to Fort Richelieu where they arrived on the twenty seventh of June Lalemant Relation sixteen forty six seventeen His political errand was accomplished Now should he return to the Mohawks or should the Mission of the Martyrs be for a time abandoned Lalemant who had succeeded Vimont as Superior of the missions held a council at Quebec with three other Jesuits of whom Jogues was one and it was determined that unless some new contingency should arise he should remain for the winter at Montreal Journal des Superieurs des Jesuites MS This was in July Soon after the plan was changed for reasons which do not appear and Jogues received orders to repair to his dangerous post He set out on the twenty fourth of August accompanied by a young Frenchman named Lalande and three or four Hurons Journal des Superieurs des Jesuites MS On the way they met Indians who warned them of a change of feeling in the Mohawk towns and the Hurons alarmed refused to go farther Jogues naturally perhaps the most timid man of the party had no thought of drawing back and pursued his journey with his young companion who like other donnes of the missions was scarcely behind the Jesuits themselves in devoted enthusiasm The reported change of feeling had indeed taken place and the occasion of it was characteristic On his previous visit to the Mohawks Jogues meaning to return had left in their charge a small chest or box From the first they were distrustful suspecting that it contained some secret mischief He therefore opened it and showed them the contents which were a few personal necessaries and having thus as he thought reassured them locked the box and left it in their keeping The Huron prisoners in the town attempted to make favor with their Iroquois enemies by abusing their French friends declaring them to be sorcerers who had bewitched by their charms and mummeries the whole Huron nation and caused drought famine pestilence and a host of insupportable miseries Thereupon the suspicions of the Mohawks against the box revived with double force and they were convinced that famine the pest or some malignant spirit was shut up in it waiting the moment to issue forth and destroy them There was sickness in the town and caterpillars were eating their corn this was ascribed to the sorceries of the Jesuit Lettre de Marie de l Incarnation a son Fils Quebec sixteen forty seven Still they were divided in opinion Some stood firm for the French others were furious against them Among the Mohawks three clans or families were predominant if indeed they did not compose the entire nation the clans of the Bear the Tortoise and the Wolf See Introduction Though by the nature of their constitution it was scarcely possible that these clans should come to blows so intimately were they bound together by ties of blood yet they were often divided on points of interest or policy and on this occasion the Bear raged against the French and howled for war while the Tortoise and the Wolf still clung to the treaty Among savages with no government except the intermittent one of councils the party of action and violence must always prevail The Bear chiefs sang their war songs and followed by the young men of their own clan and by such others as they had infected with their frenzy set forth in two bands on the war path The warriors of one of these bands were making their way through the forests between the Mohawk and Lake George when they met Jogues and Lalande They seized them stripped them and led them in triumph to their town Here a savage crowd surrounded them beating them with sticks and with their fists One of them cut thin strips of flesh from the back and arms of Jogues saying as he did so Let us see if this white flesh is the flesh of an oki I am a man like yourselves replied Jogues but I do not fear death or torture I do not know why you would kill me I come here to confirm the peace and show you the way to heaven and you treat me like a dog one You shall die to morrow cried the rabble Take courage we shall not burn you We shall strike you both with a hatchet and place your heads on the palisade that your brothers may see you when we take them prisoners two The clans of the Wolf and the Tortoise still raised their voices in behalf of the captive Frenchmen but the fury of the minority swept all before it one Lettre du P De Quen au R P Lallemant no date MS two Lettre de J Labatie a M La Montagne Fort d Orange thirty Oct sixteen forty six MS In the evening it was the eighteenth of October Jogues smarting with his wounds and bruises was sitting in one of the lodges when an Indian entered and asked him to a feast To refuse would have been an offence He arose and followed the savage who led him to the lodge of the Bear chief Jogues bent his head to enter when another Indian standing concealed within at the side of the doorway struck at him with a hatchet An Iroquois called by the French Le Berger one who seems to have followed in order to defend him bravely held out his arm to ward off the blow but the hatchet cut through it and sank into the missionary s brain He fell at the feet of his murderer who at once finished the work by hacking off his head Lalande was left in suspense all night and in the morning was killed in a similar manner The bodies of the two Frenchmen were then thrown into the Mohawk and their heads displayed on the points of the palisade which inclosed the town two one It has been erroneously stated that this brave attempt to save Jogues was made by the orator Kiotsaton Le Berger was one of those who had been made prisoners by Piskaret and treated kindly by the French In sixteen forty eight he voluntarily came to Three Rivers and gave himself up to a party of Frenchmen He was converted baptized and carried to France where his behavior is reported to have been very edifying but where he soon died Perhaps he had eaten his share of more than fifty men is the reflection of Father Ragueneau after recounting his exemplary conduct Relation sixteen fifty forty three forty eight two In respect to the death of Jogues the best authority is the letter of Labatie before cited He was the French interpreter at Fort Orange and being near the scene of the murder took pains to learn the facts The letter was inclosed in another written to Montmagny by the Dutch Governor Kieft which is also before me together with a MS account written from hearsay by Father Buteux and a letter of De Quen cited above Compare the Relations of sixteen forty seven and sixteen fifty Thus died Isaac Jogues one of the purest examples of Roman Catholic virtue which this Western continent has seen The priests his associates praise his humility and tell us that it reached the point of self contempt a crowning virtue in their eyes that he regarded himself as nothing and lived solely to do the will of God as uttered by the lips of his Superiors They add that when left to the guidance of his own judgment his self distrust made him very slow of decision but that when acting under orders he knew neither hesitation nor fear With all his gentleness he had a certain warmth or vivacity of temperament and we have seen how during his first captivity while humbly submitting to every caprice of his tyrants and appearing to rejoice in abasement a derisive word against his faith would change the lamb into the lion and the lips that seemed so tame would speak in sharp bold tones of menace and reproof CHAPTER XXI sixteen forty six sixteen forty seven ANOTHER WAR MOHAWK INROADS THE HUNTERS OF MEN THE CAPTIVE CONVERTS THE ESCAPE OF MARIE HER STORY THE ALGONQUIN PRISONER S REVENGE HER FLIGHT TERROR OF THE COLONISTS JESUIT INTREPIDITY The peace was broken and the hounds of war turned loose The contagion spread through all the Mohawk nation the war songs were sung and the warriors took the path for Canada The miserable colonists and their more miserable allies woke from their dream of peace to a reality of fear and horror Again Montreal and Three Rivers were beset with murdering savages skulking in thickets and prowling under cover of night yet when it came to blows displaying a courage almost equal to the ferocity that inspired it They plundered and burned Fort Richelieu which its small garrison had abandoned thus leaving the colony without even the semblance of protection Before the spring opened all the fighting men of the Mohawks took the war path but it is clear that many of them still had little heart for their bloody and perfidious work for of these hardy and all enduring warriors two thirds gave out on the way and returned complaining that the season was too severe Lettre du P Buteux au R P Lalemant MS Two hundred or more kept on divided into several bands On Ash Wednesday the French at Three Rivers were at mass in the chapel when the Iroquois quietly approaching plundered two houses close to the fort containing all the property of the neighboring inhabitants which had been brought hither as to a place of security They hid their booty and then went in quest of two large parties of Christian Algonquins engaged in their winter hunt Two Indians of the same nation whom they captured basely set them on the trail and they took up the chase like hounds on the scent of game Wrapped in furs or blanket coats some with gun in hand some with bows and quivers and all with hatchets war clubs knives or swords striding on snow shoes with bodies half bent through the gray forests and the frozen pine swamps among wet black trunks along dark ravines and under savage hill sides their small fierce eyes darting quick glances that pierced the farthest recesses of the naked woods the hunters of men followed the track of their human prey At length they descried the bark wigwams of the Algonquin camp The warriors were absent none were here but women and children The Iroquois surrounded the huts and captured all the shrieking inmates Then ten of them set out to find the traces of the absent hunters They soon met the renowned Piskaret returning alone As they recognized him and knew his mettle they thought treachery better than an open attack They therefore approached him in the attitude of friends while he ignorant of the rupture of the treaty began to sing his peace song Scarcely had they joined him when one of them ran a sword through his body and having scalped him they returned in triumph to their companions one All the hunters were soon after waylaid overpowered by numbers and killed or taken prisoners one Lalemant Relation sixteen forty seven four Marie de l Incarnation Lettre a son Fils Quebec sixteen forty seven Perrot s account drawn from tradition is different though not essentially so Another band of the Mohawks had meanwhile pursued the other party of Algonquins and overtaken them on the march as incumbered with their sledges and baggage they were moving from one hunting camp to another Though taken by surprise they made fight and killed several of their assailants but in a few moments their resistance was overcome and those who survived the fray were helpless in the clutches of the enraged victors Then began a massacre of the old the disabled and the infants with the usual beating gashing and severing of fingers to the rest The next day the two bands of Mohawks each with its troop of captives fast bound met at an appointed spot on the Lake of saint Peter and greeted each other with yells of exultation with which mingled a wail of anguish as the prisoners of either party recognized their companions in misery They all kneeled in the midst of their savage conquerors and one of the men a noted convert after a few words of exhortation repeated in a loud voice a prayer to which the rest responded Then they sang an Algonquin hymn while the Iroquois who at first had stared in wonder broke into laughter and derision and at length fell upon them with renewed fury One was burned alive on the spot Another tried to escape and they burned the soles of his feet that he might not repeat the attempt Many others were maimed and mangled and some of the women who afterwards escaped affirmed that in ridicule of the converts they crucified a small child by nailing it with wooden spikes against a thick sheet of bark The prisoners were led to the Mohawk towns and it is needless to repeat the monotonous and revolting tale of torture and death The men as usual were burned but the lives of the women and children were spared in order to strengthen the conquerors by their adoption not however until both but especially the women had been made to endure the extremes of suffering and indignity Several of them from time to time escaped and reached Canada with the story of their woes Among these was Marie the wife of Jean Baptiste one of the principal Algonquin converts captured and burned with the rest Early in June she appeared in a canoe at Montreal where Madame d Ailleboust to whom she was well known received her with great kindness and led her to her room in the fort Here Marie was overcome with emotion Madame d Ailleboust spoke Algonquin with ease and her words of sympathy joined to the associations of a place where the unhappy fugitive with her murdered husband and child had often found a friendly welcome so wrought upon her that her voice was smothered with sobs She had once before been a prisoner of the Iroquois at the town of Onondaga When she and her companions in misfortune had reached the Mohawk towns she was recognized by several Onondagas who chanced to be there and who partly by threats and partly by promises induced her to return with them to the scene of her former captivity where they assured her of good treatment With their aid she escaped from the Mohawks and set out with them for Onondaga On their way they passed the great town of the Oneidas and her conductors fearing that certain Mohawks who were there would lay claim to her found a hiding place for her in the forest where they gave her food and told her to wait their return She lay concealed all day and at night approached the town under cover of darkness A dull red glare of flames rose above the jagged tops of the palisade that encompassed it and from the pandemonium within an uproar of screams yells and bursts of laughter told her that they were burning one of her captive countrymen She gazed and listened shivering with cold and aghast with horror The thought possessed her that she would soon share his fate and she resolved to fly The ground was still covered with snow and her footprints would infallibly have betrayed her if she had not instead of turning towards home followed the beaten Indian path westward She journeyed on confused and irresolute and tortured between terror and hunger At length she approached Onondaga a few miles from the present city of Syracuse and hid herself in a dense thicket of spruce or cedar whence she crept forth at night to grope in the half melted snow for a few ears of corn left from the last year s harvest She saw many Indians from her lurking place and once a tall savage with an axe on his shoulder advanced directly towards the spot where she lay but in the extremity of her fright she murmured a prayer on which he turned and changed his course The fate that awaited her if she remained for a fugitive could not hope for mercy and the scarcely less terrible dangers of the pitiless wilderness between her and Canada filled her with despair for she was half dead already with hunger and cold She tied her girdle to the bough of a tree and hung herself from it by the neck The cord broke She repeated the attempt with the same result and then the thought came to her that God meant to save her life The snow by this time had melted in the forests and she began her journey for home with a few handfuls of corn as her only provision She directed her course by the sun and for food dug roots peeled the soft inner bark of trees and sometimes caught tortoises in the muddy brooks She had the good fortune to find a hatchet in a deserted camp and with it made one of those wooden implements which the Indians used for kindling fire by friction This saved her from her worst suffering for she had no covering but a thin tunic which left her legs and arms bare and exposed her at night to tortures of cold She built her fire in some deep nook of the forest warmed herself cooked what food she had found told her rosary on her fingers and slept till daylight when she always threw water on the embers lest the rising smoke should attract attention Once she discovered a party of Iroquois hunters but she lay concealed and they passed without seeing her She followed their trail back and found their bark canoe which they had hidden near the bank of a river It was too large for her use but as she was a practised canoe maker she reduced it to a convenient size embarked in it and descended the stream At length she reached the saint Lawrence and paddled with the current towards Montreal On islands and rocky shores she found eggs of water fowl in abundance and she speared fish with a sharpened pole hardened at the point with fire She even killed deer by driving them into the water chasing them in her canoe and striking them on the head with her hatchet When she landed at Montreal her canoe had still a good store of eggs and dried venison This story is taken from the Relation of sixteen forty seven and the letter of Marie de l Incarnation to her son before cited The woman must have descended the great rapids of Lachine in her canoe a feat demanding no ordinary nerve and skill Her journey from Onondaga had occupied about two months under hardships which no woman but a squaw could have survived Escapes not less remarkable of several other women are chronicled in the records of this year and one of them with a notable feat of arms which attended it calls for a brief notice Eight Algonquins in one of those fits of desperate valor which sometimes occur in Indians entered at midnight a camp where thirty or forty Iroquois warriors were buried in sleep and with quick sharp blows of their tomahawks began to brain them as they lay They killed ten of them on the spot and wounded many more The rest panic stricken and bewildered by the surprise and the thick darkness fled into the forest leaving all they had in the hands of the victors including a number of Algonquin captives of whom one had been unwittingly killed by his countrymen in the confusion Another captive a woman had escaped on a previous night They had stretched her on her back with limbs extended and bound her wrists and ankles to four stakes firmly driven into the earth their ordinary mode of securing prisoners Then as usual they all fell asleep She presently became aware that the cord that bound one of her wrists was somewhat loose and by long and painful efforts she freed her hand To release the other hand and her feet was then comparatively easy She cautiously rose Around her breathing in deep sleep lay stretched the dark forms of the unconscious warriors scarcely visible in the gloom She stepped over them to the entrance of the hut and here as she was passing out she descried a hatchet on the ground The temptation was too strong for her Indian nature She seized it and struck again and again with all her force on the skull of the Iroquois who lay at the entrance The sound of the blows and the convulsive struggles of the victim roused the sleepers They sprang up groping in the dark and demanding of each other what was the matter At length they lighted a roll of birch bark found their prisoner gone and their comrade dead and rushed out in a rage in search of the fugitive She meanwhile instead of running away had hid herself in the hollow of a tree which she had observed the evening before Her pursuers ran through the dark woods shouting and whooping to each other and when all had passed she crept from her hiding place and fled in an opposite direction In the morning they found her tracks and followed them On the second day they had overtaken and surrounded her when hearing their cries on all sides she gave up all hope But near at hand in the thickest depths of the forest the beavers had dammed a brook and formed a pond full of gnawed stumps dead fallen trees rank weeds and tangled bushes She plunged in and swimming and wading found a hiding place where her body was concealed by the water and her head by the masses of dead and living vegetation Her pursuers were at fault and after a long search gave up the chase in despair Shivering naked and half starved she crawled out from her wild asylum and resumed her flight By day the briers and bushes tore her unprotected limbs by night she shivered with cold and the mosquitoes and small black gnats of the forest persecuted her with torments which the modern sportsman will appreciate She subsisted on such roots bark reptiles or other small animals as her Indian habits enabled her to gather on her way She crossed streams by swimming or on rafts of driftwood lashed together with strips of linden bark and at length reached the saint Lawrence where with the aid of her hatchet she made a canoe Her home was on the Ottawa and she was ignorant of the great river or at least of this part of it She had scarcely even seen a Frenchman but had heard of the French as friends and knew that their dwellings were on the banks of the saint Lawrence This was her only guide and she drifted on her way doubtful whether the vast current would bear her to the abodes of the living or to the land of souls She passed the watery wilderness of the Lake of saint Peter and presently descried a Huron canoe Fearing that it was an enemy she hid herself and resumed her voyage in the evening when she soon came in sight of the wooden buildings and palisades of Three Rivers Several Hurons saw her at the same moment and made towards her on which she leaped ashore and hid in the bushes whence being entirely without clothing she would not come out till one of them threw her his coat Having wrapped herself in it she went with them to the fort and the house of the Jesuits in a wretched state of emaciation but in high spirits at the happy issue of her voyage Lalemant Relation sixteen forty seven fifteen sixteen Such stories might be multiplied but these will suffice Nor is it necessary to dwell further on the bloody record of inroads butcheries and tortures We have seen enough to show the nature of the scourge that now fell without mercy on the Indians and the French of Canada There was no safety but in the imprisonment of palisades and ramparts A deep dejection sank on the white and red men alike but the Jesuits would not despair Do not imagine writes the Father Superior that the rage of the Iroquois and the loss of many Christians and many catechumens can bring to nought the mystery of the cross of Jesus Christ and the efficacy of his blood We shall die we shall be captured burned butchered be it so Those who die in their beds do not always die the best death I see none of our company cast down On the contrary they ask leave to go up to the Hurons and some of them protest that the fires of the Iroquois are one of their motives for the journey Lalemant Relation sixteen forty seven eight CHAPTER XXII sixteen forty five sixteen fifty one PRIEST AND PURITAN MISCOU TADOUSSAC JOURNEYS OF DE QUEN DRUILLETES HIS WINTER WITH THE MONTAGNAIS INFLUENCE OF THE MISSIONS THE ABENAQUIS DRUILLETES ON THE KENNEBEC HIS EMBASSY TO BOSTON GIBBONS DUDLEY BRADFORD ELIOT ENDICOTT FRENCH AND PURITAN COLONIZATION FAILURE OF DRUILLETES S EMBASSY NEW REGULATIONS NEW YEAR S DAY AT QUEBEC Before passing to the closing scenes of this wilderness drama we will touch briefly on a few points aside from its main action yet essential to an understanding of the scope of the mission Besides their establishments at Quebec Sillery Three Rivers and the neighborhood of Lake Huron the Jesuits had an outlying post at the island of Miscou on the Gulf of saint Lawrence near the entrance of the Bay of Chaleurs where they instructed the wandering savages of those shores and confessed the French fishermen The island was unhealthy in the extreme Several of the priests sickened and died and scarcely one convert repaid their toils There was a more successful mission at Tadoussac or Sadilege as the neighboring Indians called it In winter this place was a solitude but in summer when the Montagnais gathered from their hunting grounds to meet the French traders Jesuits came yearly from Quebec to instruct them in the Faith Some times they followed them northward into wilds where at this day a white man rarely penetrates Thus in sixteen forty six De Quen ascended the Saguenay and by a series of rivers torrents lakes and rapids reached a Montagnais horde called the Nation of the Porcupine where he found that the teachings at Tadoussac had borne fruit and that the converts had planted a cross on the borders of the savage lake where they dwelt There was a kindred band the Nation of the White Fish among the rocks and forests north of Three Rivers They proved tractable beyond all others threw away their medicines or fetiches burned their magic drums renounced their medicine songs and accepted instead rosaries crucifixes and versions of Catholic hymns In a former chapter we followed Father Paul Le Jeune on his winter roamings with a band of Montagnais among the forests on the northern boundary of Maine Now Father Gabriel Druilletes sets forth on a similar excursion but with one essential difference Le Jeune s companions were heathen who persecuted him day and night with their gibes and sarcasms Those of Druilletes were all converts who looked on him as a friend and a father There were prayers confessions masses and invocations of saint Joseph They built their bark chapel at every camp and no festival of the Church passed unobserved On Good Friday they laid their best robe of beaver skin on the snow placed on it a crucifix and knelt around it in prayer What was their prayer It was a petition for the forgiveness and the conversion of their enemies the Iroquois Vimont Relation sixteen forty five sixteen Those who know the intensity and tenacity of an Indian s hatred will see in this something more than a change from one superstition to another An idea had been presented to the mind of the savage to which he had previously been an utter stranger This is the most remarkable record of success in the whole body of the Jesuit Relations but it is very far from being the only evidence that in teaching the dogmas and observances of the Roman Church the missionaries taught also the morals of Christianity When we look for the results of these missions we soon become aware that the influence of the French and the Jesuits extended far beyond the circle of converts It eventually modified and softened the manners of many unconverted tribes In the wars of the next century we do not often find those examples of diabolic atrocity with which the earlier annals are crowded The savage burned his enemies alive it is true but he rarely ate them neither did he torment them with the same deliberation and persistency He was a savage still but not so often a devil The improvement was not great but it was distinct and it seems to have taken place wherever Indian tribes were in close relations with any respectable community of white men Thus Philip s war in New England cruel as it was was less ferocious judging from Canadian experience than it would have been if a generation of civilized intercourse had not worn down the sharpest asperities of barbarism Yet it was to French priests and colonists mingled as they were soon to be among the tribes of the vast interior that the change is chiefly to be ascribed In this softening of manners such as it was and in the obedient Catholicity of a few hundred tamed savages gathered at stationary missions in various parts of Canada we find after a century had elapsed all the results of the heroic toil of the Jesuits The missions had failed because the Indians had ceased to exist Of the great tribes on whom rested the hopes of the early Canadian Fathers nearly all were virtually extinct The missionaries built laboriously and well but they were doomed to build on a failing foundation The Indians melted away not because civilization destroyed them but because their own ferocity and intractable indolence made it impossible that they should exist in its presence Either the plastic energies of a higher race or the servile pliancy of a lower one would each in its way have preserved them as it was their extinction was a foregone conclusion As for the religion which the Jesuits taught them however Protestants may carp at it it was the only form of Christianity likely to take root in their crude and barbarous nature To return to Druilletes The smoke of the wigwam blinded him and it is no matter of surprise to hear that he was cured by a miracle He returned from his winter roving to Quebec in high health and soon set forth on a new mission On the River Kennebec in the present State of Maine dwelt the Abenaquis an Algonquin people destined hereafter to become a thorn in the sides of the New England colonists Some of them had visited their friends the Christian Indians of Sillery Here they became converted went home and preached the Faith to their countrymen and this to such purpose that the Abenaquis sent to Quebec to ask for a missionary Apart from the saving of souls there were solid reasons for acceding to their request The Abenaquis were near the colonies of New England indeed the Plymouth colony under its charter claimed jurisdiction over them and in case of rupture they would prove serviceable friends or dangerous enemies to New France Charlevoix I two hundred eighty gives this as a motive of the mission Their messengers were favorably received and Druilletes was ordered to proceed upon the new mission He left Sillery with a party of Indians on the twenty ninth of August sixteen forty six Lalemant Relation sixteen forty seven fifty one and following as it seems the route by which a hundred and twenty nine years later the soldiers of Arnold made their way to Quebec he reached the waters of the Kennebec and descended to the Abenaqui villages Here he nursed the sick baptized the dying and gave such instruction as in his ignorance of the language he was able Apparently he had been ordered to reconnoitre for he presently descended the river from Norridgewock to the first English trading post where Augusta now stands Thence he continued his journey to the sea and followed the coast in a canoe to the Penobscot visiting seven or eight English posts on the way where to his surprise he was very well received At the Penobscot he found several Capuchin friars under their Superior Father Ignace who welcomed him with the utmost cordiality Returning he again ascended the Kennebec to the English post at Augusta At a spot three miles above the Indians had gathered in considerable numbers and here they built him a chapel after their fashion He remained till midwinter catechizing and baptizing and waging war so successfully against the Indian sorcerers that medicine bags were thrown away and charms and incantations were supplanted by prayers In January the whole troop set off on their grand hunt Druilletes following them with toil says the chronicler too great to buy the kingdoms of this world but very small as a price for the Kingdom of Heaven Lalemant Relation sixteen forty seven fifty four For an account of this mission see also Maurault Histoire des Abenakis one hundred sixteen one hundred fifty six They encamped on Moosehead Lake where new disputes with the medicine men ensued and the Father again remained master of the field When after a prosperous hunt the party returned to the English trading house John Winslow the agent in charge again received the missionary with a kindness which showed no trace of jealousy or religious prejudice Winslow would scarcely have recognized his own name in the Jesuit spelling Le Sieur de Houinslaud In his journal of sixteen fifty Druilletes is more successful in his orthography and spells it Winslau Early in the summer Druilletes went to Quebec and during the two following years the Abenaquis for reasons which are not clear were left without a missionary He spent another winter of extreme hardship with the Algonquins on their winter rovings and during summer instructed the wandering savages of Tadoussac It was not until the autumn of sixteen fifty that he again descended the Kennebec This time he went as an envoy charged with the negotiation of a treaty His journey is worthy of notice since with the unimportant exception of Jogues s embassy to the Mohawks it is the first occasion on which the Canadian Jesuits appear in a character distinctly political Afterwards when the fervor and freshness of the missions had passed away they frequently did the work of political agents among the Indians but the Jesuit of the earlier period was with rare exceptions a missionary only and though he was expected to exert a powerful influence in gaining subjects and allies for France he was to do so by gathering them under the wings of the Church The Colony of Massachusetts had applied to the French officials at Quebec with a view to a reciprocity of trade The Iroquois had brought Canada to extremity and the French Governor conceived the hope of gaining the powerful support of New England by granting the desired privileges on condition of military aid But as the Puritans would scarcely see it for their interest to provoke a dangerous enemy who had thus far never molested them it was resolved to urge the proposed alliance as a point of duty The Abenaquis had suffered from Mohawk inroads and the French assuming for the occasion that they were under the jurisdiction of the English colonies argued that they were bound to protect them Druilletes went in a double character as an envoy of the government at Quebec and as an agent of his Abenaqui flock who had been advised to petition for English assistance The time seemed inauspicious for a Jesuit visit to Boston for not only had it been announced as foremost among the objects in colonizing New England to raise a bulwark against the kingdom of Antichrist which the Jesuits labor to rear up in all places of the world one but three years before the Legislature of Massachusetts had enacted that Jesuits entering the colony should be expelled and if they returned hanged two one Considerations for the Plantation in New England See Hutchinson Collection twenty seven mister Savage thinks that this paper was by Winthrop See Savage s Winthrop I three hundred sixty note two See the Act in Hazard five hundred fifty Nevertheless on the first of September Druilletes set forth from Quebec with a Christian chief of Sillery crossed forests mountains and torrents and reached Norridgewock the highest Abenaqui settlement on the Kennebec Thence he descended to the English trading house at Augusta where his fast friend the Puritan Winslow gave him a warm welcome entertained him hospitably and promised to forward the object of his mission He went with him at great personal inconvenience to Merrymeeting Bay where Druilletes embarked in an English vessel for Boston The passage was stormy and the wind ahead He was forced to land at Cape Ann or as he calls it Kepane whence partly on foot partly in boats along the shore he made his way to Boston The three hilled city of the Puritans lay chill and dreary under a December sky as the priest crossed in a boat from the neighboring peninsula of Charlestown Winslow was agent for the merchant Edward Gibbons a personage of note whose life presents curious phases a reveller of Merry Mount a bold sailor a member of the church an adventurous trader an associate of buccaneers a magistrate of the commonwealth and a major general one The Jesuit with credentials from the Governor of Canada and letters from Winslow met a reception widely different from that which the law enjoined against persons of his profession two Gibbons welcomed him heartily prayed him to accept no other lodging than his house while he remained in Boston and gave him the key of a chamber in order that he might pray after his own fashion without fear of disturbance An accurate Catholic writer thinks it likely that he brought with him the means of celebrating the Mass J G Shea in Boston Pilot If so the house of the Puritan was no doubt desecrated by that Popish abomination but be this as it may Massachusetts in the person of her magistrate became the gracious host of one of those whom next to the Devil and an Anglican bishop she most abhorred one An account of him will be found in Palfrey Hist of New England II two hundred twenty five note two In the Act an exception however was made in favor of Jesuits coming as ambassadors or envoys from their government who were declared not liable to the penalty of hanging On the next day Gibbons took his guest to Roxbury called Rogsbray by Druilletes to see the Governor the harsh and narrow Dudley grown gray in repellent virtue and grim honesty Some half a century before he had served in France under Henry the Fourth but he had forgotten his French and called for an interpreter to explain the visitor s credentials He received Druilletes with courtesy and promised to call the magistrates together on the following Tuesday to hear his proposals They met accordingly and Druilletes was asked to dine with them The old Governor sat at the head of the table and after dinner invited the guest to open the business of his embassy They listened to him desired him to withdraw and after consulting among themselves sent for him to join them again at supper when they made him an answer of which the record is lost but which evidently was not definitive As the Abenaqui Indians were within the jurisdiction of Plymouth one Druilletes proceeded thither in his character of their agent Here again he was received with courtesy and kindness Governor Bradford invited him to dine and as it was Friday considerately gave him a dinner of fish Druilletes conceived great hope that the colony could be wrought upon to give the desired assistance for some of the chief inhabitants had an interest in the trade with the Abenaquis two He came back by land to Boston stopping again at Roxbury on the way It was night when he arrived and after the usual custom he took lodging with the minister Here were several young Indians pupils of his host for he was no other than the celebrated Eliot who during the past summer had established his mission at Natick three and was now laboring in the fulness of his zeal in the work of civilization and conversion There was great sympathy between the two missionaries and Eliot prayed his guest to spend the winter with him one For the documents on the title of Plymouth to lands on the Kennebec see Drake s additions to Baylies s History of New Plymouth thirty six where they are illustrated by an ancient map The patent was obtained as early as sixteen twenty eight and a trading house soon after established two The Record of the Colony of Plymouth June five sixteen fifty one contains however the entry The Court declare themselves not to be willing to aid them the French in their design or to grant them liberty to go through their jurisdiction for the aforesaid purpose to attack the Mohawks three See Palfrey New England II three hundred thirty six At Salem which Druilletes also visited in company with the minister of Marblehead he had an interview with the stern but manly Endicott who he says spoke French and expressed both interest and good will towards the objects of the expedition As the envoy had no money left Endicott paid his charges and asked him to dine with the magistrates On Druilletes s visit to New England see his journal entitled Narre du Voyage faict pour la Mission des Abenaquois et des Connoissances tirez de la Nouvelle Angleterre et des Dispositions des Magistrats de cette Republique pour le Secours contre les Iroquois See also Druilletes Rapport sur le Resultat deses Negotiations in Ferland Notes sur les Registres ninety five Druilletes was evidently struck with the thrift and vigor of these sturdy young colonies and the strength of their population He says that Boston meaning Massachusetts could alone furnish four thousand fighting men and that the four united colonies could count forty thousand souls one These numbers may be challenged but at all events the contrast was striking with the attenuated and suffering bands of priests nuns and fur traders on the saint Lawrence About twenty one thousand persons had come from Old to New England with the resolve of making it their home and though this immigration had virtually ceased the natural increase had been great The necessity or the strong desire of escaping from persecution had given the impulse to Puritan colonization while on the other hand none but good Catholics the favored class of France were tolerated in Canada These had no motive for exchanging the comforts of home and the smiles of Fortune for a starving wilderness and the scalping knives of the Iroquois The Huguenots would have emigrated in swarms but they were rigidly forbidden The zeal of propagandism and the fur trade were as we have seen the vital forces of New France Of her feeble population the best part was bound to perpetual chastity while the fur traders and those in their service rarely brought their wives to the wilderness The fur trader moreover is always the worst of colonists since the increase of population by diminishing the numbers of the fur bearing animals is adverse to his interest But behind all this there was in the religious ideal of the rival colonies an influence which alone would have gone far to produce the contrast in material growth one Druilletes Reflexions touchant ce qu on peut esperer de la Nouvelle Angleterre contre l Irocquois sic appended to his journal To the mind of the Puritan heaven was God s throne but no less was the earth His footstool and each in its degree and its kind had its demands on man He held it a duty to labor and to multiply and building on the Old Testament quite as much as on the New thought that a reward on earth as well as in heaven awaited those who were faithful to the law Doubtless such a belief is widely open to abuse and it would be folly to pretend that it escaped abuse in New England but there was in it an element manly healthful and invigorating On the other hand those who shaped the character and in great measure the destiny of New France had always on their lips the nothingness and the vanity of life For them time was nothing but a preparation for eternity and the highest virtue consisted in a renunciation of all the cares toils and interests of earth That such a doctrine has often been joined to an intense worldliness all history proclaims but with this we have at present nothing to do If all mankind acted on it in good faith the world would sink into decrepitude It is the monastic idea carried into the wide field of active life and is like the error of those who in their zeal to cultivate their higher nature suffer the neglected body to dwindle and pine till body and mind alike lapse into feebleness and disease Druilletes returned to the Abenaquis and thence to Quebec full of hope that the object of his mission was in a fair way of accomplishment The Governor d Ailleboust one who had succeeded Montmagny called his council and Druilletes was again dispatched to New England together with one of the principal inhabitants of Quebec Jean Paul Godefroy two They repaired to New Haven and appeared before the Commissioners of the Four Colonies then in session there but their errand proved bootless The Commissioners refused either to declare war or to permit volunteers to be raised in New England against the Iroquois The Puritan like his descendant would not fight without a reason The bait of free trade with Canada failed to tempt him and the envoys retraced their steps with a flat though courteous refusal three one The same who with his wife had joined the colonists of Montreal See ante chapter eighteen page two hundred sixty four two He

at Quebec and observe some notable changes that had taken place in the affairs of the colony The Company of the Hundred Associates whose outlay had been great and their profit small transferred to the inhabitants of the colony their monopoly of the fur trade and with it their debts The inhabitants also assumed their obligations to furnish arms munitions soldiers and works of defence to pay the Governor and other officials introduce emigrants and contribute to support the missions The Company was to receive besides an annual acknowledgement of a thousand pounds of beaver and was to retain all seigniorial rights The inhabitants were to form a corporation of which any one of them might be a member and no individual could trade on his own account except on condition of selling at a fixed price to the magazine of this new company Articles accordes entre les Directeurs et Associes de la Compagnie de la Nelle France et les Deputes des Habitans du dit Pays six Mars sixteen forty five MS This change took place in sixteen forty five It was followed in sixteen forty seven by the establishment of a Council composed of the Governor General the Superior of the Jesuits and the Governor of Montreal who were invested with absolute powers legislative judicial and executive The Governor General had an appointment of twenty five thousand livres besides the privilege of bringing over seventy tons of freight yearly in the Company s ships Out of this he was required to pay the soldiers repair the forts and supply arms and munitions Ten thousand livres and thirty tons of freight with similar conditions were assigned to the Governor of Montreal Under these circumstances one cannot wonder that the colony was but indifferently defended against the Iroquois and that the King had to send soldiers to save it from destruction In the next year at the instance of Maisonneuve another change was made A specified sum was set apart for purposes of defence and the salaries of the Governors were proportionably reduced The Governor General Montmagny though he seems to have done better than could reasonably have been expected was removed and as Maisonneuve declined the office d Ailleboust another Montrealist was appointed to it This movement indeed had been accomplished by the interest of the Montreal party for already there was no slight jealousy between Quebec and her rival The Council was reorganized and now consisted of the Governor the Superior of the Jesuits and three of the principal inhabitants The Governors of Montreal and Three Rivers when present had also seats in the Council These last were to be chosen every three years by the Council itself in conjunction with the Syndics of Quebec Montreal and Three Rivers The Syndic was an officer elected by the inhabitants of the community to which he belonged to manage its affairs Hence a slight ingredient of liberty was introduced into the new organization The colony since the transfer of the fur trade had become a resident corporation of merchants with the Governor and Council at its head They were at once the directors of a trading company a legislative assembly a court of justice and an executive body more even than this for they regulated the private affairs of families and individuals The appointment and payment of clerks and the examining of accounts mingled with high functions of government and the new corporation of the inhabitants seems to have been managed with very little consultation of its members How the Father Superior acquitted himself in his capacity of director of a fur company is nowhere recorded Those curious in regard to these new regulations will find an account of them at greater length in Ferland and Faillon As for Montreal though it had given a Governor to the colony its prospects were far from hopeful The ridiculous Dauversiere its chief founder was sick and bankrupt and the Associates of Montreal once so full of zeal and so abounding in wealth were

DIPLOMACY THE ANDASTES THE HURON EMBASSY NEW NEGOTIATIONS THE IROQUOIS AMBASSADOR HIS SUICIDE IROQUOIS HONOR It was a strange and miserable spectacle to behold the savages of this continent at the time when the knell of their common ruin had already sounded Civilization had gained a foothold on their borders The long and gloomy reign of barbarism was drawing near its close and their united efforts could scarcely have availed to sustain it Yet in this crisis of their destiny these doomed tribes were tearing each other s throats in a wolfish fury joined to an intelligence that served little purpose but mutual destruction How the quarrel began between the Iroquois and their Huron kindred no man can tell and it is not worth while to conjecture At this time the ruling passion of the savage Confederates was the annihilation of this rival people and of their Algonquin allies if the understanding between the Hurons and these incoherent hordes can be called an alliance United they far outnumbered the Iroquois Indeed the Hurons alone were not much inferior in force for by the largest estimates the strength of the five Iroquois nations must now have been considerably less than three thousand warriors Their true superiority was a moral one They were in one of those transports of pride self confidence and rage for ascendency which in a savage people marks an era of conquest With all the defects of their organization it was far better than that of their neighbors There were bickerings jealousies plottings and counter plottings separate wars and separate treaties among the five members of the league yet nothing could sunder them The bonds that united them were like cords of India rubber they would stretch and the parts would be seemingly disjoined only to return to their old union with the recoil Such was the elastic strength of those relations of clanship which were the life of the league See ante Introduction The first meeting of white men with the Hurons found them at blows with the Iroquois and from that time forward the war raged with increasing fury Small scalping parties infested the Huron forests killing squaws in the cornfields or entering villages at midnight to tomahawk their sleeping inhabitants Often too invasions were made in force Sometimes towns were set upon and burned and sometimes there were deadly conflicts in the depths of the forests and the passes of the hills The invaders were not always successful A bloody rebuff and a sharp retaliation now and then requited them Thus in sixteen thirty eight a war party of a hundred Iroquois met in the forest a band of three hundred Huron and Algonquin warriors They might have retreated and the greater number were for doing so but Ononkwaya an Oneida chief refused Look he said the sky is clear the Sun beholds us If there were clouds to hide our shame from his sight we might fly but as it is we must fight while we can They stood their ground for a time but were soon overborne Four or five escaped but the rest were surrounded and killed or taken This year Fortune smiled on the Hurons and they took in all more than a hundred prisoners who were distributed among their various towns to be burned These scenes with them occurred always in the night and it was held to be of the last importance that the torture should be protracted from sunset till dawn The too valiant Ononkwaya was among the victims Even in death he took his revenge for it was thought an augury of disaster to the victors if no cry of pain could he extorted from the sufferer and on the present occasion he displayed an unflinching courage rare even among Indian warriors His execution took place at the town of Teanaustaye called saint Joseph by the Jesuits The Fathers could not save his life but what was more to the purpose they baptized him On the scaffold where he was burned he wrought himself into a fury which seemed to render him insensible to pain Thinking him nearly spent his tormentors scalped him when to their amazement he leaped up snatched the brands that had been the instruments of his torture drove the screeching crowd from the scaffold and held them all at bay while they pelted him from below with sticks stones and showers of live coals At length he made a false step and fell to the ground when they seized him and threw him into the fire He instantly leaped out covered with blood cinders and ashes and rushed upon them with a blazing brand in each hand The crowd gave way before him and he ran towards the town as if to set it on fire They threw a pole across his way which tripped him and flung him headlong to the earth on which they all fell upon him cut off his hands and feet and again threw him into the fire He rolled himself out and crawled forward on his elbows and knees glaring upon them with such unutterable ferocity that they recoiled once more till seeing that he was helpless they threw themselves upon him and cut off his head Lalemant Relation des Hurons sixteen thirty nine sixty eight It was this chief whose severed hand was thrown to the Jesuits See ante chapter eleven page one hundred thirty seven When the Iroquois could not win by force they were sometimes more successful with treachery In the summer of sixteen forty five two war parties of the hostile nations met in the forest The Hurons bore themselves so well that they had nearly gained the day when the Iroquois called for a parley displayed a great number of wampum belts and said that they wished to treat for peace The Hurons had the folly to consent The chiefs on both sides sat down to a council during which the Iroquois seizing a favorable moment fell upon their dupes and routed them completely killing and capturing a considerable number Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty six fifty five The large frontier town of saint Joseph was well fortified with palisades on which at intervals were wooden watch towers On an evening of this same summer of sixteen forty five the Iroquois approached the place in force and the young Huron warriors mounting their palisades sang their war songs all night with the utmost power of their lungs in order that the enemy knowing them to be on their guard might be deterred from an attack The night was dark and the hideous dissonance resounded far and wide yet regardless of the din two Iroquois crept close to the palisade where they lay motionless till near dawn By this time the last song had died away and the tired singers had left their posts or fallen asleep One of the Iroquois with the silence and agility of a wild cat climbed to the top of a watch tower where he found two slumbering Hurons brained one of them with his hatchet and threw the other down to his comrade who quickly despoiled him of his life and his scalp Then with the reeking trophies of their exploit the adventurers rejoined their countrymen in the forest The Hurons planned a counter stroke and three of them after a journey of twenty days reached the great town of the Senecas They entered it at midnight and found as usual no guard but the doors of the houses were made fast They cut a hole in the bark side of one of them crept in stirred the fading embers to give them light chose each his man tomahawked him scalped him and escaped in the confusion Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty six fifty five fifty six Despite such petty triumphs the Hurons felt themselves on the verge of ruin Pestilence and war had wasted them away and left but a skeleton of their former strength In their distress they cast about them for succor and remembering an ancient friendship with a kindred nation the Andastes they sent an embassy to ask of them aid in war or intervention to obtain peace This powerful people dwelt as has been shown on the River Susquehanna one The way was long even in a direct line but the Iroquois lay between and a wide circuit was necessary to avoid them A Christian chief whom the Jesuits had named Charles together with four Christian and four heathen Hurons bearing wampum belts and gifts from the council departed on this embassy on the thirteenth of April sixteen forty seven and reached the great town of the Andastes early in June It contained as the Jesuits were told no less than thirteen hundred warriors The council assembled and the chief ambassador addressed them We come from the Land of Souls where all is gloom dismay and desolation Our fields are covered with blood our houses are filled only with the dead and we ourselves have but life enough to beg our friends to take pity on a people who are drawing near their end two Then he presented the wampum belts and other gifts saying that they were the voice of a dying country one See Introduction The Susquehannocks of Smith clearly the same people are placed in his map on the east side of the Susquehanna some twenty miles from its mouth He speaks of them as great enemies of the Massawomekes Mohawks No other savage people so boldly resisted the Iroquois but the story in Hazard s Annals of Pennsylvania that a hundred of them beat off sixteen hundred Senecas is disproved by the fact that the Senecas in their best estate never had so many warriors The miserable remnant of the Andastes called Conestogas were massacred by the Paxton Boys in seventeen sixty three See Conspiracy of Pontiac four hundred fourteen Compare Historical Magazine II two hundred ninety four two Il leur dit qu il venoit du pays des Ames ou la guerre et la terreur des ennemis auoit tout desole ou les campagnes n estoient couuertes que de sang ou les cabanes n estoient remplies que de cadaures et qu il ne leur restoit a eux mesmes de vie sinon autant qu ils en auoient eu besoin pour venir dire a leurs amis qu ils eussent pitie d vn pays qui tiroit a sa fin Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty eight fifty eight The Andastes who had a mortal quarrel with the Mohawks and who had before promised to aid the Hurons in case of need returned a favorable answer but were disposed to try the virtue of diplomacy rather than the tomahawk After a series of councils they determined to send ambassadors not to their old enemies the Mohawks but to the Onondagas Oneidas and Cayugas one who were geographically the central nations of the Iroquois league while the Mohawks and the Senecas were respectively at its eastern and western extremities By inducing the three central nations and if possible the Senecas also to conclude a treaty with the Hurons these last would be enabled to concentrate their force against the Mohawks whom the Andastes would attack at the same time unless they humbled themselves and made peace This scheme it will be seen was based on the assumption that the dreaded league of the Iroquois was far from being a unit in action or counsel one Examination leaves no doubt that the Ouiouenronnons of Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty eight forty six fifty nine were the Oiogouins or Goyogouins that is to say the Cayugas They must not be confounded with the Ouenrohronnons a small tribe hostile to the Iroquois who took refuge among the Hurons in sixteen thirty eight Charles with some of his colleagues now set out for home to report the result of their mission but the Senecas were lying in wait for them and they were forced to make a wide sweep through the Alleghanies Western Pennsylvania and apparently Ohio to avoid these vigilant foes It was October before they reached the Huron towns and meanwhile hopes of peace had arisen from another quarter On this mission of the Hurons to the Andastes see Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty eight fifty eight sixty Early in the spring a band of Onondagas had made an inroad but were roughly handled by the Hurons who killed several of them captured others and put the rest to flight The prisoners were burned with the exception of one who committed suicide to escape the torture and one other the chief man of the party whose name was Annenrais Some of the Hurons were dissatisfied at the mercy shown him and gave out that they would kill him on which the chiefs who never placed themselves in open opposition to the popular will secretly fitted him out made him presents and aided him to escape at night with an understanding that he should use his influence at Onondaga in favor of peace After crossing Lake Ontario he met nearly all the Onondaga warriors on the march to avenge his supposed death for he was a man of high account They greeted him as one risen from the grave and on his part he persuaded them to renounce their warlike purpose and return home On their arrival the chiefs and old men were called to council and the matter was debated with the usual deliberation About this time the ambassador of the Andastes appeared with his wampum belts Both this nation and the Onondagas had secret motives which were perfectly in accordance The Andastes hated the Mohawks as enemies and the Onondagas were jealous of them as confederates for since they had armed themselves with Dutch guns their arrogance and boastings had given umbrage to their brethren of the league and a peace with the Hurons would leave the latter free to turn their undivided strength against the Mohawks and curb their insolence The Oneidas and the Cayugas were of one mind with the Onondagas Three nations of the league to satisfy their spite against a fourth would strike hands with the common enemy of all It was resolved to send an embassy to the Hurons Yet it may be that after all the Onondagas had but half a mind for peace At least they were unfortunate in their choice of an ambassador He was by birth a Huron who having been captured when a boy adopted and naturalized had become more an Iroquois than the Iroquois themselves and scarcely one of the fierce confederates had shed so much Huron blood When he reached the town of saint Ignace which he did about midsummer and delivered his messages and wampum belts there was a great division of opinion among the Hurons The Bear Nation the member of their confederacy which was farthest from the Iroquois and least exposed to danger was for rejecting overtures made by so offensive an agency but those of the Hurons who had suffered most were eager for peace at any price and after solemn deliberation it was resolved to send an embassy in return At its head was placed a Christian chief named Jean Baptiste Atironta and on the first of August he and four others departed for Onondaga carrying a profusion of presents and accompanied by the apostate envoy of the Iroquois As the ambassadors had to hunt on the way for subsistence besides making canoes to cross Lake Ontario it was twenty days before they reached their destination When they arrived there was great jubilation and for a full month nothing but councils Having thus sifted the matter to the bottom the Onondagas determined at last to send another embassy with Jean Baptiste on his return and with them fifteen Huron prisoners as an earnest of their good intentions retaining on their part one of Baptiste s colleagues as a hostage This time they chose for their envoy a chief of their own nation named Scandawati a man of renown sixty years of age joining with him two colleagues The old Onondaga entered on his mission with a troubled mind His anxiety was not so much for his life as for his honor and dignity for while the Oneidas and the Cayugas were acting in concurrence with the Onondagas the Senecas had refused any part in the embassy and still breathed nothing but war Would they or still more the Mohawks so far forget the consideration due to one whose name had been great in the councils of the League as to assault the Hurons while he was among them in the character of an ambassador of his nation whereby his honor would be compromised and his life endangered His mind brooded on this idea and he told one of his colleagues that if such a slight were put upon him he should die of mortification I am not a dead dog he said to be despised and forgotten I am worthy that all men should turn their eyes on me while I am among enemies and do nothing that may involve me in danger What with hunting fishing canoe making and bad weather the progress of the august travellers was so slow that they did not reach the Huron towns till the twenty third of October Scandawati presented seven large belts of wampum each composed of three or four thousand beads which the Jesuits call the pearls and diamonds of the country He delivered too the fifteen captives and promised a hundred more on the final conclusion of peace The three Onondagas remained as surety for the good faith of those who sent them until the beginning of January when the Hurons on their part sent six ambassadors to conclude the treaty one of the Onondagas accompanying them Soon there came dire tidings The prophetic heart of the old chief had not deceived him The Senecas and Mohawks disregarding negotiations in which they had no part and resolved to bring them to an end were invading the country in force It might be thought that the Hurons would take their revenge on the Onondaga envoys now hostages among them but they did not do so for the character of an ambassador was for the most part held in respect One morning however Scandawati had disappeared They were full of excitement for they thought that he had escaped to the enemy They ranged the woods in search of him and at length found him in a thicket near the town He lay dead on a bed of spruce boughs which he had made his throat deeply gashed with a knife He had died by his own hand a victim of mortified pride See writes Father Ragueneau how much our Indians stand on the point of honor This remarkable story is told by Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty eight fifty six fifty eight He was present at the time and knew all the circumstances We have seen that one of his two colleagues had set out for Onondaga with a deputation of six Hurons This party was met by a hundred Mohawks who captured them all and killed the six Hurons but spared the Onondaga and compelled him to join them Soon after they made a sudden onset on about three hundred Hurons journeying through the forest from the town of saint Ignace and as many of them were women they routed the whole and took forty prisoners The Onondaga bore part in the fray and captured a Christian Huron girl but the next day he insisted on returning to the Huron town Kill me if you will he said to the Mohawks but I cannot follow you for then I should be ashamed to appear among my countrymen who sent me on a message of peace to the Hurons and I must die with them sooner than seem to act as their enemy On this the Mohawks not only permitted him to go but gave him the Huron girl whom he had taken and the Onondaga led her back in safety to her countrymen one Here then is a ray of light out of Egyptian darkness The principle of honor was not extinct in these wild hearts one Celuy qui l auoit prise estoit Onnontaeronnon qui estant icy en os tage a cause de la paix qui se traite auec les Onnontaeronnons et s estant trouue auec nos Hurons a cette chasse y fut pris tout des premiers par les Sonnontoueronnons Annieronnons qui l ayans reconnu ne luy firent aucun mal et mesme l obligerent de les suiure et

Sonnontoueronnons Senecas in the above should read Annieronnons Mohawks for on pp fifty fifty seven the writer twice speaks of the party as Mohawks We hear no more of the negotiations between the Onondagas and the Hurons They and their results were swept away in the storm of events soon to be related CHAPTER XXIV sixteen forty five sixteen forty eight THE HURON CHURCH HOPES OF THE MISSION CHRISTIAN AND HEATHEN BODY AND SOUL POSITION OF PROSELYTES THE HURON GIRL S VISIT TO HEAVEN A CRISIS HURON JUSTICE MURDER AND ATONEMENT HOPES AND FEARS How did it fare with the missions in these days of woe and terror They had thriven beyond hope The Hurons in their time of trouble had become tractable They humbled themselves and in their desolation and despair came for succor to the priests There was a harvest of converts not only exceeding in numbers that of all former years but giving in many cases undeniable proofs of sincerity and fervor In some towns the Christians outnumbered the heathen and in nearly all they formed a strong party The mission of La Conception or Ossossane was the most successful Here there were now a church and one or more resident Jesuits as also at saint Joseph saint Ignace saint Michel and saint Jean Baptiste one for we have seen that the Huron towns were christened with names of saints Each church had its bell which was sometimes hung in a neighboring tree two Every morning it rang its summons to mass and issuing from their dwellings of bark the converts gathered within the sacred precinct where the bare rude walls fresh from the axe and saw contrasted with the sheen of tinsel and gilding and the hues of gay draperies and gaudy pictures At evening they met again at prayers and on Sunday masses confession catechism sermons and repeating the rosary consumed the whole day three one Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty six fifty six two A fragment of one of these bells found on the site of a Huron town is preserved in the museum of Huron relics at the Laval University Quebec The bell was not large but was of very elaborate workmanship Before sixteen forty four the Jesuits had used old copper kettles as a substitute Lettre de Lalemant thirty one March sixteen forty four three Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty six fifty six These converts rarely took part in the burning of prisoners On the contrary they sometimes set their faces against the practice and on one occasion a certain Etienne Totiri while his heathen countrymen were tormenting a captive Iroquois at saint Ignace boldly denounced them and promised them an eternity of flames and demons unless they desisted Not content with this he addressed an exhortation to the sufferer in one of the intervals of his torture The dying wretch demanded baptism which Etienne took it upon himself to administer amid the hootings of the crowd who as he ran with a cup of water from a neighboring house pushed him to and fro to make him spill it crying out Let him alone Let the devils burn him after we have done Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty six fifty eight The Hurons often resisted the baptism of their prisoners on the ground that Hell and not Heaven was the place to which they would have them go See Lalemant Relation des Hurons sixteen forty two sixty Ragueneau Ibid sixteen forty eight fifty three and several other passages In regard to these atrocious scenes which formed the favorite Huron recreation of a summer night the Jesuits it must be confessed did not quite come up to the requirements of modern sensibility They were offended at them it is true and prevented them when they could but they were wholly given to the saving of souls and held the body in scorn as the vile source of incalculable mischief worthy the worst inflictions that could be put upon it What were a few hours of suffering to an eternity of bliss or woe If the victim were heathen these brief pangs were but the faint prelude of an undying flame and if a Christian they were the fiery portal of Heaven They might indeed be a blessing since accepted in atonement for sin they would shorten the torments of Purgatory Yet while schooling themselves to despise the body and all the pain or pleasure that pertained to it the Fathers were emphatic on one point It must not be eaten In the matter of cannibalism they were loud and vehement in invective The following curious case of conversion at the stake gravely related by Lalemant is worth preserving An Iroquois was to be burned at a town some way off What consolation to set forth in the hottest summer weather to deliver this poor victim from the hell prepared for him The Father approaches him and instructs him even in the midst of his torments Forthwith the Faith finds a place in his heart he recognizes and adores as the author of his life Him whose name he had never heard till the hour of his death He receives the grace of baptism and breathes nothing but heaven This newly made but generous Christian mounted on the scaffold which is the place of his torture in the sight of a thousand spectators who are at once his enemies his judges and his executioners raises his eyes and his voice heavenward and cries aloud Sun who art witness of my torments hear my words I am about to die but after my death I shall go to dwell in heaven Relation des Hurons sixteen forty one sixty seven The Sun it will be remembered was the god of the heathen Iroquois The convert appealed to his old deity to rejoice with him in his happy future Undeniably the Faith was making progress yet it is not to be supposed that its path was a smooth one The old opposition and the old calumnies were still alive and active It is la priere that kills us Your books and your strings of beads have bewitched the country Before you came we were happy and prosperous You are magicians Your charms kill our corn and bring sickness and the Iroquois Echon Brebeuf is a traitor among us in league with our enemies Such discourse was still rife openly and secretly The Huron who embraced the Faith renounced thenceforth as we have seen the feasts dances and games in which was his delight since all these savored of diabolism And if being in health he could not enjoy himself so also being sick he could not be cured for his physician was a sorcerer whose medicines were charms and incantations If the convert was a chief his case was far worse since writes Father Lalemant to be a chief and a Christian is to combine water and fire for the business of the chiefs is mainly to do the Devil s bidding preside over ceremonies of hell and excite the young Indians to dances feasts and shameless indecencies Relation des Hurons sixteen forty two eighty nine The indecencies alluded to were chiefly naked dances of a superstitious character and the mystical cure called Andacwandet before mentioned It is not surprising then that proselytes were difficult to make or that being made they often relapsed The Jesuits complain that they had no means of controlling their converts and coercing backsliders to stand fast and they add that the Iroquois by destroying the fur trade had broken the principal bond between the Hurons and the French and greatly weakened the influence of the mission Lettre du P Hierosme Lalemant appended to the Relation of sixteen forty five Among the slanders devised by the heathen party against the teachers of the obnoxious doctrine was one which found wide credence even among the converts and produced a great effect They gave out that a baptized Huron girl who had lately died and was buried in the cemetery at Sainte Marie had returned to life and given a deplorable account of the heaven of the French No sooner had she entered such was the story than they seized her chained her to a stake and tormented her all day with inconceivable cruelty They did the same to all the other converted Hurons for this was the recreation of the French and especially of the Jesuits in their celestial abode They baptized Indians with no other object than that they might have them to torment in heaven to which end they were willing to meet hardships and dangers in this life just as a war party invades the enemy s country at great risk that it may bring home prisoners to burn After her painful experience an unknown friend secretly showed the girl a path down to the earth and she hastened thither to warn her countrymen against the wiles of the missionaries Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty six sixty five In the spring of sixteen forty eight the excitement of the heathen party reached a crisis A young Frenchman named Jacques Douart in the service of the mission going out at evening a short distance from the Jesuit house of Sainte Marie was tomahawked by unknown Indians one who proved to be two brothers instigated by the heathen chiefs A great commotion followed and for a few days it seemed that the adverse parties would fall to blows at a time when the common enemy threatened to destroy them both But sager counsels prevailed In view of the manifest strength of the Christians the pagans lowered their tone and it soon became apparent that it was the part of the Jesuits to insist boldly on satisfaction for the outrage They made no demand that the murderers should be punished or surrendered but with their usual good sense in such matters conformed to Indian usage and required that the nation at large should make atonement for the crime by presents two The number of these their value and the mode of delivering them were all fixed by ancient custom and some of the converts acting as counsel advised the Fathers of every step it behooved them to take in a case of such importance As this is the best illustration of Huron justice on record it may be well to observe the method of procedure recollecting that the public and not the criminal was to pay the forfeit of the crime one Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty eight seventy seven Compare Lettre du P Jean de Brebeuf au T R P Vincent Carafa General de la Compagnie de Jesus Sainte Marie two Juin sixteen forty eight in Carayon two See Introduction First of all the Huron chiefs summoned the Jesuits to meet them at a grand council of the nation when an old orator chosen by the rest rose and addressed Ragueneau as chief of the French in the following harangue Ragueneau who reports it declares that he has added nothing to it and the translation is as literal as possible My Brother began the speaker behold all the tribes of our league assembled and he named them one by one We are but a handful you are the prop and stay of this nation A thunderbolt has fallen from the sky and rent a chasm in the earth We shall fall into it if you do not support us Take pity on us We are here not so much to speak as to weep over our loss and yours Our country is but a skeleton without flesh veins sinews or arteries and its bones hang together by a thread This thread is broken by the blow that has fallen on the head of your nephew one for whom we weep It was a demon of Hell who placed the hatchet in the murderer s hand Was it you Sun whose beams shine on us who led him to do this deed Why did you not darken your light that he might be stricken with horror at his crime Were you his accomplice No for he walked in darkness and did not see where he struck He thought this wretched murderer that he aimed at the head of a young Frenchman but the blow fell upon his country and gave it a death wound The earth opens to receive the blood of the innocent victim and we shall be swallowed up in the chasm for we are all guilty The Iroquois rejoice at his death and celebrate it as a triumph for they see that our weapons are turned against each other and know well that our nation is near its end Brother take pity on this nation You alone can restore it to life It is for you to gather up all these scattered bones and close this chasm that opens to ingulf us Take pity on your country I call it yours for you are the master of it and we came here like criminals to receive your sentence if you will not show us mercy Pity those who condemn themselves and come to ask forgiveness It is you who have given strength to the nation by dwelling with it and if you leave us we shall be like a wisp of straw torn from the ground to be the sport of the wind This country is an island drifting on the waves for the first storm to overwhelm and sink Make it fast again to its foundation and posterity will never forget to praise you When we first heard of this murder we could do nothing but weep and we are ready to receive your orders and comply with your demands Speak then and ask what satisfaction you will for our lives and our possessions are yours and even if we rob our children to satisfy you we will tell them that it is not of you that they have to complain but of him whose crime has made us all guilty Our anger is against him but for you we feel nothing but love He destroyed our lives and you will restore them if you will but speak and tell us what you will have us do one The usual Indian figure in such cases and not meant to express an actual relationship Uncle for a superior Brother for an equal Nephew for an inferior Ragueneau who remarks that this harangue is a proof that eloquence is the gift of Nature rather than of Art made a reply which he has not recorded and then gave the speaker a bundle of small sticks indicating the number of presents which he required in satisfaction for the murder These sticks were distributed among the various tribes in the council in order that each might contribute its share towards the indemnity The council dissolved and the chiefs went home each with his allotment of sticks to collect in his village a corresponding number of presents There was no constraint those gave who chose to do so but as all were ambitious to show their public spirit the contributions were ample No one thought of molesting the murderers Their punishment was their shame at the sacrifices which the public were making in their behalf The presents being ready a day was set for the ceremony of their delivery and crowds gathered from all parts to witness it The assembly was convened in the open air in a field beside the mission house of Sainte Marie and in the midst the chiefs held solemn council Towards evening they deputed four of their number two Christians and two heathen to carry their address to the Father Superior They came loaded with presents but these were merely preliminary One was to open the door another for leave to enter and as Sainte Marie was a large house with several interior doors at each one of which it behooved them to repeat this formality their stock of gifts became seriously reduced before they reached the room where Father Ragueneau awaited them On arriving they made him a speech every clause of which was confirmed by a present The first was to wipe away his tears the second to restore his voice which his grief was supposed to have impaired the third to calm the agitation of his mind and the fourth to allay the just anger of his heart one These gifts consisted of wampum and the large shells of which it was made together with other articles worthless in any eyes but those of an Indian Nine additional presents followed four for the four posts of the sepulchre or scaffold of the murdered man four for the cross pieces which connected the posts and one for a pillow to support his head Then came eight more corresponding to the eight largest bones of the victim s body and also to the eight clans of the Hurons two Ragueneau as required by established custom now made them a present in his turn It consisted of three thousand beads of wampum and was designed to soften the earth in order that they might not be hurt when falling upon it overpowered by his reproaches for the enormity of their crime This closed the interview and the deputation withdrew one Ragueneau himself describes the scene Relation des Hurons sixteen forty eight eighty two Ragueneau says les huit nations but as the Hurons consisted of only four or at most five nations he probably means the clans For the nature of these divisions see Introduction The grand ceremony took place on the next day A kind of arena had been prepared and here were hung the fifty presents in which the atonement essentially consisted the rest amounting to as many more being only accessory one The Jesuits had the right of examining them all rejecting any that did not satisfy them and demanding others in place of them The naked crowd sat silent and attentive while the orator in the midst delivered the fifty presents in a series of harangues which the tired listener has not thought it necessary to preserve Then came the minor gifts each with its signification explained in turn by the speaker First as a sepulchre had been provided the day before for the dead man it was now necessary to clothe and equip him for his journey to the next world and to this end three presents were made They represented a hat a coat a shirt breeches stockings shoes a gun powder and bullets but they were in fact something quite different as wampum beaver skins and the like Next came several gifts to close up the wounds of the slain Then followed three more The first closed the chasm in the earth which had burst through horror of the crime The next trod the ground firm that it might not open again and here the whole assembly rose and danced as custom required The last placed a large stone over the closed gulf to make it doubly secure one The number was unusually large partly because the affair was thought very important and partly because the murdered man belonged to another nation See Introduction Now came another series of presents seven in number to restore the voices of all the missionaries to invite the men in their service to forget the murder to appease the Governor when he should hear of it to light the fire at Sainte Marie to open the gate to launch the ferry boat in which the Huron visitors crossed the river and to give back the paddle to the boy who had charge of the boat The Fathers it seems had the right of exacting two more presents to rebuild their house and church supposed to have been shaken to the earth by the late calamity but they forbore to urge the claim Last of all were three gifts to confirm all the rest and to entreat the Jesuits to cherish an undying love for the Hurons The priests on their part gave presents as tokens of good will and with that the assembly dispersed The mission had gained a triumph and its influence was greatly strengthened The future would have been full of hope but for the portentous cloud of war that rose black and wrathful from where lay the dens of the Iroquois CHAPTER XXV sixteen forty eight sixteen forty nine SAINTE MARIE THE CENTRE OF THE MISSIONS FORT CONVENT HOSPITAL CARAVANSARY CHURCH

range of palisades and bastioned walls inclosing a number of buildings Your canoe enters a canal or ditch immediately above them and you land at the Mission or Residence or Fort of Sainte Marie Here was the centre and base of the Huron missions and now for once one must wish that Jesuit pens had been more fluent They have told us but little of Sainte Marie and even this is to be gathered chiefly from incidental allusions In the forest which long since has resumed its reign over this memorable spot the walls and ditches of the fortifications may still be plainly traced and the deductions from these remains are in perfect accord with what we can gather from the Relations and letters of the priests Before me is an elaborate plan of the remains taken on the spot The fortified work which inclosed the buildings was in the form of a parallelogram about a hundred and seventy five feet long and from eighty to ninety wide It lay parallel with the river and somewhat more than a hundred feet distant from it On two sides it was a continuous wall of masonry one flanked with square bastions adapted to musketry and probably used as magazines storehouses or lodgings The sides towards the river and the lake had no other defences than a ditch and palisade flanked like the others by bastions over each of which was displayed a large cross two The buildings within were no doubt of wood and they included a church a kitchen a refectory places of retreat for religious instruction and meditation three and lodgings for at least sixty persons Near the church but outside the fortification was a cemetery Beyond the ditch or canal which opened on the river was a large area still traceable in the form of an irregular triangle surrounded by a ditch and apparently by palisades It seems to have been meant for the protection of the Indian visitors who came in throngs to Sainte Marie and who were lodged in a large house of bark after the Huron manner four Here perhaps was also the hospital which was placed without the walls in order that Indian women as well as men might be admitted into it five one It seems probable that the walls of which the remains may still be traced were foundations supporting a wooden superstructure Ragueneau in a letter to the General of the Jesuits dated March thirteen sixteen fifty alludes to the defences of Saint Marie as une simple palissade two

hospital est tellement separe de nostre demeure que non seulement les hommes et enfans mais les femmes y peuuent estre admises Ibid sixteen forty four seventy four No doubt the buildings of Sainte Marie were of the roughest rude walls of boards windows without glass vast chimneys of unhewn stone All its riches were centred in the church which as Lalemant tells us was regarded by the Indians as one of the wonders of the world but which he adds would have made but a beggarly show in France Yet one wonders at first thought how so much labor could have been accomplished here Of late years however the number of men at the command of the mission had been considerable Soldiers had been sent up from time to time to escort the Fathers on their way and defend them on their arrival Thus in sixteen forty four Montmagny ordered twenty men of a reinforcement just arrived from France to escort Brebeuf Garreau and Chabanel to the Hurons and remain there during the winter one These soldiers lodged with the Jesuits and lived at their table two It was not however on detachments of troops that they mainly relied for labor or defence Any inhabitant of Canada who chose to undertake so hard and dangerous a service was allowed to do so receiving only his maintenance from the mission without pay In return he was allowed to trade with the Indians and sell the furs thus obtained at the magazine of the Company at a fixed price Registres des Arrets du Conseil extract in Faillon II ninety four Many availed themselves of this permission and all whose services were accepted by the Jesuits seem to have been men to whom they had communicated no small portion of their own zeal and who were enthusiastically attached to their Order and their cause There is abundant evidence that a large proportion of them acted from motives wholly disinterested They were in fact donnes of the mission three given heart and hand to its service There is probability in the conjecture that the profits of their trade with the Indians were reaped not for their own behoof but for that of the mission four It is difficult otherwise to explain the confidence with which the Father Superior in a letter to the General of the Jesuits at Rome speaks of its resources He says Though our number is greatly increased and though we still hope for more men and especially for more priests of our Society it is not necessary to increase the pecuniary aid given us five one Vimont Relation sixteen forty four forty nine He adds that some of these soldiers though they had once been assez mauvais garcons had shown great zeal and devotion in behalf of the mission two Journal des Superieurs des Jesuites MS In sixteen forty eight a small cannon was sent to Sainte Marie in the Huron canoes Ibid three See ante chapter sixteen page two hundred fourteen donnes Garnier calls them seculiers d habit mais religieux de coeur Lettres MSS four The Jesuits even at this early period were often and loudly charged with sharing in the fur trade It is certain that this charge was not wholly without foundation Le Jeune in the Relation of sixteen fifty seven speaking of the wampum guns powder lead hatchets kettles and other articles which the missionaries were obliged to give to the Indians at councils and elsewhere says that these must be bought from the traders with beaver skins which are the money of the country and he adds Que si vn Iesuite en recoit ou en recueille quelques vns pour ayder aux frais immenses qu il faut faire dans ces Missions si eloignees et pour gagner ces peuples a Iesus Christ et

beaver skins if you choose for the Dutch Even such of them as may fall into our possession will be employed for your service Ibid seventeen In sixteen thirty six La Jeune thought it necessary to write a long letter of defence against the charge and in sixteen forty three a declaration appended to the Relation of that year and certifying that the Jesuits took no part in the fur trade was drawn up and signed by twelve members of the company of New France Its only meaning is that the Jesuits were neither partners nor rivals of the Company s monopoly They certainly bought supplies from its magazines with furs which they obtained from the Indians Their object evidently was to make the mission partially self supporting To impute mercenary motives to Garnier Jogues and their company laborers is manifestly idle but even in the highest flights of his enthusiasm the Jesuit never forgot his worldly wisdom five Lettre du P Paul Ragueneau au T R P Vincent Carafa General de la Compagnie de Jesus a Rome Sainte Marie aux Hurons one Mars sixteen forty nine Carayon Much of this prosperity was no doubt due to the excellent management of their resources and a very successful agriculture While the Indians around them were starving they raised maize in such quantities that in the spring of sixteen forty nine the Father Superior thought that their stock of provisions might suffice for three years Hunting and fishing he says are better than heretofore and he adds that they had fowls swine and even cattle one How they could have brought these last to Sainte Marie it is difficult to conceive The feat under the circumstances is truly astonishing Everything indicates a fixed resolve on the part of the Fathers to build up a solid and permanent establishment one Lettre du P Paul Ragueneau au T R P Vincent Carafa General de la Compagnie de Jesus a Rome Sainte Marie aux Hurons one Mars sixteen forty nine Carayon It is by no means to be inferred that the household fared sumptuously Their ordinary food was maize pounded and boiled and seasoned in the absence of salt which was regarded as a luxury with morsels of smoked fish Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty eight forty eight In March sixteen forty nine there were in the Huron country and its neighborhood eighteen Jesuit priests four lay brothers twenty three men serving without pay seven hired men four boys and eight soldiers one Of this number fifteen priests were engaged in the various missions while all the rest were retained permanently at Sainte Marie All was method discipline and subordination Some of the men were assigned to household work and some to the hospital while the rest labored at the fortifications tilled the fields and stood ready in case of need to fight the Iroquois The Father Superior with two other priests as assistants controlled and guided all The remaining Jesuits undisturbed by temporal cares were devoted exclusively to the charge of their respective missions Two or three times in the year they all or nearly all assembled at Sainte Marie to take counsel together and determine their future action Hither also they came at intervals for a period of meditation and prayer to nerve themselves and gain new inspiration for their stern task one See the report of the Father Superior to the General above cited The number was greatly increased within the year In April sixteen forty eight Ragueneau reports but forty two French in all including priests Before the end of the summer a large reinforcement came up in the Huron canoes Besides being the citadel and the magazine of the mission Sainte Marie was the scene of a bountiful hospitality On every alternate Saturday as well as on feast days the converts came in crowds from the farthest villages They were entertained during Saturday Sunday and a part of Monday and the rites of the Church were celebrated before them with all possible solemnity and pomp They were welcomed also at other times and entertained usually with three meals to each In these latter years the prevailing famine drove them to Sainte Marie in swarms In the course of sixteen forty seven three thousand were lodged and fed here and in the following year the number was doubled Compare Ragueneau in Relation des Hurons sixteen forty eight forty eight and in his report to the General in sixteen forty nine Heathen Indians were also received and supplied with food but were not permitted to remain at night There was provision for the soul as well as the body and Christian or heathen few left Sainte Marie without a word of instruction or exhortation Charity was an instrument of conversion Such so far as we can reconstruct it from the scattered hints remaining was this singular establishment at once military monastic and patriarchal The missions of which it was the basis were now eleven in number To those among the Hurons already mentioned another had lately been added that of Sainte Madeleine and two others called saint Jean and saint Matthias had been established in the neighboring Tobacco Nation one The three remaining missions were all among tribes speaking the Algonquin languages Every winter bands of these savages driven by famine and fear of the Iroquois sought harborage in the Huron country and the mission of Sainte Elisabeth was established for their benefit The next Algonquin mission was that of Saint Esprit embracing the Nipissings and other tribes east and north east of Lake Huron and lastly the mission of saint Pierre included the tribes at the outlet of Lake Superior and throughout a vast extent of surrounding wilderness two one The mission of the Neutral Nation had been abandoned for the time from the want of missionaries The Jesuits had resolved on concentration and on the thorough conversion of the Hurons as a preliminary to more extended efforts two Besides these tribes the Jesuits had become more or less acquainted with many others also Algonquin on the west and south of Lake Huron as well as with the Puans or Winnebagoes a Dacotah tribe between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi The Mission of Sault Sainte Marie at the outlet of Lake Superior was established at a later period Modern writers have confounded it with Sainte Marie of the Hurons By the Relation of sixteen forty nine it appears that another mission had lately been begun at the Grand Manitoulin Island which the Jesuits also christened Isle Sainte Marie These missions were more laborious though not more perilous than those among the Hurons The Algonquin hordes were never long at rest and summer and winter the priest must follow them by lake forest and stream in summer plying the paddle all day or toiling through pathless thickets bending under the weight of a birch canoe or a load of baggage at night his bed the rugged earth or some bare rock lashed by the restless waves of Lake Huron while famine the snow storms the cold the treacherous ice of the Great Lakes smoke filth and not rarely threats and persecution were the lot of his winter wanderings It seemed an earthly paradise when at long intervals he found a respite from his toils among his brother Jesuits under the roof of Sainte Marie Hither while the Fathers are gathered from their scattered stations at one of their periodical meetings a little before the season of Lent sixteen forty nine one let us too repair and join them We enter at the eastern gate of the fortification midway in the wall between its northern and southern bastions and pass to the hall where at a rude table spread with ruder fare all the household are assembled laborers domestics soldiers and priests one The date of this meeting is a supposition merely It is adopted with reference to events which preceded and followed It was a scene that might recall a remote half feudal half patriarchal age when under the smoky rafters of his antique hail some warlike thane sat with kinsmen and dependants ranged down the long board each in his degree Here doubtless Ragueneau the Father Superior held the place of honor and for chieftains scarred with Danish battle axes was seen a band of thoughtful men clad in a threadbare garb of black their brows swarthy from exposure yet marked with the lines of intellect and a fixed enthusiasm of purpose Here was Bressani scarred with firebrand and knife Chabanel once a professor of rhetoric in France now a missionary bound by a self imposed vow to a life from which his nature recoiled the fanatical Chaumonot whose character savored of his peasant birth for the grossest fungus of superstition that ever grew under the shadow of Rome was not too much for his omnivorous credulity and miracles and mysteries were his daily food yet such as his faith was he was ready to die for it Garnier beardless like a woman was of a far finer nature His religion was of the affections and the sentiments and his imagination warmed with the ardor of his faith shaped the ideal forms of his worship into visible realities Brebeuf sat conspicuous among his brethren portly and tall his short moustache and beard grizzled with time for he was fifty six years old If he seemed impassive it was because one overmastering principle had merged and absorbed all the impulses of his nature and all the faculties of his mind The enthusiasm which with many is fitful and spasmodic was with him the current of his life solemn and deep as the tide of destiny The Divine Trinity the Virgin the Saints Heaven and Hell Angels and Fiends to him these alone were real and all things else were nought Gabriel Lalemant nephew of Jerome Lalemant Superior at Quebec was Brebeuf s colleague at the mission of saint Ignace His slender frame and delicate features gave him an appearance of youth though he had reached middle life and as in the case of Garnier the fervor of his mind sustained him through exertions of which he seemed physically incapable Of the rest of that company little has come down to us but the bare record of their missionary toils and we may ask in vain what youthful enthusiasm what broken hope or faded dream turned the current of their lives and sent them from the heart of civilization to this savage outpost of the world No element was wanting in them for the achievement of such a success as that to which they aspired neither a transcendent zeal nor a matchless discipline nor a practical sagacity very seldom surpassed in the pursuits where men strive for wealth and place and if they were destined to disappointment it was the result of external causes against which no power of theirs could have insured them There was a gap in their number The place of Antoine Daniel was empty and never more to be filled by him never at least in the flesh for Chaumonot averred that not long since when the Fathers were met in council he had seen their dead companion seated in their midst as of old with a countenance radiant and majestic one They believed his story no doubt he believed it himself and they consoled one another with the thought that in losing their colleague on earth they had gained him as a powerful intercessor in heaven Daniel s station had been at saint Joseph but the mission and the missionary had alike ceased to exist one Ce bon Pere s apparut apres sa mort a vn des nostres par deux diuerses fois En l vne il se fit voir en estat de gloire

eight ANTOINE DANIEL HURON TRADERS BATTLE AT THREE RIVERS saint JOSEPH ONSET OF THE IROQUOIS DEATH OF DANIEL THE TOWN DESTROYED In the summer of sixteen forty seven the Hurons dared not go down to the French settlements but in the following year they took heart and resolved at all risks to make the attempt for the kettles hatchets and knives of the traders had become necessaries of life Two hundred and fifty of their best warriors therefore embarked under five valiant chiefs They made the voyage in safety approached Three Rivers on the seventeenth of July and running their canoes ashore among the bulrushes began to grease their hair paint their faces and otherwise adorn themselves that they might appear after a befitting fashion at the fort While they were thus engaged the alarm was sounded Some of their warriors had discovered a large body of Iroquois who for several days had been lurking in the forest unknown to the French garrison watching their opportunity to strike a blow The Hurons snatched their arms and half greased and painted ran to meet them The Iroquois received them with a volley They fell flat to avoid the shot then leaped up with a furious yell and sent back a shower of arrows and bullets The Iroquois who were outnumbered gave way and fled excepting a few who for a time made fight with their knives The Hurons pursued Many prisoners were taken and many dead left on the field Lalemant Relation sixteen forty eight eleven The Jesuit Bressani had come down with the Hurons and was with them in the fight The rout of the enemy was complete and when their trade was ended the Hurons returned home in triumph decorated with the laurels and the scalps of victory As it proved it would have been well had they remained there to defend their families and firesides The oft mentioned town of Teanaustaye or saint Joseph lay on the south eastern frontier of the Huron country near the foot of a range of forest covered hills and about fifteen miles from Sainte Marie It had been the chief town of the nation and its population by the Indian standard was still large for it had four hundred families and at least two thousand inhabitants It was well fortified with palisades after the Huron manner and was esteemed the chief bulwark of the country Here countless Iroquois had been burned and devoured Its people had been truculent and intractable heathen but many of them had surrendered to the Faith and for four years past Father Daniel had preached among them with excellent results On the morning of the fourth of July when the forest around basked lazily in the early sun you might have mounted the rising ground on which the town stood and passed unchallenged through the opening in the palisade Within you would have seen the crowded dwellings of bark shaped like the arched coverings of huge baggage wagons and decorated with the totems or armorial devices of their owners daubed on the outside with paint Here some squalid wolfish dog lay sleeping in the sun a group of Huron girls chatted together in the shade old squaws pounded corn in large wooden mortars idle youths gambled with cherry stones on a wooden platter and naked infants crawled in the dust Scarcely a warrior was to be seen Some were absent in quest of game or of Iroquois scalps and some had gone with the trading party to the French settlements You followed the foul passage ways among the houses and at length came to the church It was full to the door Daniel had just finished the mass and his flock still knelt at their devotions It was but the day before that he had returned to them warmed with new fervor from his meditations in retreat at Sainte Marie Suddenly an uproar of voices shrill with terror burst upon the languid silence of the town The Iroquois the Iroquois A crowd of hostile warriors had issued from the forest and were rushing across the clearing towards the opening in the palisade Daniel ran out of the church and hurried to the point of danger Some snatched weapons some rushed to and fro in the madness of a blind panic The priest rallied the defenders promised Heaven to those who died for their homes and their faith then hastened from house to house calling on unbelievers to repent and receive baptism to snatch them from the Hell that yawned to ingulf them They crowded around him imploring to be saved and immersing his handkerchief in a bowl of water he shook it over them and baptized them by aspersion They pursued him as he ran again to the church where he found a throng of women children and old men gathered as in a sanctuary Some cried for baptism some held out their children to receive it some begged for absolution and some wailed in terror and despair Brothers he exclaimed again and again as he shook the baptismal drops from his handkerchief brothers to day we shall be in Heaven The fierce yell of the war whoop now rose close at hand The palisade was forced and the enemy was in the town The air quivered with the infernal din Fly screamed the priest driving his flock before him I will stay here We shall meet again in Heaven Many of them escaped through an opening in the palisade opposite to that by which the Iroquois had entered but Daniel would not follow for there still might be souls to rescue from perdition The hour had come for which he had long prepared himself In a moment he saw the Iroquois and came forth from the church to meet them When they saw him in turn radiant in the vestments of his office confronting them with a look kindled with the inspiration of martyrdom they stopped and stared in amazement then recovering themselves bent their bows and showered him with a volley of arrows that tore through his robes and his flesh A gun shot followed the ball pierced his heart and he fell dead gasping the name of Jesus They rushed upon him with yells of triumph stripped him naked gashed and hacked his lifeless body and scooping his blood in their hands bathed their faces in it to make them brave The town was in a blaze when the flames reached the church they flung the priest into it and both were consumed together Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty nine

aux Ursulines de Tours Quebec sixteen forty nine Daniel was born at Dieppe and was forty eight years old at the time of his death He had been a Jesuit from the age of twenty Teanaustaye was a heap of ashes and the victors took up their march with a train of nearly seven hundred prisoners many of whom they killed on the way Many more had been slain in the town and the neighboring forest where the pursuers hunted them down and where women crouching for refuge among thickets were betrayed by the cries and wailing of their infants The triumph of the Iroquois did not end here for a neighboring fortified town included within the circle of Daniel s mission shared the fate of Teanaustaye Never had the Huron nation received such a blow CHAPTER XXVII sixteen forty nine RUIN OF THE HURONS saint LOUIS ON FIRE INVASION saint IGNACE CAPTURED BREBEUF AND LALEMANT BATTLE AT saint LOUIS SAINTE MARIE THREATENED RENEWED FIGHTING DESPERATE CONFLICT A NIGHT OF SUSPENSE PANIC AMONG THE VICTORS BURNING OF saint IGNACE RETREAT OF THE IROQUOIS More than eight months had passed since the catastrophe of saint Joseph The winter was over and that dreariest of seasons had come the churlish forerunner of spring Around Sainte Marie the forests were gray and bare and in the cornfields the oozy half thawed soil studded with the sodden stalks of the last autumn s harvest showed itself in patches through the melting snow At nine o clock on the morning of the sixteenth of March the priests saw a heavy smoke rising over the naked forest towards the south east about three miles distant They looked at each other in dismay The Iroquois They are burning saint Louis Flames mingled with the smoke and as they stood gazing two Christian Hurons came breathless and aghast from the burning town Their worst fear was realized The Iroquois were there but where were the priests of the mission Brebeuf and Lalemant Late in the autumn a thousand Iroquois chiefly Senecas and Mohawks had taken the war path for the Hurons They had been all winter in the forests hunting for subsistence and moving at their leisure towards their prey The destruction of the two towns of the mission of saint Joseph had left a wide gap and in the middle of March they entered the heart of the Huron country undiscovered Common vigilance and common sense would have averted the calamities that followed but the Hurons were like a doomed people stupefied sunk in dejection fearing everything yet taking no measures for defence They could easily have met the invaders with double their force but the besotted warriors lay idle in their towns or hunted at leisure in distant forests nor could the Jesuits by counsel or exhortation rouse them to face the danger Before daylight of the sixteenth the invaders approached saint Ignace which with saint Louis and three other towns formed the mission of the same name They reconnoitred the place in the darkness It was defended on three sides by a deep ravine and further strengthened by palisades fifteen or sixteen feet high planted under the direction of the Jesuits On the fourth side it was protected by palisades alone and these were left as usual unguarded This was not from a sense of security for the greater part of the population had abandoned the town thinking it too much exposed to the enemy and there remained only about four hundred chiefly women children and old men whose infatuated defenders were absent hunting or on futile scalping parties against the Iroquois It was just before dawn when a yell as of a legion of devils startled the wretched inhabitants from their sleep and the Iroquois bursting in upon them cut them down with knives and hatchets killing many and reserving the rest for a worse fate They had entered by the weakest side on the other sides there was no exit and only three Hurons escaped The whole was the work of a few minutes The Iroquois left a guard to hold the town and secure the retreat of the main body in case of a reverse then smearing their faces with blood after their ghastly custom they rushed in the dim light of the early dawn towards saint Louis about a league distant The three fugitives had fled half naked through the forest for the same point which they reached about sunrise yelling the alarm The number of inhabitants here was less at this time than seven hundred and of these all who had strength to escape excepting about eighty warriors made in wild terror for a place of safety Many of the old sick and decrepit were left perforce in the lodges The warriors ignorant of the strength of the assailants sang their war songs and resolved to hold the place to the last It had not the natural strength of saint Ignace but like it was surrounded by palisades Here were the two Jesuits Brebeuf and Lalemant Brebeuf s converts entreated him to escape with them but the Norman zealot bold scion of a warlike stock had no thought of flight His post was in the teeth of danger to cheer on those who fought and open Heaven to those who fell His colleague slight of frame and frail of constitution trembled despite himself but deep enthusiasm mastered the weakness of Nature and he too refused to fly Scarcely had the sun risen and scarcely were the fugitives gone when like a troop of tigers the Iroquois rushed to the assault Yell echoed yell and shot answered shot The Hurons brought to bay fought with the utmost desperation and with arrows stones and the few guns they had killed thirty of their assailants and wounded many more Twice the Iroquois recoiled and twice renewed the attack with unabated ferocity They swarmed at the foot of the palisades and hacked at them with their hatchets till they had cut them through at several different points For a time there was a deadly fight at these breaches Here were the two priests promising Heaven to those who died for their faith one giving baptism and the other absolution At length the Iroquois broke in and captured all the surviving defenders the Jesuits among the rest They set the town on fire and the helpless wretches who had remained unable to fly were consumed in their burning dwellings Next they fell upon Brebeuf and Lalemant stripped them bound them fast and led them with the other prisoners back to saint Ignace where all turned out to wreak their fury on the two priests beating them savagely with sticks and clubs as they drove them into the town At present there was no time for further torture for there was work in hand The victors divided themselves into several bands to burn the neighboring villages and hunt their flying inhabitants In the flush of their triumph they meditated a bolder enterprise and in the afternoon their chiefs sent small parties to reconnoitre Sainte Marie with a view to attacking it on the next day Meanwhile the fugitives of saint Louis joined by other bands as terrified and as helpless as they were struggling through the soft snow which clogged the forests towards Lake Huron where the treacherous ice of spring was still unmelted One fear expelled another They ventured upon it and pushed forward all that day and all the following night shivering and famished to find refuge in the towns of the Tobacco Nation Here when they arrived they spread a universal panic Ragueneau Bressani and their companions waited in suspense at Sainte Marie On the one hand they trembled for Brebeuf and Lalemant on the other they looked hourly for an attack and when at evening they saw the Iroquois scouts prowling along the edge of the bordering forest their fears were confirmed They had with them about forty Frenchmen well armed but their palisades and wooden buildings were not fire proof and they had learned from fugitives the number and ferocity of the invaders They stood guard all night praying to the Saints and above all to their great patron Saint Joseph whose festival was close at hand In the morning they were somewhat relieved by the arrival of about three hundred Huron warriors chiefly converts from La Conception and Sainte Madeleine tolerably well armed and full of fight They were expecting others to join them and meanwhile dividing into several bands they took post by the passes of the neighboring forest hoping to waylay parties of the enemy Their expectation was fulfilled for at this time two hundred of the Iroquois were making their way from saint Ignace in advance of the main body to begin the attack on Sainte Marie They fell in with a band of the Hurons set upon them killed many drove the rest to headlong flight and as they plunged in terror through the snow chased them within sight of Sainte Marie The other Hurons hearing the yells and firing ran to the rescue and attacked so fiercely that the Iroquois in turn were routed and ran for shelter to saint Louis followed closely by the victors The houses of the town had been burned but the palisade around them was still standing though breached and broken The Iroquois rushed in but the Hurons were at their heels Many of the fugitives were captured the rest killed or put to utter rout and the triumphant Hurons remained masters of the place The Iroquois who escaped fled to saint Ignace Here or on the way thither they found the main body of the invaders and when they heard of the disaster the whole swarm beside themselves with rage turned towards saint Louis to take their revenge Now ensued one of the most furious Indian battles on record The Hurons within the palisade did not much exceed a hundred and fifty for many had been killed or disabled and many perhaps had straggled away Most of their enemies had guns while they had but few Their weapons were bows and arrows war clubs hatchets and knives and of these they made good use sallying repeatedly fighting like devils and driving back their assailants again and again There are times when the Indian warrior forgets his cautious maxims and throws himself into battle with a mad and reckless ferocity The desperation of one party and the fierce courage of both kept up the fight after the day had closed and the scout from Sainte Marie as he bent listening under the gloom of the pines heard far into the night the howl of battle rising from the darkened forest The principal chief of the Iroquois was severely wounded and nearly a hundred of their warriors were killed on the spot When at length their numbers and persistent fury prevailed their only prize was some twenty Huron warriors spent with fatigue and faint with loss of blood The rest lay dead around the shattered palisades which they had so valiantly defended Fatuity not cowardice was the ruin of the Huron nation The lamps burned all night at Sainte Marie and its defenders stood watching till daylight musket in hand The Jesuits prayed without ceasing and Saint Joseph was besieged with invocations Those of us who were priests writes Ragueneau each made a vow to say a mass in his honor every month for the space of a year and all the rest bound themselves by vows to divers penances The expected onslaught did not take place Not an Iroquois appeared Their victory had been bought too dear and they had no stomach for more fighting All the next day the eighteenth a stillness like the dead lull of a tempest followed the turmoil of yesterday as if says the Father Superior the country were waiting palsied with fright for some new disaster On the following day the journalist fails not to mention that it was the festival of Saint Joseph Indians came in with tidings that a panic had seized the Iroquois camp that the chiefs could not control it and that the whole body of invaders was retreating in disorder possessed with a vague terror that the Hurons were upon them in force They had found time however for an act of atrocious cruelty They planted stakes in the bark houses of saint Ignace and bound to them those of their prisoners whom they meant to sacrifice male and female from old age to infancy husbands mothers and children side by side Then as they retreated they set the town on fire and laughed with savage glee at the shrieks of anguish that rose from the blazing dwellings The site of saint Ignace still bears evidence of the catastrophe in the ashes and charcoal that indicate the position of the houses and the fragments of broken pottery and half consumed bone together with trinkets of stone metal or glass which have survived the lapse of two centuries and more The place has been minutely examined by doctor Tache They loaded the rest of their prisoners with their baggage and plunder and drove them through the forest southward braining with their hatchets any who gave out on the march An old woman who had escaped out of the midst of the flames of saint Ignace made her way to saint Michel a large town not far from the desolate site of saint Joseph Here she found about seven hundred Huron warriors hastily mustered She set them on the track of the retreating Iroquois and they took up the chase but evidently with no great eagerness to overtake their dangerous enemy well armed as he was with Dutch guns while they had little beside their bows and arrows They found as they advanced the dead bodies of prisoners tomahawked on the march and others bound fast to trees and half burned by the fagots piled hastily around them The Iroquois pushed forward with such headlong speed that the pursuers could not or would not overtake them and after two days they gave over the attempt CHAPTER XXVIII sixteen forty nine THE MARTYRS THE RUINS OF saint IGNACE THE RELICS FOUND BREBEUF AT THE STAKE HIS UNCONQUERABLE FORTITUDE LALEMANT RENEGADE HURONS IROQUOIS ATROCITIES DEATH OF BREBEUF HIS CHARACTER DEATH OF LALEMANT On the morning of the twentieth the Jesuits at Sainte Marie received full confirmation of the reported retreat of the invaders and one of them with seven armed Frenchmen set out for the scene of havoc They passed saint Louis where the bloody ground was strown thick with corpses and two or three miles farther on reached saint Ignace Here they saw a spectacle of horror for among the ashes of the burnt town were scattered in profusion the half consumed bodies of those who had perished in the flames Apart from the rest they saw a sight that banished all else from their thoughts for they found what they had come to seek the scorched and mangled relics of Brebeuf and Lalemant Ils y trouuerent vn spectacle d horreur les restes de la cruaute mesme ou plus tost les restes de l amour de Dieu qui seul triomphe dans la mort des Martyrs Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty nine thirteen They had learned their fate already from Huron prisoners many of whom had made their escape in the panic and confusion of the Iroquois retreat They described what they had seen and the condition in which the bodies were found confirmed their story On the afternoon of the sixteenth the day when the two priests were captured Brebeuf was led apart and bound to a stake He seemed more concerned for his captive converts than for himself and addressed them in a loud voice exhorting them to suffer patiently and promising Heaven as their reward The Iroquois incensed scorched him from head to foot to silence him whereupon in the tone of a master he threatened them with everlasting flames for persecuting the worshippers of God As he continued to speak with voice and countenance unchanged they cut away his lower lip and thrust a red hot iron down his throat He still held his tall form erect and defiant with no sign or sound of pain and they tried another means to overcome him They led out Lalemant that Brebeuf might see him tortured They had tied strips of bark smeared with pitch about his naked body When he saw the condition of his Superior he could not hide his agitation and called out to him with a broken voice in the words of Saint Paul We are made a spectacle to the world to angels and to men Then he threw himself at Brebeuf s feet upon which the Iroquois seized him made him fast to a stake and set fire to the bark that enveloped him As the flame rose he threw his arms upward with a shriek of supplication to Heaven Next they hung around Brebeuf s neck a collar made of hatchets heated red hot but the indomitable priest stood like a rock A Huron in the crowd who had been a convert of the mission but was now an Iroquois by adoption called out with the malice of a renegade to pour hot water on their heads since they had poured so much cold water on those of others The kettle was accordingly slung and the water boiled and poured slowly on the heads of the two missionaries We baptize you they cried that you may be happy in Heaven for nobody can be saved without a good baptism Brebeuf would not flinch and in a rage they cut strips of flesh from his limbs and devoured them before his eyes Other renegade Hurons called out to him You told us that the more one suffers on earth the happier he is in Heaven We wish to make you happy we torment you because we love you and you ought to thank us for it After a succession of other revolting tortures they scalped him when seeing him nearly dead they laid open his breast and came in a crowd to drink the blood of so valiant an enemy thinking to imbibe with it some portion of his courage A chief then tore out his heart and devoured it Thus died Jean de Brebeuf the founder of the Huron mission its truest hero and its greatest martyr He came of a noble race the same it is said from which sprang the English Earls of Arundel but never had the mailed barons of his line confronted a fate so appalling with so prodigious a constancy To the last he refused to flinch and his death was the astonishment of his murderers Charlevoix I two hundred four Alegambe uses a similar expression In him an enthusiastic devotion was grafted on an heroic nature His bodily endowments were as remarkable as the temper of his mind His manly proportions his strength and his endurance which incessant fasts and penances could not undermine had always won for him the respect of the Indians no less than a courage unconscious of fear and yet redeemed from rashness by a cool and vigorous judgment for extravagant as were the chimeras which fed the fires of his zeal they were consistent with the soberest good sense on matters of practical bearing Lalemant physically weak from childhood and slender almost to emaciation was constitutionally unequal to a display of fortitude like that of his colleague When Brebeuf died he was led back to the house whence he had been taken and tortured there all night until in the morning one of the Iroquois growing tired of the protracted entertainment killed him with a hatchet one It was said that at times he seemed beside himself then rallying with hands uplifted he offered his sufferings to Heaven as a sacrifice His robust companion had lived less than four hours under the torture while he survived it for nearly seventeen Perhaps the Titanic effort of will with which Brebeuf repressed all show of suffering conspired with the Iroquois knives and firebrands to exhaust his vitality perhaps his tormentors enraged at his fortitude forgot their subtlety and struck too near the life one We saw no part of his body says Ragueneau from head to foot which was not burned even to his eyes in the sockets of which these wretches had placed live coals Relation des Hurons sixteen forty nine fifteen Lalemant was a Parisian and his family belonged to the class of gens de robe or hereditary practitioners of the law He was thirty nine years of age His physical weakness is spoken of by several of those who knew him Marie de l Incarnation says C etait l homme le plus faible et le plus delicat qu on eut pu voir Both Bressani and Ragueneau are equally emphatic on this point The bodies of the two missionaries were carried to Sainte Marie and buried in the cemetery there but the skull of Brebeuf was preserved as a relic His family sent from France a silver bust of their martyred kinsman in the base of which was a recess to contain the skull and to this day the bust and the relic within are preserved with pious care by the nuns of the Hotel Dieu at Quebec Photographs of the bust are before me Various relics of the two missionaries were preserved and some of them may still be seen in Canadian monastic establishments The following extract from a letter of Marie de l Incarnation to her son written from Quebec in October of this year sixteen forty nine is curious Madame our foundress Madame de la Peltrie sends you relics of our holy martyrs but she does it secretly since the reverend Fathers would not give us any for fear that we should send them to France but as she is not bound by vows and as the very persons who went for the bodies have given relics of them to her in secret I begged her to send you some of them which she has done very gladly from the respect she has for you She adds in the same letter Our Lord having revealed to him Brebeuf the time of his martyrdom three days before it happened he went full of joy to find the other Fathers who seeing him in extraordinary spirits caused him by an inspiration of God to be bled after which time surgeon dried his blood through a presentiment of what was to take place lest he should be treated like Father Daniel who eight months before had been so reduced to ashes that no remains of his body could be found Brebeuf had once been ordered by the Father Superior to write down the visions revelations and inward experiences with which he was favored at least says Ragueneau those which he could easily remember for their multitude was too great for the whole to be recalled I find nothing he adds more frequent in this memoir than the expression of his desire to die for Jesus Christ Sentio me vehementer impelli ad moriendum pro Christo In fine wishing to make himself a holocaust and a victim consecrated to death and holily to anticipate the happiness of martyrdom which awaited him he bound himself by a vow to Christ which he conceived in these terms and Ragueneau gives the vow in the original Latin It binds him never to refuse the grace of martyrdom if at any day Thou shouldst in Thy infinite pity offer it to me Thy unworthy servant and when I shall have received the stroke of death I bind myself to accept it at Thy hand with all the contentment and joy of my heart Some of his innumerable visions have been already mentioned See ante chapter nine page one hundred eight Tanner Societas Militans gives various others as for example that he once beheld a mountain covered thick with saints but above all with virgins while the Queen of Virgins sat at the top in a blaze of glory In sixteen thirty seven when the whole country was enraged against the Jesuits and above all against Brebeuf as sorcerers who had caused the pest Ragueneau tells us that a troop of demons appeared before him divers times sometimes like men in a fury sometimes like frightful monsters bears lions or wild horses trying to rush upon him These spectres excited in him neither horror nor fear He said to them Do to me whatever God permits you for without His will not one hair will fall from my head And at these words all the demons vanished in a moment Relation des Hurons sixteen forty nine twenty Compare the long notice in Alegambe Mortes Illustres six hundred forty four In Ragueneau s notice of Brebeuf as in all other notices of deceased missionaries in the Relations the saintly qualities alone are brought forward as obedience humility et cetera but wherever Brebeuf himself appears in the course of those voluminous records he always brings with him an impression of power We are told that punning on his own name he used to say that he was an ox fit only to bear burdens This sort of humility may pass for what it is worth but it must be remembered that there is a kind of acting in which the actor firmly believes in the part he is playing As for the obedience it was as genuine as that of a well disciplined soldier and incomparably more profound In the case of the Canadian Jesuits posterity owes to this their favorite virtue the record of numerous visions inward voices and the like miracles which the object of these favors set down on paper at the command of his Superior while otherwise humility would have concealed them forever The truth is that with some of these missionaries one may throw off trash and nonsense by the cart load and find under it all a solid nucleus of saint and hero CHAPTER XXIX sixteen forty nine sixteen fifty THE SANCTUARY DISPERSION OF THE HURONS SAINTE MARIE ABANDONED ISLE saint JOSEPH REMOVAL OF THE MISSION THE NEW FORT MISERY OF THE HURONS FAMINE EPIDEMIC EMPLOYMENTS OF THE JESUITS All was over with the Hurons The death knell of their nation had struck Without a leader without organization without union crazed with fright and paralyzed with misery they yielded to their doom without a blow Their only thought was flight Within two weeks after the disasters of saint Ignace and saint Louis fifteen Huron towns were abandoned and the greater number burned lest they should give shelter to the Iroquois The last year s harvest had been scanty the fugitives had no food and they left behind them the fields in which was their only hope of obtaining it In bands large or small some roamed northward and eastward through the half thawed wilderness some hid themselves on the rocks or islands of Lake Huron some sought an asylum among the Tobacco Nation a few joined the Neutrals on the north of Lake Erie The Hurons as a nation ceased to exist Chaumonot who was at Ossossane at the time of the Iroquois invasion gives a vivid picture of the panic and lamentation which followed the news of the destruction of the Huron warriors at saint Louis and of the flight of the inhabitants to the country of the Tobacco Nation Vie sixty two Hitherto Sainte Marie had been covered by large fortified towns which lay between it and the Iroquois but these were all destroyed some by the enemy and some by their own people and the Jesuits were left alone to bear the brunt of the next attack There was moreover no reason for their remaining Sainte Marie had been built as a basis for the missions but its occupation was gone the flock had fled from the shepherds and its existence had no longer an object If the priests stayed to be butchered they would perish not as martyrs but as fools The necessity was as clear as it was bitter All their toil must come to nought Sainte Marie must be abandoned They confess the pang which the resolution cost them but pursues the Father Superior since the birth of Christianity the Faith has nowhere been planted except in the midst of sufferings and crosses Thus this desolation consoles us and in the midst of persecution in the extremity of the evils which assail us and the greater evils which threaten us we are all filled with joy for our hearts tell us that God has never had a more tender love for us than now Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen forty nine twenty six Several of the priests set out to follow and console the scattered bands of fugitive Hurons One embarked in a canoe and coasted the dreary shores of Lake Huron northward among the wild labyrinth of rocks and islets whither his scared flock had fled for refuge another betook himself to the forest with a band of half famished proselytes and shared their miserable rovings through the thickets and among the mountains Those who remained took counsel together at Sainte Marie Whither should they go and where should be the new seat of the mission They made choice of the Grand Manitoulin Island called by them Isle Sainte Marie and by the Hurons Ekaentoton It lay near the northern shores of Lake Huron and by its position would give a ready access to numberless Algonquin tribes along the borders of all these inland seas Moreover it would bring the priests and their flock nearer to the French settlements by the route of the Ottawa whenever the Iroquois should cease to infest that river The fishing too was good and some of the priests who knew the island well made a favorable report of the soil Thither therefore they had resolved to transplant the mission when twelve Huron chiefs arrived and asked for an interview with the Father Superior and his fellow Jesuits The conference lasted three hours The deputies declared that many of the scattered Hurons had determined to reunite and form a settlement on a neighboring island of the lake called by the Jesuits Isle saint Joseph that they needed the aid of the Fathers that without them they were helpless but with them they could hold their ground and repel the attacks of the Iroquois They urged their plea in language which Ragueneau describes as pathetic and eloquent and to confirm their words they gave him ten large collars of wampum saying that these were the voices of their wives and children They gained their point The Jesuits abandoned their former plan and promised to join the Hurons on Isle saint Joseph They had built a boat or small vessel and in this they embarked such of their stores as it would hold The greater part were placed on a large raft made for the purpose like one of the rafts of timber which every summer float down the saint Lawrence and the Ottawa Here was their stock of corn in part the produce of their own fields and in part bought from the Hurons in former years of plenty pictures vestments sacred vessels and images weapons ammunition tools goods for barter with the Indians cattle swine and poultry Some of these were killed for food after reaching the island In March following they had ten fowls a pair of swine two bulls and two cows kept for breeding Lettre de Ragueneau au General de la Compagnie de Jesus saint Joseph thirteen Mars sixteen fifty Sainte Marie was stripped of everything that could be moved Then lest it should harbor the Iroquois they set it on fire and saw consumed in an hour the results of nine or ten years of toil It was near sunset on the fourteenth of June one The houseless band descended to the mouth of the Wye went on board their raft pushed it from the shore and with sweeps and oars urged it on its way all night The lake was calm and the weather fair but it crept so slowly over the water that several days elapsed before they reached their destination about twenty miles distant one Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen fifty three In the Relation of the preceding year he gives the fifteenth of May as the date evidently an error Nous sortismes de ces terres de Promission qui estoient nostre Paradis et ou la mort nous eust este mille fois plus douce que ne sera la vie en quelque lieu que nous puissions estre Mais il faut suiure Dieu et il faut aimer ses conduites quelque opposees qu elles paroissent a nos desirs a nos plus saintes esperances et aux plus tendres amours de nostre coeur Lettre de Ragueneau

Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen fifty two three Near the entrance of Matchedash Bay lie the three islands now known as Faith Hope and Charity Of these Charity or Christian Island called Ahoendoe by the Hurons and saint Joseph by the Jesuits is by far the largest It is six or eight miles wide and when the Hurons sought refuge here it was densely covered with the primeval forest The priests landed with their men some forty soldiers laborers and others and found about three hundred Huron families bivouacked in the woods Here were wigwams and sheds of bark and smoky kettles slung over fires each on its tripod of poles while around lay groups of famished wretches with dark haggard visages and uncombed hair in every posture of despondency and woe They had not been wholly idle for they had made some rough clearings and planted a little corn The arrival of the Jesuits gave them new hope and weakened as they were with famine they set themselves to the task of hewing and burning down the forest making bark houses and planting palisades The priests on their part chose a favorable spot and began to clear the ground and mark out the lines of a fort Their men the greater part serving without pay labored with admirable spirit and before winter had built a square bastioned fort of solid masonry with a deep ditch and walls about twelve feet high Within were a small chapel houses for lodging and a well which with the ruins of the walls may still be seen on the south eastern shore of the island a hundred feet from the water one Detached redoubts were also built near at hand where French musketeers could aid in defending the adjacent Huron village Compare Martin Introduction to Bressani Relation Abregee thirty eight Though the island was called saint Joseph the fort like that on the Wye received the name of Sainte Marie Jesuit devotion scattered these names broadcast over all the field of their labors one The measurement between the angles of the two southern bastions is one hundred twenty three feet and that of the curtain wall connecting these bastions is seventy eight feet Some curious relics have been found in the fort among others a steel mill for making wafers for the Host It was found in eighteen forty eight in a remarkable state of preservation and is now in an English museum having been bought on the spot by an amateur As at Sainte Marie on the Wye the remains are in perfect conformity with the narratives and letters of the priests The island thanks to the vigilance of the French escaped attack throughout the summer but Iroquois scalping parties ranged the neighboring shores killing stragglers and keeping the Hurons in perpetual alarm As winter drew near great numbers who trembling and by stealth had gathered a miserable subsistence among the northern forests and islands rejoined their countrymen at saint Joseph until six or eight thousand expatriated wretches were gathered here under the protection of the French fort They were housed in a hundred or more bark dwellings each containing eight or ten families Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen fifty three four He reckons eight persons to a family Here were widows without children and children without parents for famine and the Iroquois had proved more deadly enemies than the pestilence which a few years before had wasted their towns one Of this multitude but few had strength enough to labor scarcely any had made provision for the winter and numbers were already perishing from want dragging themselves from house to house like living skeletons The priests had spared no effort to meet the demands upon their charity They sent men during the autumn to buy smoked fish from the Northern Algonquins and employed Indians to gather acorns in the woods Of this miserable food they succeeded in collecting five or six hundred bushels To diminish its bitterness the Indians boiled it with ashes or the priests served it out to them pounded and mixed with corn Eight hundred sacks of this mixture were given to the Hurons during the winter Bressani Relation Abregee two hundred eighty three one Ie voudrois pouuoir representer a toutes les personnes

Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen fifty five As winter advanced the Huron houses became a frightful spectacle Their inmates were dying by scores daily The priests and their men buried the bodies and the Indians dug them from the earth or the snow and fed on them sometimes in secret and sometimes openly although notwithstanding their superstitious feasts on the bodies of their enemies their repugnance and horror were extreme at the thought of devouring those of relatives and friends one An epidemic presently appeared to aid the work of famine Before spring about half of their number were dead one Ce fut alors que nous fusmes contraints de voir des squeletes mourantes qui soustenoient vne vie miserable mangeant iusqu aux ordures et les rebuts de la nature Le gland estoit a la pluspart

several feet deep yet not an hour was free from the danger of the Iroquois and from sunset to daybreak under the cold moon or in the driving snow storm the French sentries walked their rounds along the ramparts The priests rose before dawn and spent the time till sunrise in their private devotions Then the bell of their chapel rang and the Indians came in crowds at the call for misery had softened their hearts and nearly all on the island were now Christian There was a mass followed by a prayer and a few words of exhortation then the hearers dispersed to make room for others Thus the little chapel was filled ten or twelve times until all had had their turn Meanwhile other priests were hearing confessions and giving advice and encouragement in private according to the needs of each applicant This lasted till nine o clock when all the Indians returned to their village and the priests presently followed to give what assistance they could Their cassocks were worn out and they were dressed chiefly in skins Lettre de Ragueneau au General de la Compagnie de Jesus Isle saint Joseph thirteen Mars sixteen fifty They visited the Indian houses and gave to those whose necessities were most urgent small scraps of hide severally stamped with a particular mark and entitling the recipients on presenting them at the fort to a few acorns a small quantity of boiled maize or a fragment of smoked fish according to the stamp on the leather ticket of each Two hours before sunset the bell of the chapel again rang and the religious exercises of the morning were repeated Ragueneau Relation des Hurons sixteen fifty six seven Thus this miserable winter wore away till the opening spring brought new fears and new necessities Concerning the retreat of the Hurons to Isle saint Joseph the principal authorities are the Relations of sixteen forty nine and sixteen fifty which are ample in detail and written with an excellent simplicity and modesty the Relation Abregee of Bressani the reports of the Father Superior to the General of the Jesuits at Rome the manuscript of sixteen fifty two entitled Memoires touchant la Mort et les Vertus des Peres et cetera the unpublished letters of Garnier and a letter of Chaumonot written on the spot and preserved in the Relations CHAPTER XXX sixteen forty nine GARNIER CHABANEL THE TOBACCO MISSIONS saint JEAN ATTACKED DEATH OF GARNIER THE JOURNEY OF CHABANEL HIS DEATH GARREAU AND GRELON Late in the preceding autumn the Iroquois had taken the war path in force At the end of November two escaped prisoners came to Isle saint Joseph with the news that a band of three hundred warriors was hovering in the Huron forests doubtful whether to invade the island or to attack the towns of the Tobacco Nation in the valleys of the Blue Mountains The Father Superior Ragueneau sent a runner thither in all haste to warn the inhabitants of their danger There were at this time two missions in the Tobacco Nation saint Jean and saint Matthias one the latter under the charge of the Jesuits Garreau and Grelon and the former under that of Garnier and Chabanel saint Jean the principal seat of the mission of the same name was a town of five or six hundred families Its population was moreover greatly augmented by the bands of fugitive Hurons who had taken refuge there When the warriors were warned by Ragueneau s messenger of a probable attack from the Iroquois they were far from being daunted but confiding in their numbers awaited the enemy in one of those fits of valor which characterize the unstable courage of the savage At saint Jean all was paint feathers and uproar singing dancing howling and stamping Quivers were filled knives whetted and tomahawks sharpened but when after two days of eager expectancy the enemy did not appear the warriors lost patience Thinking and probably with reason that the Iroquois were afraid of them they resolved to sally forth and take the offensive With yelps and whoops they defiled into the forest where the branches were gray and bare and the ground thickly covered with snow They pushed on rapidly till the following day but could not discover their wary enemy who had made a wide circuit and was approaching the town from another quarter By ill luck the Iroquois captured a Tobacco Indian and his squaw straggling in the forest not far from saint Jean and the two prisoners to propitiate them told them the defenceless condition of the place where none remained but women children and old men The delighted Iroquois no longer hesitated but silently and swiftly pushed on towards the town one The Indian name of saint Jean was Etarita and that of saint Matthias Ekarenniondi It was two o clock in the afternoon of the seventh of December Bressani Relation Abregee two hundred sixty four Chabanel had left the place a day or two before in obedience to a message from Ragueneau and Garnier was here alone He was making his rounds among the houses visiting the sick and instructing his converts when the horrible din of the war whoop rose from the borders of the clearing and on the instant the town was mad with terror Children and girls rushed to and fro blind with fright women snatched their infants and fled they knew not whither Garnier ran to his chapel where a few of his converts had sought asylum He gave them his benediction exhorted them to hold fast to the Faith and bade them fly while there was yet time For himself he hastened back to the houses running from one to another and giving absolution or baptism to all whom he found An Iroquois met him shot him with three balls through the body and thigh tore off his cassock and rushed on in pursuit of the fugitives Garnier lay for a moment on the ground as if stunned then recovering his senses he was seen to rise into a kneeling posture At a little distance from him lay a Huron mortally wounded but still showing signs of life With the Heaven that awaited him glowing before his fading vision the priest dragged himself towards the dying Indian to give him absolution but his strength failed and he fell again to the earth He rose once more and again crept forward when a party of Iroquois rushed upon him split his head with two blows of a hatchet stripped him and left his body on the ground one At this time the whole town was on fire The invaders fearing that the absent warriors might return and take their revenge hastened to finish their work scattered firebrands every where and threw children alive into the burning houses They killed many of the fugitives captured many more and then made a hasty retreat through the forest with their prisoners butchering such of them as lagged on the way saint Jean lay a waste of smoking ruins thickly strewn with blackened corpses of the slain The above particulars of Garnier s death rest on the evidence of a Christian Huron woman named Marthe who saw him shot down and also saw his attempt to reach the dying Indian She was herself struck down immediately after with a war club but remained alive and escaped in the confusion She died three months later at Isle saint Joseph from the effects of the injuries she had received after reaffirming the truth of her story to Ragueneau who was with her and who questioned her on the subject Memoires touchant la Mort et les Vertus des Peres Garnier et cetera MS Ragueneau also speaks of her in Relation des Hurons sixteen fifty nine The priests Grelon and Garreau found the body stripped naked with three gunshot wounds in the abdomen and thigh and two deep hatchet wounds in the head Towards evening parties of fugitives reached saint Matthias with tidings of the catastrophe The town was wild with alarm and all stood on the watch in expectation of an attack but when in the morning scouts came in and reported the retreat of the Iroquois Garreau and Grelon set out with a party of converts to visit the scene of havoc For a long time they looked in vain for the body of Garnier but at length they found him lying where he had fallen so scorched and disfigured that he was recognized with difficulty The two priests wrapped his body in a part of their own clothing the Indian converts dug a grave on the spot where his church had stood and here they buried him Thus at the age of forty four died Charles Garnier the favorite child of wealthy and noble parents nursed in Parisian luxury and ease then living and dying a more than willing exile amid the hardships and horrors of the Huron wilderness His life and his death are his best eulogy Brebeuf was the lion of the Huron mission and Garnier was the lamb but the lamb was as fearless as the lion Garnier s devotion to the mission was absolute He took little or no interest in the news from France which at intervals of from one to three years found its way to the Huron towns His companion Bressani says that he would walk thirty or forty miles in the hottest summer day to baptize some dying Indian when the country was infested by the enemy On similar errands he would sometimes pass the night alone in the forest in the depth of winter He was anxious to fall into the hands of the Iroquois that he might preach the Faith to them even out of the midst of the fire In one of his unpublished letters he writes Praised be our Lord who punishes me for my sins by depriving me of this crown the crown of martyrdom After the death of Brebeuf and Lalemant he writes to his brother Helas Mon cher frere si ma conscience ne me convainquait et ne me confondait de mon infidelite au service de notre bon maitre je pourrais esperer quelque faveur approchante de celles qu il a faites aux bien heureux martyrs avec qui j avais le bien de converser souvent etant dans les memes occasions et dangers qu ils etaient mais sa justice me fait craindre que je ne demeure toujours indigne d une telle couronne He contented himself with the most wretched fare during the last years of famine living in good measure on roots and acorns although says Ragueneau he had been the cherished son of a rich and noble house on whom all the affection of his father had centred and who had been nourished on food very different from that of swine Relation des Hurons sixteen fifty twelve For his character see Ragueneau Bressani Tanner and Alegambe who devotes many pages to the description of his religious traits but the complexion of his mind is best reflected in his private letters When on the following morning the warriors of saint Jean returned from their rash and bootless sally and saw the ashes of their desolated homes and the ghastly relics of their murdered families they seated themselves amid the ruin silent and motionless as statues of bronze with heads bowed down and eyes fixed on the ground Thus they remained through half the day Tears and wailing were for women this was the mourning of warriors Garnier s colleague Chabanel had been recalled from saint Jean by an order from the Father Superior who thought it needless to expose the life of more than one priest in a position of so much danger He stopped on his way at saint Matthias and on the morning of the seventh of December the day of the attack left that town with seven or eight Christian Hurons The journey was rough and difficult They proceeded through the forest about eighteen miles and then encamped in the snow The Indians fell asleep but Chabanel from an apprehension of danger or some other cause remained awake About midnight he heard a strange sound in the distance a confusion of fierce voices mingled with songs and outcries It was the Iroquois on their retreat with their prisoners some of whom were defiantly singing their war songs after the Indian custom Chabanel waked his companions who instantly took flight He tried to follow but could not keep pace with the light footed savages who returned to saint Matthias and told what had occurred They said however that Chabanel had left them and taken an opposite direction in order to reach Isle saint Joseph His brother priests were for some time ignorant of what had befallen him At length a Huron Indian who had been converted but afterward apostatized gave out that he had met him in the forest and aided him with his canoe to cross a river which lay in his path Some supposed that he had lost his way and died of cold and hunger but others were of a different opinion Their suspicion was confirmed some time afterwards by the renegade Huron who confessed that he had killed Chabanel and thrown his body into the river after robbing him of his clothes his hat the blanket or mantle which was strapped to his shoulders and the bag in which he carried his books and papers He declared that his motive was hatred of the Faith which had caused the ruin of the Hurons Memoires touchant la Mort et les Vertus des Peres et cetera MS The priest had prepared himself for a worse fate Before leaving Sainte Marie on the Wye to go to his post in the Tobacco Nation he had written to his brother to regard him as a victim destined to the fires of the Iroquois Abrege de la Vie du P Noel Chabanel MS He added that though he was naturally timid he was now wholly indifferent to danger and he expressed the belief that only a superhuman power could have wrought such a change in him Ie suis fort apprehensif de mon naturel toutefois maintenant que ie vay au plus grand danger et qu il me semble que la mort n est pas esloignee ie ne sens plus de crainte Cette disposition ne vient pas de moy Relation des Hurons sixteen fifty eighteen The following is the vow made by Chabanel at a time when his disgust at the Indian mode of life beset him with temptations to ask to be recalled from the mission It is translated from the Latin original My Lord Jesus Christ who in the admirable disposition of thy paternal providence hast willed that I although most unworthy should be a company laborer with the holy Apostles in this vineyard of the Hurons I Noel Chabanel impelled by the desire of fulfilling thy holy will in advancing the conversion of the savages of this land to thy faith do vow in the presence of the most holy sacrament of thy precious body and blood which is God s tabernacle among men to remain perpetually attached to this mission of the Hurons understanding all things according to the interpretation and disposal of the Superiors of the Society of Jesus Therefore I entreat thee to receive me as the perpetual servant of this mission and to render me worthy of so sublime a ministry Amen This twentieth day of June sixteen forty seven Garreau and Grelon in their mission of saint Matthias were exposed to other dangers than those of the Iroquois A report was spread not only that they were magicians but that they had a secret understanding with the enemy A nocturnal council was called and their death was decreed In the morning a furious crowd gathered before a lodge which they were about to enter screeching and yelling after the manner of Indians when they compel a prisoner to run the gantlet The two priests giving no sign of fear passed through the crowd and entered the lodge unharmed Hatchets were brandished over them but no one would be the first to strike Their converts were amazed at their escape and they themselves ascribed it to the interposition of a protecting Providence The Huron missionaries were doubly in danger not more from the Iroquois than from

4335_15081_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Their scouts came in and reported that they had found fresh footprints of men in the forest 
4335_15081_000013_000002	train-clean-360	These proved however to be the tracks not of enemies but of friends 
none	none	In the preceding autumn Bressani had gone down to the French settlements with about twenty Hurons and was now returning with them and twice their number of armed Frenchmen for the defence of the mission His scouts had also been alarmed by discovering the footprints of Ragueneau s Indians and for some time the two parties stood on their guard each taking the other for an enemy When at length they discovered their mistake they met with embraces and rejoicing Bressani and his Frenchmen had come too late All was over with the Hurons and the Huron mission and as it was useless to go farther they joined Ragueneau s party and retraced their course for the settlements A day or two before they had had a sharp taste of the mettle of the enemy Ten Iroquois warriors had spent the winter in a little fort of felled trees on the borders of the Ottawa hunting for subsistence and waiting to waylay some passing canoe of Hurons Algonquins or Frenchmen 
4335_15081_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Bressani s party outnumbered them six to one but they resolved that it should not pass without a token of their presence Late on a dark night the French and Hurons lay encamped in the forest sleeping about their fires 
4335_15081_000014_000003	train-clean-360	They had set guards but these it seems were drowsy or negligent for the ten Iroquois watching their time approached with the stealth of lynxes and glided like shadows into the midst of the camp where by the dull glow of the smouldering fires they could distinguish the recumbent figures of their victims 
none	none	Suddenly they screeched the war whoop and struck like lightning with their hatchets among the sleepers Seven were killed before the rest could spring to their weapons Bressani leaped up and received on the instant three arrow wounds in the head 
4335_15081_000014_000007	train-clean-360	The Iroquois were surrounded and a desperate fight ensued in the dark

4335_15081_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The united parties soon after reached Montreal but the Hurons refused to remain in a spot so exposed to the Iroquois 
none	none	Accordingly they all descended the saint Lawrence and at length on the twenty eighth of July reached Quebec Here the Ursulines the hospital nuns and the inhabitants taxed their resources to the utmost to provide food and shelter for the exiled Hurons 
4335_15081_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Their good will exceeded their power for food was scarce at Quebec and the Jesuits themselves had to bear the chief burden of keeping the sufferers alive 
none	none	Compare Juchereau Histoire de l Hotel Dieu seventy nine eighty But if famine was an evil the Iroquois were a far greater one for while the western nations of their confederacy were engrossed with the destruction of the Hurons the Mohawks kept up incessant attacks on the Algonquins and the French 
4335_15081_000016_000001	train-clean-360	A party of Christian Indians chiefly from Sillery planned a stroke of retaliation and set out for the Mohawk country marching cautiously and sending forward scouts to scour the forest 
none	none	One of these a Huron suddenly fell in with a large Iroquois war party and seeing that he could not escape formed on the instant a villanous plan to save himself He ran towards the enemy crying out that he had long been looking for them and was delighted to see them that his nation the Hurons had come to an end and that henceforth his country was the country of the Iroquois where so many of his kinsmen and friends had been adopted 
4335_15081_000016_000004	train-clean-360	He had come he declared with no other thought than that of joining them and turning Iroquois as they had done

4335_15081_000017_000000	train-clean-360	In the course of the summer the French at Three Rivers became aware that a band of Iroquois was prowling in the neighborhood and sixty men went out to meet them 
none	none	Far from retreating the Iroquois who were about twenty five in number got out of their canoes and took post waist deep in mud and water among the tall rushes at the margin of the river Here they fought stubbornly and kept all the Frenchmen at bay At length finding themselves hard pressed they entered their canoes again and paddled off The French rowed after them and soon became separated in the chase whereupon the Iroquois turned and made desperate fight with the foremost retreating again as soon as the others came up This they repeated several times and then made their escape after killing a number of the best French soldiers Their leader in this affair was a famous half breed known as the Flemish Bastard who is styled by Ragueneau an abomination of sin and a monster produced between a heretic Dutch father and a pagan mother 
4335_15081_000018_000000	train-clean-360	In the forests far north of Three Rivers dwelt the tribe called the Atticamegues or Nation of the White Fish

4335_15082_000007_000004	train-clean-360	This brought them in contact with the Illinois an Algonquin people at that time very numerous but who like many other tribes at this epoch were doomed to a rapid diminution from wars with other savage nations 
none	none	Continuing their migration westward the Hurons and Ottawas reached the Mississippi where they fell in with the Sioux They soon quarrelled with those fierce children of the prairie who drove them from their country They retreated to the south western extremity of Lake Superior and settled on Point Saint Esprit or Shagwamigon Point near the Islands of the Twelve Apostles As the Sioux continued to harass them they left this place about the year sixteen seventy one and returned to Michilimackinac where they settled not on the island but on the neighboring Point saint Ignace now Graham s Point on the north side of the strait The greater part of them afterwards removed thence to Detroit and Sandusky where they lived under the name of Wyandots until within the present century maintaining a marked influence over the surrounding Algonquins They bore an active part on the side of the French in the war which ended in the reduction of Canada and they were the most formidable enemies of the English in the Indian war under Pontiac See History of the Conspiracy of Pontiac The government of the United States at length removed them to reserves on the western frontier where a remnant of them may still be found

4335_15082_000009_000005	train-clean-360	A Huron war chief named Etienne Annaotaha whose life is described as a succession of conflicts and adventures and who is said to have been always in luck landed with a few companions and fell into an ambuscade of the Iroquois

chapel was finished in the following year Compare Vie de Chaumonot with Dablon Relation sixteen seventy two seventy three p twenty one and Ibid Relation sixteen seventy three seventy nine p two hundred fifty nine But the Hurons were not destined to remain permanently even here for before the end of the century they removed to a place four miles distant now called New Lorette or Indian Lorette It was a wild spot covered with the primitive forest and seamed by a deep and tortuous ravine where the saint Charles foams white as a snow drift over the black ledges and where the sunlight struggles through matted boughs of the pine and fir to bask for brief moments on the mossy rocks or flash on the hurrying waters On a plateau beside the torrent another chapel was built to Our Lady and another Huron town sprang up and here to this day the tourist finds the remnant of a lost people harmless weavers of baskets and sewers of moccasins the Huron blood fast bleaching out of them as with every generation they mingle and fade away in the French population around An interesting account of a visit to Indian Lorette in seventeen twenty one will be found in the Journal Historique of

CHAPTER XXXIII sixteen fifty sixteen seventy THE DESTROYERS IROQUOIS AMBITION ITS VICTIMS THE FATE OF THE NEUTRALS THE FATE OF THE ERIES THE WAR WITH THE ANDASTES SUPREMACY OF THE IROQUOIS It was well for the European colonies above all for those of England that the wisdom of the Iroquois was but the wisdom of savages Their sagacity is past denying it showed itself in many ways but it was not equal to a comprehension of their own situation and that of their race Could they have read their destiny and curbed their mad ambition they might have leagued with themselves four great communities of kindred lineage to resist the encroachments of civilization and oppose a barrier of fire to the spread of the young colonies of the East But their organization and their intelligence were merely the instruments of a blind frenzy which impelled them to destroy those whom they might have made their allies in a common cause Of the four kindred communities two at least the Hurons and the Neutrals were probably superior in numbers to the Iroquois Either one of these with union and leadership could have held its ground against them and the two united could easily have crippled them beyond the power of doing mischief But these so called nations were mere aggregations of villages and families with nothing that deserved to be called a government They were very liable to panics because the part attacked by an enemy could never rely with confidence on prompt succor from the rest and when once broken they could not be rallied because they had no centre around which to gather The Iroquois on the other hand had an organization with which the ideas and habits of several generations were interwoven and they had also sagacious leaders for peace and war They discussed all questions of policy with the coolest deliberation and knew how to turn to profit even imperfections in their plan of government which seemed to promise only weakness and discord Thus any nation or any large town of their confederacy could make a separate war or a separate peace with a foreign nation or any part of it Some member of the league as for example the Cayugas would make a covenant of friendship with the enemy and while the infatuated victims were thus lulled into a delusive security the war parties of the other nations often joined by the Cayuga warriors would overwhelm them by a sudden onset But it was not by their craft nor by their organization which for military purposes was wretchedly feeble that this handful of savages gained a bloody supremacy They carried all before them because they were animated throughout as one man by the same audacious pride and insatiable rage for conquest Like other Indians they waged war on a plan altogether democratic that is each man fought or not as he saw fit and they owed their unity and vigor of action to the homicidal frenzy that urged them all alike The Neutral Nation had taken no part on either side in the war of extermination against the Hurons and their towns were sanctuaries where either of the contending parties might take asylum On the other hand they made fierce war on their western neighbors and a few years before destroyed with atrocious cruelties a large fortified town of the Nation of Fire one Their turn was now come and their victims found fit avengers for no sooner were the Hurons broken up and dispersed than the Iroquois without waiting to take breath turned their fury on the Neutrals At the end of the autumn of sixteen fifty they assaulted and took one of their chief towns said to have contained at the time more than sixteen hundred men besides women and children and early in the following spring they took another town The slaughter was prodigious and the victors drove back troops of captives for butchery or adoption It was the death blow of the Neutrals They abandoned their corn fields and villages in the wildest terror and dispersed themselves abroad in forests which could not yield sustenance to such a multitude They perished by thousands and from that time forth the nation ceased to exist two one Last summer writes Lalemant in sixteen forty three two thousand warriors of the Neutral Nation attacked a town of the Nation of Fire well fortified with a palisade and defended by nine hundred warriors They took it after a siege of ten days killed many on the spot and made eight hundred prisoners men women and children After burning seventy of the best warriors they put out the eyes of the old men and cut away their lips and then left them to drag out a miserable existence Behold the scourge that is depopulating all this country Relation des Hurons sixteen forty four ninety eight The Assistaeronnons Atsistaehonnons Mascoutins or Nation of Fire more correctly perhaps Nation of the Prairie were a very numerous Algonquin people of the West speaking the same language as the Sacs and Foxes In the map of Sanson they are placed in the southern part of Michigan and according to the Relation of sixteen fifty eight they had thirty towns They were a stationary and in some measure an agricultural people They fled before their enemies to the neighborhood of Fox River in Wisconsin where they long remained Frequent mention of them will be found in the later Relations and in contemporary documents They are now extinct as a tribe two Ragueneau Relation sixteen fifty one four In the unpublished journal kept by the Superior of the Jesuits at Quebec it is said under date of April sixteen fifty one that news had just come from Montreal that in the preceding autumn fifteen hundred Iroquois had taken a Neutral town that the Neutrals had afterwards attacked them and killed two hundred of their warriors and that twelve hundred Iroquois had again invaded the Neutral country to take their revenge Lafitau Moeurs des Sauvaqes II one hundred seventy six gives on the authority of Father Julien Garnier a singular and improbable account of the origin of the war An old chief named Kenjockety who claimed descent from an adopted prisoner of the Neutral Nation was recently living among the Senecas of Western New York During two or three succeeding years the Iroquois contented themselves with harassing the French and Algonquins but in sixteen fifty three they made treaties of peace each of the five nations for itself and the colonists and their red allies had an interval of rest In the following May an Onondaga orator on a peace visit to Montreal said in a speech to the Governor Our young men will no more fight the French but they are too warlike to stay at home and this summer we shall invade the country of the Eries The earth trembles and quakes in that quarter but here all remains calm Le Mercier Relation sixteen fifty four nine Early in the autumn Father Le Moyne who had taken advantage of the peace to go on a mission to the Onondagas returned with the tidings that the Iroquois were all on fire with this new enterprise and were about to march against the Eries with eighteen hundred warriors Le Mercier Relation sixteen fifty four ten Le Moyne in his interesting journal of his mission repeatedly alludes to their preparations The occasion of this new war is said to have been as follows The Eries who it will be remembered dwelt on the south of the lake named after them had made a treaty of peace with the Senecas and in the preceding year had sent a deputation of thirty of their principal men to confirm it While they were in the great Seneca town it happened that one of that nation was killed in a casual quarrel with an Erie whereupon his countrymen rose in a fury and murdered the thirty deputies Then ensued a brisk war of reprisals in which not only the Senecas but the other Iroquois nations took part The Eries captured a famous Onondaga chief and were about to burn him when he succeeded in convincing them of the wisdom of a course of conciliation and they resolved to give him to the sister of one of the murdered deputies to take the place of her lost brother The sister by Indian law had it in her choice to receive him with a fraternal embrace or to burn him but though she was absent at the time no one doubted that she would choose the gentler alternative Accordingly he was clothed in gay attire and all the town fell to feasting in honor of his adoption In the midst of the festivity the sister returned To the amazement of the Erie chiefs she rejected with indignation their proffer of a new brother declared that she would be revenged for her loss and insisted that the prisoner should forthwith be burned The chiefs remonstrated in vain representing the danger in which such a procedure would involve the nation the female fury was inexorable and the unfortunate prisoner stripped of his festal robes was bound to the stake and put to death De Quen Relation sixteen fifty six thirty He warned his tormentors with his last breath that they were burning not only him but the whole Erie nation since his countrymen would take a fiery vengeance for his fate His words proved true for no sooner was his story spread abroad among the Iroquois than the confederacy resounded with war songs from end to end and the warriors took the field under their two great war chiefs Notwithstanding Le Moyne s report their number according to the Iroquois account did not exceed twelve hundred This was their statement to Chaumonot and Dablon at Onondaga in November of this year They added that the number of the Eries was between three and four thousand Journal des PP Chaumonot et Dablon in Relation sixteen fifty six eighteen In the narrative of De Quen Ibid thirty thirty one based of course on Iroquois reports the Iroquois force is also set down at twelve hundred but that of the Eries is reduced to between two and three thousand warriors Even this may safely be taken as an exaggeration Though the Eries had no fire arms they used poisoned arrows with great effect discharging them it is said with surprising rapidity They embarked in canoes on the lake At their approach the Eries fell back withdrawing into the forests towards the west till they were gathered into one body when fortifying themselves with palisades and felled trees they awaited the approach of the invaders By the lowest estimate the Eries numbered two thousand warriors besides women and children But this is the report of the Iroquois who were naturally disposed to exaggerate the force of their enemies They approached the Erie fort and two of their chiefs dressed like Frenchmen advanced and called on those within to surrender One of them had lately been baptized by Le Moyne and he shouted to the Eries that if they did not yield in time they were all dead men for the Master of Life was on the side of the Iroquois The Eries answered with yells of derision Who is this master of your lives they cried our hatchets and our right arms are the masters of ours The Iroquois rushed to the assault but were met with a shower of poisoned arrows which killed and wounded many of them and drove the rest back They waited awhile and then attacked again with unabated mettle This time they carried their bark canoes over their heads like huge shields to protect them from the storm of arrows then planting them upright and mounting them by the cross bars like ladders scaled the barricade with such impetuous fury that the Eries were thrown into a panic Those escaped who could but the butchery was frightful and from that day the Eries as a nation were no more The victors paid dear for their conquest Their losses were so heavy that they were forced to remain for two months in the Erie country to bury their dead and nurse their wounded De Quen Relation sixteen fifty six thirty one The Iroquois it seems afterwards made other expeditions to finish their work At least they told Chaumonot and Dablon in the autumn of this year that they meant to do so in the following spring It seems that before attacking the great fort of the Eries the Iroquois had made a promise to worship the new God of the French if He would give them the victory This promise and the success which followed proved of great advantage to the mission Various traditions are extant among the modern remnant of the Iroquois concerning the war with the Eries They agree in little beyond the fact of the existence and destruction of that people Indeed Indian traditions are very rarely of any value as historical evidence One of these stories told me some years ago by a very intelligent Iroquois of the Cayuga Nation is a striking illustration of Iroquois ferocity It represents that the night after the great battle the forest was lighted up with more than a thousand fires at each of which an Erie was burning alive It differs from the historical accounts in making the Eries the aggressors One enemy of their own race remained the Andastes This nation appears to have been inferior in numbers to either the Hurons the Neutrals or the Eries but they cost their assailants more trouble than all these united The Mohawks seem at first to have borne the brunt of the Andaste war and between the years sixteen fifty and sixteen sixty they were so roughly handled by these stubborn adversaries that they were reduced from the height of audacious insolence to the depths of dejection one The remaining four nations of the Iroquois league now took up the quarrel and fared scarcely better than the Mohawks In the spring of sixteen sixty two eight hundred of their warriors set out for the Andaste country to strike a decisive blow but when they reached the great town of their enemies they saw that they had received both aid and counsel from the neighboring Swedish colonists The town was fortified by a double palisade flanked by two bastions on which it is said several small pieces of cannon were mounted Clearly it was not to be carried by assault as the invaders had promised themselves Their only hope was in treachery and accordingly twenty five of their warriors gained entrance on pretence of settling the terms of a peace Here again ensued a grievous disappointment for the Andastes seized them all built high scaffolds visible from without and tortured them to death in sight of their countrymen who thereupon decamped in miserable discomfiture Lalemant Relation sixteen sixty three ten one Relation sixteen sixty six anonymous The Mohawks also suffered great reverses about this time at the hands of their Algonquin neighbors the Mohicans The Senecas by far the most numerous of the five Iroquois nations now found themselves attacked in turn and this too at a time when they were full of despondency at the ravages of the small pox The French reaped a profit from their misfortunes for the disheartened savages made them overtures of peace and begged that they would settle in their country teach them to fortify their towns supply them with arms and ammunition and bring black robes to show them the road to Heaven Lalemant Relation sixteen sixty four thirty three The Andaste war became a war of inroads and skirmishes under which the weaker party gradually wasted away though it sometimes won laurels at the expense of its adversary Thus in sixteen seventy two a party of twenty Senecas and forty Cayugas went against the Andastes They were at a considerable distance the one from the other the Cayugas being in advance when the Senecas were set upon by about sixty young Andastes of the class known as Burnt Knives or Soft Metals because as yet they had taken no scalps Indeed they are described as mere boys fifteen or sixteen years old They killed one of the Senecas captured another and put the rest to flight after which flushed with their victory they attacked the Cayugas with the utmost fury and routed them completely killing eight of them and wounding twice that number who as is reported by the Jesuit then in the Cayuga towns came home half dead with gashes of knives and hatchets Dablon Relation sixteen seventy two twenty four May God preserve the Andastes exclaims the Father and prosper their arms that the Iroquois may be humbled and we and our missions left in peace None but they he elsewhere adds can curb the pride of the Iroquois The only strength of the Andastes however was in their courage for at this time they were reduced to three hundred fighting men and about the year sixteen seventy five they were finally overborne by the Senecas Etat Present des Missions in Relations Inedites II forty four Relation sixteen seventy six two This is one of the Relations printed by mister Lenox Yet they were not wholly destroyed for a remnant of this valiant people continued to subsist under the name of Conestogas for nearly a century until in seventeen sixty three they were butchered as already mentioned by the white ruffians known as the Paxton Boys History of the Conspiracy of Pontiac Chap XXIV Compare Shea in Historical Magazine II two hundred ninety seven The bloody triumphs of the Iroquois were complete They had made a solitude and called it peace All the surrounding nations of their own lineage were conquered and broken up while neighboring Algonquin tribes were suffered to exist only on condition of paying a yearly tribute of wampum The confederacy remained a wedge thrust between the growing colonies of France and England But what was the state of the conquerors Their triumphs had cost them dear As early as the year sixteen sixty a writer evidently well informed reports that their entire force had been reduced to twenty two hundred warriors while of these not more than twelve hundred were of the true Iroquois stock The rest was a medley of adopted prisoners Hurons Neutrals Eries and Indians of various Algonquin tribes one Still their aggressive spirit was unsubdued These incorrigible warriors pushed their murderous raids to Hudson s Bay Lake Superior the Mississippi and the Tennessee they were the tyrants of all the intervening wilderness and they remained for more than half a century a terror and a scourge to the afflicted colonists of New France one Relation sixteen sixty six seven anonymous Le Jeune says Their victories have so depopulated their towns that there are more foreigners in them than natives At Onondaga there are Indians of seven different nations permanently established and among the Senecas of no less than eleven Relation sixteen fifty seven thirty four These were either adopted prisoners or Indians who had voluntarily joined the Iroquois to save themselves from their hostility They took no part in councils but were expected to join war parties though they were usually excused from fighting against their former countrymen The condition of female prisoners was little better than that of slaves and those to whom they were assigned often killed them on the slightest pique CHAPTER XXXIV THE END FAILURE OF THE JESUITS WHAT THEIR SUCCESS WOULD HAVE INVOLVED FUTURE OF THE MISSION With the fall of the Hurons fell the best hope of the Canadian mission They and the stable and populous communities around them had been the rude material from which the Jesuit would have formed his Christian empire in the wilderness but one by one these kindred peoples were uprooted and swept away while the neighboring Algonquins to whom they had been a bulwark were involved with them in a common ruin The land of promise was turned to a solitude and a desolation There was still work in hand it is true vast regions to explore and countless heathens to snatch from perdition but these for the most part were remote and scattered hordes from whose conversion it was vain to look for the same solid and decisive results
