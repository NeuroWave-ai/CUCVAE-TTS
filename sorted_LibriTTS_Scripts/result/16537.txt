INTRODUCTION In many parts of the country when the soil is disturbed arrow heads are found Now it is a great many years since arrow heads have been used and they were never used by the people who own the land in which they appear or by their ancestors To explain the presence of these roughly cut pieces of stone we must recall the weapons with which the Indians fought when Englishmen Frenchmen Dutchmen and Spaniards first came to this part of the world There may be no authentic history of Indians in the particular locality in which these old fashioned weapons come to light but their presence in the ground is the best kind of evidence that Indians once lived on these fields or were in the habit of hunting over them In many parts of the country these arrow heads are turned up in great numbers museums large and small are plentifully supplied with them and they form part of the record of the men who once lived here and of their ways of killing game and destroying their enemies Wherever there are arrow heads there have been Indians Among every people and in every language there are found stories superstitions traditions phrases which are not to be explained by the thoughts or ideas or beliefs of people now living and the same stories superstitions phrases are found among people as far apart as those of Norway and Australia The people of to day tell these stories or remember the superstitions or use the phrases without understanding where they came from or what they meant when first used As the ground in some sections is full of arrow heads that have been buried no one knows how many centuries so the poetry we read the music we hear the stories told us when we are children have come down from a time in the history of man so early that there are in many cases no other records or remains of it These stories vary greatly in details they fit every climate and wear the peculiar dress of every country but it is easy to see that they are made up of the same materials and that they describe the same persons or ideas or things whether they are told in Greece or India or Norway or Brittany Wherever they are found they make it certain that they come from a very remote time and grew out of ideas or feelings and ways of looking at the world which a great many men shared in common in many places When a man sneezes people still say in some countries God bless you They do not know why they say it they simply repeat what they heard older people say when they were children and do not know that every time they use these words they recall the age when people believed that evil spirits could enter into a man and that when a man sneezed he expelled one of these spirits It is a very old and widely spread superstition that when a dog howls at night someone not far away is dying or will soon die Many people are uncomfortable when they hear a dog howling after dark not because they believe that dogs have any knowledge that death is present or coming but because their ancestors for many centuries believed that the howling of a dog was ominous and the habits of our ancestors leave deep traces in our natures Now every time the melancholy howling of a dog at night makes a child uncomfortable he recalls the old superstition which identified the roaring or wailing of the wind with a wolf or dog into which a god or demon had entered with power to summon the spirits of men to follow him as he rushed along in the darkness In the old homes in the forests thousands of years ago children crowded about the open fire and trembled when a great blast shook the house for fear that the gigantic beast who made the sound would call them and they would be compelled to follow him We think of wind as air in motion they thought of it as the breath and sound of some living creature When we say that the wind whistled in the keyhole or kissed the flowers or drove the clouds before it we are using poetically the language our forefathers used literally We speak of the siren voice of pleasure the blow of fate the smile of fortune and do not remember often do not know that we are recalling that remote past when people believed that there were Sirens on the coast of Crete whose voices were so sweet that sailors could not resist them and were drawn on to the rocks and drowned that fate was a terrible relentless passionless person with supreme power over gods and men that fortune was a being who smiled or frowned as men smile or frown but whose smile meant prosperity and her frown disaster There are few poems which have interested children more than Robert Browning s Pied Piper of Hamelin The story runs that long ago in the year twelve eighty four the old German town of Hamelin was so overrun with rats that there was no peace for the people living in it When things were at their worst a strange man appeared in the place and offered for a sum of money to clear it of these pests The bargain was made and the stranger began to pipe and straightway from every nook and corner in the old town the rats came in swarms followed him to the river Weser and jumped in and were drowned When the people found that the city was really free from rats they were ungrateful enough to say that the piper had used magic which was believed to be the practice of the evil spirit and refused to carry out their part of the contract The stranger went off in a great rage and threatened to come back again and take payment in his own way On saint John s Day which was a time of great festivity he suddenly reappeared blew a new and beguiling air on his pipe and immediately every child in the city felt as if a hand had seized him and ran pell mell after the musician as he climbed the mountain in which a door suddenly opened and through that door all save a lame boy passed and were never seen again From this old story probably came the proverb about paying the piper and it is one of many stories which turn on the magical power of a voice or a sound to draw men women and children to their doom These very interesting stories are not like the stories which are made up just to please people and help them pass away the time they are different forms of one story the story of the wind told by people who thought that the wind was not what we call a force but a person and that when he called those who heard must follow if he chose for the piper is no other than the wind and the ancients held that in the wind were the souls of the dead If every time we think of a force we should think of a person we should see the world as the men and women who made the myths saw it Everything that moved or made a sound or flashed out light or gave out heat was a person to them they could not think of the wind rushing through the trees or the storm devastating the fields without out imagining someone like themselves only more powerful behind the uproar and destruction any more than we can see a lantern moving along the road at night without thinking instinctively that somebody is carrying it Our idea of the world is scientific because it is based on exact though by no means complete knowledge the myth makers idea of the world was poetic because with very incomplete knowledge they could not imagine how anything could be done unless it was done as they did things When the black clouds gather on a summer afternoon and roll up the sky in great terrifying masses and the lightning flashes from them and the crash of the thunder fills the air and the rain beats down the crops we feel as if we were in the laboratory of nature seeing a wonderful experiment made when our ancestors saw the same spectacle they were sure that a great dragon breathing fire and roaring with anger was ravaging the earth As children to day imagine that dolls are alive that fairies dance in moonlit meadows on summer nights or beasts or Indians make the sounds in the woods so the people who made the myths filled the world with creatures unlike themselves but with something of human intelligence feeling and will As imaginative children personify the sounds they hear so the men and women of an early time personified everything that lived or moved or gave any sign of life They filled the earth air and sea with imaginary beings who had power over the elements and affected the lives of men There were nymphs in the sea dryads in the trees kindly or destructive spirits in the air household gods who watched over the home and greater gods who managed the affairs of the world When an intelligent man finds himself in new surroundings he begins at once to study them and try to understand them In every age this has been one of the greatest objects of interest to men and every generation has endeavoured to explain the world so as to satisfy not only its curiosity but its reason The myths were explanations of the world created by people who had not had time to study that world closely nor to train themselves to study it in a scientific way They saw the world with their imaginations quite as much as with their eyes and as they put persons behind every kind and form of life they told stories about the world instead of making accurate and matter of fact reports of it The change of the seasons is not at all mysterious to us but to the Norsemen it was a wonderful struggle between gods and giants In the summer the gods had their triumph but in the winter the giants had their way Year after year and century after century this terrible warfare went on until a day should come when in a last great battle both gods and giants would be destroyed and a new heaven and earth arise These same brave and warlike men believed that the most powerful fighter among the gods was Thor and that it was the swinging and crashing of his terrible hammer which made the lightning and thunder The sun which vanquished the darkness put out the stars drove the cold to the far north called back the flowers made the fields fertile awoke men from sleep and filled them with courage and hope was the centre of mythology and appears and reappears in a thousand stories in many parts of the world and in all kinds of disguises Now he is the most beautiful and noble of the Greek gods Apollo now he is Odin with a single eye now he is Hercules the hero with his twelve great labours for the good of men now he is Oedipus who met the Sphinx and solved her riddle In the early times men saw how everything in the world about them drew its strength and beauty from the sun how the sun warmed the earth and made the crops grow how it brought gladness and hope and inspiration to men and they made it the centre of the great world story the foremost hero of the great world play For the myths form a poetical explanation of the earth the sea the sky and of the life of man in this wonderful universe and each great myth was a chapter in a story which endowed day and night summer and winter sun moon stars winds clouds fire with life and made them actors in the mysterious drama of the world Our Norse forefathers thought of themselves always as looking on at a terrible fight between the gods who were light and heat and fruitfulness revealed in the beauty of day and the splendour of summer and the giants who were darkness cold and barrenness revealed in the gloom of night and the desolation of winter To the Norseman as to the Greek the Roman the Hindu and other primitive peoples the world was the scene of a great struggle the stage on which gods demons and heroes were contending for supremacy and they told that story in a thousand different ways Every myth is a chapter in that story and differs from other stories and legends because it is an explanation of something that happened in earth sea or sky If the men who created the myths had set to work to make wonder tales as stories are sometimes made to instruct while they entertain children they would have left a mass of very dull tales which few people would have cared to read They had no idea of doing anything so artificial and mechanical they made these old stories because all life was a story to them full of splendid or terrible figures moving across the sky or through the sea and in the depths of the woods and whichever way they looked they saw or thought they saw mysterious and wonderful things going on They were as much interested in their world as we are in ours we write hundreds of scientific books every year to explain our world they told hundreds of stories every year to explain theirs This selection represents the work of several authors and does not therefore preserve uniformity of style It is probably better for the young reader that the Greek Myths should come from one hand and the Norse Myths from another The classical work of Hawthorne has been generously drawn upon No change of any kind has been made in the text but the introductions connecting one myth with another have been omitted HAMILTON WRIGHT MABIE Myths That Every Child Should Know CHAPTER I THE THREE GOLDEN APPLES Did you ever hear of the golden apples that grew in the garden of the Hesperides Ah those were such apples as would bring a great price by the bushel if any of them could be found growing in the orchards of nowadays But there is not I suppose a graft of that wonderful fruit on a single tree in the wide world Not so much as a seed of those apples exists any longer And even in the old old half forgotten times before the garden of the Hesperides was overrun with weeds a great many people doubted whether there could be real trees that bore apples of solid gold upon their branches All had heard of them but nobody remembered to have seen any Children nevertheless used to listen open mouthed to stories of the golden apple tree and resolved to discover it when they should be big enough Adventurous young men who desired to do a braver thing than any of their fellows set out in quest of this fruit Many of them returned no more none of them brought back the apples No wonder that they found it impossible to gather them It is said that there was a dragon beneath the tree with a hundred terrible heads fifty of which were always on the watch while the other fifty slept In my opinion it was hardly worth running so much risk for the sake of a solid golden apple Had the apples been sweet mellow and juicy indeed that would be another matter There might then have been some sense in trying to get at them in spite of the hundred headed dragon But as I have already told you it was quite a common thing with young persons when tired of too much peace and rest to go in search of the garden of the Hesperides And once the adventure was undertaken by a hero who had enjoyed very little peace or rest since he came into the world At the time of which I am going to speak he was wandering through the pleasant land of Italy with a mighty club in his hand and a bow and quiver slung across his shoulders He was wrapt in the skin of the biggest and fiercest lion that ever had been seen and which he himself had killed and though on the whole he was kind and generous and noble there was a good deal of the lion s fierceness in his heart As he went on his way he continually inquired whether that were the right road to the famous garden But none of the country people knew anything about the matter and many looked as if they would have laughed at the question if the stranger had not carried so very big a club So he journeyed on and on still making the same inquiry until at last he came to the brink of a river where some beautiful young women sat twining wreaths of flowers Can you tell me pretty maidens asked the stranger whether this is the right way to the garden of the Hesperides The young women had been having a fine time together weaving the flowers into wreaths and crowning one another s heads And there seemed to be a kind of magic in the touch of their fingers that made the flowers more fresh and dewy and of brighter hues and sweeter fragrance while they played with them than even when they had been growing on their native stems But on hearing the stranger s question they dropped all their flowers on the grass and gazed at him with astonishment The garden of the Hesperides cried one We thought mortals had been weary of seeking it after so many disappointments And pray adventurous traveller what do you want there A certain king who is my cousin replied he has ordered me to get him three of the golden apples Most of the young men who go in quest of these apples observed another of the damsels desire to obtain them for themselves or to present them to some fair maiden whom they love Do you then love this king your cousin so very much Perhaps not replied the stranger sighing He has often been severe and cruel to me But it is my destiny to obey him And do you know asked the damsel who had first spoken that a terrible dragon with a hundred heads keeps watch under the golden apple tree I know it well answered the stranger calmly But from my cradle upward it has been my business and almost my pastime to deal with serpents and dragons The young women looked at his massive club and at the shaggy lion s skin which he wore and likewise at his heroic limbs and figure and they whispered to each other that the stranger appeared to be one who might reasonably expect to perform deeds far beyond the might of other men But then the dragon with a hundred heads What mortal even if he possessed a hundred lives could hope to escape the fangs of such a monster So kind hearted were the maidens that they could not bear to see this brave and handsome traveller attempt what was so very dangerous and devote himself most probably to become a meal for the dragon s hundred ravenous mouths Go back cried they all go back to your own home Your mother beholding you safe and sound will shed tears of joy and what can she do more should you win ever so great a victory No matter for the golden apples No matter for the king your cruel cousin We do not wish the dragon with the hundred heads to eat you up The stranger seemed to grow impatient at these remonstrances He carelessly lifted his mighty club and let it fall upon a rock that lay half buried in the earth near by With the force of that idle blow the great rock was shattered all to pieces It cost the stranger no more effort to achieve this feat of a giant s strength than for one of the young maidens to touch her sister s rosy cheek with a flower Do you not believe said he looking at the damsels with a smile that such a blow would have crushed one of the dragon s hundred heads Then he sat down on the grass and told them the story of his life or as much of it as he could remember from the day when he was first cradled in a warrior s brazen shield While he lay there two immense serpents came gliding over the floor and opened their hideous jaws to devour him and he a baby of a few months old had griped one of the fierce snakes in each of his little fists and strangled them to death When he was but a stripling he had killed a huge lion almost as big as the one whose vast and shaggy hide he now wore upon his shoulders The next thing that he had done was to fight a battle with an ugly sort of monster called a hydra which had no less than nine heads and exceedingly sharp teeth in every one But the dragon of the Hesperides you know observed one of the damsels has a hundred heads Nevertheless replied the stranger I would rather fight two such dragons than a single hydra For as fast as I cut off a head two others grew in its place and besides there was one of the heads that could not possibly be killed but kept biting as fiercely as ever long after it was cut off So I was forced to bury it under a stone where it is doubtless alive to this very day But the hydra s body and its eight other heads will never do any further mischief The damsels judging that the story was likely to last a good while had been preparing a repast of bread and grapes that the stranger might refresh himself in the intervals of his talk They took pleasure in helping him to this simple food and now and then one of them would put a sweet grape between her rosy lips lest it should make him bashful to eat alone The traveller proceeded to tell how he had chased a very swift stag for a twelvemonth together without ever stopping to take breath and had at last caught it by the antlers and carried it home alive And he had fought with a very odd race of people half horses and half men and had put them all to death from a sense of duty in order that their ugly figures might never be seen any more Besides all this he took to himself great credit for having cleaned out a stable Do you call that a wonderful exploit asked one of the young maidens with a smile Any clown in the country has done as much Had it been an ordinary stable replied the stranger I should not have mentioned it But this was so gigantic a task that it would have taken me all my life to perform it if I had not luckily thought of turning the channel of a river through the stable door That did the business in a very short time Seeing how earnestly his fair auditors listened he next told them how he had shot some monstrous birds and had caught a wild bull alive and let him go again and had tamed a number of very wild horses and had conquered Hippolyta the warlike queen of the Amazons He mentioned likewise that he had taken off Hippolyta s enchanted girdle and had given it to the daughter of his cousin the king Was it the girdle of Venus inquired the prettiest of the damsels which makes women beautiful No answered the stranger It had formerly been the sword belt of Mars and it can only make the wearer valiant and courageous An old sword belt cried the damsel tossing her head Then I should not care about having it You are right said the stranger Going on with his wonderful narrative he informed the maidens that as strange an adventure as ever happened was when he fought with Geryon the six legged man This was a very odd and frightful sort of figure as you may well believe Any person looking at his tracks in the sand or snow would suppose that three sociable companions had been walking along together On hearing his footsteps at a little distance it was no more than reasonable to judge that several people must be coming But it was only the strange man Geryon clattering onward with his six legs Six legs and one gigantic body Certainly he must have been a very queer monster to look at and my stars what a waste of shoe leather When the stranger had finished the story of his adventures he looked around at the attentive faces of the maidens Perhaps you may have heard of me before said he modestly My name is Hercules We had already guessed it replied the maidens for your wonderful deeds are known all over the world We do not think it strange any longer that you should set out in quest of the golden apples of the Hesperides Come sisters let us crown the hero with flowers Then they flung beautiful wreaths over his stately head and mighty shoulders so that the lion s skin was almost entirely covered with roses They took possession of his ponderous club and so entwined it about with the brightest softest and most fragrant blossoms that not a finger s breadth of its oaken substance could be seen It looked all like a huge bunch of flowers Lastly they joined hands and danced around him chanting words which became poetry of their own accord and grew into a choral song in honour of the illustrious Hercules And Hercules was rejoiced as any other hero would have been to know that these fair young girls had heard of the valiant deeds which it had cost him so much toil and danger to achieve But still he was not satisfied He could not think that what he had already done was worthy of so much honour while there remained any bold or difficult adventure to be undertaken Dear maidens said he when they paused to take breath now that you know my name will you not tell me how I am to reach the garden of the Hesperides Ah must you go to soon they exclaimed You that have performed so many wonders and spent such a toilsome life cannot you content yourself to repose a little while on the margin of this peaceful river Hercules shook his head I must depart now said he We will then give you the best directions we can replied the damsels You must go to the seashore and find out the Old One and compel him to inform you where the golden apples are to be found The Old One repeated Hercules laughing at this odd name And pray who may the Old One be Why the Old Man of the Sea to be sure answered one of the damsels He has fifty daughters whom some people call very beautiful but we do not think it proper to be acquainted with them because they have sea green hair and taper away like fishes You must talk with this Old Man of the Sea He is a seafaring person and knows all about the garden of the Hesperides for it is situated in an island which he is often in the habit of visiting Hercules then asked whereabouts the Old One was most likely to be met with When the damsels had informed him he thanked them for all their kindness for the bread and grapes with which they had fed him the lovely flowers with which they had crowned him and the songs and dances wherewith they had done him honour and he thanked them most of all for telling him the right way and immediately set forth upon his journey But before he was out of hearing one of the maidens called after him Keep fast hold of the Old One when you catch him cried she smiling and lifting her finger to make the caution more impressive Do not be astonished at anything that may happen Only hold him fast and he will tell you what you wish to know Hercules again thanked her and pursued his way while the maidens resumed their pleasant labour of making flower wreaths They talked about the hero long after he was gone We will crown him with the loveliest of our garlands said they when he returns hither with the three golden apples after slaying the dragon with a hundred heads Meanwhile Hercules travelled constantly onward over hill and dale and through the solitary woods Sometimes he swung his club aloft and splintered a mighty oak with a downright blow His mind was so full of the giants and monsters with whom it was the business of his life to fight that perhaps he mistook the great tree for a giant or a monster And so eager was Hercules to achieve what he had undertaken that he almost regretted to have spent so much time with the damsels wasting idle breath upon the story of his adventures But thus it always is with persons who are destined to perform great things What they have already done seems less than nothing What they have taken in hand to do seems worth toil danger and life itself Persons who happened to be passing through the forest must have been affrighted to see him smite the trees with his great club With but a single blow the trunk was riven as by the stroke of lightning and the broad boughs came rustling and crashing down Hastening forward without ever pausing or looking behind he by and by heard the sea roaring at a distance At this sound he increased his speed and soon came to a beach where the great surf waves tumbled themselves upon the hard sand in a long line of snowy foam At one end of the beach however there was a pleasant spot where some green shrubbery clambered up a cliff making its rocky face look soft and beautiful A carpet of verdant grass largely intermixed with sweet smelling clover covered the narrow space between the bottom of the cliff and the sea And what should Hercules espy there but an old man fast asleep But was it really and truly an old man Certainly at first sight it looked very like one but on closer inspection it rather seemed to be some kind of a creature that lived in the sea For on his legs and arms there were scales such as fishes have he was web footed and web fingered after the fashion of a duck and his long beard being of a greenish tinge had more the appearance of a tuft of seaweed than of an ordinary beard Have you never seen a stick of timber that has been long tossed about by the waves and has got all overgrown with barnacles and at last drifting ashore seems to have been thrown up from the very deepest bottom of the sea Well the old man would have put you in mind of just such a wave tossed spar But Hercules the instant he set eyes on this strange figure was convinced that it could be no other than the Old One who was to direct him on his way Yes it was the selfsame Old Man of the Sea whom the hospitable maidens had talked to him about Thanking his stars for the lucky accident of finding the old fellow asleep Hercules stole on tiptoe toward him and caught him by the arm and leg Tell me cried he before the Old One was well awake which is the way to the garden of the Hesperides As you may easily imagine the Old Man of the Sea awoke in a fright But his astonishment could hardly have been greater than was that of Hercules the next moment For all of a sudden the Old One seemed to disappear out of his grasp and he found himself holding a stag by the fore and hind leg But still he kept fast hold Then the stag disappeared and in its stead there was a sea bird fluttering and screaming while Hercules clutched it by the wing and claw But the bird could not get away Immediately afterward there was an ugly three headed dog which growled and barked at Hercules and snapped fiercely at the hands by which he held him But Hercules would not let him go In another minute instead of the three headed dog what should appear but Geryon the six legged man monster kicking at Hercules with five of his legs in order to get the remaining one at liberty But Hercules held on By and by no Geryon was there but a huge snake like one of those which Hercules had strangled in his babyhood only a hundred times as big and it twisted and twined about the hero s neck and body and threw its tail high into the air and opened its deadly jaws as if to devour him outright so that it was really a very terrible spectacle But Hercules was no whit disheartened and squeezed the great snake so tightly that he soon began to hiss with pain You must understand that the Old Man of the Sea though he generally looked so much like the wave beaten figurehead of a vessel had the power of assuming any shape he pleased When he found himself so roughly seized by Hercules he had been in hopes of putting him into such surprise and terror by these magical transformations that the hero would be glad to let him go If Hercules had relaxed his grasp the Old One would certainly have plunged down to the very bottom of the sea whence he would not soon have given himself the trouble of coming up in order to answer any impertinent questions Ninety nine people out of a hundred I suppose would have been frightened out of their wits by the very first of his ugly shapes and would have taken to their heels at once For one of the hardest things in this world is to see the difference between real dangers and imaginary ones But as Hercules held on so stubbornly and only squeezed the Old One so much the tighter at every change of shape and really put him to no small torture he finally thought it best to reappear in his own figure So there he was again a fishy scaly web footed sort of personage with something like a tuft of seaweed at his chin Pray what do you want with me cried the Old One as soon as he could take breath for it is quite a tiresome affair to go through so many false shapes Why do you squeeze me so hard Let me go this moment or I shall begin to consider you an extremely uncivil person My name is Hercules roared the mighty stranger And you will never get out of my clutch until you tell me the nearest way to the garden of the Hesperides When the old fellow heard who it was that had caught him he saw with half an eye that it would be necessary to tell him everything that he wanted to know The Old One was an inhabitant of the sea you must recollect and roamed about everywhere like other seafaring people Of course he had often heard of the fame of Hercules and of the wonderful things that he was constantly performing in various parts of the earth and how determined he always was to accomplish whatever he undertook He therefore made no more attempts to escape but told the hero how to find the garden of the Hesperides and likewise warned him of many difficulties which must be overcome before he could arrive thither You must go on thus and thus said the Old Man of the Sea after taking the points of the compass till you come in sight of a very tall giant who holds the sky on his shoulders And the giant if he happens to be in the humour will tell you exactly where the garden of the Hesperides lies And if the giant happens not to be in the humour remarked Hercules balancing his club on the tip of his finger perhaps I shall find means to persuade him Thanking the Old Man of the Sea and begging his pardon for having squeezed him so roughly the hero resumed his journey He met with a great many strange adventures which would be well worth your hearing if I had leisure to narrate them as minutely as they deserve It was in this journey if I mistake not that he encountered a prodigious giant who was so wonderfully contrived by nature that every time he touched the earth he became ten times as strong as ever he had been before His name was Antaeus You may see plainly enough that it was a very difficult business to fight with such a fellow for as often as he got a knock down blow up he started again stronger fiercer and abler to use his weapons than if his enemy had let him alone Thus the harder Hercules pounded the giant with his club the further he seemed from winning the victory I have sometimes argued with such people but never fought with one The only way in which Hercules found it possible to finish the battle was by lifting Antaeus off his feet into the air and squeezing and squeezing and squeezing him until finally the strength was quite squeezed out of his enormous body When this affair was finished Hercules continued his travels and went to the land of Egypt where he was taken prisoner and would have been put to death if he had not slain the king of the country and made his escape Passing through the deserts of Africa and going as fast as he could he arrived at last on the shore of the great ocean And here unless he could walk on the crests of the billows it seemed as if his journey must needs be at an end Nothing was before him save the foaming dashing measureless ocean But suddenly as he looked toward the horizon he saw something a great way off which he had not seen the moment before It gleamed very brightly almost as you may have beheld the round golden disc of the sun when it rises or sets over the edge of the world It evidently drew nearer for at every instant this wonderful object became larger and more lustrous At length it had come so nigh that Hercules discovered it to be an immense cup or bowl made either of gold or burnished brass How it had got afloat upon the sea is more than I can tell you There it was at all events rolling on the tumultuous billows which tossed it up and down and heaved their foamy tops against its sides but without ever throwing their spray over the brim I have seen many giants in my time thought Hercules but never one that would need to drink his wine out of a cup like this And true enough what a cup it must have been It was as large as large but in short I am afraid to say how immeasurably large it was To speak within bounds it was ten times larger than a great mill wheel and all of metal as it was it floated over the heaving surges more lightly than an acorn cup adown the brook The waves tumbled it onward until it grazed against the shore within a short distance of the spot where Hercules was standing As soon as this happened he knew what was to be done for he had not gone through so many remarkable adventures without learning pretty well how to conduct himself whenever anything came to pass a little out of the common rule It was just as clear as daylight that this marvellous cup had been set adrift by some unseen power and guided hitherward in order to carry Hercules across the sea on his way to the garden of the Hesperides Accordingly without a moment s delay he clambered over the brim and slid down on the inside where spreading out his lion s skin he proceeded to take a little repose He had scarcely rested until now since he bade farewell to the damsels on the margin of the river The waves dashed with a pleasant and ringing sound against the circumference of the hollow cup it rocked lightly to and fro and the motion was so soothing that it speedily rocked Hercules into an agreeable slumber His nap had probably lasted a good while when the cup chanced to graze against a rock and in consequence immediately resounded and reverberated through its golden or brazen substance a hundred times as loudly as ever you heard a church bell The noise awoke Hercules who instantly started up and gazed around him wondering whereabouts he was He was not long in discovering that the cup had floated across a great part of the sea and was approaching the shore of what seemed to be an island And on that island what do you think he saw No you will never guess it not if you were to try fifty thousand times It positively appears to me that this was the most marvellous spectacle that had ever been seen by Hercules in the whole course of his wonderful travels and adventures It was a greater marvel than the hydra with nine heads which kept growing twice as fast as they were cut off greater than the six legged man monster greater than Antaeus greater than anything that was ever beheld by anybody before or since the days of Hercules or than anything that remains to be beheld by travellers in all time to come It was a giant But such an intolerably big giant A giant as tall as a mountain so vast a giant that the clouds rested about his midst like a girdle and hung like a hoary beard from his chin and flitted before his huge eyes so that he could neither see Hercules nor the golden cup in which he was voyaging And most wonderful of all the giant held up his great hands and appeared to support the sky which so far as Hercules could discern through the clouds was resting upon his head This does really seem almost too much to believe Meanwhile the bright cup continued to float onward and finally touched the strand Just then a breeze wafted away the clouds from before the giant s visage and Hercules beheld it with all its enormous features eyes each of them as big as yonder lake a nose a mile long and a mouth of the same width It was a countenance terrible from its enormity of size but disconsolate and weary even as you may see the faces of many people nowadays who are compelled to sustain burdens above their strength What the sky was to the giant such are the cares of earth to those who let themselves be weighed down by them And whenever men undertake what is beyond the just measure of their abilities they encounter precisely such a doom as had befallen this poor giant Poor fellow He had evidently stood there a long while An ancient forest had been growing and decaying around his feet and oak trees of six or seven centuries old had sprung from the acorn and forced themselves between his toes The giant now looked down from the far height of his great eyes and perceiving Hercules roared out in a voice that resembled thunder proceeding out of the cloud that had just flitted away from his face Who are you down at my feet there And whence do you come in that little cup I am Hercules thundered back the hero in a voice pretty nearly or quite as loud as the giant s own And I am seeking for the garden of the Hesperides Ho ho ho roared the giant in a fit of immense laughter That is a wise adventure truly And why not cried Hercules getting a little angry at the giant s mirth Do you think I am afraid of the dragon with a hundred heads Just at this time while they were talking together some black clouds gathered about the giant s middle and burst into a tremendous storm of thunder and lightning causing such a pother that Hercules found it impossible to distinguish a word Only the giant s immeasurable legs were to be seen standing up into the obscurity of the tempest and now and then a momentary glimpse of his whole figure mantled in a volume of mist He seemed to be speaking most of the time but his big deep rough voice chimed in with the reverberations of the thunder claps and rolled away over the hills like them Thus by talking out of season the foolish giant expended an incalculable quantity of breath to no purpose for the thunder spoke quite as intelligibly as he At last the storm swept over as suddenly as it had come And there again was the clear sky and the weary giant holding it up and the pleasant sunshine beaming over his vast height and illuminating it against the background of the sullen thunder clouds So far above the shower had been his head that not a hair of it was moistened by the rain drops When the giant could see Hercules still standing on the seashore he roared out to him anew I am Atlas the mightiest giant in the world And I hold the sky upon my head So I see answered Hercules But can you show me the way to the garden of the Hesperides What do you want there asked the giant I want three of the golden apples shouted Hercules for my cousin the king There is nobody but myself quoth the giant that can go to the garden of the Hesperides and gather the golden apples If it were not for this little business of holding up the sky I would make half a dozen steps across the sea and get them for you You are very kind replied Hercules And cannot you rest the sky upon a mountain None of them are quite high enough said Atlas shaking his head But if you were to take your stand on the summit of that nearest one your head would be pretty nearly on a level with mine You seem to be a fellow of some strength What if you should take my burden on your shoulders while I do your errand for you Hercules as you must be careful to remember was a remarkably strong man and though it certainly requires a great deal of muscular power to uphold the sky yet if any mortal could be supposed capable of such an exploit he was the one Nevertheless it seemed so difficult an undertaking that for the first time in his life he hesitated Is the sky very heavy he inquired Why not particularly so at first answered the giant shrugging his shoulders But it gets to be a little burdensome after a thousand years And how long a time asked the hero will it take you to get the golden apples Oh that will be done in a few moments cried Atlas I shall take ten or fifteen miles at a stride and be at the garden and back again before your shoulders begin to ache Well then answered Hercules I will climb the mountain behind you there and relieve you of your burden The truth is Hercules had a kind heart of his own and considered that he should be doing the giant a favour by allowing him this opportunity for a ramble And besides he thought that it would be still more for his own glory if he could boast of upholding the sky than merely to do so ordinary a thing as to conquer a dragon with a hundred heads Accordingly without more words the sky was shifted from the shoulders of Atlas and placed upon those of Hercules When this was safely accomplished the first thing that the giant did was to stretch himself and you may imagine what a prodigious spectacle he was then Next lie slowly lifted one of his feet out of the forest that had grown up around it then the other Then all at once he began to caper and leap and dance for joy at his freedom flinging himself nobody knows how high into the air and floundering down again with a shock that made the earth tremble Then he laughed Ho ho ho with a thunderous roar that was echoed from the mountains far and near as if they and the giant had been so many rejoicing brothers When his joy had a little subsided he stepped into the sea ten miles at the first stride which brought him midleg deep and ten miles at the second when the water came just above his knees and ten miles more at the third by which he was immersed nearly to his waist This was the greatest depth of the sea Hercules watched the giant as he still went onward for it was really a wonderful sight this immense human form more than thirty miles off half hidden in the ocean but with his upper half as tall and misty and blue as a distant mountain At last the gigantic shape faded entirely out of view And now Hercules began to consider what he should do in case Atlas should be drowned in the sea or if he were to be stung to death by the dragon with the hundred heads which guarded the golden apples of the Hesperides If any such misfortune were to happen how could he ever get rid of the sky And by the by its weight began already to be a little irksome to his head and shoulders I really pity the poor giant thought Hercules If it wearies me so much in ten minutes how must it have wearied him in a thousand years O my sweet little people you have no idea what a weight there was in that same blue sky which looks so soft and aerial above our heads And there too was the bluster of the wind and the chill and watery clouds and the blazing sun all taking their turns to make Hercules uncomfortable He began to be afraid that the giant would never come back He gazed wistfully at the world beneath him and acknowledged to himself that it was a far happier kind of life to be a shepherd at the foot of a mountain than to stand on its dizzy summit and bear up the firmament with his might and main For of course as you will easily understand Hercules had an immense responsibility on his mind as well as a weight on his head and shoulders Why if he did not stand perfectly still and keep the sky immovable the sun would perhaps be put ajar Or after nightfall a great many of the stars might be loosened from their places and shower down like fiery rain upon the people s heads And how ashamed would the hero be if owing to his unsteadiness beneath its weight the sky should crack and show a great fissure quite across it I know not how long it was before to his unspeakable joy he beheld the huge shape of the giant like a cloud on the far off edge of the sea At his nearer approach Atlas held up his hand in which Hercules could perceive three magnificent golden apples as big as pumpkins all hanging from one branch I am glad to see you again shouted Hercules when the giant was within hearing So you have got the golden apples Certainly certainly answered Atlas and very fair apples they are I took the finest that grew on the tree I assure you Ah it is a beautiful spot that garden of Hesperides Yes and the dragon with a hundred heads is a sight worth any man s seeing After all you had better have gone for the apples yourself No matter replied Hercules You have had a pleasant ramble and have done the business as well as I could I heartily thank you for your trouble And now as I have a long way to go and am rather in haste and as the king my cousin is anxious to receive the golden apples will you be kind enough to take the sky off my shoulders again Why as to that said the giant chucking the golden apples into the air twenty miles high or thereabouts and catching them as they came down as to that my good friend I consider you a little unreasonable Cannot I carry the golden apples to the king your cousin much quicker than you could As His Majesty is in such a hurry to get them I promise you to take my longest strides And besides I have no fancy for burdening myself with the sky just now Here Hercules grew impatient and gave a great shrug of his shoulders It being now twilight you might have seen two or three stars tumble out of their places Everybody on earth looked upward in affright thinking that the sky might be going to fall next Oh that will never do cried Giant Atlas with a great roar of laughter I have not let fall so many stars within the last five centuries By the time you have stood there as long as I did you will begin to learn patience What shouted Hercules very wrathfully do you intend to make me bear this burden forever We will see about that one of these days answered the giant At all events you ought not to complain if you have to bear it the next hundred years or perhaps the next thousand I bore it a good while longer in spite of the backache Well then after a thousand years if I happen to feel in the mood we may possibly shift about again You are certainly a very strong man and can never have a better opportunity to prove it Posterity will talk of you I warrant it Pish a fig for its talk cried Hercules with another hitch of his shoulders Just take the sky upon your head one instant will you I want to make a cushion of my lion s skin for the weight to rest upon It really chafes me and will cause unnecessary inconvenience in so many centuries as I am to stand here That s no more than fair and I ll do it quoth the giant for he had no unkind feeling toward Hercules and was merely acting with a too selfish consideration of his own ease For just five minutes then I ll take back the sky Only for five minutes recollect I have no idea of spending another thousand years as I spent the last Variety is the spice of life say I Ah the thick witted old rogue of a giant He threw down the golden apples and received back the sky from the head and shoulders of Hercules upon his own where it rightly belonged And Hercules picked up the three golden apples that were as big or bigger than pumpkins and straightway set out on his journey homeward without paying the slightest heed to the thundering tones of the giant who bellowed after him to come back Another forest sprang up around his feet and grew ancient there and again might be seen oak trees of six or seven centuries old that had waxed thus aged betwixt his enormous toes And there stands the giant to this day or at any rate there stands a mountain as tall as he and which bears his name and when the thunder rumbles about its summit we may imagine it to be the voice of Giant Atlas bellowing after Hercules CHAPTER II THE POMEGRANATE SEEDS Mother Ceres was exceedingly fond of her daughter Proserpina and seldom let her go alone into the fields But just at the time when my story begins the good lady was very busy because she had the care of the wheat and the Indian corn and the rye and barley and in short of the crops of every kind all over the earth and as the season had thus far been uncommonly backward it was necessary to make the harvest ripen more speedily than usual So she put on her turban made of poppies a kind of flower which she was always noted for wearing and got into her car drawn by a pair of winged dragons and was just ready to set off Dear mother said Proserpina I shall be very lonely while you are away May I not run down to the shore and ask some of the sea nymphs to come up out of the waves and play with me Yes child answered Mother Ceres The sea nymphs are good creatures and will never lead you into any harm But you must take care not to stray away from them nor go wandering about the fields by yourself Young girls without their mothers to take care of them are very apt to get into mischief The child promised to be as prudent as if she were a grown up woman and by the time the winged dragons had whirled the car out of sight she was already on the shore calling to the sea nymphs to come and play with her They knew Proserpina s voice and were not long in showing their glistening faces and sea green hair above the water at the bottom of which was their home They brought along with them a great many beautiful shells and sitting down on the moist sand where the surf wave broke over them they busied themselves in making a necklace which they hung round Proserpina s neck By way of showing her gratitude the child besought them to go with her a little way into the fields so that they might gather abundance of flowers with which she would make each of her kind playmates a wreath Oh no dear Proserpina cried the sea nymphs we dare not go with you upon the dry land We are apt to grow faint unless at every breath we can snuff up the salt breeze of the ocean And don t you see how careful we are to let the surf wave break over us every moment or two so as to keep ourselves comfortably moist If it were not for that we should soon look like bunches of uprooted seaweed dried in the sun It is a great pity said Proserpina But do you wait for me here and I will run and gather my apron full of flowers and be back again before the surf wave has broken ten times over you I long to make you some wreaths that shall be as lovely as this necklace of many coloured shells We will wait then answered the sea nymphs But while you are gone we may as well lie down on a bank of soft sponge under the water The air to day is a little too dry for our comfort But we will pop up our heads every few minutes to see if you are coming The young Proserpina ran quickly to a spot where only the day before she had seen a great many flowers These however were now a little past their bloom and wishing to give her friends the freshest and loveliest blossoms she strayed farther into the fields and found some that made her scream with delight Never had she met with such exquisite flowers before violets so large and fragrant roses with so rich and delicate a blush such superb hyacinths and such aromatic pinks and many others some of which seemed to be of new shapes and colours Two or three times moreover she could not help thinking that a tuft of most splendid flowers had suddenly sprouted out of the earth before her very eyes as if on purpose to tempt her a few steps farther Proserpina s apron was soon filled and brimming over with delightful blossoms She was on the point of turning back in order to rejoin the sea nymphs and sit with them on the moist sands all twining wreaths together But a little farther on what should she behold It was a large shrub completely covered with the most magnificent flowers in the world The darlings cried Proserpina and then she thought to herself I was looking at that spot only a moment ago How strange it is that I did not see the flowers The nearer she approached the shrub the more attractive it looked until she came quite close to it and then although its beauty was richer than words can tell she hardly knew whether to like it or not It bore above a hundred flowers of the most brilliant hues and each different from the others but all having a kind of resemblance among themselves which showed them to be sister blossoms But there was a deep glossy lustre on the leaves of the shrub and on the petals of the flowers that made Proserpina doubt whether they might not be poisonous To tell you the truth foolish as it may seem she was half inclined to turn round and run away What a silly child I am thought she taking courage It is really the most beautiful shrub that ever sprang out of the earth I will pull it up by the roots and carry it home and plant it in my mother s garden Holding up her apron full of flowers with her left hand Proserpina seized the large shrub with the other and pulled and pulled but was hardly able to loosen the soil about its roots What a deep rooted plant it was Again the girl pulled with all her might and observed that the earth began to stir and crack to some distance around the stem She gave another pull but relaxed her hold fancying that there was a rumbling sound right beneath her feet Did the roots extend down into some enchanted cavern Then laughing at herself for so childish a notion she made another effort up came the shrub and Proserpina staggered back holding the stem triumphantly in her hand and gazing at the deep hole which its roots had left in the soil Much to her astonishment this hole kept spreading wider and wider and growing deeper and deeper until it really seemed to have no bottom and all the while there came a rumbling noise out of its depths louder and louder and nearer and nearer and sounding like the tramp of horses hoofs and the rattling of wheels Too much frightened to run away she stood straining her eyes into this wonderful cavity and soon saw a team of four sable horses snorting smoke out of their nostrils and tearing their way out of the earth with a splendid golden chariot whirling at their heels They leaped out of the bottomless hole chariot and all and there they were tossing their black manes flourishing their black tails and curveting with every one of their hoofs off the ground at once close by the spot where Proserpina stood In the chariot sat the figure of a man richly dressed with a crown on his head all flaming with diamonds He was of a noble aspect and rather handsome but looked sullen and discontented and he kept rubbing his eyes and shading them with his hand as if he did not live enough in the sunshine to be very fond of its light As soon as this personage saw the affrighted Proserpina he beckoned her to come a little nearer Do not be afraid said he with as cheerful a smile as he knew how to put on Come Will not you like to ride a little way with me in my beautiful chariot But Proserpina was so alarmed that she wished for nothing but to get out of his reach And no wonder The stranger did not look remarkably good natured in spite of his smile and as for his voice its tones were deep and stern and sounded as much like the rumbling of an earthquake under ground as anything else As is always the case with children in trouble Proserpina s first thought was to call for her mother Mother Mother Ceres cried she all in a tremble Come quickly and save me But her voice was too faint for her mother to hear Indeed it is most probable that Ceres was then a thousand miles off making the corn grow in some far distant country Nor could it have availed her poor daughter even had she been within hearing for no sooner did Proserpina begin to cry out than the stranger leaped to the ground caught the child in his arms and again mounting the chariot shook the reins and shouted to the four black horses to set off They immediately broke into so swift a gallop that it seemed rather like flying through the air than running along the earth In a moment Proserpina lost sight of the pleasant vale of Enna in which she had always dwelt Another instant and even the summit of Mount AEtna had become so blue in the distance that she could scarcely distinguish it from the smoke that gushed out of its crater But still the poor child screamed and scattered her apron full of flowers along the way and left a long cry trailing behind the chariot and many mothers to whose ears it came ran quickly to see if any mischief had befallen their children But Mother Ceres was a great way off and could not hear the cry As they rode on the stranger did his best to soothe her Why should you be so frightened my pretty child said he trying to soften his rough voice I promise not to do you any harm What You have been gathering flowers Wait till we come to my palace and I will give you a garden full of prettier flowers than those all made of pearls and diamonds and rubies Can you guess who I am They call my name Pluto and I am the king of diamonds and all other precious stones Every atom of the gold and silver that lies under the earth belongs to me to say nothing of the copper and iron and of the coal mines which supply me with abundance of fuel Do you see this splendid crown upon my head You may have it for a plaything Oh we shall be very good friends and you will find me more agreeable than you expect when once we get out of this troublesome sunshine Let me go home cried Proserpina let me go home My home is better than your mother s answered King Pluto It is a palace all made of gold with crystal windows and because there is little or no sunshine thereabouts the apartments are illuminated with diamond lamps You never saw anything half so magnificent as my throne If you like you may sit down on it and be my little queen and I will sit on the footstool I don t care for golden palaces and thrones sobbed Proserpina Oh my mother my mother Carry me back to my mother But King Pluto as he called himself only shouted to his steeds to go faster Pray do not be foolish Proserpina said he in rather a sullen tone I offer you my palace and my crown and all the riches that are under the earth and you treat me as if I were doing you an injury The one thing which my palace needs is a merry little maid to run up stairs and down and cheer up the rooms with her smile And this is what you must do for King Pluto Never answered Proserpina looking as miserable as she could I shall never smile again till you set me down at my mother s door But she might just as well have talked to the wind that whistled past them for Pluto urged on his horses and went faster than ever Proserpina continued to cry out and screamed so long and so loudly that her poor little voice was almost screamed away and when it was nothing but a whisper she happened to cast her eyes over a great broad field of waving grain and whom do you think she saw Whom but Mother Ceres making the corn grow and too busy to notice the golden chariot as it went rattling along The child mustered all her strength and gave one more scream but was out of sight before Ceres had time to turn her head King Pluto had taken a road which now began to grow excessively gloomy It was bordered on each side with rocks and precipices between which the rumbling of the chariot wheels was reverberated with a noise like rolling thunder The trees and bushes that grew in the crevices of the rocks had very dismal foliage and by and by although it was hardly noon the air became obscured with a gray twilight The black horses had rushed along so swiftly that they were already beyond the limits of the sunshine But the duskier it grew the more did Pluto s visage assume an air of satisfaction After all he was not an ill looking person especially when he left off twisting his features into a smile that did not belong to them Proserpina peeped at his face through the gathering dusk and hoped that he might not be so very wicked as she at first thought him Ah this twilight is truly refreshing said King Pluto after being so tormented with that ugly and impertinent glare of the sun How much more agreeable is lamp light or torchlight more particularly when reflected from diamonds It will be a magnificent sight when we get to my palace Is it much farther asked Proserpina And will you carry me back when I have seen it We will talk of that by and by answered Pluto We are just entering my dominions Do you see that tall gateway before us When we pass those gates we are at home And there lies my faithful mastiff at the threshold Cerberus Cerberus Come hither my good dog So saying Pluto pulled at the reins and stopped the chariot right between the tall massive pillars of the gateway The mastiff of which he had spoken got up from the threshold and stood on his hinder legs so as to put his fore paws on the chariot wheel But my stars what a strange dog it was Why he was a big rough ugly looking monster with three separate heads and each of them fiercer than the two others but fierce as they were King Pluto patted them all He seemed as fond of his three headed dog as if it had been a sweet little spaniel with silken ears and curly hair Cerberus on the other hand was evidently rejoiced to see his master and expressed his attachment as other dogs do by wagging his tail at a great rate Proserpina s eyes being drawn to it by its brisk motion she saw that this tail was neither more nor less than a live dragon with fiery eyes and fangs that had a very poisonous aspect And while the three headed Cerberus was fawning so lovingly on King Pluto there was the dragon tail wagging against its will and looking as cross and ill natured as you can imagine on its own separate account Will the dog bite me asked Proserpina shrinking closer to Pluto What an ugly creature he is Oh never fear answered her companion He never harms people unless they try to enter my dominions without being sent for or to get away when I wish to keep them here Down Cerberus Now my pretty Proserpina we will drive on On went the chariot and King Pluto seemed greatly pleased to find himself once more in his own kingdom He drew Proserpina s attention to the rich veins of gold that were to be seen among the rocks and pointed to several places where one stroke of a pickaxe would loosen a bushel of diamonds All along the road indeed there were sparkling gems which would have been of inestimable value above ground but which were here reckoned of the meaner sort and hardly worth a beggar s stooping for Not far from the gateway they came to a bridge which seemed to be built of iron Pluto stopped the chariot and bade Proserpina look at the stream which was gliding so lazily beneath it Never in her life had she beheld so torpid so black so muddy looking a stream its waters reflected no images of anything that was on the banks and it moved as sluggishly as if it had quite forgotten which way it ought to flow and had rather stagnate than flow either one way or the other This is the river Lethe observed King Pluto Is it not a very pleasant stream I think it a very dismal one said Proserpina It suits my taste however answered Pluto who was apt to be sullen when anybody disagreed with him At all events its water has one very excellent quality for a single draught of it makes people forget every care and sorrow that has hitherto tormented them Only sip a little of it my dear Proserpina and you will instantly cease to grieve for your mother and will have nothing in your memory that can prevent your being perfectly happy in my palace I will send for some in a golden goblet the moment we arrive Oh no no no cried Proserpina weeping afresh I had a thousand times rather be miserable with remembering my mother than be happy in forgetting her That dear dear mother I never never will forget her We shall see said King Pluto You do not know what fine times we will have in my palace Here we are just at the portal These pillars are solid gold I assure you He alighted from the chariot and taking Proserpina in his arms carried her up a lofty flight of steps into the great hall of the palace It was splendidly illuminated by means of large precious stones of various hues which seemed to burn like so many lamps and glowed with a hundred fold radiance all through the vast apartment And yet there was a kind of gloom in the midst of this enchanted light nor was there a single object in the hall that was really agreeable to behold except the little Proserpina herself a lovely child with one earthly flower which she had not let fall from her hand It is my opinion that even King Pluto had never been happy in his palace and that this was the true reason why he had stolen away Proserpina in order that he might have something to love instead of cheating his heart any longer with this tiresome magnificence And though he pretended to dislike the sunshine of the upper world yet the effect of the child s presence bedimmed as she was by her tears was as if a faint and watery sunbeam had somehow or other found its way into the enchanted hall Pluto now summoned his domestics and bade them lose no time in preparing a most sumptuous banquet and above all things not to fail of setting a golden beaker of the water of Lethe by Proserpina s plate I will neither drink that nor anything else said Proserpina Nor will I taste a morsel of food even if you keep me forever in your palace I should be sorry for that replied King Pluto patting her cheek for he really wished to be kind if he had only known how You are a spoiled child I perceive my little Proserpina but when you see the nice things which my cook will make for you your appetite will quickly come again Then sending for the head cook he gave strict orders that all sorts of delicacies such as young people are usually fond of should be set before Proserpina He had a secret motive in this for you are to understand it is a fixed law that when persons are carried off to the land of magic if they once taste any food there they can never get back to their friends Now if King Pluto had been cunning enough to offer Proserpina some fruit or bread and milk which was the simple fare to which the child had always been accustomed it is very probable that she would soon have been tempted to eat it But he left the matter entirely to his cook who like all other cooks considered nothing fit to eat unless it were rich pastry or highly seasoned meat or spiced sweet cakes things which Proserpina s mother had never given her and the smell of which quite took away her appetite instead of sharpening it But my story must now clamber out of King Pluto s dominions and see what Mother Ceres has been about since she was bereft of her daughter We had a glimpse of her as you remember half hidden among the waving grain while the four black steeds were swiftly whirling along the chariot in which her beloved Proserpina was so unwillingly borne away You recollect too the loud scream which Proserpina gave just when the chariot was out of sight Of all the child s outcries this last shriek was the only one that reached the ears of Mother Ceres She had mistaken the rumbling of the chariot wheels for a peal of thunder and imagined that a shower was coming up and that it would assist her in making the corn grow But at the sound of Proserpina s shriek she started and looked about in every direction not knowing whence it came but feeling almost certain that it was her daughter s voice It seemed so unaccountable however that the girl should have strayed over so many lands and seas which she herself could not have traversed without the aid of her winged dragons that the good Ceres tried to believe that it must be the child of some other parent and not her own darling Proserpina who had uttered this lamentable cry Nevertheless it troubled her with a vast many tender fears such as are ready to bestir themselves in every mother s heart when she finds it necessary to go away from her dear children without leaving them under the care of some maiden aunt or other such faithful guardian So she quickly left the field in which she had been so busy and as her work was not half done the grain looked next day as if it needed both sun and rain and as if it were blighted in the ear and had something the matter with its roots The pair of dragons must have had very nimble wings for in less than an hour Mother Ceres had alighted at the door of her home and found it empty Knowing however that the child was fond of sporting on the seashore she hastened thither as fast as she could and there beheld the wet faces of the poor sea nymphs peeping over a wave All this while the good creatures had been waiting on the bank of sponge and once every half minute or so had popped up their four heads above water to see if their playmate were yet coming back When they saw Mother Ceres they sat down on the crest of the surf wave and let it toss them ashore at her feet Where is Proserpina cried Ceres Where is my child Tell me you naughty sea nymphs have you enticed her under the sea Oh no good Mother Ceres said the innocent sea nymphs tossing back their green ringlets and looking her in the face We never should dream of such a thing Proserpina has been at play with us it is true but she left us a long while ago meaning only to run a little way upon the dry land and gather some flowers for a wreath This was early in the day and we have seen nothing of her since Ceres scarcely waited to hear what the nymphs had to say before she hurried off to make inquiries all through the neighbourhood But nobody told her anything that could enable the poor mother to guess what had become of Proserpina A fisherman it is true had noticed her little footprints in the sand as he went homeward along the beach with a basket of fish a rustic had seen the child stooping to gather flowers several persons had heard either the rattling of chariot wheels or the rumbling of distant thunder and one old woman while plucking vervain and catnip had heard a scream but supposed it to be some childish nonsense and therefore did not take the trouble to look up The stupid people It took them such a tedious while to tell the nothing that they knew that it was dark night before Mother Ceres found out that she must seek her daughter elsewhere So she lighted a torch and set forth resolving never to come back until Proserpina was discovered In her haste and trouble of mind she quite forgot her car and the winged dragons or it may be she thought that she could follow up the search more thoroughly on foot At all events this was the way in which she began her sorrowful journey holding her torch before her and looking carefully at every object along the path And as it happened she had not gone far before she found one of the magnificent flowers which grew on the shrub that Proserpina had pulled up Ha thought Mother Ceres examining it by torchlight Here is mischief in this flower The earth did not produce it by any help of mine nor of its own accord It is the work of enchantment and is therefore poisonous and perhaps it has poisoned my poor child But she put the poisonous flower in her bosom not knowing whether she might ever find any other memorial of Proserpina All night long at the door of every cottage and farmhouse Ceres knocked and called up the weary labourers to inquire if they had seen her child and they stood gaping and half asleep at the threshold and answered her pityingly and besought her to come in and rest At the portal of every palace too she made so loud a summons that the menials hurried to throw open the gate thinking that it must be some great king or queen who would demand a banquet for supper and a stately chamber to repose in And when they saw only a sad and anxious woman with a torch in her hand and a wreath of withered poppies on her head they spoke rudely and sometimes threatened to set the dogs upon her But nobody had seen Proserpina nor could give Mother Ceres the least hint which way to seek her Thus passed the night and still she continued her search without sitting down to rest or stopping to take food or even remembering to put out the torch although first the rosy dawn and then the glad light of the morning sun made its red flame look thin and pale But I wonder what sort of stuff this torch was made of for it burned dimly through the day and at night was as bright as ever and never was extinguished by the rain or wind in all the weary days and nights while Ceres was seeking for Proserpina It was not merely of human beings that she asked tidings of her daughter In the woods and by the streams she met creatures of another nature who used in those old times to haunt the pleasant and solitary places and were very sociable with persons who understood their language and customs as Mother Ceres did Sometimes for instance she tapped with her finger against the knotted trunk of a majestic oak and immediately its rude bark would cleave asunder and forth would step a beautiful maiden who was the hamadryad of the oak dwelling inside of it and sharing its long life and rejoicing when its green leaves sported with the breeze But not one of these leafy damsels had seen Proserpina Then going a little farther Ceres would perhaps come to a fountain gushing out of a pebbly hollow in the earth and would dabble with her hand in the water Behold up through its sandy and pebbly bed along with the fountain s gush a young woman with dripping hair would arise and stand gazing at Mother Ceres half out of the water and undulating up and down with its ever restless motion But when the mother asked whether her poor lost child had stopped to drink out of the fountain the naiad with weeping eyes for these water nymphs had tears to spare for everybody s grief would answer No in a murmuring voice which was just like the murmur of the stream Often likewise she encountered fauns who looked like sunburnt country people except that they had hairy ears and little horns upon their foreheads and the hinder legs of goats on which they gambolled merrily about the woods and fields They were a frolicsome kind of creature but grew as sad as their cheerful dispositions would allow when Ceres inquired for her daughter and they had no good news to tell But sometimes she came suddenly upon a rude gang of satyrs who had faces like monkeys and horses tails behind them and who were generally dancing in a very boisterous manner with shouts of noisy laughter When she stopped to question them they would only laugh the louder and make new merriment out of the lone woman s distress How unkind of those ugly satyrs And once while crossing a solitary sheep pasture she saw a personage named Pan seated at the foot of a tall rock and making music on a shepherd s flute He too had horns and hairy ears and goat s feet but being acquainted with Mother Ceres he answered her question as civilly as he knew how and invited her to taste some milk and honey out of a wooden bowl But neither could Pan tell her what had become of Proserpina any better than the rest of these wild people And thus Mother Ceres went wandering about for nine long days and nights finding no trace of Proserpina unless it were now and then a withered flower and these she picked up and put in her bosom because she fancied that they might have fallen from her poor child s hand All day she travelled onward through the hot sun and at night again the flame of the torch would redden and gleam along the pathway and she continued her search by its light without ever sitting down to rest On the tenth day she chanced to espy the mouth of a cavern within which though it was bright noon everywhere else there would have been only a dusky twilight but it so happened that a torch was burning there It flickered and struggled with the duskiness but could not half light up the gloomy cavern with all its melancholy glimmer Ceres was resolved to leave no spot without a search so she peeped into the entrance of the cave and lighted it up a little more by holding her own torch before her In so doing she caught a glimpse of what seemed to be a woman sitting on the brown leaves of the last autumn a great heap of which had been swept into the cave by the wind This woman if woman it were was by no means so beautiful as many of her sex for her head they tell me was shaped very much like a dog s and by way of ornament she wore a wreath of snakes around it But Mother Ceres the moment she saw her knew that this was an odd kind of a person who put all her enjoyment in being miserable and never would have a word to say to other people unless they were as melancholy and wretched as she herself delighted to be I am wretched enough now thought poor Ceres to talk with this melancholy Hecate were she ten times sadder than ever she was yet So she stepped into the cave and sat down on the withered leaves by the dog headed woman s side In all the world since her daughter s loss she had found no other companion O Hecate said she if ever you lose a daughter you will know what sorrow is Tell me for pity s sake have you seen my poor child Proserpina pass by the mouth of your cavern No answered Hecate in a cracked voice and sighing betwixt every word or two no Mother Ceres I have seen nothing of your daughter But my ears you must know are made in such a way that all cries of distress and affright all over the world are pretty sure to find their way to them and nine days ago as I sat in my cave making myself very miserable I heard the voice of a young girl shrieking as if in great distress Something terrible has happened to the child you may rest assured As well as I could judge a dragon or some other cruel monster was carrying her away You kill me by saying so cried Ceres almost ready to faint Where was the sound and which way did it seem to go It passed very swiftly along said Hecate and at the same time there was a heavy rumbling of wheels toward the eastward I can tell you nothing more except that in my honest opinion you will never see your daughter again The best advice I can give you is to take up your abode in this cavern where we will be the two most wretched women in the world Not yet dark Hecate replied Ceres But do you first come with your torch and help me to seek for my lost child And when there shall be no more hope of finding her if that black day is ordained to come then if you will give me room to fling myself down either on these withered leaves or on the naked rock I will show you what it is to be miserable But until I know that she has perished from the face of the earth I will not allow myself space even to grieve The dismal Hecate did not much like the idea of going abroad into the sunny world But then she reflected that the sorrow of the disconsolate Ceres would be like a gloomy twilight round about them both let the sun shine ever so brightly and that therefore she might enjoy her bad spirits quite as well as if she were to stay in the cave So she finally consented to go and they set out together both carrying torches although it was broad daylight and clear sunshine The torchlight seemed to make a gloom so that the people whom they met along the road could not very distinctly see their figures and indeed if they once caught a glimpse of Hecate with the wreath of snakes round her forehead they generally thought it prudent to run away without waiting for a second glance As the pair travelled along in this woebegone manner a thought struck Ceres There is one person she exclaimed who must have seen my poor child and can doubtless tell what has become of her Why did not I think of him before It is Phoebus What said Hecate the young man that always sits in the sunshine Oh pray do not think of going near him He is a gay light frivolous young fellow and will only smile in your face And besides there is such a glare of the sun about him that he will quite blind my poor eyes which I have almost wept away already You have promised to be my companion answered Ceres Come let us make haste or the sunshine will be gone and Phoebus along with it Accordingly they went along in quest of Phoebus both of them sighing grievously and Hecate to say the truth making a great deal worse lamentation than Ceres for all the pleasure she had you know lay in being miserable and therefore she made the most of it By and by after a pretty long journey they arrived at the sunniest spot in the whole world There they beheld a beautiful young man with long curling ringlets which seemed to be made of golden sunbeams his garments were like light summer clouds and the expression of his face was so exceedingly vivid that Hecate held her hands before her eyes muttering that he ought to wear a black veil Phoebus for this was the very person whom they were seeking had a lyre in his hands and was making its chords tremble with sweet music at the same time singing a most exquisite song which he had recently composed For besides a great many other accomplishments this young man was renowned for his admirable poetry As Ceres and her dismal companion approached him Phoebus smiled on them so cheerfully that Hecate s wreath of snakes gave a spiteful hiss and Hecate heartily wished herself back in her cave But as for Ceres she was too earnest in her grief either to know or care whether Phoebus smiled or frowned Phoebus exclaimed she I am in great trouble and have come to you for assistance Can you tell me what has become of my dear child Proserpina Proserpina Proserpina did you call her name answered Phoebus endeavouring to recollect for there was such a continual flow of pleasant ideas in his mind that he was apt to forget what had happened no longer ago than yesterday Ah yes I remember her now A very lovely child indeed I am happy to tell you my dear madam that I did see the little Proserpina not many days ago You may make yourself perfectly easy about her She is safe and in excellent hands Oh where is my dear child cried Ceres clasping her hands and flinging herself at his feet Why said Phoebus and as he spoke he kept touching his lyre so as to make a thread of music run in and out among his words as the little damsel was gathering flowers and she has really a very exquisite taste for flowers she was suddenly snatched up by King Pluto and carried off to his dominions I have never been in that part of the universe but the royal palace I am told is built in a very noble style of architecture and of the most splendid and costly materials Gold diamonds pearls and all manner of precious stones will be your daughter s ordinary playthings I recommend to you my dear lady to give yourself no uneasiness Proserpina s sense of beauty will be duly gratified and even in spite of the lack of sunshine she will lead a very enviable life Hush Say not such a word answered Ceres indignantly What is there to gratify her heart What are all the splendours you speak of without affection I must have her back again Will you go with me Phoebus to demand my daughter of this wicked Pluto Pray excuse me replied Phoebus with an elegant obeisance I certainly wish you success and regret that my own affairs are so immediately pressing that I cannot have the pleasure of attending you Besides I am not upon the best of terms with King Pluto To tell you the truth his three headed mastiff would never let me pass the gateway for I should be compelled to take a sheaf of sunbeams along with me and those you know are forbidden things in Pluto s kingdom Ah Phoebus said Ceres with bitter meaning in her words you have a harp instead of a heart Farewell Will not you stay a moment asked Phoebus and hear me turn the pretty and touching story of Proserpina into extemporary verses But Ceres shook her head and hastened away along with Hecate Phoebus who as I have told you was an exquisite poet forthwith began to make an ode about the poor mother s grief and if we were to judge of his sensibility by this beautiful production he must have been endowed with a very tender heart But when a poet gets into the habit of using his heartstrings to make chords for his lyre he may thrum upon them as much as he will without any great pain to himself Accordingly though Phoebus sang a very sad song he was as merry all the while as were the sunbeams amid which he dwelt Poor Mother Ceres had now found out what had become of her daughter but was not a whit happier than before Her case on the contrary looked more desperate than ever As long as Proserpina was above ground there might have been hopes of regaining her But now that the poor child was shut up within the iron gates of the king of the mines at the threshold of which lay the three headed Cerberus there seemed no possibility of her ever making her escape The dismal Hecate who loved to take the darkest view of things told Ceres that she had better come with her to the cavern and spend the rest of her life in being miserable Ceres answered that Hecate was welcome to go back thither herself but that for her part she would wander about the earth in quest of the entrance to King Pluto s dominions And Hecate took her at her word and hurried back to her beloved cave frightening a great many little children with a glimpse of her dog s face as she went Poor Mother Ceres It is melancholy to think of her pursuing her toilsome way all alone and holding up that never dying torch the flame of which seemed an emblem of the grief and hope that burned together in her heart So much did she suffer that though her aspect had been quite youthful when her troubles began she grew to look like an elderly person in a very brief time She cared not how she was dressed nor had she ever thought of flinging away the wreath of withered poppies which she put on the very morning of Proserpina s disappearance She roamed about in so wild a way and with her hair so dishevelled that people took her for some distracted creature and never dreamed that this was Mother Ceres who had the oversight of every seed which the husband man planted Nowadays however she gave herself no trouble about seed time nor harvest but left the farmers to take care of their own affairs and the crops to fade or flourish as the case might be There was nothing now in which Ceres seemed to feel an interest unless when she saw children at play or gathering flowers along the wayside Then indeed she would stand and gaze at them with tears in her eyes The children too appeared to have a sympathy with her grief and would cluster themselves in a little group about her knees and look up wistfully in her face and Ceres after giving them a kiss all round would lead them to their homes and advise their mothers never to let them stray out of sight For if they do said she it may happen to you as it has to me that the iron hearted King Pluto will take a liking to your darlings and snatch them up in his chariot and carry them away One day during her pilgrimage in quest of the entrance to Pluto s kingdom she came to the palace of King Celeus who reigned at Eleusis Ascending a lofty flight of steps she entered the portal and found the royal household in very great alarm about the queen s baby The infant it seems was sickly being troubled with its teeth I suppose and would take no food and was all the time moaning with pain The queen her name was Metanira was desirous of finding a nurse and when she beheld a woman of matronly aspect coming up the palace steps she thought in her own mind that here was the very person whom she needed So Queen Metanira ran to the door with the poor wailing baby in her arms and besought Ceres to take charge of it or at least to tell her what would do it good Will you trust the child entirely to me asked Ceres Yes and gladly too answered the queen if you will devote all your time to him For I can see that you have been a mother You are right said Ceres I once had a child of my own Well I will be the nurse of this poor sickly boy But beware I warn you that you do not interfere with any kind of treatment which I may judge proper for him If you do so the poor infant must suffer for his mother s folly Then she kissed the child and it seemed to do him good for he smiled and nestled closely into her bosom So Mother Ceres set her torch in a corner where it kept burning all the while and took up her abode in the palace of King Celeus as nurse to the little Prince Demophooen She treated him as if he were her own child and allowed neither the king nor the queen to say whether he should be bathed in warm or cold water or what he should eat or how often he should take the air or when he should be put to bed You would hardly believe me if I were to tell how quickly the baby prince got rid of his ailments and grew fat and rosy and strong and how he had two rows of ivory teeth in less time than any other little fellow before or since Instead of the palest and wretchedest and puniest imp in the world as his own mother confessed him to be when Ceres first took him in charge he was now a strapping baby crowing laughing kicking up his heels and rolling from one end of the room to the other All the good women of the neighbourhood crowded to the palace and held up their hands in unutterable amazement at the beauty and wholesomeness of this darling little prince Their wonder was the greater because he was never seen to taste any food not even so much as a cup of milk Pray nurse the queen kept saying how is it that you make the child thrive so I was a mother once Ceres always replied and having nursed my own child I know what other children need But Queen Metanira as was very natural had a great curiosity to know precisely what the nurse did to her child One night therefore she hid herself in the chamber where Ceres and the little prince were accustomed to sleep There was a fire in the chimney and it had now crumbled into great coals and embers which lay glowing on the hearth with a blaze flickering up now and then and flinging a warm and ruddy light upon the walls Ceres sat before the hearth with the child in her lap and the fire light making her shadow dance upon the ceiling overhead She undressed the little prince and bathed him all over with some fragrant liquid out of a vase The next thing she did was to rake back the red embers and make a hollow place among them just where the backlog had been At last while the baby was crowing and clapping its fat little hands and laughing in the nurse s face just as you may have seen your little brother or sister do before going into its warm bath Ceres suddenly laid him all naked as he was in the hollow among the red hot embers She then raked the ashes over him and turned quietly away You may imagine if you can how Queen Metanira shrieked thinking nothing less than that her dear child would be burned to a cinder She burst forth from her hiding place and running to the hearth raked open the fire and snatched up poor little Prince Demophooen out of his bed of live coals one of which he was griping in each of his fists He immediately set up a grievous cry as babies are apt to do when rudely startled out of a sound sleep To the queen s astonishment and joy she could perceive no token of the child s being injured by the hot fire in which he had lain She now turned to Mother Ceres and asked her to explain the mystery Foolish woman answered Ceres did you not promise to intrust this poor infant entirely to me You little know the mischief you have done him Had you left him to my care he would have grown up like a child of celestial birth endowed with superhuman strength and intelligence and would have lived forever Do you imagine that earthly children are to become immortal without being tempered to it in the fiercest heat of the fire But you have ruined your own son For though he will be a strong man and a hero in his day yet on account of your folly he will grow old and finally die like the sons of other women The weak tenderness of his mother has cost the poor boy an immortality Farewell Saying these words she kissed the little Prince Demophooen and sighed to think what he had lost and took her departure without heeding Queen Metanira who entreated her to remain and cover up the child among the hot embers as often as she pleased Poor baby He never slept so warmly again While she dwelt in the king s palace Mother Ceres had been so continually occupied with taking care of the young prince that her heart was a little lightened of its grief for Proserpina But now having nothing else to busy herself about she became just as wretched as before At length in her despair she came to the dreadful resolution that not a stalk of grain nor a blade of grass not a potato nor a turnip nor any other vegetable that was good for man or beast to eat should be suffered to grow until her daughter were restored She even forbade the flowers to bloom lest somebody s heart should be cheered by their beauty Now as not so much as a head of asparagus ever presumed to poke itself out of the ground without the especial permission of Ceres you may conceive what a terrible calamity had here fallen upon the earth The husbandmen ploughed and planted as usual but there lay the rich black furrows all as barren as a desert of sand The pastures looked as brown in the sweet month of June as ever they did in chill November The rich man s broad acres and the cottager s small garden patch were equally blighted Every little girl s flower bed showed nothing but dry stalks The old people shook their white heads and said that the earth had grown aged like themselves and was no longer capable of wearing the warm smile of summer on its face It was really piteous to see the poor starving cattle and sheep how they followed behind Ceres lowing and bleating as if their instinct taught them to expect help from her and everybody that was acquainted with her power besought her to have mercy on the human race and at all events to let the grass grow But Mother Ceres though naturally of an affectionate disposition was now inexorable Never said she If the earth is ever again to see any verdure it must first grow along the path which my daughter will tread in coming back to me Finally as there seemed to be no other remedy our old friend Quicksilver was sent post haste to King Pluto in hopes that he might be persuaded to undo the mischief he had done and to set everything right again by giving up Proserpina Quicksilver accordingly made the best of his way to the great gate took a flying leap right over the three headed mastiff and stood at the door of the palace in an inconceivably short time The servants knew him both by his face and garb for his short cloak and his winged cap and shoes and his snaky staff had often been seen thereabouts in times gone by He requested to be shown immediately into the king s presence and Pluto who heard his voice from the top of the stairs and who loved to recreate himself with Quicksilver s merry talk called out to him to come up And while they settle their business together we must inquire what Proserpina has been doing ever since we saw her last The child had declared as you may remember that she would not taste a mouthful of food as long as she should be compelled to remain in King Pluto s palace How she contrived to maintain her resolution and at the same time to keep herself tolerably plump and rosy is more than I can explain but some young ladies I am given to understand possess the faculty of living on air and Proserpina seems to have possessed it too At any rate it was now six months since she left the outside of the earth and not a morsel so far as the attendants were able to testify had yet passed between her teeth This was the more creditable to Proserpina inasmuch as King Pluto had caused her to be tempted day after day with all manner of sweetmeats and richly preserved fruits and delicacies of every sort such as young people are generally most fond of But her good mother had often told her of the hurtfulness of these things and for that reason alone if there had been no other she would have resolutely refused to taste them All this time being of a cheerful and active disposition the little damsel was not quite so unhappy as you may have supposed The immense palace had a thousand rooms and was full of beautiful and wonderful objects There was a never ceasing gloom it is true which half hid itself among the innumerable pillars gliding before the child as she wandered among them and treading stealthily behind her in the echo of her footsteps Neither was all the dazzle of the precious stones which flamed with their own light worth one gleam of natural sunshine nor could the most brilliant of the many coloured gems which Proserpina had for playthings vie with the simple beauty of the flowers she used to gather But still wherever the girl went among those gilded halls and chambers it seemed as if she carried nature and sunshine along with her and as if she scattered dewy blossoms on her right hand and on her left After Proserpina came the palace was no longer the same abode of stately artifice and dismal magnificence that it had before been The inhabitants all felt this and King Pluto more than any of them My own little Proserpina he used to say I wish you could like me a little better We gloomy and cloudy natured persons have often as warm hearts at bottom as those of a more cheerful character If you would only stay with me of your own accord it would make me happier than the possession of a hundred such palaces as this Ah said Proserpina you should have tried to make me like you before carrying me off And the best thing you can do now is to let me go again Then I might remember you sometimes and think that you were as kind as you knew how to be Perhaps too one day or other I might come back and pay you a visit No no answered Pluto with his gloomy smile I will not trust you for that You are too fond of living in the broad daylight and gathering flowers What an idle and childish taste that is Are not these gems which I have ordered to be dug for you and which are richer than any in my crown are they not prettier than a violet Not half so pretty said Proserpina snatching the gems from Pluto s hand and flinging them to the other end of the hall Oh my sweet violets shall I never see you again And then she burst into tears But young people s tears have very little saltness or acidity in them and do not inflame the eyes so much as those of grown persons so that it is not to be wondered at if a few moments afterward Proserpina was sporting through the hall almost as merrily as she and the four sea nymphs had sported along the edge of the surf wave King Pluto gazed after her and wished that he too was a child And little Proserpina when she turned about and beheld this great king standing in his splendid hall and looking so grand and so melancholy and so lonesome was smitten with a kind of pity She ran back to him and for the first time in all her life put her small soft hand in his I love you a little whispered she looking up in his face Do you indeed my dear child cried Pluto bending his dark face down to kiss her but Proserpina shrank away from the kiss for though his features were noble they were very dusky and grim Well I have not deserved it of you after keeping you a prisoner for so many months and starving you besides Are you not terribly hungry Is there nothing which I can get you to eat In asking this question the king of the mines had a very cunning purpose for you will recollect if Proserpina tasted a morsel of food in his dominions she would never afterward be at liberty to quit them No indeed said Proserpina Your head cook is always baking and stewing and roasting and rolling out paste and contriving one dish or another which he imagines may be to my liking But he might just as well save himself the trouble poor fat little man that he is I have no appetite for anything in the world unless it were a slice of bread of my mother s own baking or a little fruit out of her garden When Pluto heard this he began to see that he had mistaken the best method of tempting Proserpina to eat The cook s made dishes and artificial dainties were not half so delicious in the good child s opinion as the simple fare to which Mother Ceres had accustomed her Wondering that he had never thought of it before the king now sent one of his trusty attendants with a large basket to get some of the finest and juiciest pears peaches and plums which could anywhere be found in the upper world Unfortunately however this was during the time when Ceres had forbidden any fruits or vegetables to grow and after seeking all over the earth King Pluto s servant found only a single pomegranate and that so dried up as to be not worth eating Nevertheless since there was no better to be had he brought this dry old withered pomegranate home to the palace put it on a magnificent golden salver and carried it up to Proserpina Now it happened curiously enough that just as the servant was bringing the pomegranate into the back door of the palace our friend Quicksilver had gone up the front steps on his errand to get Proserpina away from King Pluto As soon as Proserpina saw the pomegranate on the golden salver she told the servant he had better take it away again I shall not touch it I assure you said she If I were ever so hungry I should never think of eating such a miserable dry pomegranate as that It is the only one in the world said the servant He set down the golden salver with the wizened pomegranate upon it and left the room When he was gone Proserpina could not help coming close to the table and looking at this poor specimen of dried fruit with a great deal of eagerness for to say the truth on seeing something that suited her taste she felt all the six months appetite taking possession of her at once To be sure it was a very wretched looking pomegranate and seemed to have no more juice in it than an oyster shell But there was no choice of such things in King Pluto s palace This was the first fruit she had seen there and the last she was ever likely to see and unless she ate it up immediately it would grow drier than it already was and be wholly unfit to eat At least I may smell it thought Proserpina So she took up the pomegranate and applied it to her nose and somehow or other being in such close neighbourhood to her mouth the fruit found its way into that little red cave Dear me what an everlasting pity Before Proserpina knew what she was about her teeth had actually bitten it of their own accord Just as this fatal deed was done the door of the apartment opened and in came King Pluto followed by Quicksilver who had been urging him to let his little prisoner go At the first noise of their entrance Proserpina withdrew the pomegranate from her mouth But Quicksilver whose eyes were very keen and his wits the sharpest that ever anybody had perceived that the child was a little confused and seeing the empty salver he suspected that she had been taking a sly nibble of something or other As for honest Pluto he never guessed at the secret My little Proserpina said the king sitting down and affectionately drawing her between his knees here is Quicksilver who tells me that a great many misfortunes have befallen innocent people on account of my detaining you in my dominions To confess the truth I myself had already reflected that it was an unjustifiable act to take you away from your good mother But then you must consider my dear child that this vast palace is apt to be gloomy although the precious stones certainly shine very bright and that I am not of the most cheerful disposition and that therefore it was a natural thing enough to seek for the society of some merrier creature than myself I hoped you would take my crown for a plaything and me ah you laugh naughty Proserpina me grim as I am for a playmate It was a silly expectation Not so extremely silly whispered Proserpina You have really amused me very much sometimes Thank you said King Pluto rather dryly But I can see plainly enough that you think my palace a dusky prison and me the iron hearted keeper of it And an iron heart I should surely have if I could detain you here any longer my poor child when it is now six months since you tasted food I give you your liberty Go with Quicksilver Hasten home to your dear mother Now although you may not have supposed it Proserpina found it impossible to take leave of poor King Pluto without some regrets and a good deal of compunction for not telling him about the pomegranate She even shed a tear or two thinking how lonely and cheerless the great palace would seem to him with all its ugly glare of artificial light after she herself his one little ray of natural sunshine whom he had stolen to be sure but only because he valued her so much after she should have departed I know not how many kind things she might have said to the disconsolate king of the mines had not Quicksilver hurried her away Come along quickly whispered he in her ear or His Majesty may change his royal mind And take care above all things that you say nothing of what was brought you on the golden salver In a very short time they had passed the great gateway leaving the three headed Cerberus barking and yelping and growling with threefold din behind them and emerged upon the surface of the earth It was delightful to behold as Proserpina hastened along how the path grew verdant behind and on either side of her Wherever she set her blessed foot there was at once a dewy flower The violets gushed up along the wayside The grass and the grain began to sprout with tenfold vigour and luxuriance to make up for the dreary months that had been wasted in barrenness The starved cattle immediately set to work grazing after their long fast and ate enormously all day and got up at midnight to eat more But I can assure you it was a busy time of year with the farmers when they found the summer coming upon them with such a rush Nor must I forget to say that all the birds in the whole world hopped about upon the newly blossoming trees and sang together in a prodigious ecstasy of joy Mother Ceres had returned to her deserted home and was sitting disconsolately on the doorstep with her torch burning in her hand She had been idly watching the flame for some moments past when all at once it flickered and went out What does this mean thought she It was an enchanted torch and should have kept burning till my child came back Lifting her eyes she was surprised to see a sudden verdure flashing over the brown and barren fields exactly as you may have observed a golden hue gleaming far and wide across the landscape from the just risen sun Does the earth disobey me exclaimed Mother Ceres indignantly Does it presume to be green when I have bidden it be barren until my daughter shall be restored to my arms Then open your arms dear mother cried a well known voice and take your little daughter into them And Proserpina came running and flung herself upon her mother s bosom Their mutual transport is not to be described The grief of their separation had caused both of them to shed a great many tears and now they shed a great many more because their joy could not so well express itself in any other way When their hearts had grown a little more quiet Mother Ceres looked anxiously at Proserpina My child said she did you taste any food while you were in King Pluto s palace Dearest mother answered Proserpina I will tell you the whole truth Until this very morning not a morsel of food had passed my lips But to day they brought me a pomegranate a very dry one it was and all shrivelled up till there was little left of it but seeds and skin and having seen no fruit for so long a time and being faint with hunger I was tempted just to bite it The instant I tasted it King Pluto and Quicksilver came into the room I had not swallowed a morsel but dear mother I hope it was no harm but six of the pomegranate seeds I am afraid remained in my mouth Ah unfortunate child and miserable me exclaimed Ceres For each of those six pomegranate seeds you must spend one month of every year in King Pluto s palace You are but half restored to your mother Only six months with me and six with that good for nothing King of Darkness Do not speak so harshly of poor King Pluto said Proserpina kissing her mother He has some very good qualities and I really think I can bear to spend six months in his palace if he will only let me spend the other six with you He certainly did very wrong to carry me off but then as he says it was but a dismal sort of life for him to live in that great gloomy place all alone and it has made a wonderful change in his spirits to have a little girl to run up stairs and down There is some comfort in making him so happy and so upon the whole dearest mother let us be thankful that he is not to keep me the whole year round CHAPTER III THE CHIMAERA

none	none	 to drink out of the spring stared hard at young Bellerophon and at the handsome bridle which he carried in his hand The watercourses must be getting low friend in your part of the world 
8168-116789-0010	train-other-500	remarked he if you come so far only to find the Fountain of Pirene But pray have you lost a horse I see you carry the bridle in your hand and a very pretty one it is with that double row of bright stones upon it
8168-116789-0011	train-other-500	If the horse was as fine as the bridle you are much to be pitied for losing him I have lost no horse said Bellerophon with a smile But I happen to be seeking a very famous one which
8168-116789-0012	train-other-500	as wise people have informed me must be found hereabouts if anywhere Do you know whether the winged horse Pegasus still haunts the Fountain of Pirene as he used to do in your forefathers days
none	none	 But then the country fellow laughed 
8168-116789-0013	train-other-500	Some of you my little friends have probably heard that this Pegasus was a snow white steed with beautiful silvery wings who spent most of his time on the summit of Mount Helicon He was as wild
8168-116789-0014	train-other-500	and as swift and as buoyant in his flight through the air as any eagle that ever soared into the clouds There was nothing else like him in the world He had no mate he never had been backed or bridled by a master
8168-116789-0015	train-other-500	and for many a long year
none	none	 he led a solitary and a happy life 
8168-116789-0016	train-other-500	Oh how fine a thing it is to be a winged horse Sleeping at night
none	none	 as he did on a lofty mountain top and passing the greater part of the day in the air 
8168-116789-0017	train-other-500	Pegasus seemed hardly to be a creature of the earth Whenever he was seen up very high above people s heads with the sunshine on his silvery wings you would have thought that he belonged to the sky
8168-116789-0018	train-other-500	and that skimming a little too low he had got astray among our mists and vapours and was seeking his way back again It was very pretty to behold him plunge into the fleecy bosom of a bright cloud
8168-116789-0019	train-other-500	and be lost in it for a moment or two and then break forth from the other side Or in a sullen rain storm when there was a gray pavement of clouds over the whole sky
8168-116789-0020	train-other-500	it would sometimes happen that the winged horse descended right through it and the glad light of the upper region would gleam after him In another instant it is true both Pegasus and the pleasant light would be gone away together
8168-116789-0021	train-other-500	But anyone that was fortunate enough to see this wondrous spectacle felt cheerful the whole day afterward and as much longer as the storm lasted In the summer time and in the beautifullest of weather
8168-116789-0022	train-other-500	Pegasus often alighted on the solid earth and closing his silvery wings would gallop over hill and dale for pastime as fleetly as the wind Oftener than in any other place
8168-116789-0023	train-other-500	he had been seen near the Fountain of Pirene drinking the delicious water or rolling himself upon the soft grass of the margin Sometimes too but Pegasus was very dainty in his food
8168-116789-0024	train-other-500	he would crop a few of the clover blossoms that happened to be sweetest To the Fountain of Pirene therefore people s great grandfathers had been in the habit of going
8168-116789-0025	train-other-500	as long as they were youthful and retained their faith in winged horses in hopes of getting a glimpse at the beautiful Pegasus But of late years he had been very seldom seen
8168-116789-0026	train-other-500	Indeed there were many of the country folks dwelling within half an hour s walk of the fountain who had never beheld Pegasus and did not believe that there was any such creature in existence
8168-116789-0027	train-other-500	The country fellow to whom Bellerophon was speaking chanced to be one of those incredulous persons And that was the reason why he laughed Pegasus indeed cried he
8168-116789-0028	train-other-500	turning up his nose as high as such a flat nose could be turned up Pegasus indeed A winged horse truly Why friend are you in your senses Of what use would wings be to a horse
8168-116789-0029	train-other-500	Could he drag the plough so well think you To be sure there might be a little saving in the expense of shoes but then how would a man like to see his horse flying out of the stable window yes or
8168-116789-0030	train-other-500	whisking him up above the clouds when he only wanted to ride to mill No no I don t believe in Pegasus
none	none	 There never was such a ridiculous kind of a horse fowl made 
8168-116789-0031	train-other-500	I have some reason to think otherwise said Bellerophon quietly And then he turned to an old gray man who was leaning on a staff and listening very attentively
8168-116789-0032	train-other-500	with his head stretched forward and one hand at his ear because for the last twenty years he had been getting rather deaf And what say you venerable sir inquired he
8168-116789-0033	train-other-500	In your younger days I should imagine you must frequently have seen the winged steed Ah young stranger my memory is very poor said the aged man
none	none	 When I was a lad if I remember rightly I used to believe there was such a horse and so did everybody else 
8168-116789-0034	train-other-500	But nowadays I hardly know what to think and very seldom think about the winged horse at all If I ever saw the creature it was a long long while ago and
8168-116789-0035	train-other-500	to tell you the truth I doubt whether I ever did see him One day to be sure when I was quite a youth I remember seeing some hoof tramps round about the brink of the fountain
8168-116789-0036	train-other-500	Pegasus might have made those hoof marks and so might some other horse And have you never seen him my fair maiden asked Bellerophon of the girl
none	none	 who stood with the pitcher on her head while this talk went on 
8168-116789-0037	train-other-500	You certainly could see Pegasus if anybody can for your eyes are very bright Once I thought I saw him replied the maiden with a smile and a blush
8168-116789-0038	train-other-500	It was either Pegasus or a large white bird a very great way up in the air And one other time as I was coming to the fountain with my pitcher I heard a neigh
8168-116789-0039	train-other-500	Oh such a brisk and melodious neigh as that was My very heart leaped with delight at the sound But it startled me nevertheless
none	none	 so that I ran home without filling my pitcher That was truly a pity 
8168-116789-0040	train-other-500	said Bellerophon And he turned to the child whom I mentioned at the beginning of the story and who was gazing at him as children are apt to gaze at strangers with his rosy mouth wide open
8168-116789-0041	train-other-500	Well my little fellow cried Bellerophon playfully pulling one of his curls I suppose you have often seen the winged horse That I have answered the child very readily I saw him yesterday
none	none	 and many times before 
8168-116789-0042	train-other-500	You are a fine little man said Bellerophon drawing the child closer to him Come tell me all about it Why replied the child
8168-116789-0043	train-other-500	I often come here to sail little boats in the fountain and to gather pretty pebbles out of its basin And sometimes when I look down into the water I see the image of the winged horse in the picture of the sky that is there
8168-116789-0044	train-other-500	I wish he would come down and take me on his back and let me ride him up to the moon But if I so much as stir to look at him he flies far away out of sight And Bellerophon put his faith in the child
8168-116789-0045	train-other-500	who had seen the image of Pegasus in the water and in the maiden who had heard him neigh so melodiously rather than in the middle aged clown who believed only in cart horses
8168-116789-0046	train-other-500	or in the old man who had forgotten the beautiful things of his youth Therefore he haunted about the Fountain of Pirene for a great many days afterward He kept continually on the watch
8168-116789-0047	train-other-500	looking upward at the sky or else down into the water hoping forever that he should see either the reflected image of the winged horse or the marvellous reality He held the bridle
8168-116789-0048	train-other-500	with its bright gems and golden bit always ready in his hand The rustic people who dwelt in the neighbourhood and drove their cattle to the fountain to drink would often laugh at poor Bellerophon
8168-116789-0049	train-other-500	and sometimes take him pretty severely to task They told him that an able bodied young man like himself
none	none	 ought to have better business than to be wasting his time in such an idle pursuit 
8168-116789-0050	train-other-500	They offered to sell him a horse if he wanted one and when Bellerophon declined the purchase they tried to drive a bargain with him for his fine bridle Even the country boys thought him so very foolish
8168-116789-0051	train-other-500	that they used to have a great deal of sport about him and were rude enough not to care a fig although Bellerophon saw and heard it One little urchin for example would play Pegasus
8168-116789-0052	train-other-500	and cut the oddest imaginable capers by way of flying while one of his schoolfellows would scamper after him holding forth a twist of bulrushes which was intended to represent Bellerophon s ornamental bridle
8168-116789-0053	train-other-500	But the gentle child who had seen the picture of Pegasus in the water comforted the young stranger more than all the naughty boys could torment him The dear little fellow in his play hours
8168-116789-0054	train-other-500	often sat down beside him and without speaking a word would look down into the fountain and up toward the sky with so innocent a faith that Bellerophon could not help feeling encouraged
8168-116789-0055	train-other-500	Now you will perhaps wish to be told why it was that Bellerophon had undertaken to catch the winged horse And we shall find no better opportunity to speak about this matter than while he is waiting for Pegasus to appear
8168-116789-0056	train-other-500	If I were to relate the whole of Bellerophon s previous adventures they might easily grow into a very long story It will be quite enough to say that
8168-116789-0057	train-other-500	in a certain country of Asia a terrible monster called a Chimaera had made its appearance and was doing more mischief than could be talked about between now and sunset
8168-116789-0058	train-other-500	According to the best accounts which I have been able to obtain this Chimaera was nearly if not quite the ugliest and most poisonous creature and the strangest and unaccountablest
8168-116789-0059	train-other-500	and the hardest to fight with and the most difficult to run away from that ever came out of the earth s inside It had a tail like a boa constrictor
none	none	 its body was like I do not care what 
8168-116789-0060	train-other-500	and it had three separate heads one of which was a lion s the second a goat s and the third an abominably great snake s And a hot blast of fire
8168-116789-0061	train-other-500	came flaming out of each of its three mouths Being an earthly monster I doubt whether it had any wings but wings or no
none	none	 it ran like a goat and a lion 
8168-116789-0062	train-other-500	and wriggled along like a serpent and thus contrived to make about as much speed as all the three together Oh the mischief and mischief and mischief that this naughty creature did
8168-116789-0063	train-other-500	With its flaming breath it could set a forest on fire or burn up a field of grain or for that matter a village with all its fences and houses
none	none	 It laid waste the whole country round about and used to eat up people and animals alive 
8168-116789-0064	train-other-500	and cook them afterward in the burning oven of its stomach Mercy on us little children I hope neither you nor I will ever happen to meet a Chimaera While the hateful beast
none	none	 if a beast we can anywise call it was doing all these 
8168-116789-0065	train-other-500	horrible things it so chanced that Bellerophon came to that part of the world on a visit to the king
none	none	 The king s name was Iobates 
8168-116789-0066	train-other-500	and Lycia was the country which he ruled over Bellerophon was one of the bravest youths in the world and desired nothing so much as to do some valiant and beneficent deed
8168-116789-0067	train-other-500	such as would make all mankind admire and love him In those days
none	none	 the only way for a young man to distinguish himself was by fighting battles 
8168-116789-0068	train-other-500	either with the enemies of his country or with wicked giants or with troublesome dragons or with wild beasts
none	none	 when he could find nothing more dangerous to encounter King Iobates 
8168-116789-0069	train-other-500	perceiving the courage of his youthful visitor proposed to him to go and fight the Chimaera which everybody else was afraid of and which unless it should be soon killed was likely to convert Lycia
8168-116789-0070	train-other-500	into a desert Bellerophon hesitated not a moment but assured the king that he would either slay this dreaded Chimaera or perish in the attempt But in the first place
8168-116789-0071	train-other-500	as the monster was so prodigiously swift he bethought himself that he should never win the victory by fighting on foot The wisest thing he could do therefore was to get the very best and fleetest horse that could
8168-116789-0072	train-other-500	anywhere be found And what other horse in all the world was half so fleet as the marvellous horse Pegasus who had wings as well as legs and was even more active in the air than on the earth
8168-116789-0073	train-other-500	To be sure a great many people denied that there was any such horse with wings and said that the stories about him were all poetry and nonsense But wonderful as it appeared
8168-116789-0074	train-other-500	Bellerophon believed that Pegasus was a real steed and hoped that he himself might be fortunate enough to find him and once fairly mounted on his back
none	none	 he would be able to fight the Chimaera 
8168-116789-0075	train-other-500	at better advantage And this was the purpose with which he had travelled from Lycia to Greece
none	none	 and had brought the beautifully ornamented bridle in his hand 
8168-116789-0076	train-other-500	It was an enchanted bridle If he could only succeed in putting the golden bit into the mouth of Pegasus the winged horse would be submissive and would own Bellerophon for his master
none	none	 and fly whithersoever he might choose to turn the rein 
8168-116789-0077	train-other-500	But indeed it was a weary and anxious time while Bellerophon waited and waited for Pegasus in hopes that he would come and drink at the Fountain of Pirene
8168-116789-0078	train-other-500	He was afraid lest King Iobates should imagine that he had fled from the Chimaera It pained him too to think how much mischief the monster was doing while he himself
none	none	 instead of righting with it 
8168-116789-0079	train-other-500	was compelled to sit idly poring over the bright waters of Pirene
none	none	 as they gushed out of the sparkling sand 
8168-116789-0080	train-other-500	And as Pegasus came thither so seldom in these latter years and scarcely alighted there more than once in a lifetime Bellerophon feared that he might grow an old man and have no strength left in his arms
8168-116789-0081	train-other-500	nor courage in his heart before the winged horse would appear Oh how heavily passes the time while an adventurous youth is yearning to do his part in life and to gather in the harvest of his renown How hard a lesson it is to wait
8168-116789-0082	train-other-500	Our life is brief and how much of it is spent in teaching us only this Well was it for Bellerophon that the gentle child had grown so fond of him and was never weary of keeping him company
8168-116789-0083	train-other-500	Every morning the child gave him a new hope to put in his bosom instead of yesterday s withered one Dear Bellerophon he would cry looking up hopefully into his face
8168-116789-0084	train-other-500	I think we shall see Pegasus to day And at length if it had not been for the little boy s unwavering faith
none	none	 Bellerophon would have given up all hope and would have gone back to Lycia and have done his best to slay the Chimaera without the help of the winged horse And in that case poor Bellerophon would at least have been terribly scorched by the creature s breath and would most probably have been killed and devoured Nobody should ever try to fight an earth born Chimaera unless he can first get upon the back of an aerial steed One morning the child spoke to Bellerophon even more hopefully than usual Dear dear Bellerophon cried he I know not why it is but I feel as if we should certainly see Pegasus to day And all that day he would not stir a step from Bellerophon s side so they ate a crust of bread together and drank some of the water of the fountain In the afternoon there they sat and Bellerophon had thrown his arm around the child who likewise had put one of his little hands into Bellerophon s The latter was lost in his own thoughts and was fixing his eyes vacantly on the trunks of the trees that overshadowed the fountain and on the grapevines that clambered up among their branches But the gentle child was gazing down into the water he was grieved for Bellerophon s sake that the hope of another day should be deceived like so many before it and two or three quiet tear drops fell from his eyes and mingled with what were said to be the many tears of Pirene when she wept for her slain children But when he least thought of it Bellerophon felt the pressure of the child s little hand and heard a soft almost breathless whisper See there dear Bellerophon There is an image in the water The young man looked down into the dimpling mirror of the fountain and saw what he took to be the reflection of a bird which seemed to be flying at a great height in the air with a gleam of sunshine on its snowy or silvery wings What a splendid bird it must be said he And how very large it looks though it must really be flying higher than the clouds It makes me tremble whispered the child I am afraid to look up into the air It is very beautiful and yet I dare only look at its image in the water Dear Bellerophon do you not see that it is no bird It is the winged horse Pegasus Bellerophon s heart began to throb He gazed keenly upward but could not see the winged creature whether bird or horse because just then it had plunged into the fleecy depths of a summer cloud It was but a moment however before the object reappeared sinking lightly down out of the cloud although still at a vast distance from the earth Bellerophon caught the child in his arms and shrank back with him so that they were both hidden among the thick shrubbery which grew all around the fountain Not that he was afraid of any harm but he dreaded lest if Pegasus caught a glimpse of them he would fly far away and alight in some inaccessible mountain top For it was really the winged horse After they had expected him so long he was coming to quench his thirst with the water of Pirene Nearer and nearer came the aerial wonder flying in great circles as you may have seen a dove when about to alight Downward came Pegasus in those wide sweeping circles which grew narrower and narrower still as he gradually approached the earth The nigher the view of him the more beautiful he was and the more marvellous the sweep of his silvery wings At last with so light a pressure as hardly to bend the grass about the fountain or imprint a hoof tramp in the sand of its margin he alighted and stooping his wild head began to drink He drew in the water with long and pleasant sighs and tranquil pauses of enjoyment and then another draught and another and another For nowhere in the world or up among the clouds did Pegasus love any water as he loved this of Pirene And when his thirst was slaked he cropped a few of the honey blossoms of the clover delicately tasting them but not caring to make a hearty meal because the herbage just beneath the clouds on the lofty sides of Mount Helicon suited his palate better than this ordinary grass After thus drinking to his heart s content and in his dainty fashion condescending to take a little food the winged horse began to caper to and fro and dance as it were out of mere idleness and sport There never was a more playful creature made than this very Pegasus So there he frisked in a way that it delights me to think about fluttering his great wings as lightly as ever did a linnet and running little races half on earth and half in air and which I know not whether to call a flight or a gallop When a creature is perfectly able to fly he sometimes chooses to run just for the pastime of the thing and so did Pegasus although it cost him some little trouble to keep his hoofs so near the ground Bellerophon meanwhile holding the child s hand peeped forth from the shrubbery and thought that never was any sight so beautiful as this nor ever a horse s eyes so wild and spirited as those of Pegasus It seemed a sin to think of bridling him and riding on his back Once or twice Pegasus stopped and snuffed the air pricking up his ears tossing his head and turning it on all sides as if he partly suspected some mischief or other Seeing nothing however and hearing no sound he soon began his antics again At length not that he was weary but only idle and luxurious Pegasus folded his wings and lay down on the soft green turf But being too full of aerial life to remain quiet for many moments together he soon rolled over on his back with his four slender legs in the air It was beautiful to see him this one solitary creature whose mate had never been created but who needed no companion and living a great many hundred years was as happy as the centuries were long The more he did such things as mortal horses are accustomed to do the less earthly and the more wonderful he seemed Bellerophon and the child almost held their breaths partly from a delightful awe but still more because they dreaded lest the slightest stir or murmur should send him up with the speed of an arrow flight into the farthest blue of the sky Finally when he had had enough of rolling over and over Pegasus turned himself about and indolently like any other horse put out his fore legs in order to rise from the ground and Bellerophon who had guessed that he would do so darted suddenly from the thicket and leaped astride of his back Yes there he sat on the back of the winged horse But what a bound did Pegasus make when for the first time he felt the weight of a mortal man upon his loins A bound indeed Before he had time to draw a breath Bellerophon found himself five hundred feet aloft and still shooting upward while the winged horse snorted and trembled with terror and anger Upward he went up up up until he plunged into the cold misty bosom of a cloud at which only a little while before Bellerophon had been gazing and fancying it a very pleasant spot Then again out of the heart of the cloud Pegasus shot down like a thunderbolt as if he meant to dash both himself and his rider headlong against a rock Then he went through about a thousand of the wildest caprioles that had ever been performed either by a bird or a horse I cannot tell you half that he did He skimmed straight forward and sideways and backward He reared himself erect with his fore legs on a wreath of mist and his hind legs on nothing at all He flung out his heels behind and put down his head between his legs with his wings pointing right upward At about two miles height above the earth he turned a somerset so that Bellerophon s heels were where his head should have been and he seemed to look down into the sky instead of up He twisted his head about and looking Bellerophon in the face with fire flashing from his eyes made a terrible attempt to bite him He fluttered his pinions so wildly that one of the silver feathers was shaken out and floating earthward was picked up by the child who kept it as long as he lived in memory of Pegasus and Bellerophon But the latter who as you may judge was as good a horseman as ever galloped had been watching his opportunity and at last clapped the golden bit of the enchanted bridle between the winged steed s jaws No sooner was this done than Pegasus became as manageable as if he had taken food all his life out of Bellerophon s hand To speak what I really feel it was almost a sadness to see so wild a creature grow suddenly so tame And Pegasus seemed to feel it so likewise He looked round to Bellerophon with the tears in his beautiful eyes instead of the fire that so recently flashed from them But when Bellerophon patted his head and spoke a few authoritative yet kind and soothing words another look came into the eyes of Pegasus for he was glad at heart after so many lonely centuries to have found a companion and a master Thus it always is with winged horses and with all such wild and solitary creatures If you can catch and overcome them it is the surest way to win their love While Pegasus had been doing his utmost to shake Bellerophon off his back he had flown a very long distance and they had come within sight of a lofty mountain by the time the bit was in his mouth Bellerophon had seen this mountain before and knew it to be Helicon on the summit of which was the winged horse s abode Thither after looking gently into his rider s face as if to ask leave Pegasus now flew and alighting waited patiently until Bellerophon should please to dismount The young man accordingly leaped from his steed s back but still held him fast by the bridle Meeting his eyes however he was so affected by the gentleness of his aspect and by the thought of the free life which Pegasus had heretofore lived that he could not bear to keep him a prisoner if he really desired his liberty Obeying this generous impulse he slipped the enchanted bridle off the head of Pegasus and took the bit from his mouth Leave me Pegasus said he Either leave me or love me In an instant the winged horse shot almost out of sight soaring upward from the summit of Mount Helicon Being long after sunset it was now twilight on the mountain top and dusky evening over all the country round about But Pegasus flew so high that he overtook the departed day and was bathed in the upper radiance of the sun Ascending higher and higher he looked like a bright speck and at last could no longer be seen in the hollow waste of the sky And Bellerophon was afraid that he should never behold him more But while he was lamenting his own folly the bright speck reappeared and drew nearer and nearer until it descended lower than the sunshine and behold Pegasus had come back After this trial there was no more fear of the winged horse s making his escape He and Bellerophon were friends and put loving faith in one another That night they lay down and slept together with Bellerophon s arm about the neck of Pegasus not as a caution but for kindness And they awoke at peep of day and bade one another good morning each in his own language In this manner Bellerophon and the wondrous steed spent several days and grew better acquainted and fonder of each other all the time They went on long aerial journeys and sometimes ascended so high that the earth looked hardly bigger than the moon They visited distant countries and amazed the inhabitants who thought that the beautiful young man on the back of the winged horse must have come down out of the sky A thousand miles a day was no more than an easy space for the fleet Pegasus to pass over Bellerophon was delighted with this kind of life and would have liked nothing better than to live always in the same way aloft in the clear atmosphere for it was always sunny weather up there however cheerless and rainy it might be in the lower region But he could not forget the horrible Chimaera which he had promised King Iobates to slay So at last when he had become well accustomed to feats of horsemanship in the air and could manage Pegasus with the least motion of his hand and had taught him to obey his voice he determined to attempt the performance of this perilous adventure At daybreak therefore as soon as he unclosed his eyes he gently pinched the winged horse s ear in order to arouse him Pegasus immediately started from the ground and pranced about a quarter of a mile aloft and made a grand sweep around the mountain top by way of showing that he was wide awake and ready for any kind of an excursion During the whole of this little flight he uttered a loud brisk and melodious neigh and finally came down at Bellerophon s side as lightly as ever you saw a sparrow hop upon a twig Well done dear Pegasus I well done my sky skimmer cried Bellerophon fondly stroking the horse s neck And now my fleet and beautiful friend we must break our fast To day we are to fight the terrible Chimaera As soon as they had eaten their morning meal and drank some sparkling water from a spring called Hippocrene Pegasus held out his head of his own accord so that his master might put on the bridle Then with a great many playful leaps and airy caperings he showed his impatience to be gone while Bellerophon was girding on his sword and hanging his shield about his neck and preparing himself for battle When everything was ready the rider mounted and as was his custom when going a long distance ascended five miles perpendicularly so as the better to see whither he was directing his course He then turned the head of Pegasus toward the east and set out for Lycia In their flight they overtook an eagle and came so nigh him before he could get out of their way that Bellerophon might easily have caught him by the leg Hastening onward at this rate it was still early in the forenoon when they beheld the lofty mountains of Lycia with their deep and shaggy valleys If Bellerophon had been told truly it was in one of those dismal valleys that the hideous Chimaera had taken up its abode Being now so near their journey s end the winged horse gradually descended with his rider and they took advantage of some clouds that were floating over the mountain tops in order to conceal themselves Hovering on the upper surface of a cloud and peeping over its edge Bellerophon had a pretty distinct view of the mountainous part of Lycia and could look into all its shadowy vales at once At first there appeared to be nothing remarkable It was a wild savage and rocky tract of high and precipitous hills In the more level part of the country there were the ruins of houses that had been burnt and here and there the carcasses of dead cattle strewn about the pastures where they had been feeding The Chimaera must have done this mischief thought Bellerophon But where can the monster be As I have already said there was nothing remarkable to be detected at first sight in any of the valleys and dells that lay among the precipitous heights of the mountains Nothing at all unless indeed it were three spires of black smoke which issued from what seemed to be the mouth of a cavern and clambered sullenly into the atmosphere Before reaching the mountain top these three black smoke wreaths mingled themselves into one The cavern was almost directly beneath the winged horse and his rider at the distance of about a thousand feet The smoke as it crept heavily upward had an ugly sulphurous stifling scent which caused Pegasus to snort and Bellerophon to sneeze So disagreeable was it to the marvellous steed who was accustomed to breathe only the purest air that he waved his wings and shot half a mile out of the range of this offensive vapour But on looking behind him Bellerophon saw something that induced him first to draw the bridle and then to turn Pegasus about He made a sign which the winged horse understood and sunk slowly through the air until his hoofs were scarcely more than a man s height above the rocky bottom of the valley In front as far off as you could throw a stone was the cavern s mouth with the three smoke wreaths oozing out of it And what else did Bellerophon behold there There seemed to be a heap of strange and terrible creatures curled up within the cavern Their bodies lay so close together that Bellerophon could not distinguish them apart but judging by their heads one of these creatures was a huge snake the second a fierce lion and the third an ugly goat The lion and the goat were asleep the snake was broad awake and kept staring around him with a great pair of fiery eyes But and this was the most wonderful part of the matter the three spires of smoke evidently issued from the nostrils of these three heads So strange was the spectacle that though Bellerophon had been all along expecting it the truth did not immediately occur to him that here was the terrible three headed Chimaera He had found out the Chimaera s cavern The snake the lion and the goat as he supposed them to be were not three separate creatures but one monster The wicked hateful thing Slumbering as two thirds of it were it still held in its abominable claws the remnant of an unfortunate lamb or possibly but I hate to think so it was a dear little boy which its three mouths had been gnawing before two of them fell asleep All at once Bellerophon started as from a dream and knew it to be the Chimaera Pegasus seemed to know it at the same instant and sent forth a neigh that sounded like the call of a trumpet to battle At this sound the three heads reared themselves erect and belched out great flashes of flame Before Bellerophon had time to consider what to do next the monster flung itself out of the cavern and sprung straight toward him with its immense claws extended and its snaky tail twisting itself venomously behind If Pegasus had not been as nimble as a bird both he and his rider would have been overthrown by the Chimaera s headlong rush and thus the battle have been ended before it was well begun But the winged horse was not to be caught so In the twinkling of an eye he was up aloft half way to the clouds snorting with anger He shuddered too not with affright but with utter disgust at the loathsomeness of this poisonous thing with three heads The Chimaera on the other hand raised itself up so as to stand absolutely on the tip end of its tail with its talons pawing fiercely in the air and its three heads sputtering fire at Pegasus and his rider My stars how it roared and hissed and bellowed Bellerophon meanwhile was fitting his shield on his arm and drawing his sword Now my beloved Pegasus he whispered in the winged horse s ear thou must help me to slay this insufferable monster or else thou shalt fly back to thy solitary mountain peak without thy friend Bellerophon For either the Chimaera dies or its three mouths shall gnaw this head of mine which has slumbered upon thy neck Pegasus whinnied and turning back his head rubbed his nose tenderly against his rider s cheek It was his way of telling him that though he had wings and was an immortal horse yet he would perish if it were possible for immortality to perish rather than leave Bellerophon behind I thank you Pegasus answered Bellerophon Now then let us make a dash at the monster Uttering these words he shook the bridle and Pegasus darted down aslant as swift as the flight of an arrow right toward the Chimaera s threefold head which all this time was poking itself as high as it could into the air As he came within arm s length Bellerophon made a cut at the monster but was carried onward by his steed before he could see whether the blow had been successful Pegasus continued his course but soon wheeled round at about the same distance from the Chimaera as before Bellerophon then perceived that he had cut the goat s head of the monster almost off so that it dangled downward by the skin and seemed quite dead But to make amends the snake s head and the lion s head had taken all the fierceness of the dead one into themselves and spit flame and hissed and roared with a vast deal more fury than before Never mind my brave Pegasus cried Bellerophon With another stroke like that we will stop either its hissing or its roaring And again he shook the bridle Dashing aslantwise as before the winged horse made another arrow flight toward the Chimaera and Bellerophon aimed another downright stroke at one of the two remaining heads as he shot by But this time neither he nor Pegasus escaped so well as at first With one of its claws the Chimaera had given the young man a deep scratch in his shoulder and had slightly damaged the left wing of the flying steed with the other On his part Bellerophon had mortally wounded the lion s head of the monster insomuch that it now hung downward with its fire almost extinguished and sending out gasps of thick black smoke The snake s head however which was the only one now left was twice as fierce and venomous as ever before It belched forth shoots of fire five hundred yards long and emitted hisses so loud so harsh and so ear piercing that King Iobates heard them fifty miles off and trembled till the throne shook under him Well a day thought the poor king the Chimaera is certainly coming to devour me Meanwhile Pegasus had again paused in the air and neighed angrily while sparkles of a pure crystal flame darted out of his eyes How unlike the lurid fire of the Chimaera The aerial steed s spirit was all aroused and so was that of Bellerophon Dost thou bleed my immortal horse cried the young man caring less for his own hurt than for the anguish of this glorious creature that ought never to have tasted pain The execrable Chimaera shall pay for this mischief with his last head Then he shook the bridle shouted loudly and guided Pegasus not aslantwise as before but straight at the monster s hideous front So rapid was the onset that it seemed but a dazzle and a flash before Bellerophon was at close gripes with his enemy The Chimaera by this time after losing its second head had got into a red hot passion of pain and rampant rage It so flounced about half on earth and partly in the air that it was impossible to say which element it rested upon It opened its snake jaws to such an abominable width that Pegasus might almost I was going to say have flown right down its throat wings outspread rider and all At their approach it shot out a tremendous blast of its fiery breath and enveloped Bellerophon and his steed in a perfect atmosphere of flame singeing the wings of Pegasus scorching off one whole side of the young man s golden ringlets and making them both far hotter than was comfortable from head to foot But this was nothing to what followed When the airy rush of the winged horse had brought him within the distance of a hundred yards the Chimaera gave a spring and flung its huge awkward venomous and utterly detestable carcass right upon poor Pegasus clung round him with might and main and tied up its snaky tail into a knot Up flew the aerial steed higher higher higher above the mountain peak above the clouds and almost out of sight of the solid earth But still the earth born monster kept its hold and was borne upward along with the creature of light and air Bellerophon meanwhile turning about found himself face to face with the ugly grimness of the Chimaera s visage and could only avoid being scorched to death or bitten right in twain by holding up his shield Over the upper edge of the shield he looked sternly into the savage eyes of the monster But the Chimaera was so mad and wild with pain that it did not guard itself so well as might else have been the case Perhaps after all the best way to fight a Chimaera is by getting as close to it as you can In its efforts to stick its horrible iron claws into its enemy the creature left its own breast quite exposed and perceiving this Bellerophon thrust his sword up to the hilt into its cruel heart Immediately the snaky tail untied its knot The monster let go its hold of Pegasus and fell from that vast height downward while the fire within its bosom instead of being put out burned fiercer than ever and quickly began to consume the dead carcass Thus it fell out of the sky all a flame and it being nightfall before it reached the earth was mistaken for a shooting star or a comet But at early sunrise some cottagers were going to their day s labour and saw to their astonishment that several acres of ground were strewn with black ashes In the middle of a field there was a heap of whitened bones a great deal higher than a haystack Nothing else was ever seen of the dreadful Chimaera And when Bellerophon had won the victory he bent forward and kissed Pegasus while the tears stood in his eyes Back now my beloved steed said he Back to the Fountain of Pirene Pegasus skimmed through the air quicker than ever he did before and reached the fountain in a very short time And there he found the old man leaning on his staff and the country fellow watering his cow and the pretty maiden filling her pitcher I remember now quoth the old man I saw this winged horse once before when I was quite a lad But he was ten times handsomer in those days I own a cart horse worth three of him said the country fellow If this pony were mine the first thing I should do would be to clip his wings But the poor maiden said nothing for she had always the luck to be afraid at the wrong time So she ran away and let her pitcher tumble down and broke it Where is the gentle child asked Bellerophon who used to keep me company and never lost his faith and never was weary of gazing into the fountain Here am I dear Bellerophon said the child softly For the little boy had spent day after day on the margin of Pirene waiting for his friend to come back but when he perceived Bellerophon descending through the clouds mounted on the winged horse he had shrunk back into the shrubbery He was a delicate and tender child and dreaded lest the old man and the country fellow should see the tears gushing from his eyes Thou hast won the victory said he joyfully running to the knee of Bellerophon who still sat on the back of Pegasus I knew thou wouldst Yes dear child replied Bellerophon alighting from the winged horse But if thy faith had not helped me I should never have waited for Pegasus and never have gone up above the clouds and never have conquered the terrible Chimaera Thou my beloved little friend hast done it all And now let us give Pegasus his liberty So he slipped off the enchanted bridle from the head of the marvellous steed Be free forevermore my Pegasus cried he with a shade of sadness in his tone Be as free as thou art fleet But Pegasus rested his head on Bellerophon s shoulder and would not be persuaded to take flight Well then said Bellerophon caressing the airy horse thou shalt be with me as long as thou wilt and we will go together forthwith and tell King Iobates that the Chimaera is destroyed Then Bellerophon embraced the gentle child and promised to come to him again and departed But in after years that child took higher flights upon the aerial steed than ever did Bellerophon and achieved more honourable deeds than his friend s victory over the Chimaera For gentle and tender as he was he grew to be a mighty poet CHAPTER IV THE GOLDEN TOUCH Once upon a time there lived a very rich man and a king besides whose name was Midas and he had a little daughter whom nobody but myself ever heard of and whose name I either never knew or have entirely forgotten So because I love odd names for little girls I choose to call her Marygold This King Midas was fonder of gold than of anything else in the world He valued his royal crown chiefly because it was composed of that precious metal If he loved anything better or half so well it was the one little maiden who played so merrily around her father s footstool But the more Midas loved his daughter the more did he desire and seek for wealth He thought foolish man that the best thing he could possibly do for this dear child would be to bequeath her the immensest pile of yellow glistening coin that had ever been heaped together since the world was made Thus he gave all his thoughts and all his time to this one purpose If ever he happened to gaze for an instant at the gold tinted clouds of sunset he wished that they were real gold and that they could be squeezed safely into his strong box When little Marygold ran to meet him with a bunch of buttercups and dandelions he used to say Poh poh child If these flowers were as golden as they look they would be worth the plucking And yet in his earlier days before he was so entirely possessed of this insane desire for riches King Midas had shown a great taste for flowers He had planted a garden in which grew the biggest and beautifullest and sweetest roses that any mortal ever saw or smelt These roses were still growing in the garden as large as lovely and as fragrant as when Midas used to pass whole hours in gazing at them and inhaling their perfume But now if he looked at them at all it was only to calculate how much the garden would be worth if each of the innumerable rose petals were a thin plate of gold And though he once was fond of music in spite of an idle story about his ears which were said to resemble those of an ass the only music for poor Midas now was the chink of one coin against another At length as people always grow more and more foolish unless they take care to grow wiser and wiser Midas had got to be so exceedingly unreasonable that he could scarcely bear to see or touch any object that was not gold He made it his custom therefore to pass a large portion of every day in a dark and dreary apartment under ground at the basement of his palace It was here that he kept his wealth To this dismal hole for it was little better than a dungeon Midas betook himself whenever he wanted to be particularly happy Here after carefully locking the door he would take a bag of gold coin or a gold cup as big as a washbowl or a heavy golden bar or a peck measure of gold dust and bring them from the obscure corners of the room into the one bright and narrow sunbeam that fell from the dungeon like window He valued the sunbeam for no other reason but that his treasure would not shine without its help And then would he reckon over the coins in the bag toss up the bar and catch it as it came down sift the gold dust through his fingers look at the funny image of his own face as reflected in the burnished circumference of the cup and whisper to himself O Midas rich King Midas what a happy man art thou But it was laughable to see how the image of his face kept grinning at him out of the polished surface of the cup It seemed to be aware of his foolish behaviour and to have a naughty inclination to make fun of him Midas called himself a happy man but felt that he was not yet quite so happy as he might be The very tiptop of enjoyment would never be reached unless the whole world were to become his treasure room and be filled with yellow metal which should be all his own Now I need hardly remind such wise little people as you are that in the old old times when King Midas was alive a great many things came to pass which we should consider wonderful if they were to happen in our own day and country And on the other hand a great many things take place nowadays which seem not only wonderful to us but at which the people of old times would have stared their eyes out On the whole I regard our own times as the strangest of the two but however that may be I must go on with my story Midas was enjoying himself in his treasure room one day as usual when he perceived a shadow fall over the heaps of gold and looking suddenly up what should he behold but the figure of a stranger standing in the bright and narrow sunbeam It was a young man with a cheerful and ruddy face Whether it was that the imagination of King Midas threw a yellow tinge over everything or whatever the cause might be he could not help fancying that the smile with which the stranger regarded him had a kind of golden radiance in it Certainly although his figure intercepted the sunshine there was now a brighter gleam upon all the piled up treasures than before Even the remotest corners had their share of it and were lighted up when the stranger smiled as with tips of flame and sparkles of fire As Midas knew that he had carefully turned the key in the lock and that no mortal strength could possibly break into his treasure room he of course concluded that his visitor must be something more than mortal It is no matter about telling you who he was In those days when the earth was comparatively a new affair it was supposed to be often the resort of beings endowed with supernatural power and who used to interest themselves in the joys and sorrows of men women and children half playfully and half seriously Midas had met such beings before now and was not sorry to meet one of them again The stranger s aspect indeed was so good humoured and kindly if not beneficent that it would have been unreasonable to suspect him of intending any mischief It was far more probable that he came to do Midas a favour And what could that favour be unless to multiply his heaps of treasure The stranger gazed about the room and when his lustrous smile had glistened upon all the golden objects that were there he turned again to Midas You are a wealthy man friend Midas he observed I doubt whether any other four walls on earth contain so much gold as you have contrived to pile up in this room I have done pretty well pretty well answered Midas in a discontented tone But after all it is but a trifle when you consider that it has taken me my whole life to get it together If one could live a thousand years he might have time to grow rich What exclaimed the stranger Then you are not satisfied Midas shook his head And pray what would satisfy you asked the stranger Merely for the curiosity of the thing I should be glad to know Midas paused and meditated He felt a presentiment that this stranger with such a golden lustre in his good humoured smile had come hither with both the power and the purpose of gratifying his utmost wishes Now therefore was the fortunate moment when he had but to speak and obtain whatever possible or seemingly impossible thing it might come into his head to ask So he thought and thought and thought and heaped up one golden mountain upon another in his imagination without being able to imagine them big enough At last a bright idea occurred to King Midas It seemed really as bright as the glistening metal which he loved so much Raising his head he looked the lustrous stranger in the face Well Midas observed his visitor I see that you have at length hit upon something that will satisfy you Tell me your wish It is only this replied Midas I am weary of collecting my treasures with so much trouble and beholding the heap so diminutive after I have done my best I wish everything that I touch to be changed to gold The stranger s smile grew so very broad that it seemed to fill the room like an outburst of the sun gleaming into a shadowy dell where the yellow autumnal leaves for so looked the lumps and particles of gold lie strewn in the glow of light The Golden Touch exclaimed he You certainly deserve credit friend Midas for striking out so brilliant a conception But are you quite sure that this will satisfy you How could it fail said Midas And will you never regret the possession of it What could induce me asked Midas I ask nothing else to render me perfectly happy Be it as you wish then replied the stranger waving his hand in token of farewell To morrow at sunrise you will find yourself gifted with the Golden Touch The figure of the stranger then became exceedingly bright and Midas involuntarily closed his eyes On opening them again he beheld only one yellow sunbeam in the room and all around him the glistening of the precious metal which he had spent his life in hoarding up Whether Midas slept as usual that night the story does not say Asleep or awake however his mind was probably in the state of a child s to whom a beautiful new plaything has been promised in the morning At any rate day had hardly peeped over the hills when King Midas was broad awake and stretching his arms out of bed began to touch the objects that were within reach He was anxious to prove whether the Golden Touch had really come according to the stranger s promise So he laid his finger on a chair by the bedside and on various other things but was grievously disappointed to perceive that they remained of exactly the same substance as before Indeed he felt very much afraid that he had only dreamed about the lustrous stranger or else that the latter had been making game of him And what a miserable affair would it be if after all his hopes Midas must content himself with what little gold he could scrape together by ordinary means instead of creating it by a touch All this while it was only the gray of the morning with but a streak of brightness along the edge of the sky where Midas could not see it He lay in a very disconsolate mood regretting the downfall of his hopes and kept growing sadder and sadder until the earliest sunbeam shone through the window and gilded the ceiling over his head It seemed to Midas that this bright yellow sunbeam was reflected in rather a singular way on the white covering of the bed Looking more closely what was his astonishment and delight when he found that this linen fabric had been transmuted to what seemed a woven texture of the purest and brightest gold The Golden Touch had come to him with the first sunbeam Midas started up in a kind of joyful frenzy and ran about the room grasping at everything that happened to be in his way He seized one of the bedposts and it became immediately a fluted golden pillar He pulled aside a window curtain in order to admit a clear spectacle of the wonders which he was performing and the tassel grew heavy in his hand a mass of gold He took up a book from the table At his first touch it assumed the appearance of such a splendidly bound and gilt edged volume as one often meets with nowadays but on running his fingers through the leaves behold it was a bundle of thin golden plates in which all the wisdom of the book had grown illegible He hurriedly put on his clothes and was enraptured to see himself in a magnificent suit of gold cloth which retained its flexibility and softness although it burdened him a little with its weight He drew out his handkerchief which little Marygold had hemmed for him That was likewise gold with the dear child s neat and pretty stitches running all along the border in gold thread Somehow or other this last transformation did not quite please King Midas He would rather that his little daughter s handiwork should have remained just the same as when she climbed his knee and put it into his hand But it was not worth while to vex himself about a trifle Midas now took his spectacles from his pocket and put them on his nose in order that he might see more distinctly what he was about In those days spectacles for common people had not been invented but were already worn by kings else how could Midas have had any To his great perplexity however excellent as the glasses were he discovered that he could not possibly see through them But this was the most natural thing in the world for on taking them off the transparent crystals turned out to be plates of yellow metal and of course were worthless as spectacles though valuable as gold It struck Midas as rather inconvenient that with all his wealth he could never again be rich enough to own a pair of serviceable spectacles It is no great matter nevertheless said he to himself very philosophically We cannot expect any great good without its being accompanied with some small inconvenience The Golden Touch is worth the sacrifice of a pair of spectacles at least if not of one s very eyesight My own eyes will serve for ordinary purposes and little Marygold will soon be old enough to read to me Wise King Midas was so exalted by his good fortune that the palace seemed not sufficiently spacious to contain him He therefore went downstairs and smiled on observing that the balustrade of the staircase became a bar of burnished gold as his hand passed over it in his descent He lifted the doorlatch it was brass only a moment ago but golden when his fingers quitted it and emerged into the garden Here as it happened he found a great number of beautiful roses in full bloom and others in all the stages of lovely bud and blossom Very delicious was their fragrance in the morning breeze Their delicate blush was one of the fairest sights in the world so gentle so modest and so full of sweet tranquillity did these roses seem to be But Midas knew a way to make them far more precious according to his way of thinking than roses had ever been before So he took great pains in going from bush to bush and exercised his magic touch most indefatigably until every individual flower and bud and even the worms at the heart of some of them were changed to gold By the time this good work was completed King Midas was summoned to breakfast and as the morning air had given him an excellent appetite he made haste back to the palace What was usually a king s breakfast in the days of Midas I really do not know and cannot stop now to investigate To the best of my belief however on this particular morning the breakfast consisted of hot cakes some nice little brook trout roasted potatoes fresh boiled eggs and coffee for King Midas himself and a bowl of bread and milk for his daughter Marygold At all events this is a breakfast fit to set before a king and whether he had it or not King Midas could not have had a better Little Marygold had not yet made her appearance Her father ordered her to be called and seating himself at table awaited the child s coming in order to begin his own breakfast To do Midas justice he really loved his daughter and loved her so much the more this morning on account of the good fortune which had befallen him It was not a great while before he heard her coming along the passageway crying bitterly This circumstance surprised him because Marygold was one of the cheerfullest little people whom you would see in a summer s day and hardly shed a thimbleful of tears in a twelvemonth When Midas heard her sobs he determined to put little Marygold into better spirits by an agreeable surprise so leaning across the table he touched his daughter s bowl which was a china one with pretty figures all around it and transmuted it to gleaming gold Meanwhile Marygold slowly and disconsolately opened the door and showed herself with her apron at her eyes still sobbing as if her heart would break How now my little lady cried Midas Pray what is the matter with you this bright morning Marygold without taking the apron from her eyes held out her hand in which was one of the roses which Midas had so recently transmuted Beautiful exclaimed her father And what is there in this magnificent golden rose to make you cry Ah dear father answered the child as well as her sobs would let her it is not beautiful but the ugliest flower that ever grew As soon as I was dressed I ran into the garden to gather some roses for you because I know you like them and like them the better when gathered by your little daughter But oh dear dear me What do you think has happened Such a misfortune All the beautiful roses that smelled so sweetly and had so many lovely blushes are blighted and spoilt They are grown quite yellow as you see this one and have no longer any fragrance What can have been the matter with them Poh my dear little girl pray don t cry about it said Midas who was ashamed to confess that he himself had wrought the change which so greatly afflicted her Sit down and eat your bread and milk You will find it easy enough to exchange a golden rose like that which will last hundreds of years for an ordinary one which would wither in a day I don t care for such roses as this cried Marygold tossing it contemptuously away It has no smell and the hard petals prick my nose The child now sat down to table but was so occupied with her grief for the blighted roses that she did not even notice the wonderful transmutation of her china bowl Perhaps this was all the better for Marygold was accustomed to take pleasure in looking at the queer figures and strange trees and houses that were painted on the circumference of the bowl and these ornaments were now entirely lost in the yellow hue of the metal Midas meanwhile had poured out a cup of coffee and as a matter of course the Coffee pot whatever metal it may have been when he took it up was gold when he set it down He thought to himself that it was rather an extravagant style of splendour in a king of his simple habits to breakfast off a service of gold and began to be puzzled with the difficulty of keeping his treasures safe The cupboard and the kitchen would no longer be a secure place of deposit for articles so valuable as golden bowls and coffee pots Amid these thoughts he lifted a spoonful of coffee to his lips and sipping it was astonished to perceive that the instant his lips touched the liquid it became molten gold and the next moment hardened into a lump Ha exclaimed Midas rather aghast What is the matter father asked little Marygold gazing at him with the tears still standing in her eyes Nothing child nothing said Midas Eat your milk before it gets quite cold He took one of the nice little trouts on his plate and by way of experiment touched its tail with his finger To his horror it was immediately transmuted from an admirably fried brook trout into a gold fish though not one of those gold fishes which people often keep in glass globes as ornaments for the parlour No but it was really a metallic fish and looked as if it had been very cunningly made by the nicest goldsmith in the world Its little bones were now golden wires its fins and tail were thin plates of gold and there were the marks of the fork in it and all the delicate frothy appearance of a nicely fried fish exactly imitated in metal A very pretty piece of work as you may suppose only King Midas just at that moment would much rather have had a real trout in his dish than this elaborate and valuable imitation of one I don t quite see thought he to himself how I am to get any breakfast He took one of the smoking hot cakes and had scarcely broken it when to his cruel mortification though a moment before it had been of the whitest wheat it assumed the yellow hue of Indian meal To say the truth if it had really been a hot Indian cake Midas would have prized it a good deal more than he now did when its solidity and increased weight made him too bitterly sensible that it was gold Almost in despair he helped himself to a boiled egg which immediately underwent a change similar to those of the trout and the cake The egg indeed might have been mistaken for one of those which the famous goose in the story book was in the habit of laying but King Midas was the only goose that had had anything to do with the matter Well this is a quandary thought he leaning back in his chair and looking quite enviously at little Marygold who was now eating her bread and milk with great satisfaction Such a costly breakfast before me and nothing that can be eaten Hoping that by dint of great dispatch he might avoid what he now felt to be a considerable inconvenience King Midas next snatched a hot potato and attempted to cram it into his mouth and swallow it in a hurry But the Golden Touch was too nimble for him He found his mouth full not of mealy potato but of solid metal which so burnt his tongue that he roared aloud and jumping up from the table began to dance and stamp about the room both with pain and affright Father dear father cried little Marygold who was a very affectionate child pray what is the matter Have you burnt your mouth Ah dear child groaned Midas dolefully I don t know what is to become of your poor father And truly my dear little folks did you ever hear of such a pitiable case in all your lives Here was literally the richest breakfast that could be set before a king and its very richness made it absolutely good for nothing The poorest labourer sitting down to his crust of bread and cup of water was far better off than King Midas whose delicate food was really worth its weight in gold And what was to be done Already at breakfast Midas was excessively hungry Would he be less so by dinner time And how ravenous would be his appetite for supper which must undoubtedly consist of the same sort of indigestible dishes as those now before him How many days think you would he survive a continuance of this rich fare These reflections so troubled wise King Midas that he began to doubt whether after all riches are the one desirable thing in the world or even the most desirable But this was only a passing thought So fascinated was Midas with the glitter of the yellow metal that he would still have refused to give up the Golden Touch for so paltry a consideration as a breakfast Just imagine what a price for one meal s victuals It would have been the same as paying millions and millions of money and as many millions more as would take forever to reckon up for some fried trout an egg a potato a hot cake and a cup of coffee It would be quite too dear thought Midas Nevertheless so great was his hunger and the perplexity of his situation that he again groaned aloud and very grievously too Our pretty Marygold could endure it no longer She sat a moment gazing at her father and trying with all the might of her little wits to find out what was the matter with him Then with a sweet and sorrowful impulse to comfort him she started from her chair and running to Midas threw her arms affectionately about his knees He bent down and kissed her He felt that his little daughter s love was worth a thousand times more than he had gained by the Golden Touch My precious precious Marygold cried he But Marygold made no answer Alas what had he done How fatal was the gift which the stranger bestowed The moment the lips of Midas touched Marygold s forehead a change had taken place Her sweet rosy face so full of affection as it had been assumed a glittering yellow colour with yellow tear drops congealing on her cheeks Her beautiful brown ringlets took the same tint Her soft and tender little form grew hard and inflexible within her father s encircling arms Oh terrible misfortune The victim of his insatiable desire for wealth little Marygold was a human child no longer but a golden statue Yes there she was with the questioning look of love grief and pity hardened into her face It was the prettiest and most woeful sight that ever mortal saw All the features and tokens of Marygold were there even the beloved little dimple remained in her golden chin But the more perfect was the resemblance the greater was the father s agony at beholding this golden image which was all that was left him of a daughter It had been a favourite phrase of Midas whenever he felt particularly fond of the child to say that she was worth her weight in gold And now the phrase had become literally true And now at last when it was too late he felt how infinitely a warm and tender heart that loved him exceeded in value all the wealth that could be piled up betwixt the earth and sky It would be too sad a story if I were to tell you how Midas in the fulness of all his gratified desires began to wring his hands and bemoan himself and how he could neither bear to look at Marygold nor yet to look away from her Except when his eyes were fixed on the image he could not possibly believe that she was changed to gold But stealing another glance there was the precious little figure with a yellow tear drop on its yellow cheek and a look so piteous and tender that it seemed as if that very expression must needs soften the gold and make it flesh again This however could not be So Midas had only to wring his hands and to wish that he were the poorest man in the wide world if the loss of all his wealth might bring back the faintest rose colour to his dear child s face While he was in this tumult of despair he suddenly beheld a stranger standing near the door Midas bent down his head without speaking for he recognised the same figure which had appeared to him the day before in the treasure room and had bestowed on him this disastrous faculty of the Golden Touch The stranger s countenance still wore a smile which seemed to shed a yellow lustre all about the room and gleamed on little Marygold s image and on the other objects that had been transmuted by the touch of Midas Well friend Midas said the stranger pray how do you succeed with the Golden Touch Midas shook his head I am very miserable said he Very miserable indeed exclaimed the stranger And how happens that Have I not faithfully kept my promise with you Have you not everything that your heart desired Gold is not everything answered Midas And I have lost all that my heart really cared for Ah So you have made a discovery since yesterday observed the stranger Let us see then Which of these two things do you think is really worth the most the gift of the Golden Touch or one cup of clear cold water O blessed water exclaimed Midas I will never moisten my parched throat again The Golden Touch continued the stranger or a crust of bread A piece of bread answered Midas is worth all the gold on earth The Golden Touch asked the stranger or your own little Marygold warm soft and loving as she was an hour ago Oh my child my dear child cried poor Midas wringing his hands I would not have given that one small dimple in her chin for the power of changing this whole big earth into a solid lump of gold You are wiser than you were King Midas said the stranger looking seriously at him Your own heart I perceive has not been entirely changed from flesh to gold Were it so your case would indeed be desperate But you appear to be still capable of understanding that the commonest things such as lie within everybody s grasp are more valuable than the riches which so many mortals sigh and struggle after Tell me now do you sincerely desire to rid yourself of this Golden Touch It is hateful to me replied Midas A fly settled on his nose but immediately fell to the floor for it too had become gold Midas shuddered Go then said the stranger and plunge into the river that glides past the bottom of your garden Take likewise a vase of the same water and sprinkle it over any object that you may desire to change back again from gold into its former substance If you do this in earnestness and sincerity it may possibly repair the mischief which your avarice has occasioned King Midas bowed low and when he lifted his head the lustrous stranger had vanished You will easily believe that Midas lost no time in snatching up a great earthen pitcher but alas me it was no longer earthen after he touched it and hastening to the river side As he scampered along and forced his way through the shrubbery it was positively marvellous to see how the foliage turned yellow behind him as if the autumn had been there and nowhere else On reaching the river s brink he plunged headlong in without waiting so much as to pull off his shoes Poof poof poof snorted King Midas as his head emerged out of the water Well this is really a refreshing bath and I think it must have quite washed away the Golden Touch And now for filling my pitcher As he dipped the pitcher into the water it gladdened his very heart to see it change from gold into the same good honest earthen vessel which it had been before he touched it He was conscious also of a change within himself A cold hard and heavy weight seemed to have gone out of his bosom No doubt his heart had been gradually losing its human substance and transmuting itself into insensible metal but had now softened back again into flesh Perceiving a violet that grew on the bank of the river Midas touched it with his finger and was overjoyed to find that the delicate flower retained its purple hue instead of undergoing a yellow blight The curse of the Golden Touch had therefore really been removed from him King Midas hastened back to the palace and I suppose the servants knew not what to make of it when they saw their royal master so carefully bringing home an earthen pitcher of water But that water which was to undo all the mischief that his folly had wrought was more precious to Midas than an ocean of molten gold could have been The first thing he did as you need hardly be told was to sprinkle it by handfuls over the golden figure of little Marygold No sooner did it fall on her than you would have laughed to see how the rosy colour came back to the dear child s cheek and how she began to sneeze and sputter and how astonished she was to find herself dripping wet and her father still throwing more water over her Pray do not dear father cried she See how you have wet my nice frock which I put on only this morning For Marygold did not know that she had been a little golden statue nor could she remember anything that had happened since the moment when she ran with outstretched arms to comfort poor King Midas Her father did not think it necessary to tell his beloved child how very foolish he had been but contented himself with showing how much wiser he had now grown For this purpose he led little Marygold into the garden where he sprinkled all the remainder of the water over the rose bushes and with such good effect that above five thousand roses recovered their beautiful bloom There were two circumstances however which as long as he lived used to put King Midas in mind of the Golden Touch One was that the sands of the river sparkled like gold the other that little Marygold s hair had now a golden tinge which he had never observed in it before she had been transmuted by the effect of his kiss This change of hue was really an improvement and made Marygold s hair richer than in her babyhood When King Midas had grown quite an old man and used to trot Mary gold s children on his knee he was fond of telling them this marvellous story pretty much as I have now told it to you And then would he stroke their glossy ringlets and tell them that their hair likewise had a rich shade of gold which they had inherited from their mother And to tell you the truth my precious little folks quoth King Midas diligently trotting the children all the while ever since that morning I have hated the very sight of all other gold save this CHAPTER V THE GORGON S HEAD Perseus was the son of Danae who was the daughter of a king And when Perseus was a very little boy some wicked people put his mother and himself into a chest and set them afloat upon the sea The wind blew freshly and drove the chest away from the shore and the uneasy billows tossed it up and down while Danae clasped her child closely to her bosom and dreaded that some big wave would dash its foamy crest over them both The chest sailed on however and neither sank nor was upset until when night was coming it floated so near an island that it got entangled in a fisherman s nets and was drawn out high and dry upon the sand The island was called Seriphus and it was reigned over by King Polydectes who happened to be the fisherman s brother This fisherman I am glad to tell you was an exceedingly humane and upright man He showed great kindness to Danae and her little boy and continued to befriend them until Perseus had grown to be a handsome youth very strong and active and skilful in the use of arms Long before this time King Polydectes had seen the two strangers the mother and her child who had come to his dominions in a floating chest As he was not good and kind like his brother the fisherman but extremely wicked he resolved to send Perseus on a dangerous enterprise in which he would probably be killed and then to do some great mischief to Danae herself So this bad hearted king spent a long while in considering what was the most dangerous thing that a young man could possibly undertake to perform At last having hit upon an enterprise that promised to turn out as fatally as he desired he sent for the youthful Perseus The young man came to the palace and found the king sitting upon his throne Perseus said King Polydectes smiling craftily upon him you are grown up a fine young man You and your good mother have received a great deal of kindness from myself as well as from my worthy brother the fisherman and I suppose you would not be sorry to repay some of it Please Your Majesty answered Perseus I would willingly risk my life to do so Well then continued the king still with a cunning smile on his lips I have a little adventure to propose to you and as you are a brave and enterprising youth you will doubtless look upon it as a great piece of good luck to have so rare an opportunity of distinguishing yourself You must know my good Perseus I think of getting married to the beautiful Princess Hippodamia and it is customary on these occasions to make the bride a present of some far fetched and elegant curiosity I have been a little perplexed I must honestly confess where to obtain anything likely to please a princess of her exquisite taste But this morning I flatter myself I have thought of precisely the article And can I assist Your Majesty in obtaining it cried Perseus eagerly You can if you are as brave a youth as I believe you to be replied King Polydectes with the utmost graciousness of manner The bridal gift which I have set my heart on presenting to the beautiful Hippodamia is the head of the Gorgon Medusa with the snaky locks and I depend on you my dear Perseus to bring it to me So as I am anxious to settle affairs with the princess the sooner you go in quest of the Gorgon the better I shall be pleased I will set out to morrow morning answered Perseus Pray do so my gallant youth rejoined the king And Perseus in cutting off the Gorgon s head be careful to make a clean stroke so as not to injure its appearance You must bring it home in the very best condition in order to suit the exquisite taste of the beautiful Princess Hippodamia Perseus left the palace but was scarcely out of hearing before Polydectes burst into a laugh being greatly amused wicked king that he was to find how readily the young man fell into the snare The news quickly spread abroad that Perseus had undertaken to cut off the head of Medusa with the snaky locks Everybody was rejoiced for most of the inhabitants of the island were as wicked as the king himself and would have liked nothing better than to see some enormous mischief happen to Danae and her son The only good man in this unfortunate island of Seriphus appears to have been the fisherman As Perseus walked along therefore the people pointed after him and made mouths and winked to one another and ridiculed him as loudly as they dared Ho ho cried they Medusa s snakes will sting him soundly Now there were three Gorgons alive at that period and they were the most strange and terrible monsters that had ever been since the world was made or that have been seen in after days or that are likely to be seen in all time to come I hardly know what sort of creature or hobgoblin to call them They were three sisters and seem to have borne some distant resemblance to women but were really a very frightful and mischievous species of dragon It is indeed difficult to imagine what hideous beings these three sisters were Why instead of locks of hair if you can believe me they had each of them a hundred enormous snakes growing on their heads all alive twisting wriggling curling and thrusting out their venomous tongues with forked stings at the end The teeth of the Gorgons were terribly long tusks their hands were made of brass and their bodies were all over scales which if not iron were something as hard and impenetrable They had wings too and exceedingly splendid ones I can assure you for every feather in them was pure bright glittering burnished gold and they looked very dazzlingly no doubt when the Gorgons were flying about in the sunshine But when people happened to catch a glimpse of their glittering brightness aloft in the air they seldom stopped to gaze but ran and hid themselves as speedily as they could You will think perhaps that they were afraid of being stung by the serpents that served the Gorgons instead of hair or of having their heads bitten off by their ugly tusks or of being torn all to pieces by their brazen claws Well to be sure these were some of the dangers but by no means the greatest nor the most difficult to avoid For the worst thing about these abominable Gorgons was that if once a poor mortal fixed his eyes full upon one of their faces he was certain that very instant to be changed from warm flesh and blood into cold and lifeless stone Thus as you will easily perceive it was a very dangerous adventure that the wicked King Polydectes had contrived for this innocent young man Perseus himself when he had thought over the matter could not help seeing that he had very little chance of coming safely through it and that he was far more likely to become a stone image than to bring back the head of Medusa with the snaky locks For not to speak of other difficulties there was one which it would have puzzled an older man than Perseus to get over Not only must he fight with and slay this golden winged iron scaled long tusked brazen clawed snaky haired monster but he must do it with his eyes shut or at least without so much as a glance at the enemy with whom he was contending Else while his arm was lifted to strike he would stiffen into stone and stand with that uplifted arm for centuries until time and the wind and weather should crumble him quite away This would be a very sad thing to befall a young man who wanted to perform a great many brave deeds and to enjoy a great deal of happiness in this bright and beautiful world So disconsolate did these thoughts make him that Perseus could not bear to tell his mother what he had undertaken to do He therefore took his shield girded on his sword and crossed over from the island to the mainland where he sat down in a solitary place and hardly refrained from shedding tears But while he was in this sorrowful mood he heard a voice close beside him Perseus said the voice why are you sad He lifted his head from his hands in which he had hidden it and behold all alone as Perseus had supposed himself to be there was a stranger in the solitary place It was a brisk intelligent and remarkably shrewd looking young man with a cloak over his shoulders an odd sort of cap on his head a strangely twisted staff in his hand and a short and very crooked sword hanging by his side He was exceedingly light and active in his figure like a person much accustomed to gymnastic exercises and well able to leap or run Above all the stranger had such a cheerful knowing and helpful aspect though it was certainly a little mischievous into the bargain that Perseus could not help feeling his spirits grow livelier as he gazed at him Besides being really a courageous youth he felt greatly ashamed that anybody should have found him with tears in his eyes like a timid little schoolboy when after all there might be no occasion for despair So Perseus wiped his eyes and answered the stranger pretty briskly putting on as brave a look as he could I am not so very sad said he only thoughtful about an adventure that I have undertaken Oho answered the stranger Well tell me all about it and possibly I may be of service to you I have helped a good many young men through adventures that looked difficult enough beforehand Perhaps you may have heard of me I have more names than one but the name of Quicksilver suits me as well as any other Tell me what the trouble is and we will talk the matter over and see what can be done The stranger s words and manner put Perseus into quite a different mood from his former one He resolved to tell Quicksilver all his difficulties since he could not easily be worse off than he already was and very possibly his new friend might give him some advice that would turn out well in the end So he let the stranger know in few words precisely what the case was how that King Polydectes wanted the head of Medusa with the snaky locks as a bridal gift for the beautiful Princess Hippodamia and how that he had undertaken to get it for him but was afraid of being turned into stone And that would be a great pity said Quicksilver with his mischievous smile You would make a very handsome marble statue it is true and it would be a considerable number of centuries before you crumbled away but on the whole one would rather be a young man for a few years than a stone image for a great many Oh far rather exclaimed Perseus with the tears again standing in his eyes And besides what would my dear mother do if her beloved son were turned into a stone Well well let us hope that the affair will not turn out so very badly replied Quicksilver in an encouraging tone I am the very person to help you if anybody can My sister and myself will do our utmost to bring you safe through the adventure ugly as it now looks Your sister repeated Perseus Yes my sister said the stranger She is very wise I promise you and as for myself I generally have all my wits about me such as they are If you show yourself bold and cautious and follow our advice you need not fear being a stone image yet awhile But first of all you must polish your shield till you can see your face in it as distinctly as in a mirror This seemed to Perseus rather an odd beginning of the adventure for he thought it of far more consequence that the shield should be strong enough to defend him from the Gorgon s brazen claws than that it should be bright enough to show him the reflection of his face However concluding that Quicksilver knew better than himself he immediately set to work and scrubbed the shield with so much diligence and good will that it very quickly shone like the moon at harvest time Quicksilver looked at it with a smile and nodded his approbation Then taking off his own short and crooked sword he girded it about Perseus instead of the one which he had before worn No sword but mine will answer your purpose observed he the blade has a most excellent temper and will cut through iron and brass as easily as through the slenderest twig And now we will set out The next thing is to find the Three Gray Women who will tell us where to find the Nymphs The Three Gray Women cried Perseus to whom this seemed only a new difficulty in the path of his adventure pray who may the Three Gray Women be I never heard of them before They are three very strange old ladies said Quicksilver laughing They have but one eye among them and only one tooth Moreover you must find them out by starlight or in the dusk of the evening for they never show themselves by the light either of the sun or moon But said Perseus why should I waste my time with these Three Gray Women Would it not be better to set out at once in search of the terrible Gorgons No no answered his friend There are other things to be done before you can find your way to the Gorgons There is nothing for it but to hunt up these old ladies and when we meet with them you may be sure that the Gorgons are not a great way off Come let us be stirring Perseus by this time felt so much confidence in his companion s sagacity that he made no more objections and professed himself ready to begin the adventure immediately They accordingly set out and walked at a pretty brisk pace so brisk indeed that Perseus found it rather difficult to keep up with his nimble friend Quicksilver To say the truth he had a singular idea that Quicksilver was furnished with a pair of winged shoes which of course helped him along marvellously And then too when Perseus looked sideways at him out of the corner of his eye he seemed to see wings on the side of his head although if he turned a full gaze there were no such things to be perceived but only an odd kind of cap But at all events the twisted staff was evidently a great convenience to Quicksilver and enabled him to proceed so fast that Perseus though a remarkably active young man began to be out of breath Here cried Quicksilver at last for he knew well enough rogue that he was how hard Perseus found it to keep pace with him take you the staff for you need it a great deal more than I Are there no better walkers than yourself in the island of Seriphus I could walk pretty well said Perseus glancing slyly at his companion s feet if I had only a pair of winged shoes We must see about getting you a pair answered Quicksilver But the staff helped Perseus along so bravely that he no longer felt the slightest weariness In fact the stick seemed to be alive in his hand and to lend some of its life to Perseus He and Quicksilver now walked onward at their ease talking very sociably together and Quicksilver told so many pleasant stories about his former adventures and how well his wits had served him on various occasions that Perseus began to think him a very wonderful person He evidently knew the world and nobody is so charming to a young man as a friend who has that kind of knowledge Perseus listened the more eagerly in the hope of brightening his own wits by what he heard At last he happened to recollect that Quicksilver had spoken of a sister who was to lend her assistance in the adventure which they were now bound upon Where is she he inquired Shall we not meet her soon All at the proper time said his companion But this sister of mine you must understand is quite a different sort of character from myself She is very grave and prudent seldom smiles never laughs and makes it a rule not to utter a word unless she has something particularly profound to say Neither will she listen to any but the wisest conversation Dear me ejaculated Perseus I shall be afraid to say a syllable She is a very accomplished person I assure you continued Quicksilver and has all the arts and sciences at her fingers ends In short she is so immoderately wise that many people call her wisdom personified But to tell you the truth she has hardly vivacity enough for my taste and I think you would scarcely find her so pleasant a travelling companion as myself She has her good points nevertheless and you will find the benefit of them in your encounter with the Gorgons By this time it had grown quite dusk They were now come to a very wild and desert place overgrown with shaggy bushes and so silent and solitary that nobody seemed ever to have dwelt or journeyed there All was waste and desolate in the gray twilight which grew every moment more obscure Perseus looked about him rather disconsolately and asked Quicksilver whether they had a great deal farther to go Hist hist whispered his companion Make no noise This is just the time and place to meet the Three Gray Women Be careful that they do not see you before you see them for though they have but a single eye among the three it is as sharp sighted as half a dozen common eyes But what must I do asked Perseus when we meet them Quicksilver explained to Perseus how the Three Gray Women managed with their one eye They were in the habit it seems of changing it from one to another as if it had been a pair of spectacles or which would have suited them better a quizzing glass When one of the three had kept the eye a certain time she took it out of the socket and passed it to one of her sisters whose turn it might happen to be and who immediately clapped it into her own head and enjoyed a peep at the visible world Thus it will easily be understood that only one of the Three Gray Women could see while the other two were in utter darkness and moreover at the instant when the eye was passing from hand to hand neither of the poor old ladies was able to see a wink I have heard of a great many strange things in my day and have witnessed not a few but none it seems to me that can compare with the oddity of these Three Gray Women all peeping through a single eye So thought Perseus likewise and was so astonished that he almost fancied his companion was joking with him and that there were no such old women in the world You will soon find whether I tell the truth or no observed Quicksilver Hark hush hist hist There they come now Perseus looked earnestly through the dusk of the evening and there sure enough at no great distance off he descried the Three Gray Women The light being so faint he could not well make out what sort of figures they were only he discovered that they had long gray hair and as they came nearer he saw that two of them had but the empty socket of an eye in the middle of their foreheads But in the middle of the third sister s forehead there was a very large bright and piercing eye which sparkled like a great diamond in a ring and so penetrating did it seem to be that Perseus could not help thinking it must possess the gift of seeing in the darkest midnight just as perfectly as at noonday The sight of three persons eyes was melted and collected into that single one Thus the three old dames got along about as comfortably upon the whole as if they could all see at once She who chanced to have the eye in her forehead led the other two by the hands peeping sharply about her all the while insomuch that Perseus dreaded lest she should see right through the thick clump of bushes behind which he and Quicksilver had hidden themselves My stars it was positively terrible to be within reach of so very sharp an eye But before they reached the clump of bushes one of the Three Gray Women spoke Sister Sister Scarecrow cried she you have had the eye long enough It is my turn now Let me keep it a moment longer Sister Nightmare answered Scarecrow I thought I had a glimpse of something behind that thick bush Well and what of that retorted Nightmare peevishly Can t I see into a thick bush as easily as yourself The eye is mine as well as yours and I know the use of it as well as you or maybe a little better I insist upon taking a peep immediately But here the third sister whose name was Shakejoint began to complain and said that it was her turn to have the eye and that Scarecrow and Nightmare wanted to keep it all to themselves To end the dispute old Dame Scarecrow took the eye out of her forehead and held it forth in her hand Take it one of you cried she and quit this foolish quarrelling For my part I shall be glad of a little thick darkness Take it quickly however or I must clap it into my own head again Accordingly both Nightmare and Shakejoint put out their hands groping eagerly to snatch the eye out of the hand of Scarecrow But being both alike blind they could not easily find where Scarecrow s hand was and Scarecrow being now just as much in the dark as Shakejoint and Nightmare could not at once meet either of their hands in order to put the eye into it Thus as you will see with half an eye my wise little auditors these good old dames had fallen into a strange perplexity For though the eye shone and glistened like a star as Scarecrow held it out yet the Gray Women caught not the least glimpse of its light and were all three in utter darkness from too impatient a desire to see Quicksilver was so much tickled at beholding Shakejoint and Nightmare both groping for the eye and each finding fault with Scarecrow and one another that he could scarcely help laughing aloud Now is your time he whispered to Perseus Quick quick before they can clap the eye into either of their heads Rush out upon the old ladies and snatch it from Scarecrow s hand In an instant while the Three Gray Women were still scolding each other Perseus leaped from behind the clump of bushes and made himself master of the prize The marvellous eye as he held it in his hand shone very brightly and seemed to look up into his face with a knowing air and an expression as if it would have winked had it been provided with a pair of eyelids for that purpose But the Gray Women knew nothing of what had happened and each supposing that one of her sisters was in possession of the eye they began their quarrel anew At last as Perseus did not wish to put these respectable dames to greater inconvenience than was really necessary he thought it right to explain the matter My good ladies said he pray do not be angry with one another If anybody is in fault it is myself for I have the honour to hold your very brilliant and excellent eye in my own hand You you have our eye And who are you screamed the Three Gray Women all in a breath for they were terribly frightened of course at hearing a strange voice and discovering that their eyesight had got into the hands of they could not guess whom Oh what shall we do sisters what shall we do We are all in the dark Give us our eye Give us our one precious solitary eye You have two of your own Give us our eye Tell them whispered Quicksilver to Perseus that they shall have back the eye as soon as they direct you where to find the Nymphs who have the flying slippers the magic wallet and the helmet of darkness My dear good admirable old ladies said Perseus addressing the Gray Women there is no occasion for putting yourselves into such a fright I am by no means a bad young man You shall have back your eye safe and sound and as bright as ever the moment you tell me where to find the Nymphs The Nymphs Goodness me sisters what Nymphs does he mean screamed Scarecrow There are a great many Nymphs people say some that go a hunting in the woods and some that live inside of trees and some that have a comfortable home in fountains of water We know nothing at all about them We are three unfortunate old souls that go wandering about in the dusk and never had but one eye amongst us and that one you have stolen away Oh give it back good stranger whoever you are give it back All this while the Three Gray Women were groping with their outstretched hands and trying their utmost to get hold of Perseus But he took good care to keep out of their reach My respectable dames said he for his mother had taught him always to use the greatest civility I hold your eye fast in my hand and shall keep it safely for you until you please to tell me where to find these Nymphs The Nymphs I mean who keep the enchanted wallet the flying slippers and the what is it the helmet of invisibility Mercy on us sisters what is the young man talking about exclaimed Scarecrow Nightmare and Shakejoint one to another with great appearance of astonishment A pair of flying slippers quoth he His heels would quickly fly higher than his head if he was silly enough to put them on And a helmet of invisibility How could a helmet make him invisible unless it were big enough for him to hide under it And an enchanted wallet What sort of a contrivance may that be I wonder No no good stranger we can tell you nothing of these marvellous things You have two eyes of your own and we have but a single one amongst us three You can find out such wonders better than three blind old creatures like us Perseus hearing them talk in this way began really to think that the Gray Women knew nothing of the matter and as it grieved him to have put them to so much trouble he was just on the point of restoring their eye and asking pardon for his rudeness in snatching it away But Quicksilver caught his hand Don t let them make a fool of you said he These Three Gray Women are the only persons in the world that can tell you where to find the Nymphs and unless you get that information you will never succeed in cutting off the head of Medusa with the snaky locks Keep fast hold of the eye and all will go well As it turned out Quicksilver was in the right There are but few things that people prize so much as they do their eyesight and the Gray Women valued their single eye as highly as if it had been half a dozen which was the number they ought to have had Finding that there was no other way of recovering it they at last told Perseus what he wanted to know No sooner had they done so than he immediately and with the utmost respect clapped the eye into the vacant socket in one of their foreheads thanked them for their kindness and bade them farewell Before the young man was out of hearing however they had got into a new dispute because he happened to have given the eye to Scarecrow who had already taken her turn of it when their trouble with Perseus commenced It is greatly to be feared that the Three Gray Women were very much in the habit of disturbing their mutual harmony by bickerings of this sort which was the more pity as they could not conveniently do without one another and were evidently intended to be inseparable companions As a general rule I would advise all people whether sisters or brothers old or young who chance to have but one eye amongst them to cultivate forbearance and not all insist upon peeping through it at once Quicksilver and Perseus in the meantime were making the best of their way in quest of the Nymphs The old dames had given them such particular directions that they were not long in finding them out They proved to be very different persons from Nightmare Shakejoint and Scarecrow for instead of being old they were young and beautiful and instead of one eye amongst the sisterhood each Nymph had two exceedingly bright eyes of her own with which she looked very kindly at Perseus They seemed to be acquainted with Quicksilver and when he told them the adventure which Perseus had undertaken they made no difficulty about giving him the valuable articles that were in their custody In the first place they brought out what appeared to be a small purse made of deer skin and curiously embroidered and bade him be sure and keep it safe This was the magic wallet The Nymphs next produced a pair of shoes or slippers or sandals with a nice little pair of wings at the heel of each Put them on Perseus said Quicksilver You will find yourself as light heeled as you can desire for the remainder of our journey So Perseus proceeded to put one of the slippers on while he laid the other on the ground by his side Unexpectedly however this other slipper spread its wings fluttered up off the ground and would probably have flown away if Quicksilver had not made a leap and luckily caught it in the air Be more careful said he as he gave it back to Perseus It would frighten the birds up aloft if they should see a flying slipper amongst them When Perseus had got on both of these wonderful slippers he was altogether too buoyant to tread on earth Making a step or two lo and behold upward he popped into the air high above the heads of Quicksilver and the Nymphs and found it very difficult to clamber down again Winged slippers and all such high flying contrivances are seldom quite easy to manage until one grows a little accustomed to them Quicksilver laughed at his companion s involuntary activity and told him that he must not be in so desperate a hurry but must wait for the invisible helmet The good natured Nymphs had the helmet with its dark tuft of waving plumes all in readiness to put upon his head And now there happened about as wonderful an incident as anything that I have yet told you The instant before the helmet was put on there stood Perseus a beautiful young man with golden ringlets and rosy cheeks the crooked sword by his side and the brightly polished shield upon his arm a figure that seemed all made up of courage sprightliness and glorious light But when the helmet had descended over his white brow there was no longer any Perseus to be seen Nothing but empty air Even the helmet that covered him with its invisibility had vanished Where are you Perseus asked Quicksilver Why here to be sure answered Perseus very quietly although his voice seemed to come out of the transparent atmosphere Just where I was a moment ago Don t you see me No indeed answered his friend You are hidden under the helmet But if I cannot see you neither can the Gorgons Follow me therefore and we will try your dexterity in using the winged slippers With these words Quicksilver s cap spread its wings as if his head were about to fly away from his shoulders but his whole figure rose lightly into the air and Perseus followed By the time they had ascended a few hundred feet the young man began to feel what a delightful thing it was to leave the dull earth so far beneath him and to be able to flit about like a bird It was now deep night Perseus looked upward and saw the round bright silvery moon and thought that he should desire nothing better than to soar up thither and spend his life there Then he looked downward again and saw the earth with its seas and lakes and the silver courses of its rivers and its snowy mountain peaks and the breadth of its fields and the dark cluster of its woods and its cities of white marble and with the moonshine sleeping over the whole scene it was as beautiful as the moon or any star could be And among other objects he saw the island of Seriphus where his dear mother was Sometimes he and Quicksilver approached a cloud that at a distance looked as if it were made of fleecy silver although when they plunged into it they found themselves chilled and moistened with gray mist So swift was their flight however that in an instant they emerged from the cloud into the moonlight again Once a high soaring eagle flew right against the invisible Perseus The bravest sights were the meteors that gleamed suddenly out as if a bonfire had been kindled in the sky and made the moonshine pale for as much as a hundred miles around them As the two companions flew onward Perseus fancied that he could hear the rustle of a garment close by his side and it was on the side opposite to the one where he beheld Quicksilver yet only Quicksilver was visible Whose garment is this inquired Perseus that keeps rustling close beside me in the breeze Oh it is my sister s answered Quicksilver She is coming along with us as I told you she would We could do nothing without the help of my sister You have no idea how wise she is She has such eyes too Why she can see you at this moment just as distinctly as if you were not invisible and I ll venture to say she will be the first to discover the Gorgons By this time in their swift voyage through the air they had come within sight of the great ocean and were soon flying over it Far beneath them the waves tossed themselves tumultuously in mid sea or rolled a white surf line upon the long beaches or foamed against the rocky cliffs with a roar that was thunderous in the lower world although it became a gentle murmur like the voice of a baby half asleep before it reached the ears of Perseus Just then a voice spoke in the air close by him It seemed to be a woman s voice and was melodious though not exactly what might be called sweet but grave and mild Perseus said the voice there are the Gorgons Where exclaimed Perseus I cannot see them On the shore of that island beneath you replied the voice A pebble dropped from your hand would strike in the midst of them I told you she would be the first to discover them said Quicksilver to Perseus And there they are Straight downward two or three thousand feet below him Perseus perceived a small island with the sea breaking into white foam all around its rocky shore except on one side where there was a beach of snowy sand He descended toward it and looking earnestly at a cluster or heap of brightness at the foot of a precipice of black rocks behold there were the terrible Gorgons They lay fast asleep soothed by the thunder of the sea for it required a tumult that would have deafened everybody else to lull such fierce creatures into slumber The moonlight glistened on their steely scales and on their golden wings which drooped idly over the sand Their brazen claws horrible to look at were thrust out and clutched the wave beaten fragments of rock while the sleeping Gorgons dreamed of tearing some poor mortal all to pieces The snakes that served them instead of hair seemed likewise to be asleep although now and then one would writhe and lift its head and thrust out its forked tongue emitting a drowsy hiss and then let itself subside among its sister snakes The Gorgons were more like an awful gigantic kind of insect immense golden winged beetles or dragon flies or things of that sort at once ugly and beautiful than like anything else only that they were a thousand and a million times as big And with all this there was something partly human about them too Luckily for Perseus their faces were completely hidden from him by the posture in which they lay for had he but looked one instant at them he would have fallen heavily out of the air an image of senseless stone Now whispered Quicksilver as he hovered by the side of Perseus now is your time to do the deed Be quick for if one of the Gorgons should awake you are too late Which shall I strike at asked Perseus drawing his sword and descending a little lower They all three look alike All three have snaky locks Which of the three is Medusa It must be understood that Medusa was the only one of these dragon monsters whose head Perseus could possibly cut off As for the other two let him have the sharpest sword that ever was forged and he might have hacked away by the hour together without doing them the least harm Be cautious said the calm voice which had before spoken to him One of the Gorgons is stirring in her sleep and is just about to turn over That is Medusa Do not look at her The sight would turn you to stone Look at the reflection of her face and figure in the bright mirror of your shield Perseus now understood Quicksilver s motive for so earnestly exhorting him to polish his shield In its surface he could safely look at the reflection of the Gorgon s face And there it was that terrible countenance mirrored in the brightness of the shield with the moonlight falling over it and displaying all its horror The snakes whose venomous natures could not altogether sleep kept twisting themselves over the forehead It was the fiercest and most horrible face that ever was seen or imagined and yet with a strange fearful and savage kind of beauty in it The eyes were closed and the Gorgon was still in a deep slumber but there was an unquiet expression disturbing her features as if the monster was troubled with an ugly dream She gnashed her white tusks and dug into the sand with her brazen claws The snakes too seemed to feel Medusa s dream and to be made more restless by it They twined themselves into tumultuous knots writhed fiercely and uplifted a hundred hissing heads without opening their eyes Now now whispered Quicksilver who was growing impatient Make a dash at the monster But be calm said the grave melodious voice at the young man s side Look in your shield as you fly downward and take care that you do not miss your first stroke Perseus flew cautiously downward still keeping his eyes on Medusa s face as reflected in his shield The nearer he came the more terrible did the snaky visage and metallic body of the monster grow At last when he found himself hovering over her within arm s length Perseus uplifted his sword while at the same instant each separate snake upon the Gorgon s head stretched threateningly upward and Medusa unclosed her eyes But she awoke too late The sword was sharp the stroke fell like a lightning flash and the head of the wicked Medusa tumbled from her body Admirably done cried Quicksilver Make haste and clap the head into your magic wallet To the astonishment of Perseus the small embroidered wallet which he had hung about his neck and which had hitherto been no bigger than a purse grew all at once large enough to contain Medusa s head As quick as thought he snatched it up with the snakes still writhing upon it and thrust it in Your task is done said the calm voice Now fly for the other Gorgons will do their utmost to take vengeance for Medusa s death It was indeed necessary to take flight for Perseus had not done the deed so quietly but that the clash of his sword and the hissing of the snakes and the thump of Medusa s head as it tumbled upon the sea beaten sand awoke the other two monsters There they sat for an instant sleepily rubbing their eyes with their brazen fingers while all the snakes on their heads reared themselves on end with surprise and with venomous malice against they knew not what But when the Gorgons saw the scaly carcass of Medusa headless and her golden wings all ruffled and half spread out on the sand it was really awful to hear what yells and screeches they set up And then the snakes They sent forth a hundredfold hiss with one consent and Medusa s snakes answered them out of the magic wallet No sooner were the Gorgons broad awake than they hurtled upward into the air brandishing their brass talons gnashing their horrible tusks and flapping their huge wings so wildly that some of the golden feathers were shaken out and floated down upon the shore And there perhaps those very feathers lie scattered till this day Up rose the Gorgons as I tell you staring horribly about in hopes of turning somebody to stone Had Perseus looked them in the face or had he fallen into their clutches his poor mother would never have kissed her boy again But he took good care to turn his eyes another way and as he wore the helmet of invisibility the Gorgons knew not in what direction to follow him nor did he fail to make the best use of the winged slippers by soaring upward a perpendicular mile or so At that height when the screams of those abominable creatures sounded faintly beneath him he made a straight course for the island of Seriphus in order to carry Medusa s head to King Polydectes I have no time to tell you of several marvellous things that befell Perseus on his way homeward such as his killing a hideous sea monster just as it was on the point of devouring a beautiful maiden nor how he changed an enormous giant into a mountain of stone merely by showing him the head of the Gorgon If you doubt this latter story you may make a voyage to Africa some day or other and see the very mountain which is still known by the ancient giant s name Finally our brave Perseus arrived at the island where he expected to see his dear mother But during his absence the wicked king had treated Danae so very ill that she was compelled to make her escape and had taken refuge in a temple where some good old priests were extremely kind to her These praiseworthy priests and the kind hearted fisherman who had first shown hospitality to Danae and little Perseus when he found them afloat in the chest seem to have been the only persons on the island who cared about doing right All the rest of the people as well as King Polydectes himself were remarkably ill behaved and deserved no better destiny than that which was now to happen Not finding his mother at home Perseus went straight to the palace and was immediately ushered into the presence of the king Polydectes was by no means rejoiced to see him for he had felt almost certain in his own evil mind that the Gorgons would have torn the poor young man to pieces and have eaten him up out of the way However seeing him safely returned he put the best face he could upon the matter and asked Perseus how he had succeeded Have you performed your promise inquired he Have you brought me the head of Medusa with the snaky locks If not young man it will cost you dear for I must have a bridal present for the beautiful Princess Hippodamia and there is nothing else that she would admire so much Yes please Your Majesty answered Perseus in a quiet way as if it were no very wonderful deed for such a young man as he to perform I have brought you the Gorgon s head snaky locks and all Indeed Pray let me see it quoth King Polydectes It must be a very curious spectacle if all that travellers tell about it be true Your Majesty is in the right replied Perseus It is really an object that will be pretty certain to fix the regards of all who look at it And if Your Majesty think fit I would suggest that a holiday be proclaimed and that all Your Majesty s subjects be summoned to behold this wonderful curiosity Few of them I imagine have seen a Gorgon s head before and perhaps never may again The king well knew that his subjects were an idle set of reprobates and very fond of sightseeing as idle persons usually are So he took the young man s advice and sent out heralds and messengers in all directions to blow the trumpet at the street corners and in the market places and wherever two roads met and summon everybody to court Thither accordingly came a great multitude of good for nothing vagabonds all of whom out of pure love of mischief would have been glad if Perseus had met with some ill hap in his encounter with the Gorgons If there were any better people in the island as I really hope there may have been although the story tells nothing about any such they stayed quietly at home minding their business and taking care of their little children Most of the inhabitants at all events ran as fast as they could to the palace and shoved and pushed and elbowed one another in their eagerness to get near a balcony on which Perseus showed himself holding the embroidered wallet in his hand On a platform within full view of the balcony sat the mighty King Polydectes amid his evil counsellors and with his flattering courtiers in a semi circle round about him Monarch counsellors courtiers and subjects all gazed eagerly toward Perseus Show us the head Show us the head shouted the people and there was a fierceness in their cry as if they would tear Perseus to pieces unless he should satisfy them with what he had to show Show us the head of Medusa with the snaky locks A feeling of sorrow and pity came over the youthful Perseus O King Polydectes cried he and ye many people I am very loath to show you the Gorgon s head Ah the villain and coward yelled the people more fiercely than before He is making game of us He has no Gorgon s head Show us the head if you have it or we will take your own head for a football The evil counsellors whispered bad advice in the king s ear the courtiers murmured with one consent that Perseus had shown disrespect to their royal lord and master and the great King Polydectes himself waved his hand and ordered him with the stern deep voice of authority on his peril to produce the head Show me the Gorgon s head or I will cut off your own And Perseus sighed This instant repeated Polydectes or you die Behold it then cried Perseus in a voice like the blast of a trumpet And suddenly holding up the head not an eyelid had time to wink before the wicked King Polydectes his evil counsellors and all his fierce subjects were no longer anything but the mere images of a monarch and his people They were all fixed forever in the look and attitude of that moment At the first glimpse of the terrible head of Medusa they whitened into marble And Perseus thrust the head back into his wallet and went to tell his dear mother that she need no longer be afraid of the wicked King Polydectes CHAPTER VI THE DRAGON S TEETH Cadmus Phoenix and Cilix the three sons of King Agenor and their little sister Europa who was a very beautiful child were at play together near the seashore in their father s kingdom of Phoenicia They had rambled to some distance from the palace where their parents dwelt and were now in a verdant meadow on one side of which lay the sea all sparkling and dimpling in the sunshine and murmuring gently against the beach The three boys were very happy gathering flowers and twining them into garlands with which they adorned the little Europa Seated on the grass the child was almost hidden under an abundance of buds and blossoms whence her rosy face peeped merrily out and as Cadmus said was the prettiest of all the flowers Just then there came a splendid butterfly fluttering along the meadow and Cadmus Phoenix and Cilix set off in pursuit of it crying out that it was a flower with wings Europa who was a little wearied with playing all day long did not chase the butterfly with her brothers but sat still where they had left her and closed her eyes For a while she listened to the pleasant murmur of the sea which was like a voice saying Hush and bidding her go to sleep But the pretty child if she slept at all could not have slept more than a moment when she heard something trample on the grass not far from her and peeping out from the heap of flowers beheld a snow white bull And whence could this bull have come Europa and her brothers had been a long time playing in the meadow and had seen no cattle nor other living thing either there or on the neighbouring hills Brother Cadmus cried Europa starting up out of the midst of the roses and lilies Phoenix Cilix Where are you all Help Help Come and drive away this bull But her brothers were too far off to hear especially as the fright took away Europa s voice and hindered her from calling very loudly So there she stood with her pretty mouth wide open as pale as the white lilies that were twisted among the other flowers in her garlands Nevertheless it was the suddenness with which she had perceived the bull rather than anything frightful in his appearance that caused Europa so much alarm On looking at him more attentively she began to see that he was a beautiful animal and even fancied a particularly amiable expression in his face As for his breath the breath of cattle you know is always sweet it was as fragrant as if he had been grazing on no other food than rosebuds or at least the most delicate of clover blossoms Never before did a bull have such bright and tender eyes and such smooth horns of ivory as this one And the bull ran little races and capered sportively around the child so that she quite forgot how big and strong he was and from the gentleness and playfulness of his actions soon came to consider him as innocent a creature as a pet lamb Thus frightened as she at first was you might by and by have seen Europa stroking the bull s forehead with her small white hand and taking the garlands off her own head to hang them on his neck and ivory horns Then she pulled up some blades of grass and he ate them out of her hand not as if he were hungry but because he wanted to be friends with the child and took pleasure in eating what she had touched Well my stars was there ever such a gentle sweet pretty and amiable creature as this bull and ever such a nice playmate for a little girl When the animal saw for the bull had so much intelligence that it is really wonderful to think of when he saw that Europa was no longer afraid of him he grew overjoyed and could hardly contain himself for delight He frisked about the meadow now here now there making sprightly leaps with as little effort as a bird expends in hopping from twig to twig Indeed his motion was as light as if he were flying through the air and his hoofs seemed hardly to leave their print in the grassy soil over which he trod With his spotless hue he resembled a snowdrift wafted along by the wind Once he galloped so far away that Europa feared lest she might never see him again so setting up her childish voice she called him back Come back pretty creature she cried Here is a nice clover blossom And then it was delightful to witness the gratitude of this amiable bull and how he was so full of joy and thankfulness that he capered higher than ever He came running and bowed his head before Europa as if he knew her to be a king s daughter or else recognised the important truth that a little girl is everybody s queen And not only did the bull bend his neck he absolutely knelt down at her feet and made such intelligent nods and other inviting gestures that Europa understood what he meant just as well as if he had put it in so many words Come dear child was what he wanted to say let me give you a ride on my back At the first thought of such a thing Europa drew back But then she considered in her wise little head that there could be no possible harm in taking just one gallop on the back of this docile and friendly animal who would certainly set her down the very instant she desired it And how it would surprise her brothers to see her riding across the green meadow And what merry times they might have either taking turns for a gallop or clambering on the gentle creature all four children together and careering round the field with shouts of laughter that would be heard as far off as King Agenor s palace I think I will do it said the child to herself And indeed why not She cast a glance around and caught a glimpse of Cadmus Phoenix and Cilix who were still in pursuit of the butterfly almost at the other end of the meadow It would be the quickest way of rejoining them to get upon the white bull s back She came a step nearer to him therefore and sociable creature that he was he showed so much joy at this mark of her confidence that the child could not find it in her heart to hesitate any longer Making one bound for this little princess was as active as a squirrel there sat Europa on the beautiful bull holding an ivory horn in each hand lest she should fall off Softly pretty bull softly she said rather frightened at what she had done Do not gallop too fast Having got the child on his back the animal gave a leap into the air and came down so like a feather that Europa did not know when his hoofs touched the ground He then began a race to that part of the flowery plain where her three brothers were and where they had just caught their splendid butterfly Europa screamed with delight and Phoenix Cilix and Cadmus stood gaping at the spectacle of their sister mounted on a white bull not knowing whether to be frightened or to wish the same good luck for themselves The gentle and innocent creature for who could possibly doubt that he was so pranced round among the children as sportively as a kitten Europa all the while looked down upon her brothers nodding and laughing but yet with a sort of stateliness in her rosy little face As the bull wheeled about to take another gallop across the meadow the child waved her hand and said Good by playfully pretending that she was now bound on a distant journey and might not see her brothers again for nobody could tell how long Good by shouted Cadmus Phoenix and Cilix all in one breath But together with her enjoyment of the sport there was still a little remnant of fear in the child s heart so that her last look at the three boys was a troubled one and made them feel as if their dear sister were really leaving them forever And what do you think the snowy bull did next Why he set off as swift as the wind straight down to the seashore scampered across the sand took an airy leap and plunged right in among the foaming billows The white spray rose in a shower over him and little Europa and fell spattering down upon the water Then what a scream of terror did the poor child send forth The three brothers screamed manfully likewise and ran to the shore as fast as their legs would carry them with Cadmus at their head But it was too late When they reached the margin of the sand the treacherous animal was already far away in the wide blue sea with only his snowy head and tail emerging and poor little Europa between them stretching out one hand toward her dear brothers while she grasped the bull s ivory horn with the other And there stood Cadmus Phoenix and Cilix gazing at this sad spectacle through their tears until they could no longer distinguish the bull s snowy head from the white capped billows that seemed to boil up out of the sea s depths around him Nothing more was ever seen of the white bull nothing more of the beautiful child This was a mournful story as you may well think for the three boys to carry home to their parents King Agenor their father was the ruler of the whole country but he loved his little daughter Europa better than his kingdom or than all his other children or than anything else in the world Therefore when Cadmus and his two brothers came crying home and told him how that a white bull had carried off their sister and swam with her over the sea the king was quite beside himself with grief and rage Although it was now twilight and fast growing dark he bade them set out instantly in search of her Never shall you see my face again he cried unless you bring me back my little Europa to gladden me with her smiles and her pretty ways Begone and enter my presence no more till you come leading her by the hand As King Agenor said this his eyes flashed fire for he was a very passionate king and he looked so terribly angry that the poor boys did not even venture to ask for their suppers but slunk away out of the palace and only paused on the steps a moment to consult whither they should go first While they were standing there all in dismay their mother Queen Telephassa who happened not to be by when they told the story to the king came hurrying after them and said that she too would go in quest of her daughter Oh no mother cried the boys The night is dark and there is no knowing what troubles and perils we may meet with Alas my dear children answered poor Queen Telephassa weeping bitterly that is only another reason why I should go with you If I should lose you too as well as my little Europa what would become of me And let me go likewise said their playfellow Thasus who came running to join them Thasus was the son of a seafaring person in the neighbourhood he had been brought up with the young princess and was their intimate friend and loved Europa very much so they consented that he should accompany them The whole party therefore set forth together Cadmus Phoenix Cilix and Thasus clustered round Queen Telephassa grasping her skirts and begging her to lean upon their shoulders whenever she felt weary In this manner they went down the palace steps and began a journey which turned out to be a great deal longer than they dreamed of The last that they saw of King Agenor he came to the door with a servant holding a torch beside him and called after them into the gathering darkness Remember Never ascend these steps again without the child Never sobbed Queen Telephassa and the three brothers and Thasus answered Never Never Never Never And they kept their word Year after year King Agenor sat in the solitude of his beautiful palace listening in vain for their returning footsteps hoping to hear the familiar voice of the queen and the cheerful talk of his sons and their playfellow Thasus entering the door together and the sweet childish accents of little Europa in the midst of them But so long a time went by that at last if they had really come the king would not have known that this was the voice of Telephassa and these the younger voices that used to make such joyful echoes when the children were playing about the palace We must now leave King Agenor to sit on his throne and must go along with Queen Telephassa and her four youthful companions They went on and on and travelled a long way and passed over mountains and rivers and sailed over seas Here and there and everywhere they made continual inquiry if any person could tell them what had become of Europa The rustic people of whom they asked this question paused a little while from their labours in the field and looked very much surprised They thought it strange to behold a woman in the garb of a queen for Telephassa in her haste had forgotten to take off her crown and her royal robes roaming about the country with four lads around her on such an errand as this seemed to be But nobody could give them any tidings of Europa nobody had seen a little girl dressed like a princess and mounted on a snow white bull which galloped as swiftly as the wind I cannot tell you how long Queen Telephassa and Cadmus Phoenix and Cilix her three sons and Thasus their playfellow went wandering along the highways and bypaths or through the pathless wildernesses of the earth in this manner But certain it is that before they reached any place of rest their splendid garments were quite worn out They all looked very much travel stained and would have had the dust of many countries on their shoes if the streams through which they waded had not washed it all away When they had been gone a year Telephassa threw away her crown because it chafed her forehead It has given me many a headache said the poor queen and it cannot cure my heartache As fast as their princely robes got torn and tattered they exchanged them for such mean attire as ordinary people wore By and by they came to have a wild and homeless aspect so that you would much sooner have taken them for a gypsy family than a queen and three princes and a young nobleman who had once a palace for their home and a train of servants to do their bidding The four boys grew up to be tall young men with sunburnt faces Each of them girded on a sword to defend themselves against the perils of the way When the husbandmen at whose farmhouses they sought hospitality needed their assistance in the harvest field they gave it willingly and Queen Telephassa who had done no work in her palace save to braid silk threads with golden ones came behind them to bind the sheaves If payment was offered they shook their heads and only asked for tidings of Europa There are bulls enough in my pasture the old farmers would reply but I never heard of one like this you tell me of A snow white bull with a little princess on his back Ho ho I ask your pardon good folks but there never was such a sight seen hereabouts At last when his upper lip began to have the down on it Phoenix grew weary of rambling hither and thither to no purpose So one day when they happened to be passing through a pleasant and solitary tract of country he sat himself down on a heap of moss I can go no farther said Phoenix It is a mere foolish waste of life to spend it as we do in always wandering up and down and never coming to any home at nightfall Our sister is lost and never will be found She probably perished in the sea or to whatever shore the white bull may have carried her it is now so many years ago that there would be neither love nor acquaintance between us should we meet again My father has forbidden us to return to his palace so I shall build me a hut of branches and dwell here Well son Phoenix said Telephassa sorrowfully you have grown to be a man and must do as you judge best But for my part I will still go in quest of my poor child And we three will go along with you cried Cadmus and Cilix and their faithful friend Thasus But before setting out they all helped Phoenix to build a habitation When completed it was a sweet rural bower roofed overhead with an arch of living boughs Inside there were two pleasant rooms one of which had a soft heap of moss for a bed while the other was furnished with a rustic seat or two curiously fashioned out of the crooked roots of trees So comfortable and homelike did it seem that Telephassa and her three companions could not help sighing to think that they must still roam about the world instead of spending the remainder of their lives in some such cheerful abode as they had here built for Phoenix But when they bade him farewell Phoenix shed tears and probably regretted that he was no longer to keep them company However he had fixed upon an admirable place to dwell in And by and by there came other people who chanced to have no homes and seeing how pleasant a spot it was they built themselves huts in the neighbourhood of Phoenix s habitation Thus before many years went by a city had grown up there in the centre of which was seen a stately palace of marble wherein dwelt Phoenix clothed in a purple robe and wearing a golden crown upon his head For the inhabitants of the new city finding that he had royal blood in his veins had chosen him to be their king The very first decree of state which King Phoenix issued was that if a maiden happened to arrive in the kingdom mounted on a snow white bull and calling herself Europa his subjects should treat her with the greatest kindness and respect and immediately bring her to the palace You may see by this that Phoenix s conscience never quite ceased to trouble him for giving up the quest of his dear sister and sitting himself down to be comfortable while his mother and her companions went onward But often and often at the close of a weary day s journey did Telephassa and Cadmus Cilix and Thasus remember the pleasant spot in which they had left Phoenix It was a sorrowful prospect for these wanderers that on the morrow they must again set forth and that after many nightfalls they would perhaps be no nearer the close of their toilsome pilgrimage than now These thoughts made them all melancholy at times but appeared to torment Cilix more than the rest of the party At length one morning when they were taking their staffs in hand to set out he thus addressed them My dear mother and you good brother Cadmus and my friend Thasus methinks we are like people in a dream There is no substance in the life which we are leading It is such a dreary length of time since the white bull carried off my sister Europa that I have quite forgotten how she looked and the tones of her voice and indeed almost doubt whether such a little girl ever lived in the world And whether she once lived or no I am convinced that she no longer survives and that therefore it is the merest folly to waste our own lives and happiness in seeking her Were we to find her she would now be a woman grown and would look upon us all as strangers So to tell you the truth I have resolved to take up my abode here and I entreat you mother brother and friend to follow my example Not I for one said Telephassa although the poor queen firmly as she spoke was so travel worn that she could hardly put her foot to the ground not I for one In the depths of my heart little Europa is still the rosy child who ran to gather flowers so many years ago She has not grown to womanhood nor forgotten me At noon at night journeying onward sitting down to rest her childish voice is always in my ears calling Mother mother Stop here who may there is no repose for me Nor for me said Cadmus while my dear mother pleases to go onward And the faithful Thasus too was resolved to bear them company They remained with Cilix a few days however and helped him to build a rustic bower resembling the one which they had formerly built for Phoenix When they were bidding him farewell Cilix burst into tears and told his mother that it seemed just as melancholy a dream to stay there in solitude as to go onward If she really believed that they would ever find Europa he was willing to continue the search with them even now But Telephassa bade him remain there and be happy if his own heart would let him So the pilgrims took their leave of him and departed and were hardly out of sight before some other wandering people came along that way and saw Cilix s habitation and were greatly delighted with the appearance of the place There being abundance of unoccupied ground in the neighbourhood these strangers built huts for themselves and were soon joined by a multitude of new settlers who quickly formed a city In the middle of it was seen a magnificent palace of coloured marble on the balcony of which every noontide appeared Cilix in a long purple robe and with a jewelled crown upon his head for the inhabitants when they found out that he was a king s son had considered him the fittest of all men to be a king himself One of the first acts of King Cilix s government was to send out an expedition consisting of a grave ambassador and an escort of bold and hardy young men with orders to visit the principal kingdoms of the earth and inquire whether a young maiden had passed through those regions galloping swiftly on a white bull It is therefore plain to my mind that Cilix secretly blamed himself for giving up the search for Europa as long as he was able to put one foot before the other As for Telephassa and Cadmus and the good Thasus it grieves me to think of them still keeping up that weary pilgrimage The two young men did their best for the poor queen helping her over the rough places often carrying her across rivulets in their faithful arms and seeking to shelter her at nightfall even when they themselves lay on the ground Sad sad it was to hear them asking of every passerby if he had seen Europa so long after the white bull had carried her away But though the gray years thrust themselves between and made the child s figure dim in their remembrance neither of these true hearted three ever dreamed of giving up the search One morning however poor Thasus found that he had sprained his ankle and could not possibly go a step farther After a few days to be sure said he mournfully I might make shift to hobble along with a stick But that would only delay you and perhaps hinder you from finding dear little Europa after all your pains and trouble Do you go forward therefore my beloved companions and leave me to follow as I may Thou hast been a true friend dear Thasus said Queen Telephassa kissing his forehead Being neither my son nor the brother of our lost Europa thou hast shown thyself truer to me and her than Phoenix and Cilix did whom we have left behind us Without thy loving help and that of my son Cadmus my limbs could not have borne me half so far as this Now take thy rest and be at peace For and it is the first time I have owned it to myself I begin to question whether we shall ever find my beloved daughter in this world Saying this the poor queen shed tears because it was a grievous trial to the mother s heart to confess that her hopes were growing faint From that day forward Cadmus noticed that she never travelled with the same alacrity of spirit that had heretofore supported her Her weight was heavier upon his arm Before setting out Cadmus helped Thasus build a bower while Telephassa being too infirm to give any great assistance advised them how to fit it up and furnish it so that it might be as comfortable as a hut of branches could Thasus however did not spend all his days in this green bower For it happened to him as to Phoenix and Cilix that other homeless people visited the spot and liked it and built themselves habitations in the neighbourhood So here in the course of a few years was another thriving city with a red freestone palace in the centre of it where Thasus set upon a throne doing justice to the people with a purple robe over his shoulders a sceptre in his hand and a crown upon his head The inhabitants had made him king not for the sake of any royal blood for none was in his veins but because Thasus was an upright true hearted and courageous man and therefore fit to rule But when the affairs of his kingdom were all settled King Thasus laid aside his purple robe and crown and sceptre and bade his worthiest subject distribute justice to the people in his stead Then grasping the pilgrim s staff that had supported him so long he set forth again hoping still to discover some hoof mark of the snow white bull some trace of the vanished child He returned after a lengthened absence and sat down wearily upon his throne To his latest hour nevertheless King Thasus showed his true hearted remembrance of Europa by ordering that a fire should always be kept burning in his palace and a bath steaming hot and food ready to be served up and a bed with snow white sheets in case the maiden should arrive and require immediate refreshment And though Europa never came the good Thasus had the blessings of many a poor traveller who profited by the food and lodging which were meant for the little playmate of the king s boyhood Telephassa and Cadmus were now pursuing their weary way with no companion but each other The queen leaned heavily upon her son s arm and could walk only a few miles a day But for all her weakness and weariness she would not be persuaded to give up the search It was enough to bring tears into the eyes of bearded men to hear the melancholy tone with which she inquired of every stranger whether he could tell her any news of the lost child Have you seen a little girl no no I mean a young maiden of full growth passing by this way mounted on a snow white bull which gallops as swiftly as the wind We have seen no such wondrous sight the people would reply and very often taking Cadmus aside they whispered to him Is this stately and sad looking woman your mother Surely she is not in her right mind and you ought to take her home and make her comfortable and do your best to get this dream out of her fancy It is no dream said Cadmus Everything else is a dream save that But one day Telephassa seemed feebler than usual and leaned almost her whole weight on the arm of Cadmus and walked more slowly than ever before At last they reached a solitary spot where she told her son that she must needs lie down and take a good long rest A good long rest she repeated looking Cadmus tenderly in the face a good long rest thou dearest one As long as you please dear mother answered Cadmus Telephassa bade him sit down on the turf beside her and then she took his hand My son said she fixing her dim eyes most lovingly upon him this rest that I speak of will be very long indeed You must not wait till it is finished Dear Cadmus you do not comprehend me You must make a grave here and lay your mother s weary frame into it My pilgrimage is over Cadmus burst into tears and for a long time refused to believe that his dear mother was now to be taken from him But Telephassa reasoned with him and kissed him and at length made him discern that it was better for her spirit to pass away out of the toil the weariness the grief and disappointment which had burdened her on earth ever since the child was lost He therefore repressed his sorrow and listened to her last words Dearest Cadmus said she thou hast been the truest son that ever mother had and faithful to the very last Who else would have borne with my infirmities as thou hast It is owing to thy care thou tenderest child that my grave was not dug long years ago in some valley or on some hillside that lies far far behind us It is enough Thou shalt wander no more on this hopeless search But when thou hast laid thy mother in the earth then go my son to Delphi and inquire of the oracle what thou shalt do next O mother mother cried Cadmus couldst thou but have seen my sister before this hour It matters little now answered Telephassa and there was a smile upon her face I go now to the better world and sooner or later shall find my daughter there I will not sadden you my little hearers with telling how Telephassa died and was buried but will only say that her dying smile grew brighter instead of vanishing from her dead face so that Cadmus felt convinced that at her very first step into the better world she had caught Europa in her arms He planted some flowers on his mother s grave and left them to grow there and make the place beautiful when he should be far away After performing this last sorrowful duty he set forth alone and took the road toward the famous oracle of Delphi as Telephassa had advised him On his way thither he still inquired of most people whom he met whether they had seen Europa for to say the truth Cadmus had grown so accustomed to ask the question that it came to his lips as readily as a remark about the weather He received various answers Some told him one thing and some another Among the rest a mariner affirmed that many years before in a distant country he had heard a rumour about a white bull which came swimming across the sea with a child on his back dressed up in flowers that were blighted by the sea water He did not know what had become of the child or the bull and Cadmus suspected indeed by a queer twinkle in the mariner s eyes that he was putting a joke upon him and had never really heard anything about the matter Poor Cadmus found it more wearisome to travel alone than to bear all his dear mother s weight while she had kept him company His heart you will understand was now so heavy that it seemed impossible sometimes to carry it any farther But his limbs were strong and active and well accustomed to exercise He walked swiftly along thinking of King Agenor and Queen Telephassa and his brothers and the friendly Thasus all of whom he had left behind him at one point of his pilgrimage or another and never expected to see them any more Full of these remembrances he came within sight of a lofty mountain which the people thereabouts told him was called Parnassus On the slope of Mount Parnassus was the famous Delphi whither Cadmus was going This Delphi was supposed to be the very midmost spot of the whole world The place of the oracle was a certain cavity in the mountain side over which when Cadmus came thither he found a rude bower of branches It reminded him of those which he had helped to build for Phoenix and Cilix and afterward for Thasus In later times when multitudes of people came from great distances to put questions to the oracle a spacious temple of marble was erected over the spot But in the days of Cadmus as I have told you there was only this rustic bower with its abundance of green foliage and a tuft of shrubbery that ran wild over the mysterious hole in the hillside When Cadmus had thrust a passage through the tangled boughs and made his way into the bower he did not at first discern the half hidden cavity But soon he felt a cold stream of air rushing out of it with so much force that it shook the ringlets on his cheek Pulling away the shrubbery which clustered over the hole he bent forward and spoke in a distinct but reverential tone as if addressing some unseen personage inside of the mountain Sacred oracle of Delphi said he whither shall I go next in quest of my dear sister Europa There was at first a deep silence and then a rushing sound or a noise like a long sigh proceeding out of the interior of the earth This cavity you must know was looked upon as a sort of fountain of truth which sometimes gushed out in audible words although for the most part these words were such a riddle that they might just as well have stayed at the bottom of the hole But Cadmus was more fortunate than many others who went to Delphi in search of truth By and by the rushing noise began to sound like articulate language It repeated over and over again the following sentence which after all was so like the vague whistle of a blast of air that Cadmus really did not quite know whether it meant anything or not Seek her no more Seek her no more Seek her no more What then shall I do asked Cadmus For ever since he was a child you know it had been the great object of his life to find his sister From the very hour that he left following the butterfly in the meadow near his father s palace he had done his best to follow Europa over land and sea And now if he must give up the search he seemed to have no more business in the world But again the sighing gust of air grew into something like a hoarse voice Follow the cow it said Follow the cow Follow the cow And when these words had been repeated until Cadmus was tired of hearing them especially as he could not imagine what cow it was or why he was to follow her the gusty hole gave vent to another sentence Where the stray cow lies down there is your home These words were pronounced but a single time and died away into a whisper before Cadmus was fully satisfied that he had caught the meaning He put other questions but received no answer only the gust of wind sighed continually out of the cavity and blew the withered leaves rustling along the ground before it Did there really come any words out of the hole thought Cadmus or have I been dreaming all this while He turned away from the oracle and thought himself no wiser than when he came thither Caring little what might happen to him he took the first path that offered itself and went along at a sluggish pace for having no object in view nor any reason to go one way more than another it would certainly have been foolish to make haste Whenever he met anybody the old question was at his tongue s end Have you seen a beautiful maiden dressed like a king s daughter and mounted on a snow white bull that gallops as swiftly as the wind But remembering what the oracle had said he only half uttered the words and then mumbled the rest indistinctly and from his confusion people must have imagined that this handsome young man had lost his wits I know not how far Cadmus had gone nor could he himself have told you when at no great distance before him he beheld a brindled cow She was lying down by the wayside and quietly chewing her cud nor did she take any notice of the young man until he had approached pretty nigh Then getting leisurely upon her feet and giving her head a gentle toss she began to move along at a moderate pace often pausing just long enough to crop a mouthful of grass Cadmus loitered behind whistling idly to himself and scarcely noticing the cow until the thought occurred to him whether this could possibly be the animal which according to the oracle s response was to serve him for a guide But he smiled at himself for fancying such a thing He could not seriously think that this was the cow because she went along so quietly behaving just like any other cow Evidently she neither knew nor cared so much as a wisp of hay about Cadmus and was only thinking how to get her living along the wayside where the herbage was green and fresh Perhaps she was going home to be milked Cow cow cow cried Cadmus Hey Brindle hey Stop my good cow He wanted to come up with the cow so as to examine her and see if she would appear to know him or whether there were any peculiarities to distinguish her from a thousand other cows whose only business is to fill the milk pail and sometimes kick it over But still the brindled cow trudged on whisking her tail to keep the flies away and taking as little notice of Cadmus as she well could If he walked slowly so did the cow and seized the opportunity to graze If he quickened his pace the cow went just so much the faster and once when Cadmus tried to catch her by running she threw out her heels stuck her tail straight on end and set off at a gallop looking as queerly as cows generally do while putting themselves to their speed When Cadmus saw that it was impossible to come up with her he walked on moderately as before The cow too went leisurely on without looking behind Wherever the grass was greenest there she nibbled a mouthful or two Where a brook glistened brightly across the path there the cow drank and breathed a comfortable sigh and drank again and trudged onward at the pace that best suited herself and Cadmus I do believe thought Cadmus that this may be the cow that was foretold me If it be the one I suppose she will lie down somewhere hereabouts Whether it were the oracular cow or some other one it did not seem reasonable that she should travel a great way farther So whenever they reached a particularly pleasant spot on a breezy hillside or in a sheltered vale or flowery meadow on the shore of a calm lake or along the bank of a clear stream Cadmus looked eagerly around to see if the situation would suit him for a home But still whether he liked the place or no the brindled cow never offered to lie down On she went at the quiet pace of a cow going homeward to the barnyard and every moment Cadmus expected to see a milkmaid approaching with a pail or a herdsman running to head the stray animal and turn her back toward the pasture But no milkmaid came no herdsman drove her back and Cadmus followed the stray brindle till he was almost ready to drop down with fatigue O brindled cow cried he in a tone of despair do you never mean to stop He had now grown too intent on following her to think of lagging behind however long the way and whatever might be his fatigue Indeed it seemed as if there were something about the animal that bewitched people Several persons who happened to see the brindled cow and Cadmus following behind began to trudge after her precisely as he did Cadmus was glad of somebody to converse with and therefore talked very freely to these good people He told them all his adventures and how he had left King Agenor in his palace and Phoenix at one place and Cilix at another and Thasus at a third and his dear mother Queen Telephassa under a flowery sod so that now he was quite alone both friendless and homeless He mentioned likewise that the oracle had bidden him be guided by a cow and inquired of the strangers whether they supposed that this brindled animal could be the one Why tis a very wonderful affair answered one of his new companions I am pretty well acquainted with the ways of cattle and I never knew a cow of her own accord to go so far without stopping If my legs will let me I ll never leave following the beast till she lies down Nor I said a second Nor I cried a third If she goes a hundred miles farther I m determined to see the end of it The secret of it was you must know that the cow was an enchanted cow and that without their being conscious of it she threw some of her enchantment over everybody that took so much as half a dozen steps behind her They could not possibly help following her though all the time they fancied themselves doing it of their own accord The cow was by no means very nice in choosing her path so that sometimes they had to scramble over rocks or wade through mud and mire and were all in a terribly bedraggled condition and tired to death and very hungry into the bargain What a weary business it was But still they kept trudging stoutly forward and talking as they went The strangers grew very fond of Cadmus and resolved never to leave him but to help him build a city wherever the cow might lie down In the centre of it there should be a noble palace in which Cadmus might dwell and be their king with a throne a crown and sceptre a purple robe and everything else that a king ought to have for in him there was the royal blood and the royal heart and the head that knew how to rule While they were talking of these schemes and beguiling the tediousness of the way with laying out the plan of the new city one of the company happened to look at the cow Joy joy cried he clapping his hands Brindle is going to lie down They all looked and sure enough the cow had stopped and was staring leisurely about her as other cows do when on the point of lying down And slowly slowly did she recline herself on the soft grass first bending her fore legs and then crouching her hind ones When Cadmus and his companions came up with her there was the brindled cow taking her ease chewing her cud and looking them quietly in the face as if this was just the spot she had been seeking for and as if it were all a matter of course This then said Cadmus gazing around him this is to be my home It was a fertile and lovely plain with great trees flinging their sun speckled shadows over it and hills fencing it in from the rough weather At no great distance they beheld a river gleaming in the sunshine A home feeling stole into the heart of poor Cadmus He was very glad to know that here he might awake in the morning without the necessity of putting on his dusty sandals to travel farther and farther The days and the years would pass over him and find him still in this pleasant spot If he could have had his brothers with him and his friend Thasus and could have seen his dear mother under a roof of his own he might here have been happy after all their disappointments Some day or other too his sister Europa might have come quietly to the door of his home and smiled round upon the familiar faces But indeed since there was no hope of regaining the friends of his boyhood or ever seeing his dear sister again Cadmus resolved to make himself happy with these new companions who had grown so fond of him while following the cow Yes my friends said he to them this is to be our home Here we will build our habitations The brindled cow which has led us hither will supply us with milk We will cultivate the neighbouring soil and lead an innocent and happy life His companions joyfully assented to this plan and in the first place being very hungry and thirsty they looked about them for the means of providing a comfortable meal Not far off they saw a tuft of trees which appeared as if there might be a spring of water beneath them They went thither to fetch some leaving Cadmus stretched on the ground along with the brindled cow for now that he had found a place of rest it seemed as if all the weariness of his pilgrimage ever since he left King Agenor s palace had fallen upon him at once But his new friends had not long been gone when he was suddenly startled by cries shouts and screams and the noise of a terrible struggle and in the midst of it all a most awful hissing which went right through his ears like a rough saw Running toward the tuft of trees he beheld the head and fiery eyes of an immense serpent or dragon with the widest jaws that ever a dragon had and a vast many rows of horribly sharp teeth Before Cadmus could reach the spot this pitiless reptile had killed his poor companions and was busily devouring them making but a mouthful of each man It appears that the fountain of water was enchanted and that the dragon had been set to guard it so that no mortal might ever quench his thirst there As the neighbouring inhabitants carefully avoided the spot it was now a long time not less than a hundred years or thereabouts since the monster had broken his fast and as was natural enough his appetite had grown to be enormous and was not half satisfied by the poor people whom he had just eaten up When he caught sight of Cadmus therefore he set up another abominable hiss and flung back his immense jaws until his mouth looked like a great red cavern at the farther end of which were seen the legs of his last victim whom he had hardly had time to swallow But Cadmus was so enraged at the destruction of his friends that he cared neither for the size of the dragon s jaws nor for his hundreds of sharp teeth Drawing his sword he rushed at the monster and flung himself right into his cavernous mouth This bold method of attacking him took the dragon by surprise for in fact Cadmus had leaped so far down into his throat that the rows of terrible teeth could not close upon him nor do him the least harm in the world Thus though the struggle was a tremendous one and though the dragon shattered the tuft of trees into small splinters by the lashing of his tail yet as Cadmus was all the while slashing and stabbing at his very vitals it was not long before the scaly wretch bethought himself of slipping away He had not gone his length however when the brave Cadmus gave him a sword thrust that finished the battle and creeping out of the gateway of the creature s jaws there he beheld him still wriggling his vast bulk although there was no longer life enough in him to harm a little child But do not you suppose that it made Cadmus sorrowful to think of the melancholy fate which had befallen those poor friendly people who had followed the cow along with him It seemed as if he were doomed to lose everybody whom he loved or to see them perish in one way or another And here he was after all his toils and troubles in a solitary place with not a single human being to help him build a hut What shall I do cried he aloud It were better for me to have been devoured by the dragon as my poor companions were Cadmus said a voice but whether it came from above or below him or whether it spoke within his own breast the young man could not tell Cadmus pluck out the dragon s teeth and plant them in the earth This was a strange thing to do nor was it very easy I should imagine to dig out all those deep rooted fangs from the dead dragon s jaws But Cadmus toiled and tugged and after pounding the monstrous head almost to pieces with a great stone he at last collected as many teeth as might have filled a bushel or two The next thing was to plant them This likewise was a tedious piece of work especially as Cadmus was already exhausted with killing the dragon and knocking his head to pieces and had nothing to dig the earth with that I know of unless it were his sword blade Finally however a sufficiently large tract of ground was turned up and sown with this new kind of seed although half of the dragon s teeth still remained to be planted some other day Cadmus quite out of breath stood leaning upon his sword and wondering what was to happen next He had waited but a few moments when he began to see a sight which was as great a marvel as the most marvellous thing I ever told you about The sun was shining slantwise over the field and showed all the moist dark soil just like any other newly planted piece of ground All at once Cadmus fancied he saw something glisten very brightly first at one spot then at another and then at a hundred and a thousand spots together Soon he perceived them to be the steel heads of spears sprouting up everywhere like so many stalks of grain and continually growing taller and taller Next appeared a vast number of bright sword blades thrusting themselves up in the same way A moment afterward the whole surface of the ground was broken up by a multitude of polished brass helmets coming up like a crop of enormous beans So rapidly did they grow that Cadmus now discerned the fierce countenance of a man beneath every one In short before he had time to think what a wonderful affair it was he beheld an abundant harvest of what looked like human beings armed with helmets and breastplates shields swords and spears and before they were well out of the earth they brandished their weapons and clashed them one against another seeming to think little while as they had yet lived that they had wasted too much of life without a battle Every tooth of the dragon had produced one of these sons of deadly mischief Up sprouted also a great many trumpeters and with the first breath that they drew they put their brazen trumpets to their lips and sounded a tremendous and ear shattering blast so that the whole space just now so quiet and solitary reverberated with the clash and clang of arms the bray of warlike music and the shouts of angry men So enraged did they all look that Cadmus fully expected them to put the whole world to the sword How fortunate would it be for a great conqueror if he could get a bushel of the dragon s teeth to sow Cadmus said the same voice which he had before heard throw a stone into the midst of the armed men So Cadmus seized a large stone and flinging it into the middle of the earth army saw it strike the breast plate of a gigantic and fierce looking warrior Immediately on feeling the blow he seemed to take it for granted that somebody had struck him and uplifting his weapon he smote his next neighbour a blow that cleft his helmet asunder and stretched him on the ground In an instant those nearest the fallen warrior began to strike at one another with their swords and stab with their spears The confusion spread wider and wider Each man smote down his brother and was himself smitten down before he had time to exult in his victory The trumpeters all the while blew their blasts shriller and shriller each soldier shouted a battle cry and often fell with it on his lips It was the strangest spectacle of causeless wrath and of mischief for no good end that had ever been witnessed but after all it was neither more foolish nor more wicked than a thousand battles that have since been fought in which men have slain their brothers with just as little reason as these children of the dragon s teeth It ought to be considered too that the dragon people were made for nothing else whereas other mortals were born to love and help one another Well this memorable battle continued to rage until the ground was strewn with helmeted heads that had been cut off Of all the thousands that began the fight there were only five left standing These now rushed from different parts of the field and meeting in the middle of it clashed their swords and struck at each other s hearts as fiercely as ever Cadmus said the voice again bid those five warriors to sheathe their swords They will help you to build the city Without hesitating an instant Cadmus stepped forward with the aspect of a king and a leader and extending his drawn sword amongst them spoke to the warriors in a stern and commanding voice Sheathe your weapons said he And forthwith feeling themselves bound to obey him the five remaining sons of the dragon s teeth made him a military salute with their swords returned them to the scabbards and stood before Cadmus in a rank eyeing him as soldiers eye their captain while awaiting the word of command These five men had probably sprung from the biggest of the dragon s teeth and were the boldest and strongest of the whole army They were almost giants indeed and had good need to be so else they never could have lived through so terrible a fight They still had a very furious look and if Cadmus happened to glance aside would glare at one another with fire flashing out of their eyes It was strange too to observe how the earth out of which they had so lately grown was incrusted here and there on their bright breastplates and even begrimed their faces just as you may have seen it clinging to beets and carrots when pulled out of their native soil Cadmus hardly knew whether to consider them as men or some odd kind of vegetable although on the whole he concluded that there was human nature in them because they were so fond of trumpets and weapons and so ready to shed blood They looked him earnestly in the face waiting for his next order and evidently desiring no other employment than to follow him from one battlefield to another all over the wide world But Cadmus was wiser than these earth born creatures with the dragon s fierceness in them and knew better how to use their strength and hardihood Come said he You are sturdy fellows Make yourselves useful Quarry some stones with those great swords of yours and help me to build a city The five soldiers grumbled a little and muttered that it was their business to overthrow cities not to build them up But Cadmus looked at them with a stern eye and spoke to them in a tone of authority so that they knew him for their master and never again thought of disobeying his commands They set to work in good earnest and toiled so diligently that in a very short time a city began to make its appearance At first to be sure the workmen showed a quarrelsome disposition Like savage beasts they would doubtless have done one another a mischief if Cadmus had not kept watch over them and quelled the fierce old serpent that lurked in their hearts when he saw it gleaming out of their wild eyes But in course of time they got accustomed to honest labour and had sense enough to feel that there was more true enjoyment in living at peace and doing good to one s neighbour than in striking at him with a two edged sword It may not be too much to hope that the rest of mankind will by and by grow as wise and peaceable as these five earth begrimed warriors who sprang from the dragon s teeth And now the city was built and there was a home in it for each of the workmen But the palace of Cadmus was not yet erected because they had left it till the last meaning to introduce all the new improvements of architecture and make it very commodious as well as stately and beautiful After finishing the rest of their labours they all went to bed betimes in order to rise in the gray of the morning and get at least the foundation of the edifice laid before nightfall But when Cadmus arose and took his way toward the site where the palace was to be built followed by his five sturdy workmen marching all in a row what do you think he saw What should it be but the most magnificent palace that had ever been seen in the world It was built of marble and other beautiful kinds of stone and rose high into the air with a splendid dome and a portico along the front and carved pillars and everything else that befitted the habitation of a mighty king It had grown up out of the earth in almost as short a time as it had taken the armed host to spring from the dragon s teeth and what made the matter more strange no seed of this stately edifice had ever been planted When the five workmen beheld the dome with the morning sunshine making it look golden and glorious they gave a great shout Long live King Cadmus they cried in his beautiful palace And the new king with his five faithful followers at his heels shouldering their pickaxes and marching in a rank for they still had a soldier like sort of behaviour as their nature was ascended the palace steps Halting at the entrance they gazed through a long vista of lofty pillars that were ranged from end to end of a great hall At the farther extremity of this hall approaching slowly toward him Cadmus beheld a female figure wonderfully beautiful and adorned with a royal robe and a crown of diamonds over her golden ringlets and the richest necklace that ever a queen wore His heart thrilled with delight He fancied it his long lost sister Europa now grown to womanhood coming to make him happy and to repay him with her sweet sisterly affection for all those weary wanderings in quest of her since he left King Agenor s palace for the tears that he had shed on parting with Phoenix and Cilix and Thasus for the heart breakings that had made the whole world seem dismal to him over his dear mother s grave But as Cadmus advanced to meet the beautiful stranger he saw that her features were unknown to him although in the little time that it required to tread along the hall he had already felt a sympathy betwixt himself and her No Cadmus said the same voice that had spoken to him in the field of the armed men this is not that dear sister Europa whom you have sought so faithfully all over the wide world This is Harmonia a daughter of the sky who is given you instead of sister and brothers and friend and mother You will find all those dear ones in her alone So King Cadmus dwelt in the palace with his new friend Harmonia and found a great deal of comfort in his magnificent abode but would doubtless have found as much if not more in the humblest cottage by the wayside Before many years went by there was a group of rosy little children but how they came thither has always been a mystery to me sporting in the great hall and on the marble steps of the palace and running joyfully to meet King Cadmus when affairs of state left him at leisure to play with them They called him father and Queen Harmonia mother The five old soldiers of the dragon s teeth grew very fond of these small urchins and were never weary of showing them how to shoulder sticks flourish wooden swords and march in military order blowing a penny trumpet or beating an abominable rub a dub upon a little drum But King Cadmus lest there should be too much of the dragon s tooth in his children s disposition used to find time from his kingly duties to teach them their A B C which he invented for their benefit and for which many little people I am afraid are not half so grateful to him as they ought to be CHAPTER VII THE MIRACULOUS PITCHER One evening in times long ago old Philemon and his old wife Baucis sat at their cottage door enjoying the calm and beautiful sunset They had already eaten their frugal supper and intended now to spend a quiet hour or two before bedtime So they talked together about their garden and their cow and their bees and their grapevine which clambered over the cottage wall and on which the grapes were beginning to turn purple But the rude shouts of children and the fierce barking of dogs in the village near at hand grew louder and louder until at last it was hardly possible for Baucis and Philemon to hear each other speak Ah wife cried Philemon I fear some poor traveller is seeking hospitality among our neighbours yonder and instead of giving him food and lodging they have set their dogs at him as their custom is Well a day answered old Baucis I do wish our neighbours felt a little more kindness for their fellow creatures And only think of bringing up their children in this naughty way and patting them on the head when they fling stones at strangers Those children will never come to any good said Philemon shaking his white head To tell you the truth wife I should not wonder if some terrible thing were to happen to all the people in the village unless they mend their manners But as for you and me so long as Providence affords us a crust of bread let us be ready to give half to any poor homeless stranger that may come along and need it That s right husband said Baucis So we will These old folks you must know were quite poor and had to work pretty hard for a living Old Philemon toiled diligently in his garden while Baucis was always busy with her distaff or making a little butter and cheese with their cow s milk or doing one thing and another about the cottage Their food was seldom anything but bread milk and vegetables with sometimes a portion of honey from their beehive and now and then a bunch of grapes that had ripened against the cottage wall But they were two of the kindest old people in the world and would cheerfully have gone without their dinners any day rather than refuse a slice of their brown loaf a cup of new milk and a spoonful of honey to the weary traveller who might pause before their door They felt as if such guests had a sort of holiness and that they ought therefore to treat them better and more bountifully than their own selves Their cottage stood on a rising ground at some short distance from a village which lay in a hollow valley that was about half a mile in breadth This valley in past ages when the world was new had probably been the bed of a lake There fishes had glided to and fro in the depths and water weeds had grown along the margin and trees and hills had seen their reflected images in the broad and peaceful mirror But as the waters subsided men had cultivated the soil and built houses on it so that it was now a fertile spot and bore no traces of the ancient lake except a very small brook which meandered through the midst of the village and supplied the inhabitants with water The valley had been dry land so long that oaks had sprung up and grown great and high and perished with old age and been succeeded by others as tall and stately as the first Never was there a prettier or more fruitful valley The very sight of the plenty around them should have made the inhabitants kind and gentle and ready to show their gratitude to Providence by doing good to their fellow creatures But we are sorry to say the people of this lovely village were not worthy to dwell in a spot on which Heaven had smiled so beneficently They were a very selfish and hard hearted people and had no pity for the poor nor sympathy with the homeless They would only have laughed had anybody told them that human beings owe a debt of love to one another because there is no other method of paying the debt of love and care which all of us owe to Providence You will hardly believe what I am going to tell you These naughty people taught their children to be no better than themselves and used to clap their hands by way of encouragement when they saw the little boys and girls run after some poor stranger shouting at his heels and pelting him with stones They kept large and fierce dogs and whenever a traveller ventured to show himself in the village street this pack of disagreeable curs scampered to meet him barking snarling and showing their teeth Then they would seize him by his leg or by his clothes just as it happened and if he were ragged when he came he was generally a pitiable object before he had time to run away This was a very terrible thing to poor travellers as you may suppose especially when they chanced to be sick or feeble or lame or old Such persons if they once knew how badly these unkind people and their unkind children and curs were in the habit of behaving would go miles and miles out of their way rather than try to pass through the village again What made the matter seem worse if possible was that when rich persons came in their chariots or riding on beautiful horses with their servants in rich liveries attending on them nobody could be more civil and obsequious than the inhabitants of the village They would take off their hats and make the humblest bows you ever saw If the children were rude they were pretty certain to get their ears boxed and as for the dogs if a single cur in the pack presumed to yelp his master instantly beat him with a club and tied him up without any supper This would have been all very well only it proved that the villagers cared much about the money that a stranger had in his pocket and nothing whatever for the human soul which lives equally in the beggar and the prince So now you can understand why old Philemon spoke so sorrowfully when he heard the shouts of the children and the barking of the dogs at the farther extremity of the village street There was a confused din which lasted a good while and seemed to pass quite through the breadth of the valley I never heard the dogs so loud observed the good old man Nor the children so rude answered his good old wife They sat shaking their heads one to another while the noise came nearer and nearer until at the foot of the little eminence on which their cottage stood they saw two travellers approaching on foot Close behind them came the fierce dogs snarling at their very heels A little farther off ran a crowd of children who sent up shrill cries and flung stones at the two strangers with all their might Once or twice the younger of the two men he was a slender and very active figure turned about and drove back the dogs with a staff which he carried in his hand His companion who was a very tall person walked calmly along as if disdaining to notice either the naughty children or the pack of curs whose manners the children seemed to imitate Both of the travellers were very humbly clad and looked as if they might not have money enough in their pockets to pay for a night s lodging And this I am afraid was the reason why the villagers had allowed their children and dogs to treat them so rudely Come wife said Philemon to Baucis let us go and meet these poor people No doubt they feel almost too heavy hearted to climb the hill Go you and meet them answered Baucis while I make haste within doors and see whether we can get them anything for supper A comfortable bowl of bread and milk would do wonders toward raising their spirits Accordingly she hastened into the cottage Philemon on his part went forward and extended his hand with so hospitable an aspect that there was no need of saying what nevertheless he did say in the heartiest tone imaginable Welcome strangers welcome Thank you replied the younger of the two in a lively kind of way notwithstanding his weariness and trouble This is quite another greeting than we have met with yonder in the village Pray why do you live in such a bad neighbourhood Ah observed old Philemon with a quiet and benign smite Providence put me here I hope among other reasons in order that I may make you what amends I can for the inhospitality of my neighbours Well said old father cried the traveller laughing and if the truth must be told my companion and myself need some amends Those children the little rascals have bespattered us finely with their mud balls and one of the curs has torn my cloak which was ragged enough already But I took him across the muzzle with my staff and I think you may have heard him yelp even thus far off Philemon was glad to see him in such good spirits nor indeed would you have fancied by the traveller s look and manner that he was weary with a long day s journey besides being disheartened by rough treatment at the end of it He was dressed in rather an odd way with a sort of cap on his head the brim of which stuck out over both ears Though it was a summer evening he wore a cloak which he kept wrapt closely about him perhaps because his undergarments were shabby Philemon perceived too that he had on a singular pair of shoes but as it was now growing dusk and as the old man s eyesight was none the sharpest he could not precisely tell in what the strangeness consisted One thing certainly seemed queer The traveller was so wonderfully light and active that it appeared as if his feet sometimes rose from the ground of their own accord or could only be kept down by an effort I used to be light footed in my youth said Philemon to the traveller But I always found my feet grow heavier toward nightfall There is nothing like a good staff to help one along answered the stranger and I happen to have an excellent one as you see This staff in fact was the oddest looking staff that Philemon had ever beheld It was made of olive wood and had something like a little pair of wings near the top Two snakes carved in the wood were represented as twining themselves about the staff and were so very skilfully executed that old Philemon whose eyes you know were getting rather dim almost thought them alive and that he could see them wriggling and twisting A curious piece of work sure enough said he A staff with wings It would be an excellent kind of stick for a little boy to ride astride of By this time Philemon and his two guests had reached the cottage door Friends said the old man sit down and rest yourselves here on this bench My good wife Baucis has gone to see what you can have for supper We are poor folks but you shall be welcome to whatever we have in the cupboard The younger stranger threw himself carelessly on the bench letting his staff fall as he did so And here happened something rather marvellous though trifling enough too The staff seemed to get up from the ground of its own accord and spreading its little pair of wings it half hopped half flew and leaned itself against the wall of the cottage There it stood quite still except that the snakes continued to wriggle But in my private opinion old Philemon s eyesight had been playing him tricks again Before he could ask any questions the elder stranger drew his attention from the wonderful staff by speaking to him Was there not asked the stranger in a remarkably deep tone of voice a lake in very ancient times covering the spot where now stands yonder village Not in my day friend answered Philemon and yet I am an old man as you see There were always the fields and meadows just as they are now and the old trees and the little stream murmuring through the midst of the valley My father nor his father before him ever saw it otherwise so far as I know and doubtless it will still be the same when old Philemon shall be gone and forgotten That is more than can be safely foretold observed the stranger and there was something very stern in his deep voice He shook his head too so that his dark and heavy curls were shaken with the movement Since the inhabitants of yonder village have forgotten the affections and sympathies of their nature it were better that the lake should be rippling over their dwellings again The traveller looked so stern that Philemon was really almost frightened the more so that at his frown the twilight seemed suddenly to grow darker and that when he shook his head there was a roll as of thunder in the air But in a moment afterward the stranger s face became so kindly and mild that the old man quite forgot his terror Nevertheless he could not help feeling that this elder traveller must be no ordinary personage although he happened now to be attired so humbly and to be journeying on foot Not that Philemon fancied him a prince in disguise or any character of that sort but rather some exceedingly wise man who went about the world in this poor garb despising wealth and all worldly objects and seeking everywhere to add a mite to his wisdom This idea appeared the more probable because when Philemon raised his eyes to the stranger s face he seemed to see more thought there in one look than he could have studied out in a lifetime While Baucis was getting the supper the travellers both began to talk very sociably with Philemon The younger indeed was extremely loquacious and made such shrewd and witty remarks that the good old man continually burst out a laughing and pronounced him the merriest fellow whom he had seen for many a day Pray my young friend said he as they grew familiar together what may I call your name Why I am very nimble as you see answered the traveller So if you call me Quicksilver the name will fit tolerably well Quicksilver Quicksilver repeated Philemon looking in the traveller s face to see if he were making fun of him It is a very odd name And your companion there Has he as strange a one You must ask the thunder to tell it you replied Quicksilver putting on a mysterious look No other voice is loud enough This remark whether it were serious or in jest might have caused Philemon to conceive a very great awe of the elder stranger if on venturing to gaze at him he had not beheld so much beneficence in his visage But undoubtedly here was the grandest figure that ever sat so humbly beside a cottage door When the stranger conversed it was with gravity and in such a way that Philemon felt irresistibly moved to tell him everything which he had most at heart This is always the feeling that people have when they meet with anyone wise enough to comprehend all their good and evil and to despise not a tittle of it But Philemon simple and kind hearted old man that he was had not many secrets to disclose He talked however quite garrulously about the events of his past life in the whole course of which he had never been a score of miles from this very spot His wife Baucis and himself had dwelt in the cottage from their youth upward earning their bread by honest labour always poor but still contented He told what excellent butter and cheese Baucis made and how nice were the vegetables which he raised in his garden He said too that because they loved one another so very much it was the wish of both that death might not separate them but that they should die as they had lived together As the stranger listened a smile beamed over his countenance and made its expression as sweet as it was grand You are a good old man said he to Philemon and you have a good old wife to be your helpmeet It is fit that your wish be granted And it seemed to Philemon just then as if the sunset clouds threw up a bright flash from the west and kindled a sudden light in the sky Baucis had now got supper ready and coming to the door began to make apologies for the poor fare which she was forced to set before her guests Had we known you were coming said she my good man and myself would have gone without a morsel rather than you should lack a better supper But I took the most part of to day s milk to make cheese and our last loaf is already half eaten Ah me I never feel the sorrow of being poor save when a poor traveller knocks at our door All will be very well do not trouble yourself my good dame replied the elder stranger kindly An honest hearty welcome to a guest works miracles with the fare and is capable of turning the coarsest food to nectar and ambrosia A welcome you shall have cried Baucis and likewise a little honey that we happen to have left and a bunch of purple grapes besides Why Mother Baucis it is a feast exclaimed Quicksilver laughing an absolute feast and you shall see how bravely I will play my part at it I think I never felt hungrier in my life Mercy on us whispered Baucis to her husband If the young man has such a terrible appetite I am afraid there will not be half enough supper They all went into the cottage And now my little auditors shall I tell you something that will make you open your eyes very wide It is really one of the oddest circumstances in the who e story Quicksilver s staff you recollect had set itself up against the wall of the cottage Well when its master entered the door leaving this wonderful staff behind what should it do but immediately spread its little wings and go hopping and fluttering up the door steps Tap tap went the staff on the kitchen floor nor did it rest until it had stood itself on end with the greatest gravity and decorum beside Quicksilver s chair Old Philemon however as well as his wife was so taken up in attending to their guests that no notice was given to what the staff had been about As Baucis had said there was but a scanty supper for two hungry travellers In the middle of the table was the remnant of a brown loaf with a piece of cheese on one side of it and a dish of honeycomb on the other There was a pretty good bunch of grapes for each of the guests A moderately sized earthen pitcher nearly full of milk stood at a corner of the board and when Baucis had filled two bowls and set them before the strangers only a little milk remained in the bottom of the pitcher Alas it is a very sad business when a bountiful heart finds itself pinched and squeezed among narrow circumstances Poor Baucis kept wishing that she might starve for a week to come if it were possible by so doing to provide these hungry folks a more plentiful supper And since the supper was so exceedingly small she could not help wishing that their appetites had not been quite so large Why at their very first sitting down the travellers both drank off all the milk in their two bowls at a draught A little more milk kind Mother Baucis if you please said Quicksilver The day has been hot and I am very much athirst Now my dear people answered Baucis in great confusion I am so sorry and ashamed But the truth is there is hardly a drop more milk in the pitcher O husband husband why didn t we go without our supper Why it appears to me cried Quicksilver starting up from the table and taking the pitcher by the handle it really appears to me that matters are not quite so bad as you represent them Here is certainly more milk in the pitcher So saying and to the vast astonishment of Baucis he proceeded to fill not only his own bowl but his companion s likewise from the pitcher that was supposed to be almost empty The good woman could scarcely believe her eyes She had certainly poured out nearly all the milk and had peeped in afterward and seen the bottom of the pitcher as she set it down upon the table But I am old thought Baucis to herself and apt to be forgetful I suppose I must have made a mistake At all events the pitcher cannot help being empty now after filling the bowls twice over What excellent milk observed Quicksilver after quaffing the contents of the second bowl Excuse me my kind hostess but I must really ask you for a little more Now Baucis had seen as plainly as she could see anything that Quicksilver had turned the pitcher upside down and consequently had poured out every drop of milk in filling the last bowl Of course there could not possibly be any left However in order to let him know precisely how the case was she lifted the pitcher and made a gesture as if pouring milk into Quicksilver s bowl but without the remotest idea that any milk would stream forth What was her surprise therefore when such an abundant cascade fell bubbling into the bowl that it was immediately filled to the brim and overflowed upon the table The two snakes that were twisted about Quicksilver s staff but neither Baucis nor Philemon happened to observe this circumstance stretched out their heads and began to lap up the spilt milk And then what a delicious fragrance the milk had It seemed as if Philemon s only cow must have pastured that day on the richest herbage that could be found anywhere in the world I only wish that each of you my beloved little souls could have a bowl of such nice milk at supper time And now a slice of your brown loaf Mother Baucis said Quicksilver and a little of that honey Baucis cut him a slice accordingly and though the loaf when she and her husband ate of it had been rather too dry and crusty to be palatable it was now as light and moist as if but a few hours out of the oven Tasting a crumb which had fallen on the table she found it more delicious than bread ever was before and could hardly believe that it was a loaf of her own kneading and baking Yet what other loaf could it possibly be But oh the honey I may just as well let it alone without trying to describe how exquisitely it smelt and looked Its colour was that of the purest and most transparent gold and it had the odour of a thousand flowers but of such flowers as never grew in an earthly garden and to seek which the bees must have flown high above the clouds The wonder is that after alighting on a flower bed of so delicious fragrance and immortal bloom they should have been content to fly down again to their hive in Philemon s garden Never was such honey tasted seen or smelt The perfume floated around the kitchen and made it so delightful that had you closed your eyes you would instantly have forgotten the low ceiling and smoky walls and have fancied yourself in an arbour with celestial honeysuckles creeping over it Although good Mother Baucis was a simple old dame she could not but think that there was something rather out of the common way in all that had been going on So after helping the guests to bread and honey and laying a bunch of grapes by each of their plates she sat down by Philemon and told him what she had seen in a whisper Did you ever hear the like asked she No I never did answered Philemon with a smile And I rather think my dear old wife you have been walking about in a sort of a dream If I had poured out the milk I should have seen through the business at once There happened to be a little more in the pitcher than you thought that is all Ah husband said Baucis say what you will these are very uncommon people Well well replied Philemon still smiling perhaps they are They certainly do look as if they had seen better days and I am heartily glad to see them making so comfortable a supper Each of the guests had now taken his bunch of grapes upon his plate Baucis who rubbed her eyes in order to see the more clearly was of opinion that the clusters had grown larger and richer and that each separate grape seemed to be on the point of bursting with ripe juice It was entirely a mystery to her how such grapes could ever have been produced from the old stunted vine that climbed against the cottage wall Very admirable grapes these observed Quicksilver as he swallowed one after another without apparently diminishing his cluster Pray my good host whence did you gather them From my own vine answered Philemon You may see one of its branches twisting across the window yonder But wife and I never thought the grapes very fine ones I never tasted better said the guest Another cup of this delicious milk if you please and I shall then have supped better than a prince This time old Philemon bestirred himself and took up the pitcher for he was curious to discover whether there was any reality in the marvels which Baucis had whispered to him He knew that his good old wife was incapable of falsehood and that she was seldom mistaken in what she supposed to be true but this was so very singular a case that he wanted to see into it with his own eyes On taking up the pitcher therefore he slyly peeped into it and was fully satisfied that it contained not so much as a single drop All at once however he beheld a little white fountain which gushed up from the bottom of the pitcher and speedily filled it to the brim with foaming and deliciously fragrant milk It was lucky that Philemon in his surprise did not drop the miraculous pitcher from his hand Who are ye wonder working strangers cried he even more bewildered than his wife had been Your guests my good Philemon and your friends replied the elder traveller in his mild deep voice that had something at once sweet and awe inspiring in it Give me likewise a cup of the milk and may your pitcher never be empty for kind Baucis and yourself any more than for the needy wayfarer The supper being now over the strangers requested to be shown to their place of repose The old people would gladly have talked with them a little longer and have expressed the wonder which they felt and their delight at finding the poor and meagre supper prove so much better and more abundant than they hoped But the elder traveller had inspired them with such reverence that they dared not ask him any questions And when Philemon drew Quicksilver aside and inquired how under the sun a fountain of milk could have got into an old earthen pitcher this latter personage pointed to his staff There is the whole mystery of the affair quoth Quicksilver and if you can make it out I ll thank you to let me know I can t tell what to make of my staff It is always playing such odd tricks as this sometimes getting me a supper and quite as often stealing it away If I had any faith in such nonsense I should say the stick was bewitched He said no more but looked so slyly in their faces that they rather fancied he was laughing at them The magic staff went hopping at his heels as Quicksilver quitted the room When left alone the good old couple spent some little time in conversation about the events of the evening and then lay down on the floor and fell fast asleep They had given up their sleeping room to the guests and had no other bed for themselves save these planks which I wish had been as soft as their own hearts The old man and his wife were stirring betimes in the morning and the strangers likewise arose with the sun and made their preparations to depart Philemon hospitably entreated them to remain a little longer until Baucis could milk the cow and bake a cake upon the hearth and perhaps find them a few fresh eggs for breakfast The guests however seemed to think it better to accomplish a good part of their journey before the heat of the day should come on They therefore persisted in setting out immediately but asked Philemon and Baucis to walk forth with them a short distance and show them the road which they were to take So they all four issued from the cottage chatting together like old friends It was very remarkable indeed how familiar the old couple insensibly grew with the elder traveller and how their good and simple spirits melted into his even as two drops of water would melt into the illimitable ocean And as for Quicksilver with his keen quick laughing wits he appeared to discover every little thought that but peeped into their minds before they suspected it themselves They sometimes wished it is true that he had not been quite so quick witted and also that he would fling away his staff which looked so mysteriously mischievous with the snakes always writhing about it But then again Quicksilver showed himself so very good humoured that they would have been rejoiced to keep him in their cottage staff snakes and all every day and the whole day long Ah me Well a day exclaimed Philemon when they had walked a little way from their door If our neighbours only knew what a blessed thing it is to show hospitality to strangers they would tie up all their dogs and never allow their children to fling another stone It is a sin and shame for them to behave so that it is cried good old Baucis vehemently And I mean to go this very day and tell some of them what naughty people they are I fear remarked Quicksilver slyly smiling that you will find none of them at home The elder traveller s brow just then assumed such a grave stern and awful grandeur yet serene withal that neither Baucis nor Philemon dared to speak a word They gazed reverently into his face as if they had been gazing at the sky When men do not feel toward the humblest stranger as if he were a brother said the traveller in tones so deep that they sounded like those of an organ they are unworthy to exist on earth which was created as the abode of a great human brotherhood And by the by my dear old people cried Quicksilver with the liveliest look of fun and mischief in his eyes where is this same village that you talk about On which side of us does it lie Methinks I do not see it hereabouts Philemon and his wife turned toward the valley where at sunset only the day before they had seen the meadows the houses the gardens the clumps of trees the wide green margined street with children playing in it and all the tokens of business enjoyment and prosperity But what was their astonishment There was no longer any appearance of a village Even the fertile vale in the hollow of which it lay had ceased to have existence In its stead they beheld the broad blue surface of a lake which filled the great basin of the valley from brim to brim and reflected the surrounding hills in its bosom with as tranquil an image as if it had been there ever since the creation of the world For an instant the lake remained perfectly smooth Then a little breeze sprang up and caused the water to dance glitter and sparkle in the early sunbeams and to dash with a pleasant rippling murmur against the hither shore The lake seemed so strangely familiar that the old couple were greatly perplexed and felt as if they could only have been dreaming about a village having lain there But the next moment they remembered the vanished dwellings and the faces and characters of the inhabitants far too distinctly for a dream The village had been there yesterday and now was gone Alas cried the kind hearted old people what has become of our poor neighbours They exist no longer as men and women said the elder traveller in his grand and deep voice while a roll of thunder seemed to echo it at a distance There was neither use nor beauty in such a life as theirs for they never softened or sweetened the hard lot of mortality by the exercise of kindly affections between man and man They retained no image of the better life in their bosoms therefore the lake that was of old has spread itself forth again to reflect the sky And as for those foolish people said Quicksilver with his mischievous smile they are all transformed to fishes There needed but little change for they were already a scaly set of rascals and the coldest blooded beings in existence So kind Mother Baucis whenever you or your husband have an appetite for a dish of broiled trout he can throw in a line and pull out half a dozen of your old neighbours Ah cried Baucis shuddering I would not for the world put one of them on the gridiron No added Philemon making a wry face we could never relish them As for you good Philemon continued the elder traveller and you kind Baucis you with your scanty means have mingled so much heartfelt hospitality with your entertainment of the homeless stranger that the milk became an inexhaustible fount of nectar and the brown loaf and the honey were ambrosia Thus the divinities have feasted at your board off the same viands that supply their banquets on Olympus You have done well my dear old friends Wherefore request whatever favour you have most at heart and it is granted Philemon and Baucis looked at one another and then I know not which of the two it was who spoke but that one uttered the desire of both their hearts Let us live together while we live and leave the world at the same instant when we die For we have always loved one another Be it so replied the stranger with majestic kindness Now look toward your cottage They did so But what was their surprise on beholding a tall edifice of white marble with a wide open portal occupying the spot where their humble residence had so lately stood There is your home said the stranger beneficently smiling on them both Exercise your hospitality in yonder palace as freely as in the poor hovel to which you welcomed us last evening The old folks fell on their knees to thank him but behold neither he nor Quicksilver was there So Philemon and Baucis took up their residence in the marble palace and spent their time with vast satisfaction to themselves in making everybody jolly and comfortable who happened to pass that way The milk pitcher I must not forget to say retained its marvellous quality of being never empty when it was desirable to have it full Whenever an honest good humoured and free hearted guest took a draught from this pitcher he invariably found it the sweetest and most invigorating fluid that ever ran down his throat But if a cross and disagreeable curmudgeon happened to sip he was pretty certain to twist his visage into a hard knot and pronounce it a pitcher of sour milk Thus the old couple lived in their palace a great great while and grew older and older and very old indeed At length however there came a summer morning when Philemon and Baucis failed to make their appearance as on other mornings with one hospitable smile overspreading both their pleasant faces to invite the guests of over night to breakfast The guests searched everywhere from top to bottom of the spacious palace and all to no purpose But after a great deal of perplexity they espied in front of the portal two venerable trees which nobody could remember to have seen there the day before Yet there they stood with their roots fastened deep into the soil and a huge breadth of foliage overshadowing the whole front of the edifice One was an oak and the other a linden tree Their boughs it was strange and beautiful to see were intertwined together and embraced one another so that each tree seemed to live in the other tree s bosom much more than in its own While the guests were marvelling how these trees that must have required at least a century to grow could have come to be so tall and venerable in a single night a breeze sprang up and set their intermingled boughs astir And then there was a deep broad murmur in the air as if the two mysterious trees were speaking I am old Philemon murmured the oak I am old Baucis murmured the linden tree But as the breeze grew stronger the trees both spoke at once Philemon Baucis Baucis Philemon as if one were both and both were one and talked together in the depths of their mutual heart It was plain enough to perceive that the good old couple had renewed their age and were now to spend a quiet and delightful hundred years or so Philemon as an oak and Baucis as a linden tree And oh what a hospitable shade did they fling around them Whenever a wayfarer paused beneath it he heard a pleasant whisper of the leaves above his head and wondered how the sound should so much resemble words like these Welcome welcome dear traveller welcome And some kind soul that knew what would have pleased old Baucis and old Philemon best built a circular seat around both their trunks where for a great while afterward the weary and the hungry and the thirsty used to repose themselves and quaff milk abundantly out of the miraculous pitcher And I wish for all our sakes that we had the pitcher here now CHAPTER VIII THE PARADISE OF CHILDREN Long long ago when this old world was in its tender infancy there was a child named Epimetheus who never had either father or mother and that he might not be lonely another child fatherless and motherless like himself was sent from a far country to live with him and be his playfellow and helpmate 
8163_116797_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Her name was Pandora 
none	none	The first thing that Pandora saw when she entered the cottage where Epimetheus dwelt was a great box And almost the first question which she put to him after crossing the threshold was this Epimetheus what have you in that box
8163_116797_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear little Pandora answered Epimetheus that is a secret and you must be kind enough not to ask any questions about it 
none	none	The box was left here to be kept safely and I do not myself know what it contains
8163_116797_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 But who gave it to you asked Pandora 
8163_116797_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 And where did it come from 
none	none	That is a secret too replied Epimetheus How provoking exclaimed Pandora pouting her lip I wish the great ugly box were out of the way Oh come don t think of it any more cried Epimetheus Let us run out of doors and have some nice play with the other children It is thousands of years since Epimetheus and Pandora were alive and the world nowadays is a very different sort of thing from what it was in their time 
8163_116797_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Then everybody was a child 
8163_116797_000016_000002	train-clean-360	There needed no fathers and mothers to take care of the children because there was no danger nor trouble of any kind and no clothes to be mended and there was always plenty to eat and drink 
none	none	Whenever a child wanted his dinner he found it growing on a tree and if he looked at the tree in the morning he could see the expanding blossom of that night s supper or at eventide he saw the tender bud of to morrow s breakfast It was a very pleasant life indeed No labour to be done no tasks to be studied nothing but sports and dances and sweet voices of children talking or carolling like birds or gushing out in merry laughter throughout the livelong day What was most wonderful of all the children never quarrelled among themselves neither had they any crying fits nor since time first began had a single one of these little mortals ever gone apart into a corner and sulked Oh what a good time was that to be alive in 
8163_116797_000017_000002	train-clean-360	The truth is those ugly little winged monsters called Troubles which are now almost as numerous as mosquitoes had never yet been seen on the earth 
none	none	It is probable that the very greatest disquietude which a child had ever experienced was Pandora s vexation at not being able to discover the secret of the mysterious box This was at first only the faint shadow of a Trouble but every day it grew more and more substantial until before a great while the cottage of Epimetheus and Pandora was less sunshiny than those of the other children Whence can the box have come Pandora continually kept saying to herself and to Epimetheus
8163_116797_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 And what in the world can be inside of it 
none	none	Always talking about this box said Epimetheus at last for he had grown extremely tired of the subject
8163_116797_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 I wish dear Pandora you would try to talk of something else 
none	none	Come let us go and gather some ripe figs and eat them under the trees for our supper And I know a vine that has the sweetest and juiciest grapes you ever tasted
8163_116797_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Always talking about grapes and figs cried Pandora pettishly 
none	none	Well then said Epimetheus who was a very good tempered child like a multitude of children in those days let us run out and have a merry time with our playmates I am tired of merry times and don t care if I never have any more answered our pettish little Pandora
8163_116797_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 And besides I never do have any This ugly box 
8163_116797_000023_000002	train-clean-360	I am so taken up with thinking about it all the time 
none	none	I insist upon your telling me what is inside of it As I have already said fifty times over I do not know replied Epimetheus getting a little vexed How then can I tell you what is inside You might open it said Pandora looking sideways at Epimetheus and then we could see for ourselves
8163_116797_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Pandora what are you thinking of exclaimed Epimetheus 
none	none	And his face expressed so much horror at the idea of looking into a box which had been confided to him on the condition of his never opening it that Pandora thought it best not to suggest it any more 
8163_116797_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Still however she could not help thinking and talking about the box 
none	none	At least said she you can tell me how it came here It was left at the door replied Epimetheus just before you came by a person who looked very smiling and intelligent and who could hardly forbear laughing as he put it down He was dressed in an odd kind of a cloak and had on a cap that seemed to be made partly of feathers so that it looked almost as if it had wings What sort of a staff had he asked Pandora
8163_116797_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh the most curious staff you ever saw cried Epimetheus 
8163_116797_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 It was like two serpents twisting around a stick and was carved so naturally that I at first thought the serpents were alive 
8163_116797_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 I know him said Pandora thoughtfully 
8163_116797_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 Nobody else has such a staff It was Quicksilver and he brought me hither as well as the box 
none	none	No doubt he intended it for me and most probably it contains pretty dresses for me to wear or toys for you and me to play with or something very nice for us both to eat Perhaps so answered Epimetheus turning away
8163_116797_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 But until Quicksilver comes back and tells us so we have neither of us any right to lift the lid of the box 
8163_116797_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 What a dull boy he is muttered Pandora as Epimetheus left the cottage 
none	none	I do wish he had a little more enterprise For the first time since her arrival Epimetheus had gone out without asking Pandora to accompany him He went to gather figs and grapes by himself or to seek whatever amusement he could find in other society than his little playfellow s He was tired to death of hearing about the box and heartily wished that Quicksilver or whatever was the messenger s name had left it at some other child s door where Pandora would never have set eyes on it So perseveringly as did she babble about this one thing The box the box and nothing but the box It seemed as if the box were bewitched and as if the cottage were not big enough to hold it without Pandora s continually stumbling over it and making Epimetheus stumble over it likewise and bruising all four of their shins Well it was really hard that poor Epimetheus should have a box in his ears from morning till night especially as the little people of the earth were so unaccustomed to vexations in those happy days that they knew not how to deal with them Thus a small vexation made as much disturbance then as a far bigger one would in our own times After Epimetheus was gone Pandora stood gazing at the box She had called it ugly above a hundred times but in spite of all that she had said against it it was positively a very handsome article of furniture and would have been quite an ornament to any room in which it should be placed It was made of a beautiful kind of wood with dark and rich veins spreading over its surface which was so highly polished that little Pandora could see her face in it As the child had no other looking glass it is odd that she did not value the box merely on this account The edges and corners of the box were carved with most wonderful skill Around the margin there were figures of graceful men and women and the prettiest children ever seen reclining or sporting amid a profusion of flowers and foliage and these various objects were so exquisitely represented and were wrought together in such harmony that flowers foliage and human beings seemed to combine into a wreath of mingled beauty But here and there peeping forth from behind the carved foliage Pandora once or twice fancied that she saw a face not so lovely or something or other that was disagreeable and which stole the beauty out of all the rest Nevertheless on looking more closely and touching the spot with her finger she could discover nothing of the kind Some face that was really beautiful had been made to look ugly by her catching a sideway glimpse at it The most beautiful face of all was done in what is called high relief in the centre of the lid There was nothing else save the dark smooth richness of the polished wood and this one face in the centre with a garland of flowers about its brow Pandora had looked at this face a great many times and imagined that the mouth could smile if it liked or be grave when it chose the same as any living mouth The features indeed all wore a very lively and rather mischievous expression which looked almost as if it needs must burst out of the carved lips and utter itself in words Had the mouth spoken it would probably have been something like this Do not be afraid Pandora What harm can there be in opening the box Never mind that poor simple Epimetheus You are wiser than he and have ten times as much spirit Open the box and see if you do not find something very pretty The box I had almost forgotten to say was fastened not by a lock nor by any other such contrivance but by a very intricate knot of gold cord There appeared to be no end to this knot and no beginning Never was a knot so cunningly twisted nor with so many ins and outs which roguishly defied the skilfullest fingers to disentangle them And yet by the very difficulty that there was in it Pandora was the more tempted to examine the knot and just see how it was made Two or three times already she had stooped over the box and taken the knot between her thumb and forefinger but without positively trying to undo it I really believe said she to herself that I begin to see how it was done Nay perhaps I could tie it up again after undoing it There would be no harm in that surely 
8163_116797_000043_000003	train-clean-360	Even Epimetheus would not blame me for that 
8163_116797_000043_000004	train-clean-360	I need not open the box and should not of course without the foolish boy s consent even if the knot were untied 
none	none	It might have been better for Pandora if she had had a little work to do or anything to employ her mind upon so as not to be so constantly thinking of this one subject But children led so easy a life before any Troubles came into the world that they had really a great deal too much leisure They could not be forever playing at hide and seek among the flower shrubs or at blind man s buff with garlands over their eyes or at whatever other games had been found out while Mother Earth was in her babyhood 
8163_116797_000044_000003	train-clean-360	When life is all sport toil is the real play 
none	none	There was absolutely nothing to do A little sweeping and dusting about the cottage I suppose and the gathering of fresh flowers which were only too abundant everywhere and arranging them in vases and poor little Pandora s day s work was over 
8163_116797_000044_000006	train-clean-360	And then for the rest of the day there was the box 
none	none	After all I am not quite sure that the box was not a blessing to her in its way 
8163_116797_000045_000001	train-clean-360	It supplied her with such a variety of ideas to think of and to talk about whenever she had anybody to listen 
none	none	When she was in good humour she could admire the bright polish of its sides and the rich border of beautiful faces and foliage that ran all around it 
8163_116797_000045_000003	train-clean-360	Or if she chanced to be ill tempered she could give it a push or kick it with her naughty little foot 
8163_116797_000045_000004	train-clean-360	And many a kick did the box but it was a mischievous box as we shall see and deserved all it got many a kick did it receive 
none	none	But certain it is if it had not been for the box our active minded little Pandora would not have known half so well how to spend her time as she now did For it was really an endless employment to guess what was inside What could it be indeed Just imagine my little hearers how busy your wits would be if there were a great box in the house which as you might have reason to suppose contained something new and pretty for your Christmas or New Year s gifts 
8163_116797_000046_000003	train-clean-360	Do you think that you should be less curious than Pandora 
none	none	If you were left alone with the box might you not feel a little tempted to lift the lid 
8163_116797_000046_000005	train-clean-360	But you would not do it 
8163_116797_000046_000006	train-clean-360	Oh fie No no Only if you thought there were toys in it it would be so very hard to let slip an opportunity of taking just one peep 
none	none	I know not whether Pandora expected any toys for none had yet begun to be made probably in those days when the world itself was one great plaything for the children that dwelt upon it But Pandora was convinced that there was something very beautiful and valuable in the box and therefore she felt just as anxious to take a peep as any of these little girls here around me would have felt And possibly a little more so but of that I am not quite so certain On this particular day however which we have so long been talking about her curiosity grew so much greater than it usually was that at last she approached the box She was more than half determined to open it if she could 
8163_116797_000047_000002	train-clean-360	Ah naughty Pandora 
none	none	First however she tried to lift it It was heavy quite too heavy for the slender strength of a child like Pandora She raised one end of the box a few inches from the floor and let it fall again with a pretty loud thump A moment afterward she almost fancied that she heard something stir inside of the box She applied her ear as closely as possible and listened Positively there did seem to be a kind of stifled murmur within 
8163_116797_000048_000006	train-clean-360	Or was it merely the singing in Pandora s ears Or could it be the beating of her heart 
8163_116797_000048_000007	train-clean-360	The child could not quite satisfy herself whether she had heard anything or no But at all events her curiosity was stronger than ever 
8163_116797_000049_000000	train-clean-360	As she drew back her head her eyes fell upon the knot of gold cord 
none	none	It must have been a very ingenious person who tied this knot said Pandora to herself But I think I could untie it nevertheless 
8163_116797_000050_000002	train-clean-360	I am resolved at least to find the two ends of the cord 
none	none	So she took the golden knot in her fingers and pried into its intricacies as sharply as she could Almost without intending it or quite knowing what she was about she was soon busily engaged in attempting to undo it Meanwhile the bright sunshine came through the open window as did likewise the merry voices of the children playing at a distance and perhaps the voice of Epimetheus among them 
8163_116797_000051_000003	train-clean-360	Pandora stopped to listen 
8163_116797_000051_000004	train-clean-360	What a beautiful day it was 
none	none	Would it not be wiser if she were to let the troublesome knot alone and think no more about the box but run and join her little playfellow and be happy All this time however her fingers were half unconsciously busy with the knot and happening to glance at the flower wreathed face on the lid of the enchanted box she seemed to perceive it slyly grinning at her
8163_116797_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 That face looks very mischievous thought Pandora 
none	none	I wonder whether it smiles because I am doing wrong 
8163_116797_000053_000002	train-clean-360	I have the greatest mind in the world to run away 
8163_116797_000054_000000	train-clean-360	But just then by the merest accident she gave the knot a kind of twist which produced a wonderful result 
8163_116797_000054_000001	train-clean-360	The gold cord untwined itself as if by magic and left the box without a fastening 
none	none	This is the strangest thing I ever knew said Pandora
8163_116797_000055_000001	train-clean-360	 What will Epimetheus say 
none	none	And how can I possibly tie it up again She made one or two attempts to restore the knot but soon found it quite beyond her skill It had disentangled itself so suddenly that she could not in the least remember how the strings had been doubled into one another and when she tried to recollect the shape and appearance of the knot it seemed to have gone entirely out of her mind Nothing was to be done therefore but to let the box remain as it was until Epimetheus should come in But said Pandora when he finds the knot untied he will know that I have done it 
8163_116797_000057_000001	train-clean-360	How shall I make him believe that I have not looked into the box 
none	none	And then the thought came into her naughty little heart that since she would be suspected of having looked into the box she might just as well do so at once Oh very naughty and very foolish Pandora You should have thought only of doing what was right and of leaving undone what was wrong and not of what your playfellow Epimetheus would have said or believed 
8163_116797_000058_000003	train-clean-360	And so perhaps she might if the enchanted face on the lid of the box had not looked so bewitchingly persuasive at her and if she had not seemed to hear more distinctly than before the murmur of small voices within 
none	none	She could not tell whether it was fancy or no but there was quite a little tumult of whispers in her ear or else it was her curiosity that whispered
8163_116797_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Let us out dear Pandora pray let us out 
none	none	We will be such nice pretty playfellows for you 
8163_116797_000059_000002	train-clean-360	Only let us out 
none	none	What can it be thought Pandora Is there something alive in the box Well yes I am resolved to take just one peep Only one peep and then the lid shall be shut down as safely as ever There cannot possibly be any harm in just one little peep But it is now time for us to see what Epimetheus was doing This was the first time since his little playmate had come to dwell with him that he had attempted to enjoy any pleasure in which she did not partake But nothing went right nor was he nearly so happy as on other days 
8163_116797_000062_000002	train-clean-360	He could not find a sweet grape or a ripe fig if Epimetheus had a fault it was a little too much fondness for figs or if ripe at all they were overripe and so sweet as to be cloying 
none	none	There was no mirth in his heart such as usually made his voice gush out of its own accord and swell the merriment of his companions In short he grew so uneasy and discontented that the other children could not imagine what was the matter with Epimetheus 
8163_116797_000062_000005	train-clean-360	Neither did he himself know what ailed him any better than they did 
none	none	For you must recollect that at the time we are speaking of it was everybody s nature and constant habit to be happy The world had not yet learned to be otherwise Not a single soul or body since these children were first sent to enjoy themselves on the beautiful earth had ever been sick or out of sorts At length discovering that somehow or other he put a stop to all the play Epimetheus judged it best to go back to Pandora who was in a humour better suited to his own But with a hope of giving her pleasure he gathered some flowers and made them into a wreath which he meant to put upon her head The flowers were very lovely roses and lilies and orange blossoms and a great many more which left a trail of fragrance behind as Epimetheus carried them along and the wreath was put together with as much skill as could reasonably be expected of a boy 
8163_116797_000063_000003	train-clean-360	The fingers of little girls it has always appeared to me are the fittest to twine flower wreaths but boys could do it in those days rather better than they can now 
none	none	And here I must mention that a great black cloud had been gathering in the sky for some time past although it had not yet overspread the sun But just as Epimetheus reached the cottage door this cloud began to intercept the sunshine and thus to make a sudden and sad obscurity 
8163_116797_000065_000000	train-clean-360	He entered softly for he meant if possible to steal behind Pandora and fling the wreath of flowers over her head before she should be aware of his approach 
none	none	But as it happened there was no need of his treading so very lightly He might have trod as heavily as he pleased as heavily as a grown man as heavily I was going to say as an elephant without much probability of Pandora s hearing his footsteps 
8163_116797_000065_000003	train-clean-360	She was too intent upon her purpose 
none	none	At the moment of his entering the cottage the naughty child had put her hand to the lid and was on the point of opening the mysterious box Epimetheus beheld her If he had cried out Pandora would probably have withdrawn her hand and the fatal mystery of the box might never have been known But Epimetheus himself although he said very little about it had his own share of curiosity to know what was inside Perceiving that Pandora was resolved to find out the secret he determined that his playfellow should not be the only wise person in the cottage And if there were anything pretty or valuable in the box he meant to take half of it to himself Thus after all his sage speeches to Pandora about restraining her curiosity Epimetheus turned out to be quite as foolish and nearly as much in fault as she So whenever we blame Pandora for what happened we must not forget to shake our heads at Epimetheus likewise As Pandora raised the lid the cottage grew very dark and dismal for the black cloud had now swept quite over the sun and seemed to have buried it alive There had for a little while past been a low growling and muttering which all at once broke into a heavy peal of thunder But Pandora heeding nothing of all this lifted the lid nearly upright and looked inside It seemed as if a sudden swarm of winged creatures brushed past her taking flight out of the box while at the same instant she heard the voice of Epimetheus with a lamentable tone as if he were in pain Oh I am stung cried he I am stung 
8163_116797_000068_000002	train-clean-360	Naughty Pandora why have you opened this wicked box 
none	none	Pandora let fall the lid and starting up looked about her to see what had befallen Epimetheus The thunder cloud had so darkened the room that she could not very clearly discern what was in it But she heard a disagreeable buzzing as if a great many huge flies or gigantic mosquitoes or those insects which we call dor bugs and pinching dogs were darting about And as her eyes grew more accustomed to the imperfect light she saw a crowd of ugly little shapes with bats wings looking abominably spiteful and armed with terribly long stings in their tails It was one of these that had stung Epimetheus Nor was it a great while before Pandora herself began to scream in no less pain and affright than her playfellow and making a vast deal more hubbub about it An odious little monster had settled on her forehead and would have stung her I know not how deeply if Epimetheus had not run and brushed it away Now if you wish to know what these ugly things might be which had made their escape out of the box I must tell you that they were the whole family of earthly Troubles There were evil Passions there were a great many species of Cares there were more than a hundred and fifty Sorrows there were Diseases in a vast number of miserable and painful shapes there were more kinds of Naughtiness than it would be of any use to talk about In short everything that has since afflicted the souls and bodies of mankind had been shut up in the mysterious box and given to Epimetheus and Pandora to be kept safely in order that the happy children of the world might never be molested by them Had they been faithful to their trust all would have gone well No grown person would ever have been sad nor any child have had cause to shed a single tear from that hour until this moment But and you may see by this how a wrong act of any one mortal is a calamity to the whole world by Pandora s lifting the lid of that miserable box and by the fault of Epimetheus too in not preventing her these Troubles have obtained a foothold among us and do not seem very likely to be driven away in a hurry For it was impossible as you will easily guess that the two children should keep the ugly swarms in their own little cottage On the contrary the first thing that they did was to fling open the doors and windows in hopes of getting rid of them and sure enough away flew the winged Troubles all abroad and so pestered and tormented the small people everywhere about that none of them so much as smiled for many days afterward And what was very singular all the flowers and dewy blossoms on earth not one of which had hitherto faded now began to droop and shed their leaves after a day or two The children moreover who before seemed immortal in their childhood now grew older day by day and came soon to be youths and maidens and men and women by and by and aged people before they dreamed of such a thing Meanwhile the naughty Pandora and hardly less naughty Epimetheus remained in their cottage Both of them had been grievously stung and were in a good deal of pain which seemed the more intolerable to them because it was the very first pain that had ever been felt since the world began Of course they were entirely unaccustomed to it and could have no idea what it meant Besides all this they were in exceedingly bad humour both with themselves and with one another In order to indulge it to the utmost Epimetheus sat down sullenly in a corner with his back toward Pandora while Pandora flung herself upon the floor and rested her head on the fatal and abominable box 
8163_116797_000072_000005	train-clean-360	She was crying bitterly and sobbing as if her heart would break 
8163_116797_000073_000000	train-clean-360	Suddenly there was a gentle little tap on the inside of the lid 
8163_116797_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 What can that be cried Pandora lifting her head 
8163_116797_000075_000000	train-clean-360	But either Epimetheus had not heard the tap or was too much out of humour to notice it 
8163_116797_000075_000001	train-clean-360	At any rate he made no answer 
none	none	You are very unkind said Pandora sobbing anew not to speak to me 
8163_116797_000077_000000	train-clean-360	Again the tap 
none	none	It sounded like the tiny knuckles of a fairy s hand knocking lightly and playfully on the inside of the box Who are you asked Pandora with a little of her former curiosity Who are you inside of this naughty box 
8163_116797_000079_000000	train-clean-360	A sweet little voice spoke from within 
none	none	Only lift the lid and you shall see
8163_116797_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 No no answered Pandora again beginning to sob I have had enough of lifting the lid 
none	none	You are inside of the box naughty creature and there you shall stay There are plenty of your ugly brothers and sisters already flying about the world 
8163_116797_000081_000003	train-clean-360	You need never think that I shall be so foolish as to let you out 
none	none	She looked toward Epimetheus as she spoke perhaps expecting that he would commend her for her wisdom But the sullen boy only muttered that she was wise a little too late Ah said the sweet little voice again you had much better let me out I am not like those naughty creatures that have stings in their tails They are no brothers and sisters of mine as you would see at once if you were only to get a glimpse of me 
8163_116797_000083_000003	train-clean-360	Come come my pretty Pandora 
none	none	I am sure you will let me out And indeed there was a kind of cheerful witchery in the tone that made it almost impossible to refuse anything which this little voice asked Pandora s heart had insensibly grown lighter at every word that came from within the box Epimetheus too though still in the corner had turned half round and seemed to be in rather better spirits than before My dear Epimetheus cried Pandora have you heard this little voice Yes to be sure I have answered he but in no very good humour as yet
8163_116797_000086_000001	train-clean-360	 And what of it 
none	none	Shall I lift the lid again asked Pandora Just as you please said Epimetheus You have done so much mischief already that perhaps you may as well do a little more One other Trouble in such a swarm as you have set adrift about the world can make no very great difference You might speak a little more kindly murmured Pandora wiping her eyes Ah naughty boy cried the little voice within the box in an arch and laughing tone He knows he is longing to see me Come my dear Pandora lift up the lid I am in a great hurry to comfort you Only let me have some fresh air and you shall soon see that matters are not quite so dismal as you think them Epimetheus exclaimed Pandora come what may I am resolved to open the box
8163_116797_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 And as the lid seems very heavy cried Epimetheus running across the room I will help you 
none	none	So with one consent the two children again lifted the lid Out flew a sunny and smiling little personage and Hovered about the room throwing a light wherever she went Have you never made the sunshine dance into dark corners by reflecting it from a bit of looking glass Well so looked the winged cheerfulness of this fairy like stranger amid the gloom of the cottage She flew to Epimetheus and laid the least touch of her finger on the inflamed spot where the Trouble had stung him and immediately the anguish of it was gone Then she kissed Pandora on the forehead and her hurt was cured likewise After performing these good offices the bright stranger fluttered sportively over the children s heads and looked so sweetly at them that they both began to think it not so very much amiss to have opened the box since otherwise their cheery guest must have been kept a prisoner among those naughty imps with stings in their tails
8163_116797_000095_000000	train-clean-360	 Pray who are you beautiful creature inquired Pandora 
none	none	I am to be called Hope answered the sunshiny figure And because I am such a cheery little body I was packed into the box to make amends to the human race for that swarm of ugly Troubles which was destined to be let loose among them Never fear I we shall do pretty well in spite of them all Your wings are coloured like the rainbow exclaimed Pandora How very beautiful Yes they are like the rainbow said Hope because glad as my nature is I am partly made of tears as well as smiles And will you stay with us asked Epimetheus forever and ever As long as you need me said Hope with her pleasant smile and that will be as long as you live in the world I promise never to desert you There may come times and seasons now and then when you will think that I have utterly vanished But again and again and again when perhaps you least dream of it you shall see the glimmer of my wings on the ceiling of your cottage 
8163_116797_000100_000002	train-clean-360	Yes my dear children and I know something very good and beautiful that is to be given you hereafter 
8163_116797_000101_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh tell us they exclaimed tell us what it is 
none	none	Do not ask me replied Hope putting her finger on her rosy mouth But do not despair even if it should never happen while you live on this earth 
8163_116797_000102_000001	train-clean-360	Trust in my promise for it is true 
none	none	We do trust you cried Epimetheus and Pandora both in one breath And so they did and not only they but so has everybody trusted Hope that has since been alive And to tell you the truth I cannot help being glad though to be sure it was an uncommonly naughty thing for her to do but I cannot help being glad that our foolish Pandora peeped into the box No doubt no doubt the Troubles are still flying about the world and have increased in multitude rather than lessened and are a very ugly set of imps and carry most venomous stings in their tails I have felt them already and expect to feel them more as I grow older 
8163_116797_000104_000004	train-clean-360	But then that lovely and lightsome little figure of Hope 
8163_116797_000104_000005	train-clean-360	What in the world could we do without her 
none	none	Hope spiritualises the earth Hope makes it always new and even in the earth s best and brightest aspect Hope shows it to be only the shadow of an infinite bliss hereafter CHAPTER IX THE CYCLOPS When the great city of Troy was taken all the chiefs who had fought against it set sail for their homes But there was wrath in heaven against them for indeed they had borne themselves haughtily and cruelly in the day of their victory Therefore they did not all find a safe and happy return For one was shipwrecked and another was shamefully slain by his false wife in his palace and others found all things at home troubled and changed and were driven to seek new dwellings elsewhere And some whose wives and friends and people had been still true to them through those ten long years of absence were driven far and wide about the world before they saw their native land again And of all the wise Ulysses was he who wandered farthest and suffered most He was well nigh the last to sail for he had tarried many days to do pleasure to Agamemnon lord of all the Greeks Twelve ships he had with him twelve he had brought to Troy and in each there were some fifty men being scarce half of those that had sailed in them in the old days so many valiant heroes slept the last sleep by Simois and Scamander and in the plain and on the seashore slain in battle or by the shafts of Apollo First they sailed northwest to the Thracian coast where the Ciconians dwelt who had helped the men of Troy Their city they took and in it much plunder slaves and oxen and jars of fragrant wine and might have escaped unhurt but that they stayed to hold revel on the shore For the Ciconians gathered their neighbours being men of the same blood and did battle with the invaders and drove them to their ship And when Ulysses numbered his men he found that he had lost six out of each ship Scarce had he set out again when the wind began to blow fiercely so seeing a smooth sandy beach they drave the ships ashore and dragged them out of reach of the waves and waited till the storm should abate And the third morning being fair they sailed again and journeyed prosperously till they came to the very end of the great Peloponnesian land where Cape Malea looks out upon the southern sea But contrary currents baffled them so that they could not round it and the north wind blew so strongly that they must fain drive before it And on the tenth day they came to the land where the lotus grows a wondrous fruit of which whosoever eats cares not to see country or wife or children again Now the Lotus eaters for so they call the people of the land were a kindly folk and gave of the fruit to some of the sailors not meaning them any harm but thinking it to be the best that they had to give These when they had eaten said that they would not sail any more over the sea which when the wise Ulysses heard he bade their comrades bind them and carry them sadly complaining to the ships Then the wind having abated they took to their oars and rowed for many days till they came to the country where the Cyclopes dwell Now a mile or so from the shore there was an island very fair and fertile but no man dwells there or tills the soil and in the island a harbour where a ship may be safe from all winds and at the head of the harbour a stream falling from the rock and whispering alders all about it Into this the ships passed safely and were hauled up on the beach and the crews slept by them waiting for the morning And the next day they hunted the wild goats of which there was great store on the island and feasted right merrily on what they caught with draughts of red wine which they had carried off from the town of the Ciconians But on the morrow Ulysses for he was ever fond of adventure and would know of every land to which he came what manner of men they were that dwelt there took one of his twelve ships and bade row to the land There was a great hill sloping to the shore and there rose up here and there a smoke from the caves where the Cyclopes dwelt apart holding no converse with each other for they were a rude and savage folk but ruled each his own household not caring for others Now very close to the shore was one of these caves very huge and deep with laurels round about the mouth and in front a fold with walls built of rough stone and shaded by tall oaks and pines So Ulysses chose out of the crew the twelve bravest and bade the rest guard the ship and went to see what manner of dwelling this was and who abode there He had his sword by his side and on his shoulder a mighty skin of wine sweet smelling and strong with which he might win the heart of some fierce savage should he chance to meet with such as indeed his prudent heart forecasted that he might So they entered the cave and judged that it was the dwelling of some rich and skilful shepherd For within there were pens for the young of the sheep and of the goats divided all according to their age and there were baskets full of cheeses and full milkpails ranged along the wall But the Cyclops himself was away in the pastures Then the companions of Ulysses besought him that he would depart taking with him if he would a store of cheeses and sundry of the lambs and of the kids But he would not for he wished to see after his wont what manner of host this strange shepherd might be And truly he saw it to his cost It was evening when the Cyclops came home a mighty giant twenty feet in height or more On his shoulder he bore a vast bundle of pine logs for his fire and threw them down outside the cave with a great crash and drove the flocks within and closed the entrance with a huge rock which twenty wagons and more could not bear Then he milked the ewes and all the she goats and half of the milk he curdled for cheese and half he set ready for himself when he should sup Next he kindled a fire with the pine logs and the flame lighted up all the cave showing him Ulysses and his comrades Who are ye cried Polyphemus for that was the giant s name Are ye traders or haply pirates For in those days it was not counted shame to be called a pirate Ulysses shuddered at the dreadful voice and shape but bore him bravely and answered We are no pirates mighty sir but Greeks sailing back from Troy and subjects of the great King Agamemnon whose fame is spread from one end of heaven to the other And we are come to beg hospitality of thee in the name of Zeus who rewards or punishes hosts and guests according as they be faithful the one to the other or no Nay said the giant it is but idle talk to tell me of Zeus and the other gods We Cyclopes take no account of gods holding ourselves to be much better and stronger than they But come tell me where have you left your ship But Ulysses saw his thought when he asked about the ship how he was minded to break it and take from them all hope of flight Therefore he answered him craftily Ship have we none for that which was ours King Poseidon brake driving it on a jutting rock on this coast and we whom thou seest are all that are escaped from the waves Polyphemus answered nothing but without more ado caught up two of the men as a man might catch up the whelps of a dog and dashed them on the ground and tore them limb from limb and devoured them with huge draughts of milk between leaving not a morsel not even the very bones But the others when they saw the dreadful deed could only weep and pray to Zeus for help And when the giant had ended his foul meal he lay down among his sheep and slept Then Ulysses questioned much in his heart whether he should slay the monster as he slept for he doubted not that his good sword would pierce to the giant s heart mighty as he was But being very wise he remembered that should he slay him he and his comrades would yet perish miserably For who should move away the great rock that lay against the door of the cave So they waited till the morning And the monster woke and milked his flocks and afterward seizing two men devoured them for his meal Then he went to the pastures but put the great rock on the mouth of the cave just as a man puts down the lid upon his quiver All that day the wise Ulysses was thinking what he might best do to save himself and his companions and the end of his thinking was this There was a mighty pole in the cave green wood of an olive tree big as a ship s mast which Polyphemus purposed to use when the smoke should have dried it as a walking staff Of this he cut off a fathom s length and his comrades sharpened it and hardened it in the fire and then hid it away At evening the giant came back and drove his sheep into the cave nor left the rams outside as he had been wont to do before but shut them in And having duly done his shepherd s work he made his cruel feast as before Then Ulysses came forward with the wine skin in his hand and said Drink Cyclops now that thou hast feasted Drink and see what precious things we had in our ship But no one hereafter will come to thee with such like if thou dealest with strangers as cruelly as thou hast dealt with us Then the Cyclops drank and was mightily pleased and said Give me again to drink and tell me thy name stranger and I will give thee a gift such as a host should give In good truth this is a rare liquor We too have vines but they bear not wine like this which indeed must be such as the gods drink in heaven Then Ulysses gave him the cup again and he drank Thrice he gave it to him and thrice he drank not knowing what it was and how it would work within his brain Then Ulysses spake to him Thou didst ask my name Cyclops Lo my name is No Man And now that thou knowest my name thou shouldst give me thy gift And he said My gift shall be that I will eat thee last of all thy company And as he spake he fell back in a drunken sleep Then Ulysses bade his comrades be of good courage for the time was come when they should be delivered And they thrust the stake of olive wood into the fire till it was ready green as it was to burst into flame and they thrust it into the monster s eye for he had but one eye and that in the midst of his forehead with the eyebrow below it And Ulysses leant with all his force upon the stake and thrust it in with might and main And the burning wood hissed in the eye just as the red hot iron hisses in the water when a man seeks to temper steel for a sword Then the giant leapt up and tore away the stake and cried aloud so that all the Cyclopes who dwelt on the mountain side heard him and came about his cave asking him What aileth thee Polyphemus that thou makest this uproar in the peaceful night driving away sleep Is any one robbing thee of thy sheep or seeking to slay thee by craft or force And the giant answered No Man slays me by craft Nay but they said if no man does thee wrong we cannot help thee The sickness which great Zeus may send who can avoid Pray to our father Poseidon for help Then they departed and Ulysses was glad at heart for the good success of his device when he said that he was No Man But the Cyclops rolled away the great stone from the door of the cave and sat in the midst stretching out his hands to feel whether perchance the men within the cave would seek to go out among the sheep Long did Ulysses think how he and his comrades should best escape At last he lighted upon a good device and much he thanked Zeus for that this once the giant had driven the rams with the other sheep into the cave For these being great and strong he fastened his comrades under the bellies of the beasts tying them with osier twigs of which the giant made his bed One ram he took and fastened a man beneath it and two others he set one on either side So he did with the six for but six were left out of the twelve who had ventured with him from the ship And there was one mighty ram far larger than all the others and to this Ulysses clung grasping the fleece tight with both his hands So they waited for the morning And when the morning came the rams rushed forth to the pasture but the giant sat in the door and felt the back of each as it went by nor thought to try what might be underneath Last of all went the great ram And the Cyclops knew him as he passed and said How is this thou who art the leader of the flock Thou art not wont thus to lag behind Thou hast always been the first to run to the pastures and streams in the morning and the first to come back to the fold when evening fell and now thou art last of all Perhaps thou art troubled about thy master s eye which some wretch No Man they call him has destroyed having first mastered me with wine He has not escaped I ween I would that thou couldst speak and tell me where he is lurking Of a truth I would dash out his brains upon the ground and avenge me of this No Man So speaking he let him pass out of the cave But when they were out of reach of the giant Ulysses loosed his hold of the ram and then unbound his comrades And they hastened to their ship not forgetting to drive before them a good store of the Cyclops fat sheep Right glad were those that had abode by the ship to see them Nor did they lament for those that had died though they were fain to do so for Ulysses forbade fearing lest the noise of their weeping should betray them to the giant where they were Then they all climbed into the ship and sitting well in order on the benches smote the sea with their oars laying to right lustily that they might the sooner get away from the accursed land And when they had rowed a hundred yards or so so that a man s voice could yet be heard by one who stood upon the shore Ulysses stood up in the ship and shouted He was no coward O Cyclops whose comrades thou didst so foully slay in thy den Justly art thou punished monster that devourest thy guests in thy dwelling May the gods make thee suffer yet worse things than these Then the Cylops in his wrath broke off the top of a great hill a mighty rock and hurled it where he had heard the voice Right in front of the ship s bow it fell and a great wave rose as it sank and washed the ship back to the shore But Ulysses seized a long pole with both hands and pushed the ship from the land and bade his comrades ply their oars nodding with his head for he was too wise to speak lest the Cyclops should know where they were Then they rowed with all their might and main And when they had gotten twice as far as before Ulysses made as if he would speak again but his comrades sought to hinder him saying Nay my lord anger not the giant any more Surely we thought before we were lost when he threw the great rock and washed our ship back to the shore And if he hear thee now he may crush our ship and us for the man throws a mighty bolt and throws it far But Ulysses would not be persuaded but stood up and said Hear Cyclops If any man ask who blinded thee say that it was the warrior Ulysses son of Laertes dwelling in Ithaca And the Cyclops answered with a groan Of a truth the old oracles are fulfilled for long ago there came to this land one Telemus a prophet and dwelt among us even to old age This man foretold me that one Ulysses would rob me of my sight But I looked for a great man and a strong who should subdue me by force and now a weakling has done the deed having cheated me with wine But come thou hither Ulysses and I will be a host indeed to thee Or at least may Poseidon give thee such a voyage to thy home as I would wish thee to have For know that Poseidon is my sire May be that he may heal me of my grievous wound And Ulysses said Would to God I could send thee down to the abode of the dead where thou wouldst be past all healing even from Poseidon s self Then Cyclops lifted up his hands to Poseidon and prayed Hear me Poseidon if I am indeed thy son and thou my father May this Ulysses never reach his home or if the Fates have ordered that he should reach it may he come alone all his comrades lost and come to find sore trouble in his house And as he ended he hurled another mighty rock which almost lighted on the rudder s end yet missed it as if by a hair s breadth So Ulysses and his comrades escaped and came to the island of the wild goats where they found their comrades who indeed had waited long for them in sore fear lest they had perished Then Ulysses divided among his company all the sheep which they had taken from the Cyclops And all with one consent gave him for his share the great ram which had carried him out of the cave and he sacrificed it to Zeus And all that day they feasted right merrily on the flesh of sheep and on sweet wine and when the night was come they lay down upon the shore and slept CHAPTER X THE ARGONAUTS I How the Centaur Trained the Heroes on Pelion I have told you of a hero who fought with wild beasts and with wild men but now I have a tale of heroes who sailed away into a distant land to win themselves renown forever in the adventure of the Golden Fleece Whither they sailed my children I cannot clearly tell It all happened long ago so long that it has all grown dim like a dream which you dreamed last year And why they went I cannot tell some say that it was to win gold It may be so but the noblest deeds which have been done on earth have not been done for gold It was not for the sake of gold that the Lord came down and died and the Apostles went out to preach the good news in all lands The Spartans looked for no reward in money when they fought and died at Thermopylae and Socrates the wise asked no pay from his countrymen but lived poor and barefoot all his days only caring to make men good And there are heroes in our days also who do noble deeds but not for gold Our discoverers did not go to make themselves rich when they sailed out one after another into the dreary frozen seas nor did the ladies who went out last year to drudge in the hospitals of the East making themselves poor that they might be rich in noble works And young men too whom you know children and some of them of your own kin did they say to themselves How much money shall I earn when they went out to the war leaving wealth and comfort and a pleasant home and all that money can give to face hunger and thirst and wounds and death that they might fight for their country and their Queen No children there is a better thing on earth than wealth a better thing than life itself and that is to have done something before you die for which good men may honour you and God your Father smile upon your work Therefore we will believe why should we not of these same Argonauts of old that they too were noble men who planned and did a noble deed and that therefore their fame has lived and been told in story and in song mixed up no doubt with dreams and fables yet true and right at heart So we will honour these old Argonauts and listen to their story as it stands and we will try to be like them each of us in our place for each of us has a Golden Fleece to seek and a wild sea to sail over ere we reach it and dragons to fight ere it be ours And what was that first Golden Fleece I do not know nor care The old Hellenes said that it hung in Colchis which we call the Circassian coast nailed to a beech tree in the war god s wood and that it was the fleece of the wondrous ram who bore Phrixus and Helle across the Euxine Sea For Phrixus and Helle were the children of the cloud nymph and of Athamas the Minuan king And when a famine came upon the land their cruel stepmother Ino wished to kill them that her own children might reign and said that they must be sacrificed on an altar to turn away the anger of the gods So the poor children were brought to the altar and the priest stood ready with his knife when out of the clouds came the Golden Ram and took them on his back and vanished Then madness came upon that foolish king Athamas and ruin upon Ino and her children For Athamas killed one of them in his fury and Ino fled from him with the other in her arms and leaped from a cliff into the sea and was changed into a dolphin such as you have seen which wanders over the waves forever sighing with its little one clasped to its breast But the people drove out King Athamas because he had killed his child and he roamed about in his misery till he came to the Oracle in Delphi And the Oracle told him that he must wander for his sin till the wild beasts should feast him as their guest So he went on in hunger and sorrow for many a weary day till he saw a pack of wolves The wolves were tearing a sheep but when they saw Athamas they fled and left the sheep for him and he ate of it and then he knew that the oracle was fulfilled at last So he wandered no more but settled and built a town and became a king again But the ram carried the two children far away over land and sea till he came to the Thracian Chersonese and there Helle fell into the sea So those narrow straits are called Hellespont after her and they bear that name until this day Then the ram flew on with Phrixus to the northeast across the sea which we call the Black Sea now but the Hellenes called it Euxine And at last they say he stopped at Colchis on the steep Circassian coast and there Phrixus married Chalchiope the daughter of Aietes the king and offered the ram in sacrifice and Aietes nailed the ram s fleece to a beech in the grove of Ares the war god And after awhile Phrixus died and was buried but his spirit had no rest for he was buried far from his native land and the pleasant hills of Hellas So he came in dreams to the heroes of the Minuai and called sadly by their beds Come and set my spirit free that I may go home to my fathers and to my kinsfolk and the pleasant Minuan land And they asked How shall we set your spirit free You must sail over the sea to Colchis and bring home the golden fleece and then my spirit will come back with it and I shall sleep with my fathers and have rest He came thus and called to them often but when they woke they looked at each other and said Who dare sail to Colchis or bring home the golden fleece And in all the country none was brave enough to try it for the man and the time were not come Phrixus had a cousin called AEson who was king in Iolcos by the sea There he ruled over the rich Minuan heroes as Athamas his uncle ruled in Boeotia and like Athamas he was an unhappy man For he had a stepbrother named Pelias of whom some said that he was a nymph s son and there were dark and sad tales about his birth When he was a babe he was cast out on the mountains and a wild mare came by and kicked him But a shepherd passing found the baby with its face all blackened by the blow and took him home and called him Pelias because his face was bruised and black And he grew up fierce and lawless and did many a fearful deed and at last he drove out AEson his stepbrother and then his own brother Neleus and took the kingdom to himself and ruled over the rich Minuan heroes in Iolcos by the sea And AEson when he was driven out went sadly away out of the town leading his little son by the hand and he said to himself I must hide the child in the mountains or Pelias will surely kill him because he is the heir So he went up from the sea across the valley through the vineyards and the olive groves and across the torrent of Anauros toward Pelion the ancient mountain whose brows are white with snow He went up and up into the mountain over marsh and crag and down till the boy was tired and footsore and AEson had to bear him in his arms till he came to the mouth of a lonely cave at the foot of a mighty cliff Above the cliff the snow wreaths hung dripping and cracking in the sun But at its foot around the cave s mouth grew all fair flowers and herbs as if in a garden ranged in order each sort by itself There they grew gayly in the sunshine and the spray of the torrent from above while from the cave came the sound of music and a man s voice singing to the harp Then AEson put down the lad and whispered Fear not but go in and whomsoever you shall find lay your hands upon his knees and say In the name of Zeus the father of gods and men I am your guest from this day forth Then the lad went in without trembling for he too was a hero s son but when he was within he stopped in wonder to listen to that magic song And there he saw the singer lying upon bear skins and fragrant boughs Cheiron the ancient centaur the wisest of all things beneath the sky Down to the waist he was a man but below he was a noble horse his white hair rolled down over his broad shoulders and his white beard over his broad brown chest and his eyes were wise and mild and his forehead like a mountain wall And in his hands he held a harp of gold and struck it with a golden key and as he struck he sang till his eyes glittered and filled all the cave with light And he sang of the birth of Time and of the heavens and the dancing stars and of the ocean and the ether and the fire and the shaping of the wondrous earth And he sang of the treasures of the hills and the hidden jewels of the mine and the veins of fire and metal and the virtues of all healing herbs and of the speech of birds and of prophecy and of hidden things to come Then he sang of health and strength and manhood and a valiant heart and of music and hunting and wrestling and all the games which heroes love and of travel and wars and sieges and a noble death in fight and then he sang of peace and plenty and of equal justice in the land and as he sang the boy listened wide eyed and forgot his errand in the song And at the last old Cheiron was silent and called the lad with a soft voice And the lad ran trembling to him and would have laid his hands upon his knees but Cheiron smiled and said Call hither your father AEson for I know you and all that has befallen and saw you both afar in the valley even before you left the town Then AEson came in sadly and Cheiron asked him Why came you not yourself to me AEson the AEolid And AEson said I thought Cheiron will pity the lad if he sees him come alone and I wished to try whether he was fearless and dare venture like a hero s son But now I entreat you by Father Zeus let the boy be your guest till better times and train him among the sons of the heroes that he may avenge his father s house Then Cheiron smiled and drew the lad to him and laid his hand upon his golden locks and said Are you afraid of my horse s hoofs fair boy or will you be my pupil from this day I would gladly have horse s hoofs like you if I could sing such songs as yours And Cheiron laughed and said Sit here by me till sundown when your playfellows will come home and you shall learn like them to be a king worthy to rule over gallant men Then he turned to AEson and said Go back in peace and bend before the storm like a prudent man This boy shall not cross the Anauros again till he has become a glory to you and to the house of AEolus And AEson wept over his son and went away but the boy did not weep so full was his fancy of that strange cave and the Centaur and his song and the playfellows whom he was to see Then Cheiron put the lyre into his hands and taught him how to play it till the sun sank low behind the cliff and a shout was heard outside And then in came the sons of the heroes AEneas and Heracles and Peleus and many another mighty name And great Cheiron leapt up joyfully and his hoofs made the cave resound as they shouted Come out Father Cheiron come out and see our game And one cried I have killed two deer and another I took a wildcat among the crags and Heracles dragged a wild goat after him by its horns for he was as huge as a mountain crag and Caeneus carried a bear cub under each arm and laughed when they scratched and bit for neither tooth nor steel could wound him And Cheiron praised them all each according to his deserts Only one walked apart and silent Asclepius the too wise child with his bosom full of herbs and flowers and round his wrist a spotted snake he came with downcast eyes to Cheiron and whispered how he had watched the snake cast his old skin and grow young again before his eyes and how he had gone down into a village in the vale and cured a dying man with a herb which he had seen a sick goat eat And Cheiron smiled and said To each Athene and Apollo give some gift and each is worthy in his place but to this child they have given an honour beyond all honours to cure while others kill Then the lads brought in wood and split it and lighted a blazing fire and others skinned the deer and quartered them and set them to roast before the fire and while the venison was cooking they bathed in the snow torrent and washed away the dust and sweat And then all ate till they could eat no more for they had tasted nothing since the dawn and drank of the clear spring water for wine is not fit for growing lads And when the remnants were put away they all lay down upon the skins and leaves about the fire and each took the lyre in turn and sang and played with all his heart And after a while they all went out to a plot of grass at the cave s mouth and there they boxed and ran and wrestled and laughed till the stones fell from the cliffs Then Cheiron took his lyre and all the lads joined hands and as he played they danced to his measure in and out and round and round There they danced hand in hand till the night fell over land and sea while the black glen shone with their broad white limbs and the gleam of their golden hair And the lad danced with them delighted and then slept a wholesome sleep upon fragrant leaves of bay and myrtle and marjoram and flowers of thyme and rose at the dawn and bathed in the torrent and became a schoolfellow to the heroes sons and forgot Iolcos and his father and all his former life But he grew strong and brave and cunning upon the pleasant downs of Pelion in the keen hungry mountain air And he learnt to wrestle and to box and to hunt and to play upon the harp and next he learnt to ride for old Cheiron used to mount him on his back and he learnt the virtues of all herbs and how to cure all wounds and Cheiron called him Jason the healer and that is his name until this day PART II How Jason Lost His Sandal in Anauros And ten years came and went and Jason was grown to be a mighty man Some of his fellows were gone and some were growing up by his side Asclepius was gone into Peloponnese to work his wondrous cures on men and some say he used to raise the dead to life And Heracles was gone to Thebes to fulfil those famous labours which have become a proverb among men And Peleus had married a sea nymph and his wedding is famous to this day And AEneas was gone home to Troy and many a noble tale you will read of him and of all the other gallant heroes the scholars of Cheiron the just And it happened on a day that Jason stood on the mountain and looked north and south and east and west and Cheiron stood by him and watched him for he knew that the time was come And Jason looked and saw the plains of Thessaly where the Lapithai breed their horses and the lake of Boibe and the stream which runs northward to Peneus and Tempe and he looked north and saw the mountain wall which guards the Magnesian shore Olympus the seat of the Immortals and Ossa and Pelion where he stood Then he looked east and saw the bright blue sea which stretched away forever toward the dawn Then he looked south and saw a pleasant land with white walled towns and farms nestling along the shore of a land locked bay while the smoke rose blue among the trees and he knew it for the bay of Pagasai and the rich lowlands of Haemonia and Iolcos by the sea Then he sighed and asked Is it true what the heroes tell me that I am heir of that fair land And what good would it be to you Jason if you were heir of that fair land I would take it and keep it A strong man has taken it and kept it long Are you stronger than Pelias the terrible I can try my strength with his said Jason But Cheiron sighed and said You have many a danger to go through before you rule in Iolcos by the sea many a danger and many a woe and strange troubles in strange lands such as man never saw before The happier I said Jason to see what man never saw before And Cheiron sighed again and said The eaglet must leave the nest when it is fledged Will you go to Iolcos by the sea Then promise me two things before you go Jason promised and Cheiron answered Speak harshly to no soul whom you may meet and stand by the word which you shall speak Jason wondered why Cheiron asked this of him but he knew that the Centaur was a prophet and saw things long before they came So he promised and leapt down the mountain to take his fortune like a man He went down through the arbutus thickets and across the downs of thyme till he came to the vineyard walls and the pomegranates and the olives in the glen and among the olives roared Anauros all foaming with a summer flood And on the bank of Anauros sat a woman all wrinkled gray and old her head shook palsied on her breast and her hands shook palsied on her knees and when she saw Jason she spoke whining Who will carry me across the flood Jason was bold and hasty and was just going to leap into the flood and yet he thought twice before he leapt so loud roared the torrent down all brown from the mountain rains and silver veined with melting snow while underneath he could hear the boulders rumbling like the tramp of horsemen or the roll of wheels as they ground along the narrow channel and shook the rocks on which he stood But the old woman whined all the more I am weak and old fair youth For Hera s sake carry me over the torrent And Jason was going to answer her scornfully when Cheiron s words came to his mind So he said For Hera s sake the Queen of the Immortals on Olympus I will carry you over the torrent unless we both are drowned midway Then the old dame leapt upon his back as nimbly as a goat and Jason staggered in wondering and the first step was up to his knees The first step was up to his knees and the second step was up to his waist and the stones rolled about his feet and his feet slipped about the stones so he went on staggering and panting while the old woman cried from off his back Fool you have wet my mantle Do you make game of poor old souls like me Jason had half a mind to drop her and let her get through the torrent by herself but Cheiron s words were in his mind and he said only Patience mother the best horse may stumble some day At last he staggered to the shore and set her down upon the bank and a strong man he needed to have been or that wild water he never would have crossed He lay panting awhile upon the bank and then leapt up to go upon his journey but he cast one look at the old woman for he thought She should thank me once at least And as he looked she grew fairer than all women and taller than all men on earth and her garments shone like the summer sea and her jewels like the stars of heaven and over her forehead was a veil woven of the golden clouds of sunset and through the veil she looked down on him with great soft heifer s eyes with great eyes mild and awful which filled all the glen with light And Jason fell upon his knees and hid his face between his hands And she spoke I am the Queen of Olympus Hera the wife of Zeus As thou hast done to me so will I do to thee Call on me in the hour of need and try if the Immortals can forget And when Jason looked up she rose from off the earth like a pillar of tall white cloud and floated away across the mountain peaks toward Olympus the holy hill Then a great fear fell on Jason but after a while he grew light of heart and he blessed old Cheiron and said Surely the Centaur is a prophet and guessed what would come to pass when he bade me speak harshly to no soul whom I might meet Then he went down toward Iolcos and as he walked he found that he had lost one of his sandals in the flood And as he went through the streets the people came out to look at him so tall and fair was he but some of the elders whispered together and at last one of them stopped Jason and called to him Fair lad who are you and whence come you and what is your errand in the town My name good father is Jason and I come from Pelion up above and my errand is to Pelias your king tell me then where his palace is But the old man started and grew pale and said Do you not know the oracle my son that you go so boldly through the town with but one sandal on I am a stranger here and know of no oracle but what of my one sandal I lost the other in Anauros while I was struggling with the flood Then the old man looked back to his companions and one sighed and another smiled at last he said I will tell you lest you rush upon your ruin unawares The oracle in Delphi has said that a man wearing one sandal should take the kingdom from Pelias and keep it for himself Therefore beware how you go up to his palace for he is the fiercest and most cunning of all kings Then Jason laughed a great laugh like a war horse in his pride Good news good father both for you and me For that very end I came into the town Then he strode on toward the palace of Pelias while all the people wondered at his bearing And he stood in the doorway and cried Come out come out Pelias the valiant and fight for your kingdom like a man Pelias came out wondering and Who are you bold youth he cried I am Jason the son of AEson the heir of all this land Then Pelias lifted up his hands and eyes and wept or seemed to weep and blessed the heavens which had brought his nephew to him never to leave him more For said he I have but three daughters and no son to be my heir You shall be my heir then and rule the kingdom after me and marry whichsoever of my daughters you shall choose though a sad kingdom you will find it and whosoever rules it a miserable man But come in come in and feast So he drew Jason in whether he would or not and spoke to him so lovingly and feasted him so well that Jason s anger passed and after supper his three cousins came into the hall and Jason thought that he should like well enough to have one of them for his wife But at last he said to Pelias Why do you look so sad my uncle And what did you mean just now when you said that this was a doleful kingdom and its ruler a miserable man Then Pelias sighed heavily again and again and again like a man who had to tell some dreadful story and was afraid to begin but at last For seven long years and more have I never known a quiet night and no more will he who comes after me till the golden fleece be brought home Then he told Jason the story of Phrixus and of the golden fleece and told him too which was a lie that Phrixus s spirit tormented him calling to him day and night And his daughters came and told the same tale for their father had taught them their parts and wept and said Oh who will bring home the golden fleece that our uncle s spirit may have rest and that we may have rest also whom he never lets sleep in peace Jason sat awhile sad and silent for he had often heard of that golden fleece but he looked on it as a thing hopeless and impossible for any mortal man to win it But when Pelias saw him silent he began to talk of other things and courted Jason more and more speaking to him as if he was certain to be his heir and asking his advice about the kingdom till Jason who was young and simple could not help saying to himself Surely he is not the dark man whom people call him Yet why did he drive my father out And he asked Pelias boldly Men say that you are terrible and a man of blood but I find you a kind and hospitable man and as you are to me so will I be to you Yet why did you drive my father out Pelias smiled and sighed Men have slandered me in that as in all things Your father was growing old and weary and he gave the kingdom up to me of his own will You shall see him to morrow and ask him and he will tell you the same Jason s heart leapt in him when he heard that he was to see his father and he believed all that Pelias said forgetting that his father might not dare to tell the truth One thing more there is said Pelias on which I need your advice for though you are young I see in you a wisdom beyond your years There is one neighbour of mine whom I dread more than all men on earth I am stronger than he now and can command him but I know that if he stay among us he will work my ruin in the end Can you give me a plan Jason by which I can rid myself of that man After awhile Jason answered half laughing Were I you I would send him to fetch that same golden fleece for if he once set forth after it you would never be troubled with him more And at that a bitter smile came across Pelias s lips and a flash of wicked joy into his eyes and Jason saw it and started and over his mind came the warning of the old man and his own one sandal and the oracle and he saw that he was taken in a trap But Pelias only answered gently My son he shall be sent forthwith You mean me cried Jason starting up because I came here with one sandal And he lifted his fist angrily while Pelias stood up to him like a wolf at bay and whether of the two was the stronger and the fiercer it would be hard to tell But after a moment Pelias spoke gently Why then so rash my son You and not I have said what is said why blame me for what I have not done Had you bid me love the man of whom I spoke and make him my son in law and heir I would have obeyed you and what if I obey you now and send the man to win himself immortal fame I have not harmed you or him One thing at least I know that he will go and that gladly for he has a hero s heart within him loving glory and scorning to break the word which he has given Jason saw that he was entrapped but his second promise to Cheiron came into his mind and he thought What if the Centaur were a prophet in that also and meant that I should win the fleece Then he cried aloud You have well spoken cunning uncle of mine I love glory and I dare keep to my word I will go and fetch this golden fleece Promise me but this in return and keep your word as I keep mine Treat my father lovingly while I am gone for the sake of the all seeing Zeus and give me up the kingdom for my own on the day that I bring back the golden fleece Then Pelias looked at him and almost loved him in the midst of all his hate and said I promise and I will perform It will be no shame to give up my kingdom to the man who wins that fleece Then they swore a great oath between them and afterward both went in and lay down to sleep But Jason could not sleep for thinking of his mighty oath and how he was to fulfil it all alone and without wealth or friends So he tossed a long time upon his bed and thought of this plan and of that and sometimes Phrixus seemed to call him in a thin voice faint and low as if it came from far across the sea Let me come home to my fathers and have rest And sometimes he seemed to see the eyes of Hera and to hear her words again Call on me in the hour of need and see if the Immortals can forget And on the morrow he went to Pelias and said Give me a victim that I may sacrifice to Hera So he went up and offered his sacrifice and as he stood by the altar Hera sent a thought into his mind and he went back to Pelias and said If you are indeed in earnest give me two heralds that they may go round to all the princes of the Minuai who were pupils of the Centaur with me that we may fit out a ship together and take what shall befall At that Pelias praised his wisdom and hastened to send the heralds out for he said in his heart Let all the princes go with him and like him never return for so I shall be lord of all the Minuai and the greatest king in Hellas PART III How They Built the Ship Argo in Iolcos So the heralds went out and cried to all the heroes of the Minuai Who dare come to the adventure of the golden fleece And Hera stirred the hearts of all the princes and they came from all their valleys to the yellow sands of Pagasai And first came Heracles the mighty with his lion s skin and club and behind him Hylas his young squire who bore his arrows and his bow and Tiphys the skilful steersman and Butes the fairest of all men and Castor and Polydeuces the twins the sons of the magic swan and Caineus the strongest of mortals whom the Centaurs tried in vain to kill and overwhelmed him with trunks of pine trees but even so he would not die and thither came Zetes and Calais the winged sons of the north wind and Peleus the father of Achilles whose bride was silver footed Thetis the goddess of the sea And thither came Telamon and Oileus the fathers of the two Aiantes who fought upon the plains of Troy and Mopsus the wise soothsayer who knew the speech of birds and Idmon to whom Phoebus gave a tongue to prophesy of things to come and Ancaios who could read the stars and knew all the circles of the heavens and Argus the famed shipbuilder and many a hero more in helmets of brass and gold with tall dyed horsehair crests and embroidered shirts of linen beneath their coats of mail and greaves of polished tin to guard their knees in fight with each man his shield upon his shoulder of many a fold of tough bull s hide and his sword of tempered bronze in his silver studded belt and in his right hand a pair of lances of the heavy white ash stave So they came down to Iolcos and all the city came out to meet them and were never tired with looking at their height and their beauty and their gallant bearing and the glitter of their inlaid arms And some said Never was such a gathering of the heroes since the Hellenes conquered the land But the women sighed over them and whispered Alas they are all going to the death Then they felled the pines on Pelion and shaped them with the axe and Argus taught them to build a galley the first long ship which ever sailed the seas They pierced her for fifty oars an oar for each hero of the crew and pitched her with coal black pitch and painted her bows with vermilion and they named her Argo after Argus and worked at her all day long And at night Pelias feasted them like a king and they slept in his palace porch But Jason went away to the northward and into the land of Thrace till he found Orpheus the prince of minstrels where he dwelt in his cave under Rhodope among the savage Cicon tribes And he asked him Will you leave your mountains Orpheus my fellow scholar in old times and cross Strymon once more with me to sail with the heroes of the Minuai and bring home the golden fleece and charm for us all men and all monsters with your magic harp and song Then Orpheus sighed Have I not had enough of toil and of weary wandering far and wide since I lived in Cheiron s cave above Iolcos by the sea In vain is the skill and the voice which my goddess mother gave me in vain have I sung and laboured in vain I went down to the dead and charmed all the kings of Hades to win back Eurydice my bride For I won her my beloved and lost her again the same day and wandered away in my madness even to Egypt and the Libyan sands and the isles of all the seas driven on by the terrible gadfly while I charmed in vain the hearts of men and the savage forest beasts and the trees and the lifeless stones with my magic harp and song giving rest but finding none But at last Calliope my mother delivered me and brought me home in peace and I dwell here in the cave alone among the savage Cicon tribes softening their wild hearts with music and the gentle laws of Zeus And now I must go out again to the ends of all the earth far away into the misty darkness to the last wave of the Eastern Sea But what is doomed must be and a friend s demand obeyed for prayers are the daughters of Zeus and who honours them honours him Then Orpheus rose up sighing and took his harp and went over Strymon And he led Jason to the southwest up the banks of Haliacmon and over the spurs of Pindus to Dodona the town of Zeus where it stood by the side of the sacred lake and the fountain which breathed out fire in the darkness of the ancient oak wood beneath the mountain of the hundred springs And he led him to the holy oak where the black dove settled in old times and was changed into the priestess of Zeus and gave oracles to all nations round And he bade him cut down a bough and sacrifice to Hera and to Zeus and they took the bough and came to Iolcos and nailed it to the beak head of the ship And at last the ship was finished and they tried to launch her down the beach but she was too heavy for them to move her and her keel sank deep in the sand Then all the heroes looked at each other blushing but Jason spoke and said Let us ask the magic bough perhaps it can help us in our need Then a voice came from the bough and Jason heard the words it said and bade Orpheus play upon the harp while the heroes waited round holding the pine trunk rollers to help her toward the sea Then Orpheus took his harp and began his magic song How sweet it is to ride upon the surges and to leap from wave to wave while the wind sings cheerful in the cordage and the oars flash fast among the foam How sweet it is to roam across the ocean and see new towns and wondrous lands and to come home laden with treasure and to win undying fame And the good ship Argo heard him and longed to be away and out at sea till she stirred in every timber and heaved from stem to stern and leapt up from the sand upon the rollers and plunged onward like a gallant horse and the heroes fed her path with pine trunks till she rushed into the whispering sea Then they stored her well with food and water and pulled the ladder up on board and settled themselves each man to his oar and kept time to Orpheus s harp and away across the bay they rowed southward while the people lined the cliffs and the women wept while the men shouted at the starting of that gallant crew PART IV How the Argonauts Sailed to Colchis And what happened next my children whether it be true or not stands written in ancient songs which you shall read for yourselves some day And grand old songs they are written in grand old rolling verse and they call them the Songs of Orpheus or the Orphics to this day And they tell how the heroes came to Aphetai across the bay and waited for the southwest wind and chose themselves a captain from their crew and how all called for Heracles because he was the strongest and most huge but Heracles refused and called for Jason because he was the wisest of them all So Jason was chosen captain and Orpheus heaped a pile of wood and slew a bull and offered it to Hera and called all the heroes to stand round each man s head crowned with olive and to strike their swords into the bull Then he filled a golden goblet with the bull s blood and with wheaten flour and honey and wine and the bitter salt sea water and bade the heroes taste So each tasted the goblet and passed it round and vowed an awful vow and they vowed before the sun and the night and the blue haired sea who shakes the land to stand by Jason faithfully in the adventure of the golden fleece and whosoever shrank back or disobeyed or turned traitor to his vow then justice should witness against him and the Erinnes who track guilty men Then Jason lighted the pile and burnt the carcass of the bull and they went to their ship and sailed eastward like men who have a work to do and the place from which they went was called Aphetai the sailing place from that day forth Three thousand years ago and more they sailed away into the unknown Eastern seas and great nations have come and gone since then and many a storm has swept the earth and many a mighty armament to which Argo would be but one small boat have sailed those waters since yet the fame of that small Argo lives forever and her name is become a proverb among men So they sailed past the Isle of Sciathos with the Cape of Sepius on their left and turned to the northward toward Pelion up the long Magnesian shore On their right hand was the open sea and on their left old Pelion rose while the clouds crawled round his dark pine forests and his caps of summer snow And their hearts yearned for the dear old mountain as they thought of pleasant days gone by and of the sports of their boyhood and their hunting and their schooling in the cave beneath the cliff And at last Peleus spoke Let us land here friends and climb the dear old hill once more We are going on a fearful journey who knows if we shall see Pelion again Let us go up to Cheiron our master and ask his blessing ere we start And I have a boy too with him whom he trains as he trained me once the son whom Thetis brought me the silver footed lady of the sea whom I caught in the cave and tamed her though she changed her shape seven times For she changed as I held her into water and to vapour and to burning flame and to a rock and to a black maned lion and to a tall and stately tree But I held her and held her ever till she took her own shape again and led her to my father s house and won her for my bride And all the rulers of Olympus came to our wedding and the heavens and the earth rejoiced together when an immortal wedded mortal man And now let me see my son for it is not often I shall see him upon earth famous he will be but short lived and die in the flower of youth So Tiphys the helmsman steered them to the shore under the crags of Pelion and they went up through the dark pine forests toward the Centaur s cave And they came into the misty hall beneath the snow crowned crag and saw the great Centaur lying with his huge limbs spread upon the rock and beside him stood Achilles the child whom no steel could wound and played upon his harp right sweetly while Cheiron watched and smiled Then Cheiron leapt up and welcomed them and kissed them every one and set a feast before them of swine s flesh and venison and good wine and young Achilles served them and carried the golden goblet round And after supper all the heroes clapped their hands and called on Orpheus to sing but he refused and said How can I who am the younger sing before our ancient host So they called on Cheiron to sing and Achilles brought him his harp and he began a wondrous song a famous story of old time of the fight between Centaurs and the Lapithai which you may still see carved in stone He sang how his brothers came to ruin by their folly when they were mad with wine and how they and the heroes fought with fists and teeth and the goblets from which they drank and how they tore up the pine trees in their fury and hurled great crags of stone while the mountains thundered with the battle and the land was wasted far and wide till the Lapithai drove them from their home in the rich Thessalian plains to the lonely glens of Pindus leaving Cheiron all alone And the heroes praised his song right heartily for some of them had helped in that great fight Then Orpheus took the lyre and sang of Chaos and the making of the wondrous World and how all things sprang from Love who could not live alone in the Abyss And as he sang his voice rose from the cave above the crags and through the tree tops and the glens of oak and pine And the trees bowed their heads when they heard it and the gray rocks cracked and rang and the forest beasts crept near to listen and the birds forsook their nests and hovered round And old Cheiron clapt his hands together and beat his hoofs upon the ground for wonder at that magic song Then Peleus kissed his boy and wept over him and they went down to the ship and Cheiron came down with them weeping and kissed them one by one and blest them and promised to them great renown And the heroes wept when they left him till their great hearts could weep no more for he was kind and just and pious and wiser than all beasts and men Then he went up to a cliff and prayed for them that they might come home safe and well while the heroes rowed away and watched him standing on his cliff above the sea with his great hands raised toward heaven and his white locks waving in the wind and they strained their eyes to watch him to the last for they felt that they should look on him no more So they rowed on over the long swell of the sea past Olympus the seat of die immortals and past the wooded bays of Athos and Samothrace the sacred isle and they came past Lemnos to the Hellespont and through the narrow strait of Abydos and so on into the Propontis which we call Marmora now And there they met with Cyzicus ruling in Asia over the Dolions who the songs say was the son of AEneas of whom you will hear many a tale some day For Homer tells us how he fought at Troy and Virgil how he sailed away and founded Rome and men believed until late years that from him sprang the old British kings Now Cyzicus the songs say welcomed the heroes for his father had been one of Cheiron s scholars so he welcomed them and feasted them and stored their ship with corn and wine and cloaks and rugs the songs say and shirts of which no doubt they stood in need But at night while they lay sleeping came down on them terrible men who lived with the bears in the mountains like Titans or giants in shape for each of them had six arms and they fought with young firs and pines But Heracles killed them all before morn with his deadly poisoned arrows but among them in the darkness he slew Cyzicus the kindly prince Then they got to their ship and to their oars and Tiphys bade them cast off the hawsers and go to sea But as he spoke a whirlwind came and spun the Argo round and twisted the hawsers together so that no man could loose them Then Tiphys dropped the rudder from his hand and cried This comes from the Gods above But Jason went forward and asked counsel of the magic bough Then the magic bough spoke and answered This is because you have slain Cyzicus your friend You must appease his soul or you will never leave this shore Jason went back sadly and told the heroes what he had heard And they leapt on shore and searched till dawn and at dawn they found the body all rolled in dust and blood among the corpses of those monstrous beasts And they wept over their kind host and laid him on a fair bed and heaped a huge mound over him and offered black sheep at his tomb and Orpheus sang a magic song to him that his spirit might have rest And then they held games at the tomb after the custom of those times and Jason gave prizes to each winner To Ancaeus he gave a golden cup for he wrestled best of all and to Heracles a silver one for he was the strongest of all and to Castor who rode best a golden crest and Polydeuces the boxer had a rich carpet and to Orpheus for his song a sandal with golden wings But Jason himself was the best of all the archers and the Minuai crowned him with an olive crown and so the songs say the soul of good Cyzicus was appeased and the heroes went on their way in peace But when Cyzicus s wife heard that he was dead she died likewise of grief and her tears became a fountain of clear water which flows the whole year round Then they rowed away the songs say along the Mysian shore and past the mouth of Rhindacus till they found a pleasant bay sheltered by the long ridges of Arganthus and by high walls of basalt rock And there they ran the ship ashore upon the yellow sand and furled the sail and took the mast down and lashed it in its crutch And next they let down the ladder and went ashore to sport and rest And there Heracles went away into the woods bow in hand to hunt wild deer and Hylas the fair boy slipt away after him and followed him by stealth until he lost himself among the glens and sat down weary to rest himself by the side of a lake and there the water nymphs came up to look at him and loved him and carried him down under the lake to be their playfellow forever happy and young And Heracles sought for him in vain shouting his name till all the mountains rang but Hylas never heard him far down under the sparkling lake So while Heracles wandered searching for him a fair breeze sprang up and Heracles was nowhere to be found and the Argo sailed away and Heracles was left behind and never saw the noble Phasian stream Then the Minuai came to a doleful land where Amycus the giant ruled and cared nothing for the laws of Zeus but challenged all strangers to box with him and those whom he conquered he slew But Polydeuces the boxer struck him a harder blow than he ever felt before and slew him and the Minuai went on up the Bosphorus till they came to the city of Phineus the fierce Bithynian king for Zetes and Calais bade Jason land there because they had a work to do And they went up from the shore toward the city through forests white with snow and Phineus came out to meet them with a lean and woeful face and said Welcome gallant heroes to the land of bitter blasts a land of cold and misery yet I will feast you as best I can And he led them in and set meat before them but before they could put their hands to their mouths down came two fearful monsters the like of whom man never saw for they had the faces and the hair of fair maidens but the wings and claws of hawks and they snatched the meat from off the table and flew shrieking out above the roofs Then Phineus beat his breast and cried These are the Harpies whose names are the Whirlwind and the Swift the daughters of Wonder and of the Amber nymph and they rob us night and day They carried off the daughters of Pandareus whom all the Gods had blest for Aphrodite fed them on Olympus with honey and milk and wine and Hera gave them beauty and wisdom and Athene skill in all the arts but when they came to their wedding the Harpies snatched them both away and gave them to be slaves to the Erinnues and live in horror all their days And now they haunt me and my people and the Bosphorus with fearful storms and sweep away our food from off our tables so that we starve in spite of all our wealth Then up rose Zetes and Calais the winged sons of the North wind and said Do you not know us Phineus and these wings which grow upon our backs And Phineus hid his face in terror but he answered not a word Because you have been a traitor Phineus the Harpies haunt you night and day Where is Cleopatra our sister your wife whom you keep in prison and where are her two children whom you blinded in your rage at the bidding of an evil woman and cast them out upon the rocks Swear to us that you will right our sister and cast out that wicked woman and then we will free you from your plague and drive the whirlwind maidens from the south but if not we will put out your eyes as you put out the eyes of your own sons Then Phineus swore an oath to them and drove out the wicked woman and Jason took those two poor children and cured their eyes with magic herbs But Zetes and Calais rose up sadly and said Farewell now heroes all farewell our dear companions with whom we played on Pelion in old times for a fate is laid upon us and our day is come at last in which we may hunt the whirlwinds over land and sea forever and if we catch them they die and if not we die ourselves At that all the heroes wept but the two young men sprang up and aloft into the air after the Harpies and the battle of the winds began The heroes trembled in silence as they heard the shrieking of the blasts while the palace rocked and all the city and great stones were torn from the crags and the forest pines were hurled eastward north and south and east and west and the Bosphorus boiled white with foam and the clouds were dashed against the cliffs But at last the battle ended and the Harpies fled screaming toward the south and the sons of the North wind rushed after them and brought clear sunshine where they passed For many a league they followed them over all the isles of the Cyclades and away to the southwest across Hellas till they came to the Ionian Sea and there they fell upon the Echinades at the mouth of the Achelous and those isles were called the Whirlwind Isles for many a hundred years But what became of Zetes and Calais I know not for the heroes never saw them again and some say that Heracles met them and quarrelled with them and slew them with his arrows and some say that they fell down from weariness and the heat of the summer sun and that the Sun god buried them among the Cyclades in the pleasant Isle of Tenos and for many hundred years their grave was shown there and over it a pillar which turned to every wind But those dark storms and whirlwinds haunt the Bosphorus until this day But the Argonauts went eastward and out into the open sea which we now call the Black Sea but it was called the Euxine then No Hellen had ever crossed it and all feared that dreadful sea and its rocks and shoals and fogs and bitter freezing storms and they told strange stories of it some false and some half true how it stretched northward to the ends of the earth and the sluggish Putrid Sea and the everlasting night and the regions of the dead So the heroes trembled for all their courage as they came into that wild Black Sea and saw it stretching out before them without a shore as far as eye could see And first Orpheus spoke and warned them We shall come now to the wandering blue rocks my mother warned me of them Calliope the immortal muse And soon they saw the blue rocks shining like spires and castles of gray glass while an ice cold wind blew from them and chilled all the heroes hearts And as they neared they could see them heaving as they rolled upon the long sea waves crashing and grinding together till the roar went up to heaven The sea sprang up in spouts between them and swept round them in white sheets of foam but their heads swung nodding high in air while the wind whistled shrill among the crags The heroes hearts sank within them and they lay upon their oars in fear but Orpheus called to Tiphys the helmsman Between them we must pass so look ahead for an opening and be brave for Hera is with us But Tiphys the cunning helmsman stood silent clenching his teeth till he saw a heron come flying mast high toward the rocks and hover awhile before them as if looking for a passage through Then he cried Hera has sent us a pilot let us follow the cunning bird Then the heron flapped to and fro a moment till he saw a hidden gap and into it he rushed like an arrow while the heroes watched what would befall And the blue rocks clashed together as the bird fled swiftly through but they struck but a feather from his tail and then rebounded apart at the shock Then Tiphys cheered the heroes and they shouted and the oars bent like withes beneath their strokes as they rushed between those toppling ice crags and the cold blue lips of death And ere the rocks could meet again they had passed them and were safe out in the open sea And after that they sailed on wearily along the Asian coast by the Black Cape and Thyneis where the hot stream of Thymbris falls into the sea and Sangarius whose waters float on the Euxine till they came to Wolf the river and to Wolf the kindly king And there died two brave heroes Idmon and Tiphys the wise helmsman one died of an evil sickness and one a wild boar slew So the heroes heaped a mound above them and set upon it an oar on high and left them there to sleep together on the far off Lycian shore But Idas killed the boar and avenged Tiphys and Ancaios took the rudder and was helmsman and steered them on toward the east And they went on past Sinope and many a mighty river s mouth and past many a barbarous tribe and the cities of the Amazons the warlike women of the East till all night they heard the clank of anvils and the roar of furnace blasts and the forge fires shone like sparks through the darkness in the mountain glens aloft for they were come to the shores of the Chalybes the smiths who never tire but serve Ares the cruel War god forging weapons day and night And at day dawn they looked eastward and midway between the sea and the sky they saw white snow peaks hanging glittering sharp and bright above the clouds And they knew that they were come to Caucasus at the end of all the earth Caucasus the highest of all mountains the father of the rivers of the East On his peak lies chained the Titan while a vulture tears his heart and at his feet are piled dark forests round the magic Colchian land And they rowed three days to the eastward while Caucasus rose higher hour by hour till they saw the dark stream of Phasis rushing headlong to the sea and shining above the treetops the golden roofs of King Aietes the child of the sun Then out spoke Ancaios the helmsman We are come to our goal at last for there are the roofs of Aietes and the woods where all poisons grow but who can tell us where among them is hid the golden fleece Many a toil must we bear ere we find it and bring it home to Greece But Jason cheered the heroes for his heart was high and bold and he said I will go alone up to Aietes though he be the child of the sun and win him with soft words Better so than to go altogether and to come to blows at once But the Minuai would not stay behind so they rowed boldly up the stream And a dream came to Aietes and filled his heart with fear He thought he saw a shining star which fell into his daughter s lap and that Medeia his daughter took it gladly and carried it to the river side and cast it in and there the whirling river bore it down and out into the Euxine Sea Then he leapt up in fear and bade his servants bring his chariot that he might go down to the riverside and appease the nymphs and the heroes whose spirits haunt the bank So he went down in his golden chariot and his daughters by his side Medeia the fair witch maiden and Chalciope who had been Phrixus s wife and behind him a crowd of servants and soldiers for he was a rich and mighty prince And as he drove down by the reedy river he saw Argo sliding up beneath the bank and many a hero in her like immortals for beauty and for strength as their weapons glittered round them in the level morning sunlight through the white mist of the stream But Jason was the noblest of all for Hera who loved him gave him beauty and tallness and terrible manhood And when they came near together and looked into each other s eyes the heroes were awed before Aietes as he shone in his chariot like his father the glorious Sun for his robes were of rich gold tissue and the rays of his diadem flashed fire and in his hand he bore a jewelled sceptre which glittered like the stars and sternly he looked at them under his brows and sternly he spoke and loud Who are you and what want you here that you come to the shore of Cutaia Do you take no account of my rule nor of my people the Colchians who serve me who never tired yet in the battle and know well how to face an invader And the heroes sat silent awhile before the face of that ancient king But Hera the awful goddess put courage into Jason s heart and he rose and shouted loudly in answer We are no pirates nor lawless men We come not to plunder and to ravage or carry away slaves from your land but my uncle the son of Poseidon Pelias the Minuan king he it is who has set me on a quest to bring home the golden fleece And these too my bold comrades they are no nameless men for some are the sons of immortals and some of heroes far renowned And we too never tire in battle and know well how to give blows and to take yet we wish to be guests at your table it will be better so for both Then Aietes s rage rushed up like a whirlwind and his eyes flashed fire as he heard but he crushed his anger down in his breast and spoke mildly a cunning speech If you will fight for the fleece with my Colchians then many a man must die But do you indeed expect to win from me the fleece in fight So few you are that if you be worsted I can load your ship with your corpses But if you will be ruled by me you will find it better far to choose the best man among you and let him fulfil the labours which I demand Then I will give him the golden fleece for a prize and a glory to you all So saying he turned his horses and drove back in silence to the town And the Minuai sat silent with sorrow and longed for Heracles and his strength for there was no facing the thousands of the Colchians and the fearful chance of war But Chalciope Phrixus s widow went weeping to the town for she remembered her Minuan husband and all the pleasures of her youth while she watched the fair faces of his kinsmen and their long locks of golden hair And she whispered to Medeia her sister Why should all these brave men die why does not my father give them up the fleece that my husband s spirit may have rest And Medeia s heart pitied the heroes and Jason most of all and she answered Our father is stern and terrible and who can win the golden fleece But Chalciope said These men are not like our men there is nothing which they cannot dare nor do And Medeia thought of Jason and his brave countenance and said If there was one among them who knew no fear I could show him how to win the fleece So in the dusk of evening they went down to the riverside Chalciope and Medeia the witch maiden and Argus Phrixus s son And Argus the boy crept forward among the beds of reeds till he came where the heroes were sleeping on the thwarts of the ship beneath the bank while Jason kept ward on shore and leant upon his lance full of thought And the boy came to Jason and said I am the son of Phrixus your cousin and Chalciope my mother waits for you to talk about the golden fleece Then Jason went boldly with the boy and found the two princesses standing and when Chalciope saw him she wept and took his hands and cried O cousin of my beloved go home before you die It would be base to go home now fair princess and to have sailed all these seas in vain Then both the princesses besought him but Jason said It is too late But you know not said Medeia what he must do who would win the fleece He must tame the two brazen footed bulls who breathe devouring flame and with them he must plough ere nightfall four acres in the field of Ares and he must sow them with serpents teeth of which each tooth springs up into an armed man Then he must fight with all those warriors and little will it profit him to conquer them for the fleece is guarded by a serpent more huge than any mountain pine and over his body you must step if you would reach the golden fleece Then Jason laughed bitterly Unjustly is that fleece kept here and by an unjust and lawless king and unjustly shall I die in my youth for I will attempt it ere another sun be set Then Medeia trembled and said No mortal man can reach that fleece unless I guide him through For round it beyond the river is a wall full nine ells high with lofty towers and buttresses and mighty gates of threefold brass and over the gates the wall is arched with golden battlements above And over the gateway sits Brimo the wild witch huntress of the woods brandishing a pine torch in her hands while her mad hounds howl around No man dare meet her or look on her but only I her priestess and she watches far and wide lest any stranger should come near No wall so high but it may be climbed at last and no wood so thick but it may be crawled through no serpent so wary but he may be charmed or witch queen so fierce but spells may soothe her and I may yet win the golden fleece if a wise maiden help bold men And he looked at Medeia cunningly and held her with his glittering eye till she blushed and trembled and said Who can face the fire of the bulls breath and fight ten thousand armed men He whom you help said Jason flattering her for your fame is spread over all the earth Are you not the queen of all enchantresses wiser even than your sister Circe in her fairy island in the West Would that I were with my sister Circe in her fairy island in the West far away from sore temptation and thoughts which tear the heart But if it must be so for why should you die I have an ointment here I made it from the magic ice flower which sprang from Prometheus s wound above the clouds on Caucasus in the dreary fields of snow Anoint yourself with that and you shall have in you seven men s strength and anoint your shield with it and neither fire nor sword can harm you But what you begin you must end before sunset for its virtue lasts only one day And anoint your helmet with it before you sow the serpents teeth and when the sons of earth spring up cast your helmet among their ranks and the deadly crop of the War god s field will mow itself and perish Then Jason fell on his knees before her and thanked her and kissed her hands and she gave him the vase of ointment and fled trembling through the reeds And Jason told his comrades what had happened and showed them the box of ointment and all rejoiced but Idas and he grew mad with envy And at sunrise Jason went and bathed and anointed himself from head to foot and his shield and his helmet and his weapons and bade his comrades try the spell So they tried to bend his lance but it stood like an iron bar and Idas in spite hewed at it with his sword but the blade flew to splinters in his face Then they hurled their lances at his shield but the spear points turned like lead and Caineus tried to throw him but he never stirred a foot and Polydeuces struck him with his fist a blow which would have killed an ox but Jason only smiled and the heroes danced about him with delight and he leapt and ran and shouted in the joy of that enormous strength till the sun rose and it was time to go and to claim Aietes s promise So he sent up Telamon and Aithalides to tell Aietes that he was ready for the fight and they went up among the marble walls and beneath the roofs of gold and stood in Aietes s hall while he grew pale with rage Fulfil your promise to us child of the blazing sun Give us the serpents teeth and let loose the fiery bulls for we have found a champion among us who can win the golden fleece And Aietes bit his lips for he fancied that they had fled away by night but he could not go back from his promise so he gave them the serpents teeth Then he called for his chariot and his horses and sent heralds through all the town and all the people went out with him to the dreadful War god s field And there Aietes sat upon his throne with his warriors on each hand thousands and tens of thousands clothed from head to foot in steel chain mail And the people and the women crowded to every window and bank and wall while the Minuai stood together a mere handful in the midst of that great host And Chalciope was there and Argus trembling and Medeia wrapped closely in her veil but Aietes did not know that she was muttering cunning spells between her lips Then Jason cried Fulfil your promise and let your fiery bulls come forth Then Aietes bade open the gates and the magic bulls leapt out Their brazen hoofs rang upon the ground and their nostrils sent out sheets of flame as they rushed with lowered heads upon Jason but he never flinched a step The flame of their breath swept round him but it singed not a hair of his head and the bulls stopped short and trembled when Medeia began her spell Then Jason sprang upon the nearest and seized him by the horn and up and down they wrestled till the bull fell grovelling on his knees for the heart of the brute died within him and his mighty limbs were loosed beneath the steadfast eye of that dark witch maiden and the magic whisper of her lips So both the bulls were tamed and yoked and Jason bound them to the plough and goaded them onward with his lance till he had ploughed the sacred field And all the Minuai shouted but Aietes bit his lips with rage for the half of Jason s work was over and the sun was yet high in heaven Then he took the serpents teeth and sowed them and waited what would befall But Medeia looked at him and at his helmet lest he should forget the lesson she had taught And every furrow heaved and bubbled and out of every clod rose a man Out of the earth they rose by thousands each clad from head to foot in steel and drew their swords and rushed on Jason where he stood in the midst alone Then the Minuai grew pale with fear for him but Aietes laughed a bitter laugh See if I had not warriors enough already round me I could call them out of the bosom of the earth But Jason snatched off his helmet and hurled it into the thickest of the throng And blind madness came upon them suspicion hate and fear and one cried to his fellow Thou didst strike me and another Thou art Jason thou shalt die So fury seized those earth born phantoms and each turned his hand against the rest and they fought and were never weary till they all lay dead upon the ground Then the magic furrows opened and the kind earth took them home into her breast and the grass grew up all green again above them and Jason s work was done Then the Minuai rose and shouted till Prometheus heard them from his crag And Jason cried Lead me to the fleece this moment before the sun goes down But Aietes thought He has conquered the bulls and sown and reaped the deadly crop Who is this who is proof against all magic He may kill the serpent yet So he delayed and sat taking counsel with his princes till the sun went down and all was dark Then he bade a herald cry Every man to his home for to night To morrow we will meet these heroes and speak about the golden fleece Then he turned and looked at Medeia This is your doing false witch maid You have helped these yellow haired strangers and brought shame upon your father and yourself Medeia shrank and trembled and her face grew pale with fear and Aietes knew that she was guilty and whispered If they win the fleece you die But the Minuai marched toward their ship growling like lions cheated of their prey for they saw that Aietes meant to mock them and to cheat them out of all their toil And Oileus said Let us go to the grove together and take the fleece by force And Idas the rash cried Let us draw lots who shall go in first for while the dragon is devouring one the rest can slay him and carry off the fleece in peace But Jason held them back though he praised them for he hoped for Medeia s help And after awhile Medeia came trembling and wept a long while before she spoke And at last My end is come and I must die for my father has found out that I have helped you You he would kill if he dared but he will not harm you because you have been his guests Go then go and remember poor Medeia when you are far away across the sea But all the heroes cried If you die we die with you for without you we cannot win the fleece and home we will not go without it but fall here fighting to the last man You need not die said Jason Flee home with us across the sea Show us first how to win the fleece for you can do it Why else are you the priestess of the grove Show us but how to win the fleece and come with us and you shall be my queen and rule over the rich princes of the Minuai in Iolcos by the sea And all the heroes pressed round and vowed to her that she should be their queen Medeia wept and shuddered and hid her face in her hands for her heart yearned after her sisters and her playfellows and the home where she was brought up as a child But at last she looked up at Jason and spoke between her sobs Must I leave my home and my people to wander with strangers across the sea The lot is cast and I must endure it I will show you how to win the golden fleece Bring up your ship to the woodside and moor her there against the bank and let Jason come up at midnight and one brave comrade with him and meet me beneath the wall Then all the heroes cried together I will go and I and I And Idas the rash grew mad with envy for he longed to be foremost in all things But Medeia calmed them and said Orpheus shall go with Jason and bring his magic harp for I hear of him that he is the king of all minstrels and can charm all things on earth And Orpheus laughed for joy and clapped his hands because the choice had fallen on him for in those days poets and singers were as bold warriors as the best So at midnight they went up the bank and found Medeia and beside came Absyrtus her young brother leading a yearling lamb Then Medeia brought them to a thicket beside the War god s gate and there she bade Jason dig a ditch and kill the lamb and leave it there and strew on it magic herbs and honey from the honeycomb Then sprang up through the earth with the red fire flashing before her Brimo the wild witch huntress while her mad hounds howled around She had one head like a horse s and another like a ravening hound s and another like a hissing snake s and a sword in either hand And she leapt into the ditch with her hounds and they ate and drank their fill while Jason and Orpheus trembled and Medeia hid her eyes And at last the witch queen vanished and fled with her hounds into the woods and the bars of the gates fell down and the brazen doors flew wide and Medeia and the heroes ran forward and hurried through the poison wood among the dark stems of the mighty beeches guided by the gleam of the golden fleece until they saw it hanging on one vast tree in the midst And Jason would have sprung to seize it but Medeia held him back and pointed shuddering to the tree foot where the mighty serpent lay coiled in and out among the roots with a body like a mountain pine His coils stretched many a fathom spangled with bronze and gold and half of him they could see but no more for the rest lay in the darkness far beyond And when he saw them coming he lifted up his head and watched them with his small bright eyes and flashed his forked tongue and roared like the fire among the woodlands till the forest tossed and groaned For his cry shook the trees from leaf to root and swept over the long reaches of the river and over AEetes s hall and woke the sleepers in the city till mothers clasped their children in their fear But Medeia called gently to him and he stretched out his long spotted neck and licked her hand and looked up in her face as if to ask for food Then she made a sign to Orpheus and he began his magic song And as he sung the forest grew calm again and the leaves on every tree hung still and the serpent s head sank down and his brazen coils grew limp and his glittering eyes closed lazily till he breathed as gently as a child while Orpheus called to pleasant Slumber who gives peace to men and beasts and waves Then Jason leapt forward warily and stept across that mighty snake and tore the fleece from off the tree trunk and the four rushed down the garden to the bank where the Argo lay There was a silence for a moment while Jason held the golden fleece on high Then he cried Go now good Argo swift and steady if ever you would see Pelion more And she went as the heroes drove her grim and silent all with muffled oars till the pine wood bent like willow in their hands and stout Argo groaned beneath their strokes On and on beneath the dewy darkness they fled swiftly down the swirling stream underneath black walls and temples and the castles of the princes of the East past sluice mouths and fragrant gardens and groves of all strange fruits past marshes where fat kine lay sleeping and long beds of whispering reeds till they heard the merry music of the surge upon the bar as it tumbled in the moonlight all alone Into the surge they rushed and Argo leapt the breakers like a horse for she knew the time was come to show her mettle and win honour for the heroes and herself Into the surge they rushed and Argo leapt the breakers like a horse till the heroes stopped all panting each man upon his oar as she slid into the still broad sea Then Orpheus took his harp and sang a paean till the heroes hearts rose high again and they rowed on stoutly and steadfastly away into the darkness of the West PART V How the Argonauts Were Driven into the Unknown Sea So they fled away in haste to the westward but Aietes manned his fleet and followed them 
8193_116804_000006_000001	train-clean-360	And Lynceus the quick eyed saw him coming while he was still many a mile away and cried I see a hundred ships like a flock of white swans far in the east And at that they rowed hard like heroes but the ships came nearer every hour 
none	none	Then Medeia the dark witch maiden laid a cruel and a cunning plot for she killed Absyrtus her young brother and cast him into the sea and said Ere my father can take up his corpse and bury it he must wait long and be left far behind And all the heroes shuddered and looked one at the other for shame yet they did not punish that dark witch woman because she had won for them the golden fleece And when Aietes came to the place he saw the floating corpse and he stopped a long while and bewailed his son and took him up and went home 
8193_116804_000009_000001	train-clean-360	But he sent on his sailors toward the westward and bound them by a mighty curse Bring back to me that dark witch woman that she may die a dreadful death 
8193_116804_000009_000002	train-clean-360	But if you return without her you shall die by the same death yourselves 
8193_116804_000010_000000	train-clean-360	So the Argonauts escaped for that time but Father Zeus saw that foul crime and out of the heavens he sent a storm and swept the ship far from her course 
none	none	Day after day the storm drove her amid foam and blinding mist till they knew no longer where they were for the sun was blotted from the skies And at last the ship struck on a shoal amid low isles of mud and sand and the waves rolled over her and through her and the heroes lost all hope of life Then Jason cried to Hera Fair queen who hast befriended us till now why hast thou left us in our misery to die here among unknown seas It is hard to lose the honour which we have won with such toil and danger and hard never to see Hellas again and the pleasant bay of Pagasai 
8193_116804_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Then out and spoke the magic bough which stood upon the Argo s beak Because Father Zeus is angry all this has fallen on you for a cruel crime has been done on board and the sacred ship is foul with blood 
8193_116804_000013_000000	train-clean-360	At that some of the heroes cried Medeia is the murderess 
8193_116804_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Let the witch woman bear her sin and die 
8193_116804_000014_000000	train-clean-360	And they seized Medeia to hurl her into the sea and atone for the young boy s death but the magic bough spoke again Let her live till her crimes are full 
8193_116804_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Vengeance waits for her slow and sure but she must live for you need her still 
none	none	She must show you the way to her sister Circe who lives among the islands of the West To her you must sail a weary way and she shall cleanse you from your guilt 
8193_116804_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Then all the heroes wept aloud when they heard the sentence of the oak for they knew that a dark journey lay before them and years of bitter toil 
8193_116804_000015_000001	train-clean-360	And some upbraided the dark witch woman and some said Nay we are her debtors still without her we should never have won the fleece But most of them bit their lips in silence for they feared the witch s spells 
8193_116804_000016_000000	train-clean-360	And now the sea grew calmer and the sun shone out once more and the heroes thrust the ship off the sand bank and rowed forward on their weary course under the guiding of the dark witch maiden into the wastes of the unknown sea 
none	none	Whither they went I cannot tell nor how they came to Circe s isle Some say that they went to the westward and up the Ister A stream and so came into the Adriatic dragging their ship over the snowy Alps And others say that they went southward into the Red Indian Sea and past the sunny lands where spices grow round AEthiopia toward the west and that at last they came to Libya and dragged their ship across the burning sands and over the hills into the Syrtes where the flats and quicksands spread for many a mile between rich Cyrene and the Lotus eaters shore 
8193_116804_000017_000003	train-clean-360	But all these are but dreams and fables and dim hints of unknown lands 
none	none	Footnote A The Danube 
8193_116804_000019_000000	train-clean-360	But all say that they came to a place where they had to drag their ship across the land nine days with ropes and rollers till they came into an unknown sea 
none	none	And the best of all the old songs tells us how they went away toward the north till they came to the slope of Caucasus where it sinks into the sea and to the narrow Cimmerian Bosphorus A where the Titan swam across upon the bull and thence into the lazy waters of the still Maeotid Lake B And thence they went northward ever up the Tanais which we call Don past the Geloni and Sauromatai and many a wandering shepherd tribe and the one eyed Arimaspi of whom old Greek poets tell who steal the gold from the Griffins in the cold Rhiphaian C hills And they passed the Scythian archers and the Tauri who eat men and the wandering Hyperboreai who feed their flocks beneath the pole star until they came into the northern ocean the dull dead Cronian Sea D And there Argo would move on no longer and each man clasped his elbow and leaned his head upon his hand heartbroken with toil and hunger and gave himself up to death But brave Ancaios the helmsman cheered up their hearts once more and bade them leap on land and haul the ship with ropes and rollers for many a weary day whether over land or mud or ice I know not for the song is mixed and broken like a dream And it says next how they came to the rich nation of the famous long lived men and to the coast of the Cimmerians who never saw the sun buried deep in the glens of the snow mountains and to the fair land of Hermione where dwelt the most righteous of all nations and to the gates of the world below and to the dwelling place of dreams Footnote A Between the Crimaea and Circassia Footnote B The Sea of Azov Footnote C The Ural Mountains Footnote D The Baltic And at last Ancaios shouted Endure a little while brave friends the worst is surely past for I can see the pure west wind ruffle the water and hear the roar of ocean on the sands 
8193_116804_000025_000001	train-clean-360	So raise up the mast and set the sail and face what comes like men 
none	none	Then out spoke the magic bough Ah would that I had perished long ago and been whelmed by the dread blue rocks beneath the fierce swell of the Euxine 
8193_116804_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Better so than to wander forever disgraced by the guilt of my princes for the blood of Absyrtus still tracks me and woe follows hard upon woe 
none	none	And now some dark horror will clutch me if I come near the Isle of Ierne A Unless you will cling to the land and sail southward and southward forever I shall wander beyond the Atlantic to the ocean which has no shore Then they blest the magic bough and sailed southward along the land But ere they could pass Ierne the land of mists and storms the wild wind came down dark and roaring and caught the sail and strained the ropes 
8193_116804_000027_000001	train-clean-360	And away they drove twelve nights on the wide wild western sea through the foam and over the rollers while they saw neither sun nor stars 
8193_116804_000027_000002	train-clean-360	And they cried again We shall perish for we know not where we are 
8193_116804_000027_000003	train-clean-360	We are lost in the dreary damp darkness and cannot tell north from south 
none	none	But Lynceus the long sighted called gayly from the bows Take heart again brave sailors for I see a pine clad isle and the halls of the kind Earth mother with a crown of clouds around them Footnote A Britain 
8193_116804_000030_000000	train-clean-360	But Orpheus said Turn from them for no living man can land there there is no harbour on the coast but steep walled cliffs all round 
none	none	So Ancaios turned the ship away and for three days more they sailed on till they came to Aiaia Circe s home and the fairy island of the West And there Jason bid them land and seek about for any sign of living man 
8193_116804_000032_000001	train-clean-360	And as they went inland Circe met them coming down toward the ship and they trembled when they saw her for her hair and face and robes shone like flame 
8193_116804_000033_000000	train-clean-360	And she came and looked at Medeia and Medeia hid her face beneath her veil 
8193_116804_000034_000000	train-clean-360	And Circe cried Ah wretched girl have you forgotten all your sins that you come hither to my island where the flowers bloom all the year round 
8193_116804_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Where is your aged father and the brother whom you killed Little do I expect you to return in safety with these strangers whom you love 
none	none	I will send you food and wine but your ship must not stay here for it is foul with sin and foul with sin its crew 
8193_116804_000035_000000	train-clean-360	And the heroes prayed her but in vain and cried Cleanse us from our guilt But she sent them away and said Go on to Malea and there you may be cleansed and return home 
8193_116804_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Then a fair wind rose and they sailed eastward by Tartessus on the Iberian shore till they came to the Pillars of Hercules and the Mediterranean Sea 
8193_116804_000036_000001	train-clean-360	And thence they sailed on through the deeps of Sardinia and past the Ausonian Islands and the capes of the Tyrrhenian shore till they came to a flowery island upon a still bright summer s eve 
8193_116804_000036_000002	train-clean-360	And as they neared it slowly and wearily they heard sweet songs upon the shore 
8193_116804_000036_000003	train-clean-360	But when Medeia heard it she started and cried Beware all heroes for these are the rocks of the Sirens 
8193_116804_000036_000004	train-clean-360	You must pass close by them for there is no other channel but those who listen to that song are lost 
8193_116804_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Then Orpheus spoke the king of all minstrels Let them match their song against mine 
none	none	I have charmed stones and trees and dragons how much more the hearts of man So he caught up his lyre and stood upon the poop and began his magic song 
8193_116804_000038_000000	train-clean-360	And now they could see the Sirens on Anthemousa the flowery isle three fair maidens sitting on the beach beneath a red rock in the setting sun among beds of crimson poppies and golden asphodel 
8193_116804_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Slowly they sung and sleepily with silver voices mild and clear which stole over the golden waters and into the hearts of all the heroes in spite of Orpheus s song 
8193_116804_000039_000000	train-clean-360	And all things stayed around and listened the gulls sat in white lines along the rocks on the beach great seals lay basking and kept time with lazy heads while silver shoals of fish came up to hearken and whispered as they broke the shining calm 
8193_116804_000039_000001	train-clean-360	The Wind overhead hushed his whistling as he shepherded his clouds toward the west and the clouds stood in mid blue and listened dreaming like a flock of golden sheep 
8193_116804_000040_000000	train-clean-360	And as the heroes listened the oars fell from their hands and their heads drooped on their breasts and they closed their heavy eyes and they dreamed of bright still gardens and of slumbers under murmuring pines till all their toil seemed foolishness and they thought of their renown no more 
8193_116804_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Then one lifted his head suddenly and cried What use in wandering forever 
8193_116804_000041_000001	train-clean-360	Let us stay here and rest awhile And another Let us row to the shore and hear the words they sing And another I care not for the words but for the music 
8193_116804_000041_000002	train-clean-360	They shall sing me to sleep that I may rest 
none	none	And Butes the son of Pandion the fairest of all mortal men leapt out and swam toward the shore crying I come I come fair maidens to live and die here listening to your song 
8193_116804_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Then Medeia clapped her hands together and cried Sing louder Orpheus sing a bolder strain wake up these hapless sluggards or none of them will see the land of Hellas more 
none	none	Then Orpheus lifted his harp and crashed his cunning hand across the strings and his music and his voice rose like a trumpet through the still evening air into the air it rushed like thunder till the rocks rang and the sea and into their souls it rushed like wine till all hearts beat fast within their breasts 
8193_116804_000045_000000	train-clean-360	And he sung the song of Perseus how the Gods led him over land and sea and how he slew the loathly Gorgon and won himself a peerless bride and how he sits now with the Gods upon Olympus a shining star in the sky immortal with his immortal bride and honoured by all men below 
8193_116804_000046_000000	train-clean-360	So Orpheus sang and the Sirens answering each other across the golden sea till Orpheus s voice drowned the Sirens and the heroes caught their oars again 
8193_116804_000047_000000	train-clean-360	And they cried We will be men like Perseus and we will dare and suffer to the last 
8193_116804_000047_000001	train-clean-360	Sing us his song again brave Orpheus that we may forget the Sirens and their spell 
8193_116804_000048_000000	train-clean-360	And as Orpheus sang they dashed their oars into the sea and kept time to his music as they fled fast away and the Sirens voices died behind them in the hissing of the foam along their wake 
none	none	But Butes swam to the shore and knelt down before the Sirens and cried Sing on sing on But he could say no more for a charmed sleep came over him and a pleasant humming in his ears and he sank all along upon the pebbles and forgot all heaven and earth and never looked at that sad beach around him all strewn with the bones of men 
8193_116804_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Then slowly rose up those three fair sisters with a cruel smile upon their lips and slowly they crept down toward him like leopards who creep upon their prey and their hands were like the talons of eagles as they stept across the bones of their victims to enjoy their cruel feast 
none	none	But fairest Aphrodite saw him from the highest Idalian peak and she pitied his youth and his beauty and leapt up from her golden throne and like a falling star she cleft the sky and left a trail of glittering light till she stooped to the Isle of the Sirens and snatched their prey from their claws And she lifted Butes as he lay sleeping and wrapt him in a golden mist and she bore him to the peak of Lilybaeum and he slept there many a pleasant year But when the Sirens saw that they were conquered they shrieked for envy and rage and leapt from the beach into the sea and were changed into rocks until this day Then they came to the straits by Lilybaeum and saw Sicily the three cornered island under which Enceladus the giant lies groaning day and night and when he turns the earth quakes and his breath bursts out in roaring flames from the highest cone of AEtna above the chestnut woods 
8193_116804_000053_000001	train-clean-360	And there Charybdis caught them in its fearful coils of wave and rolled mast high about them and spun them round and round and they could go neither back nor forward while the whirlpool sucked them in 
8193_116804_000054_000000	train-clean-360	And while they struggled they saw near them on the other side of the strait a rock stand in the water with a peak wrapt round in clouds a rock which no man could climb though he had twenty hands and feet for the stone was smooth and slippery as if polished by man s hand and half way up a misty cave looked out toward the west 
none	none	And when Orpheus saw it he groaned and struck his hands together 
8193_116804_000055_000001	train-clean-360	And Little will it help to us he cried to escape the jaws of the whirlpool for in that cave lives Scylla the sea hag with a young whelp s voice my mother warned me of her ere we sailed away from Hellas she has six heads and six long necks and hides in that dark cleft 
8193_116804_000055_000002	train-clean-360	And from her cave she fishes for all things which pass by for sharks and seals and dolphins and all the herds of Amphitrite 
8193_116804_000055_000003	train-clean-360	And never ship s crew boasted that they came safe by her rock for she bends her long necks down to them and every mouth takes up a man And who will help us now 
none	none	For Hera and Zeus hate us and our ship is foul with guilt so we must die whatever befalls 
8193_116804_000056_000000	train-clean-360	Then out of the depths came Thetis Peleus s silver footed bride for love of her gallant husband and all her nymphs around her and they played like snow white dolphins diving on from wave to wave before the ship and in her wake and beside her as dolphins play 
8193_116804_000056_000001	train-clean-360	And they caught the ship and guided her and passed her on from hand to hand and tossed her through the billows as maidens toss the ball 
none	none	And when Scylla stooped to seize her they struck back her ravening heads and foul Scylla whined as a whelp whines at the touch of their gentle hands But she shrank into her cave affrighted for all bad things shrink from good and Argo leapt safe past her while a fair breeze rose behind 
8193_116804_000056_000004	train-clean-360	Then Thetis and her nymphs sank down to their gardens of green and purple where live flowers of bloom all the year round while the heroes went on rejoicing yet dreading what might come next 
8193_116804_000057_000000	train-clean-360	After that they rowed on steadily for many a weary day till they saw a long high island and beyond it a mountain land 
8193_116804_000057_000001	train-clean-360	And they searched till they found a harbour and there rowed boldly in 
8193_116804_000057_000002	train-clean-360	But after awhile they stopped and wondered for there stood a great city on the shore and temples and walls and gardens and castles high in air upon the cliffs And on either side they saw a harbour with a narrow mouth but wide within and black ships without number high and dry upon the shore 
none	none	Then Ancaius the wise helmsman spoke What new wonder is this 
8193_116804_000058_000001	train-clean-360	I know all isles and harbours and the windings of all the seas and this should be Corcyra where a few wild goatherds dwell 
none	none	But whence come these new harbours and vast works of polished stone 
8193_116804_000059_000000	train-clean-360	But Jason said They can be no savage people 
8193_116804_000059_000001	train-clean-360	We will go in and take our chance 
none	none	So they rowed into the harbour among a thousand black beaked ships each larger far than Argo toward a quay of polished stone 
8193_116804_000060_000001	train-clean-360	And they wondered at that mighty city with its roofs of burnished brass and long and lofty walls of marble with strong palisades above 
none	none	And the quays were full of people merchants and mariners and slaves going to and fro with merchandise among the crowd of ships And the heroes hearts were humbled and they looked at each other and said We thought ourselves a gallant crew when we sailed from Iolcos by the sea but how small we look before this city like an ant before a hive of bees Then the sailors hailed them roughly from the quay What men are you we want no strangers here nor pirates 
8193_116804_000062_000001	train-clean-360	We keep our business to ourselves 
8193_116804_000063_000000	train-clean-360	But Jason answered gently with many a flattering word and praised their city and their harbour and their fleet of gallant ships 
8193_116804_000063_000001	train-clean-360	 Surely you are the children of Poseidon and the masters of the sea and we are but poor wandering mariners worn out with thirst and toil 
8193_116804_000063_000002	train-clean-360	Give us but food and water and we will go on our voyage in peace 
8193_116804_000064_000000	train-clean-360	Then the sailors laughed and answered Stranger you are no fool you talk like an honest man and you shall find us honest too 
8193_116804_000064_000001	train-clean-360	We are the children of Poseidon and the masters of the sea but come ashore to us and you shall have the best that we can give 
none	none	So they limped ashore all stiff and weary with long ragged beards and sunburnt cheeks and garments torn and weather stained and weapons rusted with the spray while the sailors laughed at them for they were rough tongued though their hearts were frank and kind 
8193_116804_000065_000001	train-clean-360	And one said These fellows are but raw sailors they look as if they had been sea sick all the day And another Their legs have grown crooked with much rowing till they waddle in their walk like ducks 
8193_116804_000066_000000	train-clean-360	At that Idas the rash would have struck them but Jason held him back till one of the merchant kings spoke to them a tall and stately man 
8193_116804_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Do not be angry strangers the sailor boys must have their jest 
8193_116804_000067_000001	train-clean-360	But we will treat you justly and kindly for strangers and poor men come from God and you seem no common sailors by your strength and height and weapons 
none	none	Come up with me to the palace of Alcinous the rich sea going king and we will feast you well and heartily and after that you shall tell us your name 
8193_116804_000068_000000	train-clean-360	But Medeia hung back and trembled and whispered in Jason s ear We are betrayed and are going to our ruin for I see my countrymen among the crowd dark eyed Colchi in steel mail shirts such as they wear in my father s land 
8193_116804_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 It is too late to turn said Jason 
8193_116804_000069_000001	train-clean-360	And he spoke to the merchant king What country is this good sir and what is this new built town 
8193_116804_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 This is the land of the Phaeaces beloved by all the Immortals for they come hither and feast like friends with us and sit by our side in the hall 
8193_116804_000070_000001	train-clean-360	Hither we came from Liburnia to escape the unrighteous Cyclopes for they robbed us peaceful merchants of our hard earned wares and wealth 
none	none	So Nausithous the son of Poseidon brought us hither and died in peace and now his son Alcinous rules us and Arete the wisest of queens So they went up across the square and wondered still more as they went for along the quays lay in order great cables and yards and masts before the fair temple of Poseidon the blue haired king of the seas And round the square worked the shipwrights as many in number as ants twining ropes and hewing timber and smoothing long yards and oars And the Minuai went on in silence through clean white marble streets till they came to the hall of Alcinous and they wondered then still more For the lofty palace shone aloft in the sun with walls of plated brass from the threshold to the innermost chamber and the doors were of silver and gold And on each side of the doorway sat living dogs of gold who never grew old or died so well Hephaistus had made them in his forges in smoking Lemnos and gave them to Alcinous to guard his gates by night 
8193_116804_000071_000003	train-clean-360	And within against the walls stood thrones on either side down the whole length of the hall strewn with rich glossy shawls and on them the merchant kings of those crafty sea roving Phaeaces sat eating and drinking in pride and feasting there all the year round 
8193_116804_000071_000004	train-clean-360	And boys of molten gold stood each on a polished altar and held torches in their hands to give light all night to the guests 
8193_116804_000071_000005	train-clean-360	And round the house sat fifty maid servants some grinding the meal in the mill some turning the spindle some weaving at the loom while their hands twinkled as they passed the shuttle like quivering aspen leaves 
8193_116804_000072_000000	train-clean-360	And outside before the palace a great garden was walled round filled full of stately fruit trees with olives and sweet figs and pomegranates pears and apples which bore the whole year round 
8193_116804_000072_000001	train-clean-360	For the rich southwest wind fed them till pear grew ripe on pear fig on fig and grape on grape all the winter and the spring 
none	none	And at the further end gay flower beds bloomed through all seasons of the year and two fair fountains rose and ran one through the garden grounds and one beneath the palace gate to water all the town Such noble gifts the heavens had given to Alcinous the wise So they went in and saw him sitting like Poseidon on his throne with his golden sceptre by him in garments stiff with gold and in his hand a sculptured goblet as he pledged the merchant kings and beside him stood Arete his wise and lovely queen and leaned against a pillar as she spun her golden threads 
8193_116805_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Then Alcinous rose and welcomed them and bade them sit and eat and the servants brought them tables and bread and meat and wine 
none	none	But Medeia went on trembling toward Arete the fair queen and fell at her knees and clasped them and cried weeping as she knelt
8193_116805_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 I am your guest fair queen and I entreat you be Zeus from whom prayers come 
8193_116805_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Do not send me back to my father to die some dreadful death but let me go my way and bear my burden 
8193_116805_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Have I not had enough of punishment and shame 
8193_116805_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Who are you strange maiden 
8193_116805_000005_000001	train-clean-360	and what is the meaning of your prayer 
none	none	I am Medeia daughter of Aietes and I saw my countrymen here to day and I know that they are come to find me and take me home to die some dreadful death Then Arete frowned and said Lead this girl in my maidens and let the kings decide not I And Alcinous leapt up from his throne and cried Speak strangers who are you And who is this maiden
8193_116805_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 We are the heroes of the Minuai said Jason and this maiden has spoken truth 
8193_116805_000009_000001	train-clean-360	We are the men who took the golden fleece the men whose fame has run round every shore 
none	none	We came hither out of the ocean after sorrows such as man never saw before 
8193_116805_000009_000003	train-clean-360	We went out many and come back few for many a noble comrade have we lost 
8193_116805_000009_000004	train-clean-360	So let us go as you should let your guests go in peace that the world may say Alcinous is a just king 
8193_116805_000010_000000	train-clean-360	But Alcinous frowned and stood deep in thought and at last he spoke 
none	none	Had not the deed been done which is done I should have said this day to myself It is an honour to Alcinous and to his children after him that the far famed Argonauts are his guests But these Colchi are my guests as you are and for this month they have waited here with all their fleet for they have hunted all the seas of Hellas and could not find you and dared neither go further nor go home
8193_116805_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Let them choose out their champions and we will fight them man for man 
8193_116805_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 No guest of ours shall fight upon our island and if you go outside they will outnumber you 
8193_116805_000013_000001	train-clean-360	I will do justice between you for I know and do what is right 
8193_116805_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Then he turned to his kings and said This may stand over till to morrow 
8193_116805_000014_000001	train-clean-360	To night we will feast our guests and hear the story of all their wanderings and how they came hither out of the ocean 
none	none	So Alcinous bade the servants take the heroes in and bathe them and give them clothes 
8193_116805_000015_000001	train-clean-360	And they were glad when they saw the warm water for it was long since they had bathed 
8193_116805_000015_000002	train-clean-360	And they washed off the sea salt from their limbs and anointed themselves from head to foot with oil and combed out their golden hair 
8193_116805_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Then they came back again into the hall while the merchant kings rose up to do them honour 
8193_116805_000015_000004	train-clean-360	And each man said to his neighbour No wonder that these men won fame 
none	none	How they stand now like Giants or Titans or Immortals come down from Olympus though many a winter has worn them and many a fearful storm What must they have been when they sailed from Iolcos in the bloom of their youth long ago 
8193_116805_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Then they went out to the garden and the merchant princes said Heroes run races with us 
8193_116805_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Let us see whose feet are nimblest 
none	none	We cannot race against you for our limbs are stiff from sea and we have lost our two swift comrades the sons of the north wind 
8193_116805_000017_000001	train-clean-360	But do not think us cowards if you wish to try our strength we will shoot and box and wrestle against any men on earth 
8193_116805_000030_000000	train-clean-360	And Alcinous smiled 
8193_116805_000018_000000	train-clean-360	And Alcinous smiled and answered I believe you gallant guests with your long limbs and broad shoulders we could never match you here 
8193_116805_000018_000001	train-clean-360	For we care nothing here for boxing or for shooting with the bow but for feasts and songs and harping and dancing and running races to stretch our limbs on shore 
8193_116805_000019_000000	train-clean-360	So they danced there and ran races the jolly merchant kings till the night fell and all went in 
8193_116805_000020_000000	train-clean-360	And then they ate and drank and comforted their weary souls till Alcinous called a herald and bade him go and fetch the harper 
8193_116805_000021_000000	train-clean-360	The herald went out and fetched the harper and led him in by the hand and Alcinous cut him a piece of meat from the fattest of the haunch and sent it to him and said Sing to us noble harper and rejoice the heroes hearts 
8193_116805_000022_000000	train-clean-360	So the harper played and sang while the dancers danced strange figures and after that the tumblers showed their tricks till the heroes laughed again 
none	none	Then Tell me heroes asked Alcinous you who have sailed the ocean round and seen the manners of all nations have you seen such dancers as ours here 
8193_116805_000023_000001	train-clean-360	or heard such music and such singing 
8193_116805_000023_000002	train-clean-360	We hold ours to be the best on earth 
8193_116805_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Such dancing we have never seen said Orpheus and your singer is a happy man for Phoebus himself must have taught him or else he is the son of a Muse as I am also and have sung once or twice though not so well as he 
none	none	Sing to us then noble stranger said Alcinous and we will give you precious gifts So Orpheus took his magic harp and sang to them a stirring song of their voyage from Iolcos and their dangers and how they won the golden fleece and of Medeia s love and how she helped them and went with them over land and sea and of all their fearful dangers from monsters and rocks and storms till the heart of Arete was softened and all the women wept And the merchant kings rose up each man from off his golden throne and clasped their hands and shouted Hail to the noble Argonauts who sailed the unknown seal 
8193_116805_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Then he went on and told their journey over the sluggish northern main and through the shoreless outer ocean to the fairy island of the West and of the Sirens and Scylla and Charybdis and all the wonders they had seen till midnight passed and the day dawned but the kings never thought of sleep 
8193_116805_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Each man sat still and listened with his chin upon his hand 
none	none	And at last when Orpheus had ended they all went thoughtful out and the heroes lay down to sleep beneath the sounding porch outside where Arete had strewn them rugs and carpets in the sweet still summer night But Arete pleaded hard with her husband for Medeia for her heart was softened 
8193_116805_000029_000001	train-clean-360	And she said The Gods will punish her not we 
8193_116805_000029_000002	train-clean-360	After all she is our guest and my suppliant and prayers are the daughters of Zeus 
8193_116805_000029_000003	train-clean-360	And who too dare part man and wife after all they have endured together 
none	none	And Alcinous smiled
8193_116805_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 The minstrel s song has charmed you but I must remember what is right for songs cannot alter justice and I must be faithful to my name 
none	none	Alcinous I am called the man of sturdy sense and Alcinous I will be But for all that Arete besought him until she won him round 
8193_116805_000031_000000	train-clean-360	So next morning he sent a herald and called the kings into the square and said This is a puzzling matter remember but one thing 
none	none	These Minuai live close by us and we may meet them often on the seas but Aietes lives afar off and we have only heard his name 
8193_116805_000031_000002	train-clean-360	Which then of the two is it safer to offend the men near us or the men far off 
8193_116805_000032_000000	train-clean-360	The princes laughed and praised his wisdom and Alcinous called the heroes to the square and the Colchi also and they came and stood opposite each other but Medeia stayed in the palace 
8193_116805_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Then Alcinous spoke Heroes of the Colchi what is your errand about this lady 
8193_116805_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 To carry her home with us that she may die a shameful death but if we return without her we must die the death she should have died 
none	none	What say you to this Jason the AEolid said Alcinous turning to the Minuai
8193_116805_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I say said the cunning Jason that they are come here on a bootless errand 
8193_116805_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Do you think that you can make her follow you heroes of the Colchi 
none	none	her who knows all spells and charms She will cast away your ships on quicksands or call down on you Brimo the wild huntress or the chains will fall from off her wrists and she will escape in her dragon car or if not thus some other way for she has a thousand plans and wiles 
8193_116805_000035_000004	train-clean-360	And why return home at all brave heroes and face the long seas again and the Bosphorus and the stormy Euxine and double all your toil 
8193_116805_000035_000005	train-clean-360	There is many a fair land round these coasts which waits for gallant men like you 
none	none	Better to settle there and build a city and let Aietes and Colchis help themselves Then a murmur rose among the Colchi and some cried He has spoken well and some We have had enough of roving we will sail the seas no more And the chief said at last Be it so then a plague she has been to us and a plague to the house of her father and a plague she will be to you 
8193_116805_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Take her since you are no wiser and we will sail away toward the north 
8193_116805_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Then Alcinous gave them food and water and garments and rich presents of all sorts and he gave the same to the Minuai and sent them all away in peace 
8193_116805_000038_000000	train-clean-360	So Jason kept the dark witch maiden to breed him woe and shame and the Colchi went northward into the Adriatic and settled and built towns along the shore 
none	none	Then the heroes rowed away to the eastward to reach Hellas their beloved land but a storm came down upon them and swept them far away toward the south 
8193_116805_000039_000001	train-clean-360	And they rowed till they were spent with struggling through the darkness and the blinding rain but where they were they could not tell and they gave up all hope of life 
8193_116805_000039_000002	train-clean-360	And at last they touched the ground and when daylight came they waded to the shore and saw nothing round but sand and desolate salt pools for they had come to the quicksands of the Syrtis and the dreary treeless flats which lie between Numidia and Cyrene on the burning shore of Africa 
8193_116805_000039_000003	train-clean-360	And there they wandered starving for many a weary day ere they could launch their ship again and gain the open sea 
8193_116805_000039_000004	train-clean-360	And there Canthus was killed while he was trying to drive off sheep by a stone which a herdsman threw 
8193_116805_000040_000000	train-clean-360	And there too Mopsus died the seer who knew the voices of all birds but he could not foretell his own end for he was bitten in the foot by a snake one of those which sprang from the Gorgon s head when Perseus carried it across the sands 
8193_116805_000041_000000	train-clean-360	At last they rowed away toward the northward for many a weary day till their water was spent and their food eaten and they were worn out with hunger and thirst 
none	none	But at last they saw a long steep island and a blue peak high among the clouds and they knew it for the peak of Ida and the famous land of Crete And they said We will land in Crete and see Minos the just king and all his glory and his wealth at least he will treat us hospitably and let us fill our water casks upon the shore 
8193_116805_000042_000000	train-clean-360	But when they came nearer to the island they saw a wondrous sight upon the cliffs 
8193_116805_000042_000001	train-clean-360	For on a cape to the westward stood a giant taller than any mountain pine who glittered aloft against the sky like a tower of burnished brass 
8193_116805_000042_000002	train-clean-360	He turned and looked on all sides round him till he saw the Argo and her crew and when he saw them he came toward them more swiftly than the swiftest horse leaping across the glens at a bound and striding at one step from down to down 
8193_116805_000042_000003	train-clean-360	And when he came abreast of them he brandished his arms up and down as a ship hoists and lowers her yards and shouted with his brazen throat like a trumpet from off the hills You are pirates you are robbers 
8193_116805_000042_000004	train-clean-360	If you dare land here you die 
none	none	Then the heroes cried We are no pirates 
8193_116805_000043_000001	train-clean-360	We are all good men and true and all we ask is food and water but the giant cried the more 
8193_116805_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 You are robbers you are pirates all I know you and if you land you shall die the death 
8193_116805_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Then he waved his arms again as a signal and they saw the people flying inland driving their flocks before them while a great flame arose among the hills 
8193_116805_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Then the giant ran up a valley and vanished and the heroes lay on their oars in fear 
8193_116805_000046_000000	train-clean-360	But Medeia stood watching all from under her steep black brows with a cunning smile upon her lips and a cunning plot within her heart 
8193_116805_000046_000001	train-clean-360	At last she spoke I know this giant 
none	none	I heard of him in the East Hephaistos the Fire King made him in his forge in AEtna beneath the earth and called him Talus and gave him to Minos for a servant to guard the coast of Crete 
8193_116805_000046_000003	train-clean-360	Thrice a day he walks round the island and never stops to sleep and if strangers land he leaps into his furnace which flames there among the hills and when he is red hot he rushes on them and burns them in his brazen hands 
8193_116805_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Then all the heroes cried What shall we do wise Medeia 
8193_116805_000047_000001	train-clean-360	We must have water or we die of thirst 
8193_116805_000047_000002	train-clean-360	Flesh and blood we can face fairly but who can face this red hot brass 
8193_116805_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 I can face red hot brass if the tale I hear be true 
8193_116805_000048_000001	train-clean-360	For they say that he has but one vein in all his body filled with liquid fire and that this vein is closed with a nail but I know not where that nail is placed 
8193_116805_000048_000002	train-clean-360	But if I can get it once into these hands you shall water your ship here in peace 
8193_116805_000049_000000	train-clean-360	Then she bade them put her on shore and row off again and wait what would befall 
8193_116805_000050_000000	train-clean-360	And the heroes obeyed her unwillingly for they were ashamed to leave her so alone but Jason said She is dearer to me than to any of you yet I will trust her freely on shore she has more plots than we can dream of in the windings of that fair and cunning head 
8193_116805_000051_000000	train-clean-360	So they left the witch maiden on the shore and she stood there in her beauty all alone till the giant strode back red hot from head to heel while the grass hissed and smoked beneath his tread 
8193_116805_000052_000000	train-clean-360	And when he saw the maiden alone he stopped and she looked boldly up into his face without moving and began her magic song 
8193_116805_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Life is short though life is sweet and even men of brass and fire must die 
8193_116805_000053_000001	train-clean-360	The brass must rust the fire must cool for time gnaws all things in their turn 
8193_116805_000053_000002	train-clean-360	Life is short though life is sweet but sweeter to live forever sweeter to live ever youthful like the Gods who have ichor in their veins ichor which gives life and youth and joy and a bounding heart 
8193_116805_000054_000000	train-clean-360	Then Talus said Who are you strange maiden and where is this ichor of youth 
8193_116805_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Then Medeia held up a flask of crystal and said Here is the ichor of youth 
8193_116805_000055_000001	train-clean-360	I am Medeia the enchantress my sister Circe gave me this and said Go and reward Talus the faithful servant for his fame is gone out into all lands So come and I will pour this into your veins that you may live forever young 
none	none	And he listened to her false words that simple Talus and came near and Medeia said Dip yourself in the sea first and cool yourself lest you burn my tender hands then show me where the nail in your vein is that I may pour the ichor in 
8193_116805_000057_000000	train-clean-360	Then that simple Talus dipped himself in the sea till it hissed and roared and smoked and came and knelt before Medeia and showed her the secret nail 
8193_116805_000058_000000	train-clean-360	And she drew the nail out gently but she poured no ichor in and instead the liquid fire spouted forth like a stream of red hot iron And Talus tried to leap up crying You have betrayed me false witch maiden 
8193_116805_000058_000001	train-clean-360	But she lifted up her hands before him and sang till he sank beneath her spell 
8193_116805_000058_000002	train-clean-360	And as he sank his brazen limbs clanked heavily and the earth groaned beneath his weight and the liquid fire ran from his heel like a stream of lava to the sea and Medeia laughed and called to the heroes Come ashore and water your ship in peace 
8193_116805_000059_000000	train-clean-360	So they came and found the giant lying dead and they fell down and kissed Medeia s feet and watered their ship and took sheep and oxen and so left that inhospitable shore 
8193_116805_000060_000000	train-clean-360	At last after many more adventures they came to the Cape of Malea at the southwest point of the Peloponnese 
8193_116805_000060_000001	train-clean-360	And there they offered sacrifices and Orpheus purged them from their guilt 
none	none	Then they rowed away again to the northward past the Laconian shore and came all worn and tired by Sunium and up the long Euboean Strait until they saw once more Pelion and Aphetai and Iolcos by the sea 
8193_116805_000061_000000	train-clean-360	And they ran the ship ashore but they had no strength left to haul her up the beach and they crawled out on the pebbles and sat down and wept till they could weep no more 
none	none	For the houses and the trees were all altered and all the faces which they saw were strange and their joy was swallowed up in sorrow while they thought of their youth and all their labour and the gallant comrades they had lost And the people crowded round and asked them Who are you that you sit weeping here We are the sons of your princes who sailed out many a year ago 
8193_116805_000063_000001	train-clean-360	We went to fetch the golden fleece and we have brought it and grief therewith 
none	none	Give us news of our fathers and our mothers if any of them be left alive on earth Then there was shouting and laughing and weeping and all the kings came to the shore and they led away the heroes to their homes and bewailed the valiant dead 
8193_116805_000065_000000	train-clean-360	Then Jason went up with Medeia to the palace of his uncle Pelias 
8193_116805_000065_000001	train-clean-360	And when he came in Pelias sat by the hearth crippled and blind with age while opposite him sat AEson Jason s father crippled and blind likewise and the two old men s heads shook together as they tried to warm themselves before the fire 
8193_116805_000066_000000	train-clean-360	And Jason fell down at his father s knees and wept and called him by his name 
8193_116805_000066_000001	train-clean-360	And the old man stretched his hands out and felt him and said Do not mock me young hero 
8193_116805_000066_000002	train-clean-360	My son Jason is dead long ago at sea 
none	none	I am your own son Jason whom you trusted to the Centaur upon Pelion and I have brought home the golden fleece and a princess of the Sun s race for my bride 
8193_116805_000067_000001	train-clean-360	So now give me up the kingdom Pelias my uncle and fulfil your promise as I have fulfilled mine 
8193_116805_000068_000000	train-clean-360	Then his father clung to him like a child and wept and would not let him go and cried Now I shall not go down lonely to my grave 
none	none	Promise me never to leave me till I die PART VI What Was the End of the Heroes And now I wish that I could end my story pleasantly but it is no fault of mine that I cannot The old songs end it sadly and I believe that they are right and wise for though the heroes were purified at Malea yet sacrifices cannot make bad hearts good and Jason had taken a wicked wife and he had to bear his burden to the last And first she laid a cunning plot to punish that poor old Pelias instead of letting him die in peace For she told his daughters I can make old things young again I will show you how easy it is to do So she took an old ram and killed him and put him in a cauldron with magic herbs and whispered her spells over him and he leapt out again a young lamb So that Medeia s cauldron is a proverb still by which we mean times of war and change when the world has become old and feeble and grows young again through bitter pains Then she said to Pelias s daughters Do to your father as I did to this ram and he will grow young and strong again But she only told them half the spell so they failed while Medeia mocked them and poor old Pelias died and his daughters came to misery But the songs say she cured AEson Jason s father and he became young and strong again But Jason could not love her after all her cruel deeds So he was ungrateful to her and wronged her and she revenged herself on him And a terrible revenge she took too terrible to speak of here But you will hear of it yourselves when you grow up for it has been sung in noble poetry and music and whether it be true or not it stands forever as a warning to us not to seek for help from evil persons or to gain good ends by evil means For if we use an adder even against our enemies it will turn again and sting us But of all the other heroes there is many a brave tale left which I have no space to tell you so you must read them for yourselves of the hunting of the boar in Calydon which Meleager killed and of Heracles s twelve famous labours and of the seven who fought at Thebes and of the noble love of Castor and Polydeuces the twin Dioscouroi how when one died the other would not live without him so they shared their immortality between them and Zeus changed them into the two twin stars which never rise both at once And what became of Cheiron the good immortal beast That too is a sad story for the heroes never saw him more He was wounded by a poisoned arrow at Pholoc among the hills when Heracles opened the fatal wine jar which Cheiron had warned him not to touch And the Centaurs smelt the wine and flocked to it and fought for it with Heracles but he killed them all with his poisoned arrows and Cheiron was left alone Then Cheiron took up one of the arrows and dropped it by chance upon his foot and the poison ran like fire along his veins and he lay down and longed to die and cried Through wine I perish the bane of all my race Why should I live forever in this agony Who will take my immortality that I may die Then Prometheus answered the good Titan whom Heracles had set free from Caucasus I will take your immortality and live forever that I may help poor mortal men So Cheiron gave him his immortality and died and had rest from pain And Heracles and Prometheus wept over him and went to bury him on Pelion but Zeus took him up among the stars to live forever grand and mild low down in the far southern sky And in time the heroes died all but Nestor the silver tongued old man and left behind them valiant sons but not so great as they had been Yet their fame too lives till this day for they fought at the ten years siege of Troy and their story is in the book which we call Homer in two of the noblest songs on earth the Iliad which tells us of the siege of Troy and Achilles s quarrel with the kings and the Odyssey which tells the wanderings of Odysseus through many lands for many years and how Alcinous sent him home at last safe to Ithaca his beloved island and to Penelope his faithful wife and Telemachus his son and Euphorbus the noble swineherd and the old dog who licked his hand and died CHAPTER XI THE GIANT BUILDER Ages and ages ago when the world was first made the gods decided to build a beautiful city high above the heavens the most glorious and wonderful city that ever was known Asgard was to be its name and it was to stand on Ida Plain under the shade of Yggdrasil the great tree whose roots were underneath the earth First of all they built a house with a silver roof where there were seats for all the twelve chiefs In the midst and high above the rest was the wonder throne of Odin the All Father whence he could see everything that happened in the sky or on the earth or in the sea Next they made a fair house for Queen Frigg and her lovely daughters Then they built a smithy with its great hammers tongs anvils and bellows where the gods could work at their favourite trade the making of beautiful things out of gold which they did so well that folk name that time the Golden Age Afterward as they had more leisure they built separate houses for all the AEsir each more beautiful than the preceding for of course they were continually growing more skilful They saved Father Odin s palace until the last for they meant this to be the largest and the most splendid of all Gladsheim the home of joy was the name of Odin s house and it was built all of gold set in the midst of a wood whereof the trees had leaves of ruddy gold like an autumn gilded forest For the safety of All Father it was surrounded by a roaring river and by a high picket fence and there was a great courtyard within The glory of Gladsheim was its wondrous hall radiant with gold the most lovely room that time has ever seen Valhalla the Hall of Heroes was the name of it and it was roofed with the mighty shields of warriors The ceiling was made of interlacing spears and there was a portal at the west end before which hung a great gray wolf while over him a fierce eagle hovered The hall was so huge that it had five hundred forty gates through each of which eight hundred men could march abreast Indeed there needed to be room for this was the hall where every morning Odin received all the brave warriors who had died in battle on the earth below and there were many heroes in those days This was the reward which the gods gave to courage When a hero had gloriously lost his life the Valkyries the nine warrior daughters of Odin brought his body up to Valhalla on their white horses that gallop the clouds There they lived forever after in happiness enjoying the things that they had most loved upon earth Every morning they armed themselves and went out to fight with one another in the great courtyard It was a wondrous game wondrously played No matter how often a hero was killed he became alive again in time to return perfectly well to Valhalla where he ate a delicious breakfast with the Jisir while the beautiful Valkyries who had first brought him thither waited at table and poured the blessed mead which only the immortal taste A happy life it was for the heroes and a happy life for all who dwelt in Asgard for this was before trouble had come among the gods following the mischief of Loki This is how the trouble began From the beginning of time the giants had been unfriendly to the AEsir because the giants were older and huger and more wicked besides they were jealous because the good AEsir were fast gaining more wisdom and power than the giants had ever known It was the AEsir who set the fair brother and sister Sun and Moon in the sky to give light to men and it was they also who made the jewelled stars out of sparks from the place of fire The giants hated the AEsir and tried all in their power to injure them and the men of the earth below whom the AEsir loved and cared for The gods had already built a wall around Midgard the world of men to keep the giants out built it of the bushy eyebrows of Ymir the oldest and hugest of giants Between Asgard and the giants flowed Ifing the great river on which ice never formed and which the gods crossed on the rainbow bridge But this was not protection enough Their beautiful new city needed a fortress So the word went forth in Asgard We must build us a fortress against the giants the hugest strongest finest fortress that ever was built Now one day soon after they had announced this decision there came a mighty man stalking up the rainbow bridge that led to Asgard city Who goes there cried Heimdal the watchman whose eyes were so keen that he could see for a hundred miles around and whose ears were so sharp that he could hear the grass growing in the meadow and the wool on the backs of the sheep Who goes there No one can enter Asgard if I say no I am a builder said the stranger who was a huge fellow with sleeves rolled up to show the iron muscles of his arms I am a builder of strong towers and I have heard that the folk of Asgard need one to help them raise a fair fortress in their city Heimdal looked at the stranger narrowly for there was that about him which his sharp eyes did not like But he made no answer only blew on his golden horn which was so loud that it sounded through all the world At this signal all the AEsir came running to the rainbow bridge from wherever they happened to be to find out who was coming to Asgard For it was Heimdal s duty ever to warn them of the approach of the unknown This fellow says he is a builder quoth Heimdal And he would fain build us a fortress in the city Ay that I would nodded the stranger Look at my iron arm look at my broad back look at my shoulders Am I not the workman you need Truly he is a mighty figure vowed Odin looking at him approvingly How long will it take you alone to build our fortress We can allow but one stranger at a time within our city for safety s sake In three half years replied the stranger I will undertake to build for you a castle so strong that not even the giants should they swarm hither over Midgard not even they could enter without your leave Aha cried Father Odin well pleased at this offer And what reward do you ask friend for help so timely The stranger hummed and hawed and pulled his long beard while he thought Then he spoke suddenly as if the idea had just come into his mind I will name my price friends he said a small price for so great a deed I ask you to give me Freia for my wife and those two sparkling jewels the Sun and Moon At this demand the gods looked grave for Freia was their dearest treasure She was the most beautiful maid who ever lived the light and life of heaven and if she should leave Asgard joy would go with her while the Sun and Moon were the light and life of the AEsir s children men who lived in the little world below But Loki the sly whispered that they would be safe enough if they made another condition on their part so hard that the builder could not fulfil it After thinking cautiously he spoke for them all Mighty man quoth he we are willing to agree to your price upon one condition It is too long a time that you ask we cannot wait three half years for our castle that is equal to three centuries when one is in a hurry See that you finish the fort without help in one winter one short winter and you shall have fair Freia with the Sun and Moon But if on the first day of summer one stone is wanting to the walls or if anyone has given you aid in the building then your reward is lost and you shall depart without payment So spoke Loki in the name of all the gods but the plan was his own At first the stranger shook his head and frowned saying that in so short a time no one unaided could complete the undertaking At last he made another offer Let me have but my good horse to help me and I will try he urged Let me bring the useful Svadilfoeri with me to the task and I will finish the work in one winter of short days or lose my reward Surely you will not deny me this little help from one four footed friend Then again the AEsir consulted and the wiser of them were doubtful whether it were best to accept the stranger s offer so strangely made But again Loki urged them to accept Surely there is no harm he said Even with his old horse to help him he cannot build the castle in the promised time We shall gain a fortress without trouble and with never a price to pay Loki was so eager that although the other AEsir did not like this crafty way of making bargains they finally consented Then in the presence of the heroes with the Valkyries and Mimer s head for witnesses the stranger and the AEsir gave solemn promise that the bargain should be kept On the first day of winter the strange builder began his work and wondrous was the way he set about it His strength seemed as the strength of a hundred men As for his horse Svadilfoeri he did more work by half than even the mighty builder In the night he dragged the enormous rocks that were to be used in building the castle rocks as big as mountains of the earth while in the daytime the stranger piled them into place with his iron arms The AEsir watched him with amazement never was seen such strength in Asgard Neither Tyr the stout nor Thor the strong could match the power of the stranger The gods began to look at one another uneasily Who was this mighty one who had come among them and what if after all he should win his reward Freia trembled in her palace and the Sun and Moon grew dim with fear Still the work went on and the fort was piling higher and higher by day and by night There were but three days left before the end of winter and already the building was so tall and so strong that it was safe from the attacks of any giant The AEsir were delighted with their fine new castle but their pride was dimmed by the fear that it must be paid for at all too costly a price For only the gateway remained to be completed and unless the stranger should fail to finish that in the next three days they must give him Freia with the Sun and Moon The AEsir held a meeting upon Ida Plain a meeting full of fear and anger At last they realised what they had done they had made a bargain with one of the giants their enemies and if he won the prize it would mean sorrow and darkness in heaven and upon earth How did we happen to agree to so mad a bargain they asked one another Who suggested the wicked plan which bids fair to cost us all that we most cherish Then they remembered that it was Loki who had made the plan it was he who had insisted that it be carried out and they blamed him for all the trouble It is your counsels Loki that have brought this danger upon us quoth Father Odin frowning You chose the way of guile which is not our way It now remains for you to help us by guile if you can But if you cannot save for us Freia and the Sun and Moon you shall die This is my word All the other AEsir agreed that this was just Thor alone was away hunting evil demons at the other end of the world so he did not know what was going on and what dangers were threatening Asgard Loki was much frightened at the word of All Father It was my fault he cried but how was I to know that he was a giant He had disguised himself so that he seemed but a strong man And as for his horse it looks much like that of other folk If it were not for the horse he could not finish the work Ha I have a thought The builder shall not finish the gate the giant shall not receive his payment I will cheat the fellow Now it was the last night of winter and there remained but a few stones to put in place on the top of the wondrous gateway The giant was sure of his prize and chuckled to himself as he went out with his horse to drag the remaining stones for he did not know that the AEsir had guessed at last who he was and that Loki was plotting to outwit him Hardly had he gone to work when out of the wood came running a pretty little mare who neighed to Svadilfoeri as if inviting the tired horse to leave his work and come to the green fields for a holiday Svadilfoeri you must remember had been working hard all winter with never a sight of four footed creature of his kind and he was very lonesome and tired of dragging stones Giving a snort of disobedience off he ran after this new friend toward the grassy meadows Off went the giant after him howling with rage and running for dear life as he saw not only his horse but his chance of success slipping out of reach It was a mad chase and all Asgard thundered with the noise of galloping hoofs and the giant s mighty tread The mare who raced ahead was Loki in disguise and he led Svadilfoeri far out of reach to a hidden meadow that he knew so that the giant howled and panted up and down all night long without catching even a sight of his horse Now when the morning came the gateway was still unfinished and night and winter had ended at the same hour The giant s time was over and he had forfeited his reward The AEsir came flocking to the gateway and how they laughed and triumphed when they found three stones wanting to complete the gate You have failed fellow judged Father Odin sternly and no price shall we pay for work that is still undone You have failed Leave Asgard quickly we have seen all we want of you and of your race Then the giant knew that he was discovered and he was mad with rage It was a trick he bellowed assuming his own proper form which was huge as a mountain and towered high beside the fortress that he had built It was a wicked trick You shall pay for this in one way or another I cannot tear down the castle which ungrateful ones I have built you stronger than the strength of any giant But I will demolish the rest of your shining city Indeed he would have done so in his mighty rage but at this moment Thor whom Heimdal had called from the end of the earth by one blast of the golden horn came rushing to the rescue drawn in his chariot of goats Thor jumped to the ground close beside the giant and before that huge fellow knew what had happened his head was rolling upon the ground at Father Odin s feet for with one blow Thor had put an end to the giant s wickedness and had saved Asgard This is the reward you deserve Thor cried Not Freia nor the Sun and Moon but the death that I have in store for all the enemies of the AEsir In this extraordinary way the noble city of Asgard was made safe and complete by the addition of a fortress which no one not even the giant who built it could injure it was so wonder strong But always at the top of the gate were lacking three great stones that no one was mighty enough to lift This was a reminder to the AEsir that now they had the race of giants for their everlasting enemies And though Loki s trick had saved them Freia and for the world the Sun and Moon it was the beginning of trouble in Asgard which lasted as long as Loki lived to make mischief with his guile CHAPTER XII HOW ODIN LOST HIS EYE In the beginning of things before there was any world or sun moon and stars there were the giants for these were the oldest creatures that ever breathed They lived in Jotunheim the land of frost and darkness and their hearts were evil Next came the gods the good AEsir who made earth and sky and sea and who dwelt in Asgard above the heavens Then were created the queer little dwarfs who lived underground in the caverns of the mountains working at their mines of metal and precious stones Last of all the gods made men to dwell in Midgard the good world that we know between which and the glorious home of the AEsir stretched Bifroest the bridge of rainbows In those days folk say there was a mighty ash tree named Yggdrasil so vast that its branches shaded the whole earth and stretched up into heaven where the AEsir dwelt while its roots sank far down below the lowest depth In the branches of the big ash tree lived a queer family of creatures First there was a great eagle who was wiser than any bird that ever lived except the two ravens Thought and Memory who sat upon Father Odin s shoulders and told him the secrets which they learned in their flight over the wide world Near the great eagle perched a hawk and four antlered deer browsed among the buds of Yggdrasil At the foot of the tree coiled a huge serpent who was always gnawing hungrily at its roots with a whole colony of little snakes to keep him company so many that they could never be counted The eagle at the top of the tree and the serpent at its foot were enemies always saying hard things of each other Between the two skipped up and down a little squirrel a tale bearer and a gossip who repeated each unkind remark and like the malicious neighbour that he was kept their quarrel ever fresh and green In one place at the roots of Yggdrasil was a fair fountain called the Urdar well where the three Norn maidens who knew the past present and future dwelt with their pets the two white swans This was magic water in the fountain which the Norns sprinkled every day upon the giant tree to keep it green water so sacred that everything which entered it became white as the film of an eggshell Close beside this sacred well the AEsir had their council hall to which they galloped every morning over the rainbow bridge But Father Odin the king of all the AEsir knew of another fountain more wonderful still the two ravens whom he sent forth to bring him news had told him This also was below the roots of Yggdrasil in the spot where the sky and ocean met Here for centuries and centuries the giant Mimer had sat keeping guard over his hidden well in the bottom of which lay such a treasure of wisdom as was to be found nowhere else in the world Every morning Mimer dipped his glittering horn Gioell into the fountain and drew out a draught of the wondrous water which he drank to make him wise Every day he grew wiser and wiser and as this had been going on ever since the beginning of things you can scarcely imagine how wise Mimer was Now it did not seem right to Father Odin that a giant should have all this wisdom to himself for the giants were the enemies of the AEsir and the wisdom which they had been hoarding for ages before the gods were made was generally used for evil purposes Moreover Odin longed and longed to become the wisest being in the world So he resolved to win a draught from Mimer s well if in any way that could be done One night when the sun had set behind the mountains of Midgard Odin put on his broad brimmed hat and his striped cloak and taking his famous staff in his hand trudged down the long bridge to where it ended by Mimer s secret grotto Good day Mimer said Odin entering I have come for a drink from your well The giant was sitting with his knees drawn up to his chin his long white beard falling over his folded arms and his head nodding for Mimer was very old and he often fell asleep while watching over his precious spring He woke with a frown at Odin s words You want a drink from my well do you he growled Hey I let no one drink from my well Nevertheless you must let me have a draught from your glittering horn insisted Odin and I will pay you for it Oho you will pay me for it will you echoed Mimer eyeing his visitor keenly For now that he was wide awake his wisdom taught him that this was no ordinary stranger What will you pay for a drink from my well and why do you wish it so much I can see with my eyes all that goes on in heaven and upon earth said Odin but I cannot see into the depths of ocean I lack the hidden wisdom of the deep the wit that lies at the bottom of your fountain My ravens tell me many secrets but I would know all And as for payment ask what you will and I will pledge anything in return for the draught of wisdom Then Mimer s keen glance grew keener You are Odin of the race of gods he cried We giants are centuries older than you and our wisdom which we have treasured during these ages when we were the only creatures in all space is a precious thing If I grant you a draught from my well you will become as one of us a wise and dangerous enemy It is a goodly price Odin which I shall demand for a boon so great Now Odin was growing impatient for the sparkling water Ask your price he frowned I have promised that I will pay What say you then to leaving one of those far seeing eyes of yours at the bottom of my well asked Mimer hoping that he would refuse the bargain This is the only payment I will take Odin hesitated It was indeed a heavy price and one that he could ill afford for he was proud of his noble beauty But he glanced at the magic fountain bubbling mysteriously in the shadow and he knew that he must have the draught Give me the glittering horn he answered I pledge you my eye for a draught to the brim Very unwillingly Mimer filled the horn from the fountain of wisdom and handed it to Odin Drink then he said drink and grow wise This hour is the beginning of trouble between your race and mine And wise Mimer foretold the truth Odin thought merely of the wisdom which was to be his He seized the horn eagerly and emptied it without delay From that moment he became wiser than anyone else in the world except Mimer himself Now he had the price to pay which was not so pleasant When he went away from the grotto he left at the bottom of the dark pool one of his fiery eyes which twinkled and winked up through the magic depths like the reflection of a star This is how Odin lost his eye and why from that day he was careful to pull his gray hat low over his face when he wanted to pass unnoticed For by this oddity folk could easily recognise the wise lord of Asgard In the bright morning when the sun rose over the mountains of Midgard old Mimer drank from his bubbly well a draught of the wise water that flowed over Odin s pledge Doing so from his underground grotto he saw all that befell in heaven and on earth So that he also was wiser by the bargain Mimer seemed to have secured rather the best of it for he lost nothing that he could not spare while Odin lost what no man can well part with one of the good windows wherethrough his heart looks out upon the world But there was a sequel to these doings which made the balance swing down in Odin s favour Not long after this the AEsir quarrelled with the Vanir wild enemies of theirs and there was a terrible battle But in the end the two sides made peace and to prove that they meant never to quarrel again they exchanged hostages The Vanir gave to the AEsir old Nioerd the rich the lord of the sea and the ocean wind with his two children Frey and Freia This was indeed a gracious gift for Freia was the most beautiful maid in the world and her twin brother was almost as fair To the Vanir in return Father Odin gave his own brother Hoenir And with Hoenir he sent Mimer the wise whom he took from his lonely well Now the Vanir made Hoenir their chief thinking that he must be very wise because he was the brother of great Odin who had lately become famous for his wisdom They did not know the secret of Mimer s well how the hoary old giant was far more wise than anyone who had not quaffed of the magic water It is true that in the assemblies of the Vanir Hoenir gave excellent counsel But this was because Mimer whispered in Hoenir s ear all the wisdom that he uttered Witless Hoenir was quite helpless without his aid and did not know what to do or say Whenever Mimer was absent he would look nervous and frightened and if folk questioned him he always answered Yes ah yes Now go and consult someone else Of course the Vanir soon grew very angry at such silly answers from their chief and presently they began to suspect the truth Odin has deceived us they said He has sent us his foolish brother with a witch to tell him what to say Ha We will show him that we understand the trick So they cut off poor old Mimer s head and sent it to Odin as a present The tales do not say what Odin thought of the gift Perhaps he was glad that now there was no one in the whole world who could be called so wise as himself Perhaps he was sorry for the danger into which he had thrust a poor old giant who had never done him any wrong except to be a giant of the race which the AEsir hated Perhaps he was a little ashamed of the trick which he had played the Vanir Odin s new wisdom showed him how to prepare Mimer s head with herbs and charms so that it stood up by itself quite naturally and seemed not dead Thenceforth Odin kept it near him and learned from it many useful secrets which it had not forgotten So in the end Odin fared better than the unhappy Mimer whose worst fault was that he knew more than most folk That is a dangerous fault as others have found though it is not one for which many of us need fear being punished CHAPTER XIII THE QUEST OF THE HAMMER One morning Thor the Thunderer awoke with a yawn and stretching out his knotted arm felt for his precious hammer which he kept always under his pillow of clouds But he started up with a roar of rage so that all the palace trembled The hammer was gone Now this was a very serious matter for Thor was the protector of Asgard and Mioelnir the magic hammer which the dwarf had made was his mighty weapon of which the enemies of the AEsir stood so much in dread that they dared not venture near But if they should learn that Mioelnir was gone who could tell what danger might not threaten the palaces of heaven Thor darted his flashing eye into every corner of Cloud Land in search of the hammer He called his fair wife Sif of the golden hair to aid in the search and his two lovely daughters Thrude and Lora They hunted and they hunted they turned Thrudheim upside down and set the clouds to rolling wonderfully as they peeped and pried behind and around and under each billowy mass But Mioelnir was not to be found Certainly someone had stolen it Thor s yellow beard quivered with rage and his hair bristled on end like the golden rays of a star while all his household trembled It is Loki again he cried I am sure Loki is at the bottom of this mischief For since the time when Thor had captured Loki for the dwarf Brock and had given him over to have his bragging lips sewed up Loki had looked at him with evil eyes and Thor knew that the red rascal hated him most of all the gods But this time Thor was mistaken It was not Loki who had stolen the hammer he was too great a coward for that And though he meant before the end to be revenged upon Thor he was waiting until a safe chance should come when Thor himself might stumble into danger and Loki need only to help the evil by a malicious word or two and this chance came later as you shall hear in another tale Meanwhile Loki was on his best behaviour trying to appear very kind and obliging so when Thor came rumbling and roaring up to him demanding What have you done with my hammer you thief Loki looked surprised but did not lose his temper nor answer rudely Have you indeed missed your hammer brother Thor he said mumbling for his mouth was still sore where Brock had sewed the stitches That is a pity for if the giants hear of this they will be coming to try their might against Asgard Hush muttered Thor grasping him by the shoulder with his iron fingers That is what I fear But look you Loki I suspect your hand in the mischief Come confess Then Loki protested that he had nothing to do with so wicked a deed But he added wheedlingly I think I can guess the thief and because I love you Thor I will help you to find him Humph growled Thor Much love you bear to me However you are a wise rascal the nimblest wit of all the AEsir and it is better to have you on my side than on the other when giants are in the game Tell me then who has robbed the Thunder Lord of his bolt of power Loki drew near and whispered in Thor s ear Look how the storms rage and the winds howl in the world below Someone is wielding your thunder hammer all unskilfully Can you not guess the thief Who but Thrym the mighty giant who has ever been your enemy and your imitator and whose fingers have long itched to grasp the short handle of mighty Mioelnir that the world may name him Thunder Lord instead of you But look What a tempest The world will be shattered into fragments unless we soon get the hammer back Then Thor roared with rage I will seek this impudent Thrym he cried I will crush him into bits and teach him to meddle with the weapon of the AEsir Softly softly said Loki smiling maliciously He is a shrewd giant and a mighty Even you great Thor cannot go to him and pluck the hammer from his hand as one would slip the rattle from a baby s pink fist Nay you must use craft Thor and it is I who will teach you if you will be patient Thor was a brave blunt fellow and he hated the ways of Loki his lies and his deceit He liked best the way of warriors the thundering charge the flash of weapons and the heavy blow but without the hammer he could not fight the giants hand to hand Loki s advice seemed wise and he decided to leave the matter to the Red One Loki was now all eagerness for he loved difficulties which would set his wit in play and bring other folk into danger Look now he said We must go to Freia and borrow her falcon dress But you must ask for she loves me so little that she would scarce listen to me So first they made their way to Folkvang the house of maidens where Freia dwelt the loveliest of all in Asgard She was fairer than fair and sweeter than sweet and the tears from her flower eyes made the dew which blessed the earth flowers night and morning Of her Thor borrowed the magic dress of feathers in which Freia was wont to clothe herself and flit like a great beautiful bird all about the world She was willing enough to lend it to Thor when he told her that by its aid he hoped to win back the hammer which he had lost for she well knew the danger threatening herself and all the AEsir until Mioelnir should be found Now will I fetch the hammer for you said Loki So he put on the falcon plumage and spreading his brown wings flapped away up up over the world down down across the great ocean which lies beyond all things that men know And he came to the dark country where there was no sunshine nor spring but it was always dreary winter where mountains were piled up like blocks of ice and where great caverns yawned hungrily in blackness And this was Jotunheim the land of the Frost Giants And lo when Loki came thereto he found Thrym the Giant King sitting outside his palace cave playing with his dogs and horses The dogs were as big as elephants and the horses were as big as houses but Thrym himself was as huge as a mountain and Loki trembled but he tried to seem brave Good day Loki said Thrym with the terrible voice of which he was so proud for he fancied it was as loud as Thor s How fares it feathered one with your little brothers the AEsir in Asgard halls And how dare you venture alone in this guise to Giant Land It is an ill day in Asgard sighed Loki keeping his eye warily upon the giant and a stormy one in the world of men I heard the winds howling and the storms rushing on the earth as I passed by Some mighty one has stolen the hammer of our Thor Is it you Thrym greatest of all giants greater than Thor himself This the crafty one said to flatter Thrym for Loki well knew the weakness of those who love to be thought greater than they are Then Thrym bridled and swelled with pride and tried to put on the majesty and awe of noble Thor but he only succeeded in becoming an ugly puffy monster Well yes he admitted I have the hammer that belonged to your little Thor and now how much of lord is he Alack sighed Loki again weak enough he is without his magic weapon But you O Thrym surely your mightiness needs no such aid Give me the hammer that Asgard may no longer be shaken by Thor s grief for his precious toy But Thrym was not so easily to be flattered into parting with his stolen treasure He grinned a dreadful grin several yards in width which his teeth barred like jagged boulders across the entrance to a mountain cavern Mioelnir the hammer is mine he said and I am Thunder Lord mightiest of the mighty I have hidden it where Thor can never find it twelve leagues below the sea caves where Queen Ran lives with her daughters the white capped Waves But listen Loki Go tell the AEsir that I will give back Thor s hammer I will give it back upon one condition that they send Freia the beautiful to be my wife Freia the beautiful Loki had to stifle a laugh Fancy the AEsir giving their fairest flower to such an ugly fellow as this But he only said politely Ah yes you demand our Freia in exchange for the little hammer It is a costly price great Thrym But I will be your friend in Asgard If I have my way you shall soon see the fairest bride in all the world knocking at your door Farewell So Loki whizzed back to Asgard on his falcon wings and as he went he chuckled to think of the evils which were likely to happen because of his words with Thrym First he gave the message to Thor not sparing of Thrym s insolence to make Thor angry and then he went to Freia with the word for her not sparing of Thrym s ugliness to make her shudder The spiteful fellow Now you can imagine the horror that was in Asgard as the AEsir listened to Loki s words My hammer roared Thor The villain confesses that he has stolen my hammer and boasts that he is Thunder Lord Gr r r The ugly giant wailed Freia Must I be the bride of that hideous old monster and live in his gloomy mountain prison all my life Yes put on your bridal veil sweet Freia said Loki maliciously and come with me to Jotunheim Hang your famous starry necklace about your neck and don your bravest robe for in eight days there will be a wedding and Thor s hammer is to pay Then Freia fell to weeping I cannot go I will not go she cried I will not leave the home of gladness and Father Odin s table to dwell in the land of horrors Thor s hammer is mighty but mightier the love of the kind AEsir for their little Freia Good Odin dear brother Frey speak for me You will not make me go The Asir looked at her and thought how lonely and bare would Asgard be without her loveliness for she was fairer than fair and sweeter than sweet She shall not go shouted Frey putting his arms about his sister s neck No she shall not go cried all the Asir with one voice But my hammer insisted Thor I must have Mioelnir back again And my word to Thrym said Loki that must be made good You are too generous with your words said Odin sternly for he knew his brother well Your word is not a gem of great price for you have made it cheap Then spoke Heimdal the sleepless watchman who sits on guard at the entrance to the rainbow bridge which leads to Asgard and Heimdal was the wisest of the AEsir for he could see into the future and knew how things would come to pass Through his golden teeth he spoke for his teeth were all of gold I have a plan he said Let us dress Thor himself like a bride in Freia s robes and send him to Jotunheim to talk with Thrym and to win back his hammer But at this word Thor grew very angry What dress me like a girl he roared I should never hear the last of it The Asir will mock me and call me maiden The giants and even the puny dwarfs will have a lasting jest upon me I will not go I will fight I will die if need be But dressed as a woman I will not go But Loki answered him with sharp words for this was a scheme after his own heart What Thor he said Would you lose your hammer and keep Asgard in danger for so small a whim Look now if you go not Thrym with his giants will come in a mighty army and drive us from Asgard then he will indeed make Freia his bride and moreover he will have you for his slave under the power of his hammer How like you this picture brother of the thunder Nay Heimdal s plan is a good one and I myself will help to carry it out Still Thor hesitated but Freia came and laid her white hand on his arm and looked up into his scowling face pleadingly To save me Thor she begged And Thor said he would go Then there was great sport among the AEsir while they dressed Thor like a beautiful maiden Brunhilde and her sisters the nine Valkyrie daughters of Odin had the task in hand How they laughed as they brushed and curled his yellow hair and set upon it the wondrous headdress of silk and pearls They let out seams and they let down hems and set on extra pieces to make it larger and so they hid his great limbs and knotted arms under Freia s fairest robe of scarlet but beneath it all he would wear his shirt of mail and his belt of power that gave him double strength Freia herself twisted about his neck her famous necklace of starry jewels and Queen Frigg his mother hung at his girdle a jingling bunch of keys such as was the custom for the bride to wear at Norse weddings Last of all that Thrym might not see Thor s fierce eyes and the yellow beard that ill became a maiden they threw over him a long veil of silver white which covered him to the feet And there he stood as stately and tall a bride as even a giant might wish to see but on his hands he wore his iron gloves and they ached for but one thing to grasp the handle of the stolen hammer Ah what a lovely maid it is chuckled Loki and how glad will Thrym be to see this Freia come Bride Thor I will go with you as your handmaiden for I would fain see the fun Come then said Thor sulkily for he was ill pleased and wore his maiden robes with no good grace It is fitting that you go for I like not these lies and masking and I may spoil the mummery without you at my elbow There was loud laughter above the clouds when Thor all veiled and dainty seeming drove away from Asgard to his wedding with maid Loki by his side Thor cracked his whip and chirruped fiercely to his twin goats with golden hoofs for he wanted to escape the sounds of mirth that echoed from the rainbow bridge where all the AEsir stood watching Loki sitting with his hands meekly folded like a girl chuckled as he glanced up at Thor s angry face but he said nothing for he knew it was not good to joke too far with Thor even when Miloenir was hidden twelve leagues below the sea in Ran s kingdom So off they dashed to Jotunheim where Thrym was waiting and longing for his beautiful bride Thor s goats thundered along above the sea and land and people far below who looked up wondering as the noise rolled overhead Hear how the thunder rumbles they said Thor is on a long journey to night And a long journey it was as the tired goats found before they reached the end Thrym heard the sound of their approach for his ear was eager Hola he cried Someone is coming from Asgard only one of Odin s children could make a din so fearful Hasten men and see if they are bringing Freia to be my wife Then the lookout giant stepped down from the top of his mountain and said that a chariot was bringing two maidens to the door Run giants run shouted Thrym in a fever at this news My bride is coming Put silken cushions on the benches for a great banquet and make the house beautiful for the fairest maid in all space Bring in all my golden horned cows and my coal black oxen that she may see how rich I am and heap all my gold and jewels about to dazzle her sweet eyes She shall find me richest of the rich and when I have her fairest of the fair there will be no treasure that I lack not one The chariot stopped at the gate and out stepped the tall bride hidden from head to foot and her handmaiden muffled to the chin How afraid of catching cold they must be whispered the giant ladies who were peering over one another s shoulders to catch a glimpse of the bride just as the crowd outside the awning does at a wedding nowadays Thrym had sent six splendid servants to escort the maidens these were the Metal Kings who served him as lord of them all There was the Gold King all in cloth of gold with fringes of yellow bullion most glittering to see and there was the Silver King almost as gorgeous in a suit of spangled white and side by side bowed the dark Kings of Iron and Lead the one mighty in black the other sullen in blue and after them were the Copper King gleaming ruddy and brave and the Tin King strutting in his trimmings of gaudy tinsel which looked nearly as well as silver but were more economical And this fine troop of lackey kings most politely led Thor and Loki into the palace and gave them of the best for they never suspected who these seeming maidens really were And when evening came there was a wonderful banquet to celebrate the wedding On a golden throne sat Thrym uglier than ever in his finery of purple and gold Beside him was the bride of whose face no one had yet caught even a glimpse and at Thrym s other hand stood Loki the waiting maid for he wanted to be near to mend the mistakes which Thor might make Now the dishes at the feast were served in a huge way as befitted the table of giants great beeves roasted whole on platters as wide across as a ship s deck plum puddings as fat as feather beds with plums as big as footballs and a wedding cake like a snow capped hay mow The giants ate enormously But to Thor because they thought him a dainty maiden they served small bits of everything on a tiny gold dish Now Thor s long journey had made him very hungry and through his veil he whispered to Loki I shall starve Loki I cannot fare on these nibbles I must eat a goodly meal as I do at home And forthwith he helped himself to such morsels as might satisfy his hunger for a little time You should have seen the giants stare at the meal which the dainty bride devoured For first under the silver veil disappeared by pieces a whole roast ox Then Thor made eight mouthfuls of eight pink salmon a dish of which he was very fond And next he looked about and reached for a platter of cakes and sweetmeats that was set aside at one end of the table for the lady guests and the bride ate them all You can fancy how the damsels drew down their mouths and looked at one another when they saw their dessert disappear and they whispered about the table Alack if our future mistress is to sup like this day by day there will be poor cheer for the rest of us And to crown it all Thor was thirsty as well he might be and one after another he raised to his lips and emptied three great barrels of mead the foamy drink of the giants Then indeed Thrym was amazed for Thor s giant appetite had beaten that of the giants themselves Never before saw I a bride so hungry he cried And never before one half so thirsty But Loki the waiting maid whispered to him softly The truth is great Thrym that my dear mistress was almost starved For eight days Freia has eaten nothing at all so eager was she for Jotunheim Then Thrym was delighted you may be sure He forgave his hungry bride and loved her with all his heart He leaned forward to give her a kiss raising a corner of her veil but his hand dropped suddenly and he started up in terror for he had caught the angry flash of Thor s eye which was glaring at him through the bridal veil Thor was longing for his hammer Why has Freia so sharp a look Thrym cried It pierces like lightning and burns like fire But again the sly waiting maid whispered timidly Oh Thrym be not amazed The truth is my poor mistress s eyes are red with wakefulness and bright with longing For eight nights Freia has not known a wink of sleep so eager was she for Jotunheim Then again Thrym was doubly delighted and he longed to call her his very own dear wife Bring in the wedding gift he cried Bring in Thor s hammer Mioelnir and give it to Freia as I promised for when I have kept my word she will be mine all mine Then Thor s big heart laughed under his woman s dress and his fierce eyes swept eagerly down the hall to meet the servant who was bringing in the hammer on a velvet cushion Thor s fingers could hardly wait to clutch the stubby handle which they knew so well but he sat quite still on the throne beside ugly old Thrym with his hands meekly folded and his head bowed like a bashful bride The giant servant drew nearer nearer puffing and blowing strong though he was beneath the mighty weight He was about to lay it at Thor s feet for he thought it so heavy that no maiden could lift it or hold it in her lap when suddenly Thor s heart swelled and he gave a most unmaidenly shout of rage and triumph With one swoop he grasped the hammer in his iron fingers with the other arm he tore off the veil that hid his terrible face and trampled it under foot then he turned to the frightened king who cowered beside him on the throne Thief he cried Freia sends you this as a wedding gift And he whirled the hammer about his head then hurled it once twice thrice as it rebounded to his hand and in the first stroke as of lightning Thrym rolled dead from his throne in the second stroke perished the whole giant household these ugly enemies of the AEsir and in the third stroke the palace itself tumbled together and fell to the ground like a toppling playhouse of blocks But Loki and Thor stood safely among the ruins dressed in their tattered maiden robes a quaint and curious sight and Loki full of mischief now as ever burst out laughing Oh Thor if you could see he began but Thor held up his hammer and shook it gently as he said Look now Loki it was an excellent joke and so far you have done well after your crafty fashion which likes me not But now I have my hammer again and the joke is done From you nor from another I brook no laughter at my expense Henceforth we will have no mention of this masquerade nor of these rags which now I throw away Do you hear red laughter And Loki heard with a look of hate and stifled his laughter as best he could for it is not good to laugh at him who holds the hammer Not once after that was there mention in Asgard of the time when Thor dressed him as a girl and won his bridal gift from Thrym the giant But Mioelnir was safe once more in Asgard and you and I know how it came there so someone must have told I wonder if red Loki whispered the tale to some outsider after all Perhaps it may be so for now he knew how best to make Thor angry and from that day when Thor forbade his laughing Loki hated him with the mean little hatred of a mean little soul CHAPTER XIV THE APPLES OF IDUN Once upon a time Odin Loki and Hoener started on a journey They had often travelled together before on all sorts of errands for they had a great many things to look after and more than once they had fallen into trouble through the prying meddlesome malicious spirit of Loke who was never so happy as when he was doing wrong When the gods went on a journey they travelled fast and hard for they were strong active spirits who loved nothing so much as hard work hard blows storm peril and struggle There were no roads through the country over which they made their way only high mountains to be climbed by rocky paths deep valleys into which the sun hardly looked during half the year and swift rushing streams cold as ice and treacherous to the surest foot and the strongest arm Not a bird flew through the air not an animal sprang through the trees It was as still as a desert The gods walked on and on getting more tired and hungry at every step The sun was sinking low over the steep pine crested mountains and the travellers had neither breakfasted nor dined Even Odin was beginning to feel the pangs of hunger like the most ordinary mortal when suddenly entering a little valley the famished gods came upon a herd of cattle It was the work of a minute to kill a great ox and to have the carcass swinging in a huge pot over a roaring fire But never were gods so unlucky before In spite of their hunger the pot would not boil They piled on the wood until the great flames crackled and licked the pot with their fiery tongues but every time the cover was lifted there was the meat just as raw as when it was put in It is easy to imagine that the travellers were not in very good humour As they were talking about it and wondering how it could be a voice called out from the branches of the oak overhead If you will give me my fill I ll make the pot boil The gods looked first at each other and then into the tree and there they discovered a great eagle They were glad enough to get their supper on almost any terms so they told the eagle he might have what he wanted if he would only get the meat cooked The bird was as good as his word and in less time than it takes to tell it supper was ready Then the eagle flew down and picked out both shoulders and both legs This was a pretty large share it must be confessed and Loki who was always angry when anybody got more than he no sooner saw what the eagle had taken than he seized a great pole and began to beat the rapacious bird unmercifully Whereupon a very singular thing happened as singular things always used to happen when the gods were concerned the pole stuck fast in the huge talons of the eagle at one end and Loki stuck fast at the other end Struggle as he might he could not get loose and as the great bird sailed away over the tops of the trees Loki went pounding along on the ground striking against rocks and branches until he was bruised half to death The eagle was not an ordinary bird by any means as Loki soon found when he begged for mercy The giant Thjasse happened to be flying abroad in his eagle plumage when the hungry travellers came under the oak and tried to cook the ox It was into his hands that Loki had fallen and he was not to get away until he had promised to pay roundly for his freedom If there was one thing which the gods prized above their other treasures in Asgard it was the beautiful fruit of Idun kept by the goddess in a golden casket and given to the gods to keep them forever young and fair Without these Apples all their power could not have kept them from getting old like the meanest of mortals Without these Apples of Idun Asgard itself would have lost its charm for what would heaven be without youth and beauty forever shining through it Thjasse told Loki that he could not go unless he would promise to bring him the Apples of Idun Loki was wicked enough for anything but when it came to robbing the gods of their immortality even he hesitated And while he hesitated the eagle dashed hither and thither flinging him against the sides of the mountains and dragging him through the great tough boughs of the oaks until his courage gave out entirely and he promised to steal the Apples out of Asgard and give them to the giant Loki was bruised and sore enough when he got on his feet again to hate the giant who handled him so roughly with all his heart but he was not unwilling to keep his promise to steal the Apples if only for the sake of tormenting the other gods But how was it to be done Idun guarded the golden fruit of immortality with sleepless watchfulness No one ever touched it but herself and a beautiful sight it was to see her fair hands spread it forth for the morning feasts in Asgard The power which Loki possessed lay not so much in his own strength although he had a smooth way of deceiving people as in the goodness of others who had no thought of his doing wrong because they never did wrong themselves Not long after all this happened Loki came carelessly up to Idun as she was gathering her Apples to put them away in the beautiful carven box which held them Good morning goddess said he How fair and golden your Apples are Yes answered Idun the bloom of youth keeps them always beautiful I never saw anything like them continued Loki slowly as if he were talking about a matter of no importance until the other day Idun looked up at once with the greatest interest and curiosity in her face She was very proud of her Apples and she knew no earthly trees however large and fair bore the immortal fruit Where have you seen any Apples like them she asked Oh just outside the gates said Loki indifferently If you care to see them I ll take you there It will keep you but a moment The tree is only a little way off Idun was anxious to go at once Better take your Apples with you to compare them with the others said the wily god as she prepared to go Idun gathered up the golden Apples and went out of Asgard carrying with her all that made it heaven No sooner was she beyond the gates than a mighty rushing sound was heard like the coming of a tempest and before she could think or act the giant Thjasse in his eagle plumage was bearing her swiftly away through the air to his desolate icy home in Thrymheim where after vainly trying to persuade her to let him eat the Apples and be forever young like the gods he kept her a lonely prisoner Loki after keeping his promise and delivering Idun into the hands of the giant strayed back into Asgard as if nothing had happened The next morning when the gods assembled for their feast there was no Idun Day after day went past and still the beautiful goddess did not come Little by little the light of youth and beauty faded from the home of the gods and they themselves became old and haggard Their strong young faces were lined with care and furrowed by age their raven locks passed from gray to white and their flashing eyes became dim and hollow Brage the god of poetry could make no music while his beautiful wife was gone he knew not whither Morning after morning the faded light broke on paler and ever paler faces until even in heaven the eternal light of youth seemed to be going out forever Finally the gods could bear the loss of power and joy no longer They made rigorous inquiry They tracked Loki on that fair morning when he led Idun beyond the gates they seized him and brought him into solemn council and when he read in their haggard faces the deadly hate which flamed in all their hearts against his treachery his courage failed and he promised to bring Idun back to Asgard if the goddess Freyja would lend him her falcon guise No sooner said than done and with eager gaze the gods watched him as he flew away becoming at last only a dark moving speck against the sky After long and weary flight Loki came to Thrymheim and was glad enough to find Thjasse gone to sea and Idun alone in his dreary house He changed her instantly into a nut and taking her thus disguised in his talons flew away as fast as his falcon wings could carry him And he had need of all his speed for Thjasse coming suddenly home and finding Idun and her precious fruit gone guessed what had happened and putting on his eagle plumage flew forth in a mighty rage with vengeance in his heart Like the rushing wings of a tempest his mighty pinions beat the air and bore him swiftly onward From mountain peak to mountain peak he measured his wide course almost grazing at times the murmuring pine forests and then sweeping high in mid air with nothing above but the arching sky and nothing beneath but the tossing sea At last he sees the falcon far ahead and now his flight becomes like the flash of the lightning for swiftness and like the rushing of clouds for uproar The haggard faces of the gods line the walls of Asgard and watch the race with tremulous eagerness Youth and immortality are staked upon the winning of Loki He is weary enough and frightened enough too as the eagle sweeps on close behind him but he makes desperate efforts to widen the distance between them Little by little the eagle gains on the falcon The gods grow white with fear they rush off and prepare great fires upon the walls With fainting drooping wing the falcon passes over and drops exhausted by the wall In an instant the fires have been lighted and the great flames roar to heaven The eagle sweeps across the fiery line a second later and falls maimed and burned to the ground where a dozen fierce hands smite the life out of him and the great giant Thjasse perishes among his foes Idun resumes her natural form as Brage rushes to meet her The gods crowd round her She spreads the feast the golden Apples gleaming with unspeakable lustre in the eyes of the gods They eat and once more their faces glow with the beauty of immortal youth their eyes flash with the radiance of divine power and while Idun stands like a star for beauty among the throng the song of Brage is heard once more for poetry and immortality are wedded again CHAPTER XV THE DEATH OF BALDER There was one shadow which always fell over Asgard Sometimes in the long years the gods almost forgot it it lay so far off like a dim cloud in a clear sky but Odin saw it deepen and widen as he looked out into the universe and he knew that the last great battle would surely come when the gods themselves would be destroyed and a long twilight would rest on all the worlds and now the day was close at hand Misfortunes never come singly to men and they did not to the gods Idun the beautiful goddess of youth whose apples were the joy of all Asgard made a resting place for herself among the massive branches of Yggdrasil and there every evening came Brage and sang so sweetly that the birds stopped to listen and even the Norns those implacable sisters at the foot of the tree were softened by the melody But poetry cannot change the purposes of fate and one evening no song was heard of Brage or birds the leaves of the world tree hung withered and lifeless on the branches and the fountain from which they had daily been sprinkled was dry at last Idun had fallen into the dark valley of death and when Brage Heimdal and Loki went to question her about the future she could answer them only with tears Brage would not leave his beautiful wife alone amid the dim shades that crowded the dreary valley and so youth and genius vanished out of Asgard forever Balder was the most godlike of all the gods because he was the purest and the best Wherever he went his coming was like the coming of sunshine and all the beauty of summer was but the shining of his face When men s hearts were white like the light and their lives clear as the day it was because Balder was looking down upon them with those soft clear eyes that were open windows to the soul of God He had always lived in such a glow of brightness that no darkness had ever touched him but one morning after Idun and Brage had gone Balder s face was sad and troubled He walked slowly from room to room in his palace Breidablik stainless as the sky when April showers have swept across it because no impure thing had ever crossed the threshold and his eyes were heavy with sorrow In the night terrible dreams had broken his sleep and made it a long torture The air seemed to be full of awful changes for him and for all the gods He knew in his soul that the shadow of the last great day was sweeping on as he looked out and saw the worlds lying in light and beauty the fields yellow with waving grain the deep fiords flashing back the sunbeams from their clear depths the verdure clothing the loftiest mountains and knew that over all this darkness and desolation would come with silence of reapers and birds with fading of leaf and flower a great sorrow fell on his heart Balder could bear the burden no longer He went out called all the gods together and told them the terrible dreams of the night Every face was heavy with care The death of Balder would be like the going out of the sun and after a long sad council the gods resolved to protect him from harm by pledging all things to stand between him and any hurt So Frigg his mother went forth and made everything promise on a solemn oath not to injure her son Fire iron all kinds of metal every sort of stone trees earth diseases birds beasts snakes as the anxious mother went to them solemnly pledged themselves that no harm should come near Balder Everything promised and Frigg thought she had driven away the cloud but fate was stronger than her love and one little shrub had not sworn Odin was not satisfied even with these precautions for whichever way he looked the shadow of a great sorrow spread over the worlds He began to feel as if he were no longer the greatest of the gods and he could almost hear the rough shouts of the frost giants crowding the rainbow bridge on their way into Asgard When trouble comes to men it is hard to bear but to a god who had so many worlds to guide and rule it was a new and terrible thing Odin thought and thought until he was weary but no gleam of light could he find anywhere it was thick darkness everywhere At last he could bear the suspense no longer and saddling his horse he rode sadly out of Asgard to Niflheim the home of Hel whose face was as the face of death itself As he drew near the gates a monstrous dog came out and barked furiously but Odin rode a little eastward of the shadowy gates to the grave of a wonderful prophetess It was a cold gloomy place and the soul of the great god was pierced with a feeling of hopeless sorrow as he dismounted from Sleipner and bending over the grave began to chant weird songs and weave magical charms over it When he had spoken those wonderful words which could waken the dead from their sleep there was an awful silence for a moment and then a faint ghost like voice came from the grave Who art thou it said Who breaketh the silence of death and calleth the sleeper out of her long slumbers Ages ago I was laid at rest here snow and rain have fallen upon me through myriad years why dost thou disturb me I am Vegtam answered Odin and I come to ask why the couches of Hel are hung with gold and the benches strewn with shining rings It is done for Balder answered the awful voice ask me no more Odin s heart sank when he heard these words but he was determined to know the worst I will ask thee until I know all Who shall strike the fatal blow If I must I must moaned the prophetess Hoder shall smite his brother Balder and send him down to the dark home of Hel The mead is already brewed for Balder and the despair draweth near Then Odin looking into the future across the open grave saw all the days to come Who is this he said seeing that which no mortal could have seen who is this that will not weep for Balder Then the prophetess knew that it was none other than the greatest of the gods who had called her up Thou art not Vegtam she exclaimed thou art Odin himself the king of men And thou answered Odin angrily art no prophetess but the mother of three giants Ride home then and exult in what thou hast discovered said the dead woman Never shall my slumbers be broken again until Loki shall burst his chains and the great battle come And Odin rode sadly homeward knowing that already Niflheim was making itself beautiful against the coming of Balder The other gods meanwhile had become merry again for had not everything promised to protect their beloved Balder They even made sport of that which troubled them for when they found that nothing could hurt Balder and that all things glanced aside from his shining form they persuaded him to stand as a target for their weapons hurling darts spears swords and battle axes at him all of which went singing through the air and fell harmless at his feet But Loki when he saw these sports was jealous of Balder and went about thinking how he could destroy him It happened that as Frigg sat spinning in her house Fensal the soft wind blowing in at the windows and bringing the merry shouts of the gods at play an old woman entered and approached her Do you know asked the newcomer what they are doing in Asgard They are throwing all manner of dangerous weapons at Balder He stands there like the sun for brightness and against his glory spears and battle axes fall powerless to the ground Nothing can harm him No answered Frigg joyfully nothing can bring him any hurt for I have made everything in heaven and earth swear to protect him What said the old woman has everything sworn to guard Balder Yes said Frigg everything has sworn except one little shrub which is called Mistletoe and grows on the eastern side of Valhal I did not take an oath from that because I thought it too young and weak When the old woman heard this a strange light came into her eyes she walked off much faster than she had come in and no sooner had she passed beyond Frigg s sight than this same feeble old woman grew suddenly erect shook off her woman s garments and there stood Loki himself In a moment he had reached the slope east of Valhal had plucked a twig of the unsworn Mistletoe and was back in the circle of the gods who were still at their favourite pastime with Balder Hoder was standing silent and alone outside the noisy throng for he was blind Loki touched him Why do you not throw something at Balder Because I cannot see where Balder stands and have nothing to throw if I could replied Hoder If that is all said Loki come with me I will give you something to throw and direct your aim Hoder thinking no evil went with Loki and did as he was told The little sprig of Mistletoe shot through the air pierced the heart of Balder and in a moment the beautiful god lay dead upon the field A shadow rose out of the deep beyond the worlds and spread itself over heaven and earth for the light of the universe had gone out The gods could not speak for horror They stood like statues for a moment and then a hopeless wail burst from their lips Tears fell like rain from eyes that had never wept before for Balder the joy of Asgard had gone to Niflheim and left them desolate But Odin was saddest of all because he knew the future and he knew that peace and light had fled from Asgard forever and that the last day and the long night were hurrying on Frigg could not give up her beautiful son and when her grief had spent itself a little she asked who would go to Hel and offer her a rich ransom if she would permit Balder to return to Asgard I will go said Hermod swift at the word of Odin Sleipner was led forth and in an instant Hermod was galloping furiously away Then the gods began with sorrowful hearts to make ready for Balder s funeral When the once beautiful form had been arrayed in grave clothes they carried it reverently down to the deep sea which lay calm as a summer afternoon waiting for its precious burden Close to the water s edge lay Balder s Ringhorn the greatest of all the ships that sailed the seas but when the gods tried to launch it they could not move it an inch The great vessel creaked and groaned out no one could push it down to the water Odin walked about it with a sad face and the gentle ripple of the little waves chasing each other over the rocks seemed a mocking laugh to him Send to Jotunheim for Hyrroken he said at last and a messenger was soon flying for that mighty giantess In a little time Hyrroken came riding swiftly on a wolf so large and fierce that he made the gods think of Fenrer When the giantess had alighted Odin ordered four Berserkers of mighty strength to hold the wolf but he struggled so angrily that they had to throw him on the ground before they could control him Then Hyrroken went to the prow of the ship and with one mighty effort sent it far into the sea the rollers underneath bursting into flame and the whole earth trembling with the shock Thor was so angry at the uproar that he would have killed the giantess on the spot if he had not been held back by the other gods The great ship floated on the sea as she had often done before when Balder full of life and beauty set all her sails and was borne joyfully across the tossing seas Slowly and solemnly the dead god was carried on board and as Nanna his faithful wife saw her husband borne for the last time from the earth which he had made dear to her and beautiful to all men her heart broke with sorrow and they laid her beside Balder on the funeral pyre Since the world began no one had seen such a funeral No bells tolled no long procession of mourners moved across the hills but all the worlds lay under a deep shadow and from every quarter came those who had loved or feared Balder There at the very water s edge stood Odin himself the ravens flying about his head and on his majestic face a gloom that no sun would ever lighten again and there was Frigg the desolate mother whose son had already gone so far that he would never come back to her there was Frey standing sad and stern in his chariot there was Freyja the goddess of love from whose eyes fell a shining rain of tears there too was Heimdal on his horse Goldtop and around all these glorious ones from Asgard crowded the children of Jotunheim grim mountain giants seamed with scars from Thor s hammer and frost giants who saw in the death of Balder the coming of that long winter in which they should reign through all the worlds A deep hush fell on all created things and every eye was fixed on the great ship riding near the shore and on the funeral pyre rising from the deck crowned with the forms of Balder and Nanna Suddenly a gleam of light flashed over the water the pile had been kindled and the flames creeping slowly at first climbed faster and faster until they met over the dead and rose skyward A lurid light filled the heavens and shone on the sea and in the brightness of it the gods looked pale and sad and the circle of giants grew darker and more portentous Thor struck the fast burning pyre with his consecrating hammer and Odin cast into it the wonderful ring Draupner Higher and higher leaped the flames more and more desolate grew the scene at last they began to sink the funeral pyre was consumed Balder had vanished forever the summer was ended and winter waited at the doors Meanwhile Hermod was riding hard and fast on his gloomy errand Nine days and nights he rode through valleys so deep and dark that he could not see his horse Stillness and blackness and solitude were his only companions until he came to the golden bridge which crosses the river Gjol The good horse Sleipner who had carried Odin on so many strange journeys had never travelled such a road before and his hoofs rang drearily as he stopped short at the bridge for in front of him stood its porter the gigantic Modgud Who are you she asked fixing her piercing eyes on Hermod What is your name and parentage Yesterday five bands of dead men rode across the bridge and beneath them all it did not shake as under your single tread There is no colour of death in your face Why ride you hither the living among the dead I come said Hermod to seek for Balder Have you seen him pass this way He has already crossed the bridge and taken his journey northward to Hel Then Hermod rode slowly across the bridge that spans the abyss between life and death and found his way at last to the barred gates of Hel s dreadful home There he sprang to the ground tightened the girths remounted drove the spurs deep into the horse and Sleipner with a mighty leap cleared the wall Hermod rode straight to the gloomy palace dismounted entered and in a moment was face to face with the terrible queen of the kingdom of the dead Beside her on a beautiful throne sat Balder pale and wan crowned with a withered wreath of flowers and close at hand was Nanna pallid as her husband for whom she had died And all night long while ghostly forms wandered restless and sleepless through Helheim Hermod talked with Balder and Nanna There is no record of what they said but the talk was sad enough doubtless and ran like a still stream among the happy days in Asgard when Balder s smile was morning over the earth and the sight of his face the summer of the world When the morning came faint and dim through the dusky palace Hermod sought Hel who received him as cold and stern as fate Your kingdom is full O Hel he said and without Balder Asgard is empty Send him back to us once more for there is sadness in every heart and tears are in every eye Through heaven and earth all things weep for him If that is true was the slow icy answer if every created thing weeps for Balder he shall return to Asgard but if one eye is dry he remains henceforth in Helheim Then Hermod rode swiftly away and the decree of Hel was soon told in Asgard Through all the worlds the gods sent messengers to say that all who loved Balder should weep for his return and everywhere tears fell like rain There was weeping in Asgard and in all the earth there was nothing that did not weep Men and women and little children missing the light that had once fallen into their hearts and homes sobbed with bitter grief the birds of the air who had sung carols of joy at the gates of the morning since time began were full of sorrow the beasts of the fields crouched and moaned in their desolation the great trees that had put on their robes of green at Balder s command sighed as the wind wailed through them and the sweet flowers that waited for Balder s footstep and sprang up in all the fields to greet him hung their frail blossoms and wept bitterly for the love and the warmth and the light that had gone out Throughout the whole earth there was nothing but weeping and the sound of it was like the wailing of those storms in autumn that weep for the dead summer as its withered leaves drop one by one from the trees The messengers of the gods went gladly back to Asgard for everything had wept for Balder but as they journeyed they came upon a giantess called Thok and her eyes were dry Weep for Balder they said With dry eyes only will I weep for Balder she answered Dead or alive he never gave me gladness Let him stay in Helheim When she had spoken these words a terrible laugh broke from her lips and the messengers looked at each other with pallid faces for they knew it was the voice of Loki Balder never came back to Asgard and the shadows deepened over all things for the night of death was fast coming on CHAPTER XVI THE STAR AND THE LILY An old chieftain sat in his wigwam quietly smoking his favourite pipe when a crowd of Indian boys and girls suddenly entered and with numerous offerings of tobacco begged him to tell them a story and he did so There was once a time when this world was filled with happy people when all the nations were as one and the crimson tide of war had not begun to roll Plenty of game was in the forest and on the plains None were in want for a full supply was at hand Sickness was unknown The beasts of the field were tame they came and went at the bidding of man One unending spring gave no place for winter for its cold blasts or its unhealthy chills Every tree and bush yielded fruit Flowers carpeted the earth The air was laden with their fragrance and redolent with the songs of wedded warblers that flew from branch to branch fearing none for there were none to harm them There were birds then of more beautiful song and plumage than now It was at such a time when earth was a paradise and man worthily its possessor that the Indians were lone inhabitants of the American wilderness They numbered millions and living as nature designed them to live enjoyed its many blessings Instead of amusements in close rooms the sport of the field was theirs At night they met on the wide green beneath the heavenly worlds the ah nung o kah They watched the stars they loved to gaze at them for they believed them to be the residences of the good who had been taken home by the Great Spirit One night they saw one star that shone brighter than all others Its location was far away in the south near a mountain peak For many nights it was seen till at length it was doubted by many that the star was as far distant in the southern skies as it seemed to be This doubt led to an examination which proved the star to be only a short distance away and near the tops of some trees A number of warriors were deputed to go and see what it was They went and on their return said it appeared strange and somewhat like a bird A committee of the wise men were called to inquire into and if possible to ascertain the meaning of the strange phenomenon They feared that it might be the omen of some disaster Some thought it a precursor of good others of evil and some supposed it to be the star spoken of by their forefathers as the forerunner of a dreadful war One moon had nearly gone by and yet the mystery remained unsolved One night a young warrior had a dream in which a beautiful maiden came and stood at his side and thus addressed him Young brave charmed with the land of my forefathers its flowers its birds its rivers its beautiful lakes and its mountains clothed with green I have left my sisters in yonder world to dwell among you Young brave ask your wise and your great men where I can live and see the happy race continually ask them what form I shall assume in order to be loved Thus discoursed the bright stranger The young man awoke On stepping out of his lodge he saw the star yet blazing in its accustomed place At early dawn the chief s crier was sent round the camp to call every warrior to the council lodge When they had met the young warrior related his dream They concluded that the star that had been seen in the south had fallen in love with mankind and that it was desirous to dwell with them The next night five tall noble looking adventurous braves were sent to welcome the stranger to earth They went and presented to it a pipe of peace filled with sweet scented herbs and were rejoiced that it took it from them As they returned to the village the star with expanded wings followed and hovered over their homes till the dawn of day Again it came to the young man in a dream and desired to know where it should live and what form it should take Places were named on the top of giant trees or in flowers At length it was told to choose a place itself and it did so At first it dwelt in the white rose of the mountains but there it was so buried that it could not be seen It went to the prairie but it feared the hoof of the buffalo It next sought the rocky cliff but there it was so high that the children whom it loved most could not see it I know where I shall live said the bright fugitive where I can see the gliding canoe of the race I most admire Children yes they shall be my playmates and I will kiss their slumber by the side of cool lakes The nation shall love me wherever I am These words having been said she alighted on the waters where she saw herself reflected The next morning thousands of white flowers were seen on the surface of the lakes and the Indians gave them this name wah be gwan nee white flower This star lived in the southern skies Her brethren can be seen far off in the cold north hunting the Great Bear whilst her sisters watch her in the east and west Children when you see the lily on the waters take it in your hands and hold it to the skies that it may be happy on earth as its two sisters the
