Comes Back to the Enchanted Palace XXIX Poetry and Prose XXX A Wedding at the Stone House I An Irate Neighbor A tall slim girl half past sixteen with serious gray eyes and hair which her friends called auburn had sat down on the broad red sandstone doorstep of a Prince Edward Island farmhouse one ripe afternoon in August firmly resolved to construe so many lines of Virgil But an August afternoon with blue hazes scarfing the harvest slopes little winds whispering elfishly in the poplars and a dancing slendor of red poppies outflaming against the dark coppice of young firs in a corner of the cherry orchard was fitter for dreams than dead languages The Virgil soon slipped unheeded to the ground and Anne her chin propped on her clasped hands and her eyes on the splendid mass of fluffy clouds that were heaping up just over mister J A Harrison s house like a great white mountain was far away in a delicious world where a certain schoolteacher was doing a wonderful work shaping the destinies of future statesmen and inspiring youthful minds and hearts with high and lofty ambitions To be sure if you came down to harsh facts which it must be confessed Anne seldom did until she had to it did not seem likely that there was much promising material for celebrities in Avonlea school but you could never tell what might happen if a teacher used her influence for good Anne had certain rose tinted ideals of what a teacher might accomplish if she only went the right way about it and she was in the midst of a delightful scene forty years hence with a famous personage just exactly what he was to be famous for was left in convenient haziness but Anne thought it would be rather nice to have him a college president or a Canadian premier bowing low over her wrinkled hand and assuring her that it was she who had first kindled his ambition and that all his success in life was due to the lessons she had instilled so long ago in Avonlea school This pleasant vision was shattered by a most unpleasant interruption A demure little Jersey cow came scuttling down the lane and five seconds later mister Harrison arrived if arrived be not too mild a term to describe the manner of his irruption into the yard He bounced over the fence without waiting to open the gate and angrily confronted astonished Anne who had risen to her feet and stood looking at him in some bewilderment mister Harrison was their new righthand neighbor and she had never met him before although she had seen him once or twice In early April before Anne had come home from Queen s mister Robert Bell whose farm adjoined the Cuthbert place on the west had sold out and moved to Charlottetown His farm had been bought by a certain mister J A Harrison whose name and the fact that he was a New Brunswick man were all that was known about him But before he had been a month in Avonlea he had won the reputation of being an odd person a crank missus Rachel Lynde said missus Rachel was an outspoken lady as those of you who may have already made her acquaintance will remember mister Harrison was certainly different from other people and that is the essential characteristic of a crank as everybody knows In the first place he kept house for himself and had publicly stated that he wanted no fools of women around his diggings Feminine Avonlea took its revenge by the gruesome tales it related about his house keeping and cooking He had hired little John Henry Carter of White Sands and John Henry started the stories For one thing there was never any stated time for meals in the Harrison establishment mister Harrison got a bite when he felt hungry and if John Henry were around at the time he came in for a share but if he were not he had to wait until mister Harrison s next hungry spell John Henry mournfully averred that he would have starved to death if it wasn t that he got home on Sundays and got a good filling up and that his mother always gave him a basket of grub to take back with him on Monday mornings As for washing dishes mister Harrison never made any pretence of doing it unless a rainy Sunday came Then he went to work and washed them all at once in the rainwater hogshead and left them to drain dry Again mister Harrison was close When he was asked to subscribe to the reverend mister Allan s salary he said he d wait and see how many dollars worth of good he got out of his preaching first he didn t believe in buying a pig in a poke And when missus Lynde went to ask for a contribution to missions and incidentally to see the inside of the house he told her there were more heathens among the old woman gossips in Avonlea than anywhere else he knew of and he d cheerfully contribute to a mission for Christianizing them if she d undertake it missus Rachel got herself away and said it was a mercy poor missus Robert Bell was safe in her grave for it would have broken her heart to see the state of her house in which she used to take so much pride Why she scrubbed the kitchen floor every second day missus Lynde told Marilla Cuthbert indignantly and if you could see it now I had to hold up my skirts as I walked across it Finally mister Harrison kept a parrot called Ginger Nobody in Avonlea had ever kept a parrot before consequently that proceeding was considered barely respectable And such a parrot If you took John Henry Carter s word for it never was such an unholy bird It swore terribly missus Carter would have taken John Henry away at once if she had been sure she could get another place for him Besides Ginger had bitten a piece right out of the back of John Henry s neck one day when he had stooped down too near the cage missus Carter showed everybody the mark when the luckless John Henry went home on Sundays All these things flashed through Anne s mind as mister Harrison stood quite speechless with wrath apparently before her In his most amiable mood mister Harrison could not have been considered a handsome man he was short and fat and bald and now with his round face purple with rage and his prominent blue eyes almost sticking out of his head Anne thought he was really the ugliest person she had ever seen All at once mister Harrison found his voice I m not going to put up with this he spluttered not a day longer do you hear miss Bless my soul this is the third time miss the third time Patience has ceased to be a virtue miss I warned your aunt the last time not to let it occur again and she s let it she s done it what does she mean by it that is what I want to know That is what I m here about miss Will you explain what the trouble is asked Anne in her most dignified manner She had been practicing it considerably of late to have it in good working order when school began but it had no apparent effect on the irate J A Harrison Trouble is it Bless my soul trouble enough I should think The trouble is miss that I found that Jersey cow of your aunt s in my oats again not half an hour ago The third time mark you I found her in last Tuesday and I found her in yesterday I came here and told your aunt not to let it occur again She has let it occur again Where s your aunt miss I just want to see her for a minute and give her a piece of my mind a piece of J A Harrison s mind miss If you mean Miss Marilla Cuthbert she is not my aunt and she has gone down to East Grafton to see a distant relative of hers who is very ill said Anne with due increase of dignity at every word I am very sorry that my cow should have broken into your oats she is my cow and not Miss Cuthbert s Matthew gave her to me three years ago when she was a little calf and he bought her from mister Bell Sorry miss Sorry isn t going to help matters any You d better go and look at the havoc that animal has made in my oats trampled them from center to circumference miss I am very sorry repeated Anne firmly but perhaps if you kept your fences in better repair Dolly might not have broken in It is your part of the line fence that separates your oatfield from our pasture and I noticed the other day that it was not in very good condition My fence is all right snapped mister Harrison angrier than ever at this carrying of the war into the enemy s country The jail fence couldn t keep a demon of a cow like that out And I can tell you you redheaded snippet that if the cow is yours as you say you d be better employed in watching her out of other people s grain than in sitting round reading yellow covered novels with a scathing glance at the innocent tan colored Virgil by Anne s feet Something at that moment was red besides Anne s hair which had always been a tender point with her I d rather have red hair than none at all except a little fringe round my ears she flashed The shot told for mister Harrison was really very sensitive about his bald head His anger choked him up again and he could only glare speechlessly at Anne who recovered her temper and followed up her advantage I can make allowance for you mister Harrison because I have an imagination I can easily imagine how very trying it must be to find a cow in your oats and I shall not cherish any hard feelings against you for the things you ve said I promise you that Dolly shall never break into your oats again I give you my word of honor on THAT point Well mind you she doesn t muttered mister Harrison in a somewhat subdued tone but he stamped off angrily enough and Anne heard him growling to himself until he was out of earshot Grievously disturbed in mind Anne marched across the yard and shut the naughty Jersey up in the milking pen She can t possibly get out of that unless she tears the fence down she reflected She looks pretty quiet now I daresay she has sickened herself on those oats I wish I d sold her to mister Shearer when he wanted her last week but I thought it was just as well to wait until we had the auction of the stock and let them all go together I believe it is true about mister Harrison being a crank Certainly there s nothing of the kindred spirit about HIM Anne had always a weather eye open for kindred spirits Marilla Cuthbert was driving into the yard as Anne returned from the house and the latter flew to get tea ready They discussed the matter at the tea table I ll be glad when the auction is over said Marilla It is too much responsibility having so much stock about the place and nobody but that unreliable Martin to look after them He has never come back yet and he promised that he would certainly be back last night if I d give him the day off to go to his aunt s funeral I don t know how many aunts he has got I am sure That s the fourth that s died since he hired here a year ago I ll be more than thankful when the crop is in and mister Barry takes over the farm We ll have to keep Dolly shut up in the pen till Martin comes for she must be put in the back pasture and the fences there have to be fixed I declare it is a world of trouble as Rachel says Here s poor Mary Keith dying and what is to become of those two children of hers is more than I know She has a brother in British Columbia and she has written to him about them but she hasn t heard from him yet What are the children like How old are they Six past they re twins Oh I ve always been especially interested in twins ever since missus Hammond had so many said Anne eagerly Are they pretty Goodness you couldn t tell they were too dirty Davy had been out making mud pies and Dora went out to call him in Davy pushed her headfirst into the biggest pie and then because she cried he got into it himself and wallowed in it to show her it was nothing to cry about Mary said Dora was really a very good child but that Davy was full of mischief He has never had any bringing up you might say His father died when he was a baby and Mary has been sick almost ever since I m always sorry for children that have no bringing up said Anne soberly You know I hadn t any till you took me in hand I hope their uncle will look after them Just what relation is missus Keith to you Mary None in the world It was her husband he was our third cousin There s missus Lynde coming through the yard I thought she d be up to hear about Mary Don t tell her about mister Harrison and the cow implored Anne Marilla promised but the promise was quite unnecessary for missus Lynde was no sooner fairly seated than she said I saw mister Harrison chasing your Jersey out of his oats today when I was coming home from Carmody I thought he looked pretty mad Did he make much of a rumpus Anne and Marilla furtively exchanged amused smiles Few things in Avonlea ever escaped missus Lynde It was only that morning Anne had said If you went to your own room at midnight locked the door pulled down the blind and SNEEZED missus Lynde would ask you the next day how your cold was I believe he did admitted Marilla I was away He gave Anne a piece of his mind I think he is a very disagreeable man said Anne with a resentful toss of her ruddy head You never said a truer word said missus Rachel solemnly I knew there d be trouble when Robert Bell sold his place to a New Brunswick man that s what I don t know what Avonlea is coming to with so many strange people rushing into it It ll soon not be safe to go to sleep in our beds Why what other strangers are coming in asked Marilla Haven t you heard Well there s a family of Donnells for one thing They ve rented Peter Sloane s old house Peter has hired the man to run his mill They belong down east and nobody knows anything about them Then that shiftless Timothy Cotton family are going to move up from White Sands and they ll simply be a burden on the public He is in consumption when he isn t stealing and his wife is a slack twisted creature that can t turn her hand to a thing She washes her dishes SITTING DOWN missus George Pye has taken her husband s orphan nephew Anthony Pye He ll be going to school to you Anne so you may expect trouble that s what And you ll have another strange pupil too Paul Irving is coming from the States to live with his grandmother You remember his father Marilla Stephen Irving him that jilted Lavendar Lewis over at Grafton I don t think he jilted her There was a quarrel I suppose there was blame on both sides Well anyway he didn t marry her and she s been as queer as possible ever since they say living all by herself in that little stone house she calls Echo Lodge Stephen went off to the States and went into business with his uncle and married a Yankee He s never been home since though his mother has been up to see him once or twice His wife died two years ago and he s sending the boy home to his mother for a spell He s ten years old and I don t know if he ll be a very desirable pupil You can never tell about those Yankees missus Lynde looked upon all people who had the misfortune to be born or brought up elsewhere than in Prince Edward Island with a decided can any good thing come out of Nazareth air They MIGHT be good people of course but you were on the safe side in doubting it She had a special prejudice against Yankees Her husband had been cheated out of ten dollars by an employer for whom he had once worked in Boston and neither angels nor principalities nor powers could have convinced missus Rachel that the whole United States was not responsible for it Avonlea school won t be the worse for a little new blood said Marilla drily and if this boy is anything like his father he ll be all right Steve Irving was the nicest boy that was ever raised in these parts though some people did call him proud I should think missus Irving would be very glad to have the child She has been very lonesome since her husband died Oh the boy may be well enough but he ll be different from Avonlea children said missus Rachel as if that clinched the matter missus Rachel s opinions concerning any person place or thing were always warranted to wear What s this I hear about your going to start up a Village Improvement Society Anne I was just talking it over with some of the girls and boys at the last Debating Club said Anne flushing They thought it would be rather nice and so do mister and missus Allan Lots of villages have them now Well you ll get into no end of hot water if you do Better leave it alone Anne that s what People don t like being improved Oh we are not going to try to improve the PEOPLE It is Avonlea itself There are lots of things which might be done to make it prettier For instance if we could coax mister Levi Boulter to pull down that dreadful old house on his upper farm wouldn t that be an improvement It certainly would admitted missus Rachel That old ruin has been an eyesore to the settlement for years But if you Improvers can coax Levi Boulter to do anything for the public that he isn t to be paid for doing may I be there to see and hear the process that s what I don t want to discourage you Anne for there may be something in your idea though I suppose you did get it out of some rubbishy Yankee magazine but you ll have your hands full with your school and I advise you as a friend not to bother with your improvements that s what But there I know you ll go ahead with it if you ve set your mind on it You were always one to carry a thing through somehow Something about the firm outlines of Anne s lips told that missus Rachel was not far astray in this estimate Anne s heart was bent on forming the Improvement Society Gilbert Blythe who was to teach in White Sands but would always be home from Friday night to Monday morning was enthusiastic about it and most of the other folks were willing to go in for anything that meant occasional meetings and consequently some fun As for what the improvements were to be nobody had any very clear idea except Anne and Gilbert They had talked them over and planned them out until an ideal Avonlea existed in their minds if nowhere else missus Rachel had still another item of news They ve given the Carmody school to a Priscilla Grant Didn t you go to Queen s with a girl of that name Anne
246_122825_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes 
none	none	indeed Priscilla to teach at Carmody How perfectly lovely exclaimed Anne her gray eyes lighting up until they looked like evening stars causing missus Lynde to wonder anew if she would ever get it settled to her satisfaction whether Anne Shirley were really a pretty girl or not II Selling in Haste and Repenting at Leisure Anne drove over to Carmody on a shopping expedition the next afternoon and took Diana Barry with her Diana was of course a pledged member of the Improvement Society and the two girls talked about little else all the way to Carmody and back The very first thing we ought to do when we get started is to have that hall painted said Diana as they drove past the Avonlea hall a rather shabby building set down in a wooded hollow with spruce trees hooding it about on all sides It s a disgraceful looking place and we must attend to it even before we try to get mister Levi Boulder to pull his house down Father says we ll never succeed in DOING that Levi Boulter is too mean to spend the time it would take Perhaps he ll let the boys take it down if they promise to haul the boards and split them up for him for kindling wood said Anne hopefully We must do our best and be content to go slowly at first We can t expect to improve everything all at once We ll have to educate public sentiment first of course Diana wasn t exactly sure what educating public sentiment meant but it sounded fine and she felt rather proud that she was going to belong to a society with such an aim in view I thought of something last night that we could do Anne You know that three cornered piece of ground where the roads from Carmody and Newbridge and White Sands meet It s all grown over with young spruce but wouldn t it be nice to have them all cleared out and just leave the two or three birch trees that are on it Splendid agreed Anne gaily And have a rustic seat put under the birches And when spring comes we ll have a flower bed made in the middle of it and plant geraniums Yes only we ll have to devise some way of getting old missus Hiram Sloane to keep her cow off the road or she ll eat our geraniums up laughed Diana I begin to see what you mean by educating public sentiment Anne There s the old Boulter house now Did you ever see such a rookery And perched right close to the road too An old house with its windows gone always makes me think of something dead with its eyes picked out I think an old deserted house is such a sad sight said Anne dreamily It always seems to me to be thinking about its past and mourning for its old time joys Marilla says that a large family was raised in that old house long ago and that it was a real pretty place with a lovely garden and roses climbing all over it It was full of little children and laughter and songs and now it is empty and nothing ever wanders through it but the wind How lonely and sorrowful it must feel Perhaps they all come back on moonlit nights the ghosts of the little children of long ago and the roses and the songs and for a little while the old house can dream it is young and joyous again Diana shook her head I never imagine things like that about places now Anne Don t you remember how cross mother and Marilla were when we imagined ghosts into the Haunted Wood To this day I can t go through that bush comfortably after dark and if I began imagining such things about the old Boulter house I d be frightened to pass it too Besides those children aren t dead They re all grown up and doing well and one of them is a butcher And flowers and songs couldn t have ghosts anyhow Anne smothered a little sigh She loved Diana dearly and they had always been good comrades But she had long ago learned that when she wandered into the realm of fancy she must go alone The way to it was by an enchanted path where not even her dearest might follow her A thunder shower came up while the girls were at Carmody it did not last long however and the drive home through lanes where the raindrops sparkled on the boughs and little leafy valleys where the drenched ferns gave out spicy odors was delightful But just as they turned into the Cuthbert lane Anne saw something that spoiled the beauty of the landscape for her Before them on the right extended mister Harrison s broad gray green field of late oats wet and luxuriant and there standing squarely in the middle of it up to her sleek sides in the lush growth and blinking at them calmly over the intervening tassels was a Jersey cow Anne dropped the reins and stood up with a tightening of the lips that boded no good to the predatory quadruped Not a word said she but she climbed nimbly down over the wheels and whisked across the fence before Diana understood what had happened Anne come back shrieked the latter as soon as she found her voice You ll ruin your dress in that wet grain ruin it She doesn t hear me Well she ll never get that cow out by herself I must go and help her of course Anne was charging through the grain like a mad thing Diana hopped briskly down tied the horse securely to a post turned the skirt of her pretty gingham dress over her shoulders mounted the fence and started in pursuit of her frantic friend She could run faster than Anne who was hampered by her clinging and drenched skirt and soon overtook her Behind them they left a trail that would break mister Harrison s heart when he should see it Anne for mercy s sake stop panted poor Diana I m right out of breath and you are wet to the skin I must get that cow out before mister Harrison sees her gasped Anne I don t care if I m drowned if we can only do that But the Jersey cow appeared to see no good reason for being hustled out of her luscious browsing ground No sooner had the two breathless girls got near her than she turned and bolted squarely for the opposite corner of the field Head her off screamed Anne Run Diana run Diana did run Anne tried to and the wicked Jersey went around the field as if she were possessed Privately Diana thought she was It was fully ten minutes before they headed her off and drove her through the corner gap into the Cuthbert lane There is no denying that Anne was in anything but an angelic temper at that precise moment Nor did it soothe her in the least to behold a buggy halted just outside the lane wherein sat mister Shearer of Carmody and his son both of whom wore a broad smile I guess you d better have sold me that cow when I wanted to buy her last week Anne chuckled mister Shearer I ll sell her to you now if you want her said her flushed and disheveled owner You may have her this very minute Done I ll give you twenty for her as I offered before and Jim here can drive her right over to Carmody She ll go to town with the rest of the shipment this evening mister Reed of Brighton wants a Jersey cow Five minutes later Jim Shearer and the Jersey cow were marching up the road and impulsive Anne was driving along the Green Gables lane with her twenty dollars What will Marilla say asked Diana Oh she won t care Dolly was my own cow and it isn t likely she d bring more than twenty dollars at the auction But oh dear if mister Harrison sees that grain he will know she has been in again and after my giving him my word of honor that I d never let it happen Well it has taught me a lesson not to give my word of honor about cows A cow that could jump over or break through our milk pen fence couldn t be trusted anywhere Marilla had gone down to missus Lynde s and when she returned knew all about Dolly s sale and transfer for missus Lynde had seen most of the transaction from her window and guessed the rest I suppose it s just as well she s gone though you DO do things in a dreadful headlong fashion Anne I don t see how she got out of the pen though She must have broken some of the boards off I didn t think of looking said Anne but I ll go and see now Martin has never come back yet Perhaps some more of his aunts have died I think it s something like mister Peter Sloane and the octogenarians The other evening missus Sloane was reading a newspaper and she said to mister Sloane I see here that another octogenarian has just died What is an octogenarian Peter And mister Sloane said he didn t know but they must be very sickly creatures for you never heard tell of them but they were dying That s the way with Martin s aunts Martin s just like all the rest of those French said Marilla in disgust You can t depend on them for a day Marilla was looking over Anne s Carmody purchases when she heard a shrill shriek in the barnyard A minute later Anne dashed into the kitchen wringing her hands Anne Shirley what s the matter now Oh Marilla whatever shall I do This is terrible And it s all my fault Oh will I EVER learn to stop and reflect a little before doing reckless things missus Lynde always told me I would do something dreadful some day and now I ve done it Anne you are the most exasperating girl WHAT is it you ve done Sold mister Harrison s Jersey cow the one he bought from mister Bell to mister Shearer Dolly is out in the milking pen this very minute Anne Shirley are you dreaming I only wish I were There s no dream about it though it s very like a nightmare And mister Harrison s cow is in Charlottetown by this time Oh Marilla I thought I d finished getting into scrapes and here I am in the very worst one I ever was in in my life What can I do Do There s nothing to do child except go and see mister Harrison about it We can offer him our Jersey in exchange if he doesn t want to take the money She is just as good as his I m sure he ll be awfully cross and disagreeable about it though moaned Anne I daresay he will He seems to be an irritable sort of a man I ll go and explain to him if you like No indeed I m not as mean as that exclaimed Anne This is all my fault and I m certainly not going to let you take my punishment I ll go myself and I ll go at once The sooner it s over the better for it will be terribly humiliating Poor Anne got her hat and her twenty dollars and was passing out when she happened to glance through the open pantry door On the table reposed a nut cake which she had baked that morning a particularly toothsome concoction iced with pink icing and adorned with walnuts Anne had intended it for Friday evening when the youth of Avonlea were to meet at Green Gables to organize the Improvement Society But what were they compared to the justly offended mister Harrison Anne thought that cake ought to soften the heart of any man especially one who had to do his own cooking and she promptly popped it into a box She would take it to mister Harrison as a peace offering That is if he gives me a chance to say anything at all she thought ruefully as she climbed the lane fence and started on a short cut across the fields golden in the light of the dreamy August evening I know now just how people feel who are being led to execution III mister Harrison at Home mister Harrison s house was an old fashioned low eaved whitewashed structure set against a thick spruce grove mister Harrison himself was sitting on his vineshaded veranda in his shirt sleeves enjoying his evening pipe When he realized who was coming up the path he sprang suddenly to his feet bolted into the house and shut the door This was merely the uncomfortable result of his surprise mingled with a good deal of shame over his outburst of temper the day before But it nearly swept the remnant of her courage from Anne s heart If he s so cross now what will he be when he hears what I ve done she reflected miserably as she rapped at the door But mister Harrison opened it smiling sheepishly and invited her to enter in a tone quite mild and friendly if somewhat nervous He had laid aside his pipe and donned his coat he offered Anne a very dusty chair very politely and her reception would have passed off pleasantly enough if it had not been for the telltale of a parrot who was peering through the bars of his cage with wicked golden eyes No sooner had Anne seated herself than Ginger exclaimed Bless my soul what s that redheaded snippet coming here for It would be hard to say whose face was the redder mister Harrison s or Anne s Don t you mind that parrot said mister Harrison casting a furious glance at Ginger He s he s always talking nonsense I got him from my brother who was a sailor Sailors don t always use the choicest language and parrots are very imitative birds So I should think said poor Anne the remembrance of her errand quelling her resentment She couldn t afford to snub mister Harrison under the circumstances that was certain When you had just sold a man s Jersey cow offhand without his knowledge or consent you must not mind if his parrot repeated uncomplimentary things Nevertheless the redheaded snippet was not quite so meek as she might otherwise have been I ve come to confess something to you mister Harrison she said resolutely It s it s about that Jersey cow Bless my soul exclaimed mister Harrison nervously has she gone and broken into my oats again
426_122822_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 Well never mind 
none	none	never mind if she has It s no difference none at all I I was too hasty yesterday that s a fact Never mind if she has Oh if it were only that sighed Anne But it s ten times worse I don t Bless my soul do you mean to say she s got into my wheat No no not the wheat But Then it s the cabbages She s broken into my cabbages that I was raising for Exhibition hey It s NOT the cabbages mister Harrison I ll tell you everything that is what I came for but please don t interrupt me It makes me so nervous Just let me tell my story and don t say anything till I get through and then no doubt you ll say plenty Anne concluded but in thought only I won t say another word said mister Harrison and he didn t But Ginger was not bound by any contract of silence and kept ejaculating Redheaded snippet at intervals until Anne felt quite wild I shut my Jersey cow up in our pen yesterday This morning I went to Carmody and when I came back I saw a Jersey cow in your oats Diana and I chased her out and you can t imagine what a hard time we had I was so dreadfully wet and tired and vexed and mister Shearer came by that very minute and offered to buy the cow I sold her to him on the spot for twenty dollars It was wrong of me I should have waited and consulted Marilla of course But I m dreadfully given to doing things without thinking everybody who knows me will tell you that mister Shearer took the cow right away to ship her on the afternoon train Redheaded snippet quoted Ginger in a tone of profound contempt At this point mister Harrison arose and with an expression that would have struck terror into any bird but a parrot carried Ginger s cage into an adjoining room and shut the door Ginger shrieked swore and otherwise conducted himself in keeping with his reputation but finding himself left alone relapsed into sulky silence Excuse me and go on said mister Harrison sitting down again My brother the sailor never taught that bird any manners I went home and after tea I went out to the milking pen mister Harrison Anne leaned forward clasping her hands with her old childish gesture while her big gray eyes gazed imploringly into mister Harrison s embarrassed face I found my cow still shut up in the pen It was YOUR cow I had sold to mister Shearer Bless my soul exclaimed mister Harrison in blank amazement at this unlooked for conclusion What a VERY extraordinary thing Oh it isn t in the least extraordinary that I should be getting myself and other people into scrapes said Anne mournfully I m noted for that You might suppose I d have grown out of it by this time I ll be seventeen next March but it seems that I haven t mister Harrison is it too much to hope that you ll forgive me I m afraid it s too late to get your cow back but here is the money for her or you can have mine in exchange if you d rather She s a very good cow And I can t express how sorry I am for it all Tut tut said mister Harrison briskly don t say another word about it miss It s of no consequence no consequence whatever Accidents will happen I m too hasty myself sometimes miss far too hasty But I can t help speaking out just what I think and folks must take me as they find me If that cow had been in my cabbages now but never mind she wasn t so it s all right I think I d rather have your cow in exchange since you want to be rid of her Oh thank you mister Harrison I m so glad you are not vexed I was afraid you would be And I suppose you were scared to death to come here and tell me after the fuss I made yesterday hey But you mustn t mind me I m a terrible outspoken old fellow that s all awful apt to tell the truth no matter if it is a bit plain So is missus Lynde said Anne before she could prevent herself Who missus Lynde Don t you tell me I m like that old gossip said mister Harrison irritably I m not not a bit What have you got in that box A cake said Anne archly In her relief at mister Harrison s unexpected amiability her spirits soared upward feather light I brought it over for you I thought perhaps you didn t have cake very often I don t that s a fact and I m mighty fond of it too I m much obliged to you It looks good on top I hope it s good all the way through It is said Anne gaily confident I have made cakes in my time that were NOT as missus Allan could tell you but this one is all right I made it for the Improvement Society but I can make another for them Well I ll tell you what miss you must help me eat it I ll put the kettle on and we ll have a cup of tea How will that do Will you let me make the tea said Anne dubiously mister Harrison chuckled I see you haven t much confidence in my ability to make tea You re wrong I can brew up as good a jorum of tea as you ever drank But go ahead yourself Fortunately it rained last Sunday so there s plenty of clean dishes Anne hopped briskly up and went to work She washed the teapot in several waters before she put the tea to steep Then she swept the stove and set the table bringing the dishes out of the pantry The state of that pantry horrified Anne but she wisely said nothing mister Harrison told her where to find the bread and butter and a can of peaches Anne adorned the table with a bouquet from the garden and shut her eyes to the stains on the tablecloth Soon the tea was ready and Anne found herself sitting opposite mister Harrison at his own table pouring his tea for him and chatting freely to him about her school and friends and plans She could hardly believe the evidence of her senses mister Harrison had brought Ginger back averring that the poor bird would be lonesome and Anne feeling that she could forgive everybody and everything offered him a walnut But Ginger s feelings had been grievously hurt and he rejected all overtures of friendship He sat moodily on his perch and ruffled his feathers up until he looked like a mere ball of green and gold Why do you call him Ginger asked Anne who liked appropriate names and thought Ginger accorded not at all with such gorgeous plumage My brother the sailor named him Maybe it had some reference to his temper I think a lot of that bird though you d be surprised if you knew how much He has his faults of course That bird has cost me a good deal one way and another Some people object to his swearing habits but he can t be broken of them I ve tried other people have tried Some folks have prejudices against parrots Silly ain t it I like them myself Ginger s a lot of company to me Nothing would induce me to give that bird up nothing in the world miss mister Harrison flung the last sentence at Anne as explosively as if he suspected her of some latent design of persuading him to give Ginger up Anne however was beginning to like the queer fussy fidgety little man and before the meal was over they were quite good friends mister Harrison found out about the Improvement Society and was disposed to approve of it That s right Go ahead There s lots of room for improvement in this settlement and in the people too Oh I don t know flashed Anne To herself or to her particular cronies she might admit that there were some small imperfections easily removable in Avonlea and its inhabitants But to hear a practical outsider like mister Harrison saying it was an entirely different thing I think Avonlea is a lovely place and the people in it are very nice too I guess you ve got a spice of temper commented mister Harrison surveying the flushed cheeks and indignant eyes opposite him It goes with hair like yours I reckon Avonlea is a pretty decent place or I wouldn t have located here but I suppose even you will admit that it has SOME faults I like it all the better for them said loyal Anne I don t like places or people either that haven t any faults I think a truly perfect person would be very uninteresting missus Milton White says she never met a perfect person but she s heard enough about one her husband s first wife Don t you think it must be very uncomfortable to be married to a man whose first wife was perfect It would be more uncomfortable to be married to the perfect wife declared mister Harrison with a sudden and inexplicable warmth When tea was over Anne insisted on washing the dishes although mister Harrison assured her that there were enough in the house to do for weeks yet She would dearly have loved to sweep the floor also but no broom was visible and she did not like to ask where it was for fear there wasn t one at all You might run across and talk to me once in a while suggested mister Harrison when she was leaving Tisn t far and folks ought to be neighborly I m kind of interested in that society of yours Seems to me there ll be some fun in it Who are you going to tackle first We are not going to meddle with PEOPLE it is only PLACES we mean to improve said Anne in a dignified tone She rather suspected that mister Harrison was making fun of the project When she had gone mister Harrison watched her from the window a lithe girlish shape tripping lightheartedly across the fields in the sunset afterglow I m a crusty lonesome crabbed old chap he said aloud but there s something about that little girl makes me feel young again and it s such a pleasant sensation I d like to have it repeated once in a while Redheaded snippet croaked Ginger mockingly mister Harrison shook his fist at the parrot You ornery bird he muttered I almost wish I d wrung your neck when my brother the sailor brought you home Will you never be done getting me into trouble Anne ran home blithely and recounted her adventures to Marilla who had been not a little alarmed by her long absence and was on the point of starting out to look for her It s a pretty good world after all isn t it Marilla concluded Anne happily missus Lynde was complaining the other day that it wasn t much of a world She said whenever you looked forward to anything pleasant you were sure to be more or less disappointed perhaps that is true But there is a good side to it too The bad things don t always come up to your expectations either they nearly always turn out ever so much better than you think I looked forward to a dreadfully unpleasant experience when I went over to mister Harrison s tonight and instead he was quite kind and I had almost a nice time I think we re going to be real good friends if we make plenty of allowances for each other and everything has turned out for the best But all the same Marilla I shall certainly never again sell a cow before making sure to whom she belongs And I do NOT like parrots IV Different Opinions One evening at sunset Jane Andrews Gilbert Blythe and Anne Shirley were lingering by a fence in the shadow of gently swaying spruce boughs where a wood cut known as the Birch Path joined the main road Jane had been up to spend the afternoon with Anne who walked part of the way home with her at the fence they met Gilbert and all three were now talking about the fateful morrow for that morrow was the first of September and the schools would open Jane would go to Newbridge and Gilbert to White Sands You both have the advantage of me sighed Anne You re going to teach children who don t know you but I have to teach my own old schoolmates and missus Lynde says she s afraid they won t respect me as they would a stranger unless I m very cross from the first But I don t believe a teacher should be cross Oh it seems to me such a responsibility I guess we ll get on all right said Jane comfortably Jane was not troubled by any aspirations to be an influence for good She meant to earn her salary fairly please the trustees and get her name on the School Inspector s roll of honor Further ambitions Jane had none The main thing will be to keep order and a teacher has to be a little cross to do that If my pupils won t do as I tell them I shall punish them How Give them a good whipping of course Oh Jane you wouldn t cried Anne shocked Jane you COULDN T Indeed I could and would if they deserved it said Jane decidedly I could NEVER whip a child said Anne with equal decision I don t believe in it AT ALL Miss Stacy never whipped any of us and she had perfect order and mister Phillips was always whipping and he had no order at all No if I can t get along without whipping I shall not try to teach school There are better ways of managing
246_122825_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall try 
none	none	to win my pupils affections and then they will WANT to do what I tell them But suppose they don t said practical Jane I wouldn t whip them anyhow I m sure it wouldn t do any good Oh don t whip your pupils Jane dear no matter what they do What do you think about it Gilbert demanded Jane Don t you think there are some children who really need a whipping now and then Don t you think it s a cruel barbarous thing to whip a child ANY child exclaimed Anne her face flushing with earnestness Well said Gilbert slowly torn between his real convictions and his wish to measure up to Anne s ideal there s something to be said on both sides I don t believe in whipping children MUCH I think as you say Anne that there are better ways of managing as a rule and that corporal punishment should be a last resort But on the other hand as Jane says I believe there is an occasional child who can t be influenced in any other way and who in short needs a whipping and would be improved by it Corporal punishment as a last resort is to be my rule Gilbert having tried to please both sides succeeded as is usual and eminently right in pleasing neither Jane tossed her head I ll whip my pupils when they re naughty It s the shortest and easiest way of convincing them Anne gave Gilbert a disappointed glance I shall never whip a child she repeated firmly I feel sure it isn t either right or necessary Suppose a boy sauced you back when you told him to do something said Jane I d keep him in after school and talk kindly and firmly to him said Anne There is some good in every person if you can find it It is a teacher s duty to find and develop it That is what our School Management professor at Queen s told us you know Do you suppose you could find any good in a child by whipping him It s far more important to influence the children aright than it is even to teach them the three R s Professor Rennie says But the Inspector examines them in the three R s mind you and he won t give you a good report if they don t come up to his standard protested Jane I d rather have my pupils love me and look back to me in after years as a real helper than be on the roll of honor asserted Anne decidedly Wouldn t you punish children at all when they misbehaved asked Gilbert Oh yes I suppose I shall have to although I know I ll hate to do it But you can keep them in at recess or stand them on the floor or give them lines to write I suppose you won t punish the girls by making them sit with the boys said Jane slyly Gilbert and Anne looked at each other and smiled rather foolishly Once upon a time Anne had been made to sit with Gilbert for punishment and sad and bitter had been the consequences thereof Well time will tell which is the best way said Jane philosophically as they parted Anne went back to Green Gables by way of Birch Path shadowy rustling fern scented through Violet Vale and past Willowmere where dark and light kissed each other under the firs and down through Lover s Lane spots she and Diana had so named long ago She walked slowly enjoying the sweetness of wood and field and the starry summer twilight and thinking soberly about the new duties she was to take up on the morrow When she reached the yard at Green Gables missus Lynde s loud decided tones floated out through the open kitchen window missus Lynde has come up to give me good advice about tomorrow thought Anne with a grimace but I don t believe I ll go in Her advice is much like pepper I think excellent in small quantities but rather scorching in her doses I ll run over and have a chat with mister Harrison instead This was not the first time Anne had run over and chatted with mister Harrison since the notable affair of the Jersey cow She had been there several evenings and mister Harrison and she were very good friends although there were times and seasons when Anne found the outspokenness on which he prided himself rather trying Ginger still continued to regard her with suspicion and never failed to greet her sarcastically as redheaded snippet mister Harrison had tried vainly to break him of the habit by jumping excitedly up whenever he saw Anne coming and exclaiming Bless my soul here s that pretty little girl again or something equally flattering But Ginger saw through the scheme and scorned it Anne was never to know how many compliments mister Harrison paid her behind her back He certainly never paid her any to her face Well I suppose you ve been back in the woods laying in a supply of switches for tomorrow was his greeting as Anne came up the veranda steps No indeed said Anne indignantly She was an excellent target for teasing because she always took things so seriously I shall never have a switch in my school mister Harrison Of course I shall have to have a pointer but I shall use it for pointing ONLY So you mean to strap them instead Well I don t know but you re right A switch stings more at the time but the strap smarts longer that s a fact I shall not use anything of the sort I m not going to whip my pupils Bless my soul exclaimed mister Harrison in genuine astonishment how do you lay out to keep order then I shall govern by affection mister Harrison It won t do said mister Harrison won t do at all Anne Spare the rod and spoil the child When I went to school the master whipped me regular every day because he said if I wasn t in mischief just then I was plotting it Methods have changed since your schooldays mister Harrison But human nature hasn t Mark my words you ll never manage the young fry unless you keep a rod in pickle for them The thing is impossible Well I m going to try my way first said Anne who had a fairly strong will of her own and was apt to cling very tenaciously to her theories You re pretty stubborn I reckon was mister Harrison s way of putting it Well well we ll see Someday when you get riled up and people with hair like yours are desperate apt to get riled you ll forget all your pretty little notions and give some of them a whaling You re too young to be teaching anyhow far too young and childish Altogether Anne went to bed that night in a rather pessimistic mood She slept poorly and was so pale and tragic at breakfast next morning that Marilla was alarmed and insisted on making her take a cup of scorching ginger tea Anne sipped it patiently although she could not imagine what good ginger tea would do Had it been some magic brew potent to confer age and experience Anne would have swallowed a quart of it without flinching Marilla what if I fail You ll hardly fail completely in one day and there s plenty more days coming said Marilla The trouble with you Anne is that you ll expect to teach those children everything and reform all their faults right off and if you can t you ll think you ve failed V A Full fledged Schoolma am When Anne reached the school that morning for the first time in her life she had traversed the Birch Path deaf and blind to its beauties all was quiet and still The preceding teacher had trained the children to be in their places at her arrival and when Anne entered the schoolroom she was confronted by prim rows of shining morning faces and bright inquisitive eyes She hung up her hat and faced her pupils hoping that she did not look as frightened and foolish as she felt and that they would not perceive how she was trembling She had sat up until nearly twelve the preceding night composing a speech she meant to make to her pupils upon opening the school She had revised and improved it painstakingly and then she had learned it off by heart It was a very good speech and had some very fine ideas in it especially about mutual help and earnest striving after knowledge The only trouble was that she could not now remember a word of it After what seemed to her a year about ten seconds in reality she said faintly Take your Testaments please and sank breathlessly into her chair under cover of the rustle and clatter of desk lids that followed While the children read their verses Anne marshalled her shaky wits into order and looked over the array of little pilgrims to the Grownup Land Most of them were of course quite well known to her Her own classmates had passed out in the preceding year but the rest had all gone to school with her excepting the primer class and ten newcomers to Avonlea Anne secretly felt more interest in these ten than in those whose possibilities were already fairly well mapped out to her To be sure they might be just as commonplace as the rest but on the other hand there MIGHT be a genius among them It was a thrilling idea Sitting by himself at a corner desk was Anthony Pye He had a dark sullen little face and was staring at Anne with a hostile expression in his black eyes Anne instantly made up her mind that she would win that boy s affection and discomfit the Pyes utterly In the other corner another strange boy was sitting with Arty Sloane a jolly looking little chap with a snub nose freckled face and big light blue eyes fringed with whitish lashes probably the DonNELL boy and if resemblance went for anything his sister was sitting across the aisle with Mary Bell Anne wondered what sort of mother the child had to send her to school dressed as she was She wore a faded pink silk dress trimmed with a great deal of cotton lace soiled white kid slippers and silk stockings Her sandy hair was tortured into innumerable kinky and unnatural curls surmounted by a flamboyant bow of pink ribbon bigger than her head Judging from her expression she was very well satisfied with herself A pale little thing with smooth ripples of fine silky fawn colored hair flowing over her shoulders must Anne thought be Annetta Bell whose parents had formerly lived in the Newbridge school district but by reason of hauling their house fifty yards north of its old site were now in Avonlea Three pallid little girls crowded into one seat were certainly Cottons and there was no doubt that the small beauty with the long brown curls and hazel eyes who was casting coquettish looks at Jack Gills over the edge of her Testament was Prillie Rogerson whose father had recently married a second wife and brought Prillie home from her grandmother s in Grafton A tall awkward girl in a back seat who seemed to have too many feet and hands Anne could not place at all but later on discovered that her name was Barbara Shaw and that she had come to live with an Avonlea aunt She was also to find that if Barbara ever managed to walk down the aisle without falling over her own or somebody else s feet the Avonlea scholars wrote the unusual fact up on the porch wall to commemorate it But when Anne s eyes met those of the boy at the front desk facing her own a queer little thrill went over her as if she had found her genius She knew this must be Paul Irving and that missus Rachel Lynde had been right for once when she prophesied that he would be unlike the Avonlea children More than that Anne realized that he was unlike other children anywhere and that there was a soul subtly akin to her own gazing at her out of the very dark blue eyes that were watching her so intently She knew Paul was ten but he looked no more than eight He had the most beautiful little face she had ever seen in a child features of exquisite delicacy and refinement framed in a halo of chestnut curls His mouth was delicious being full without pouting the crimson lips just softly touching and curving into finely finished little corners that narrowly escaped being dimpled He had a sober grave meditative expression as if his spirit was much older than his body but when Anne smiled softly at him it vanished in a sudden answering smile which seemed an illumination of his whole being as if some lamp had suddenly kindled into flame inside of him irradiating him from top to toe Best of all it was involuntary born of no external effort or motive but simply the outflashing of a hidden personality rare and fine and sweet With a quick interchange of smiles Anne and Paul were fast friends forever before a word had passed between them The day went by like a dream Anne could never clearly recall it afterwards It almost seemed as if it were not she who was teaching but somebody else She heard classes and worked sums and set copies mechanically The children behaved quite well only two cases of discipline occurred Morley Andrews was caught driving a pair of trained crickets in the aisle Anne stood Morley on the platform for an hour and which Morley felt much more keenly confiscated his crickets She put them in a box and on the way from school set them free in Violet Vale but Morley believed then and ever afterwards that she took them home and kept them for her own amusement The other culprit was Anthony Pye who poured the last drops of water from his slate bottle down the back of Aurelia Clay s neck Anne kept Anthony in at recess and talked to him about what was expected of gentlemen admonishing him that they never poured water down ladies necks She wanted all her boys to be gentlemen she said Her little lecture was quite kind and touching but unfortunately Anthony remained absolutely untouched He listened to her in silence with the same sullen expression and whistled scornfully as he went out Anne sighed and then cheered herself up by remembering that winning a Pye s affections like the building of Rome wasn t the work of a day In fact it was doubtful whether some of the Pyes had any affections to win but Anne hoped better things of Anthony who looked as if he might be a rather nice boy if one ever got behind his sullenness When school was dismissed and the children had gone Anne dropped wearily into her chair Her head ached and she felt woefully discouraged There was no real reason for discouragement since nothing very dreadful had occurred but Anne was very tired and inclined to believe that she would never learn to like teaching And how terrible it would be to be doing something you didn t like every day for well say forty years Anne was of two minds whether to have her cry out then and there or wait till she was safely in her own white room at home Before she could decide there was a click of heels and a silken swish on the porch floor and Anne found herself confronted by a lady whose appearance made her recall a recent criticism of mister Harrison s on an overdressed female he had seen in a Charlottetown store She looked like a head on collision between a fashion plate and a nightmare The newcomer was gorgeously arrayed in a pale blue summer silk puffed frilled and shirred wherever puff frill or shirring could possibly be placed Her head was surmounted by a huge white chiffon hat bedecked with three long but rather stringy ostrich feathers A veil of pink chiffon lavishly sprinkled with huge black dots hung like a flounce from the hat brim to her shoulders and floated off in two airy streamers behind her She wore all the jewelry that could be crowded on one small woman and a very strong odor of perfume attended her I am missus DonNELL missus H B DonNELL announced this vision and I have come in to see you about something Clarice Almira told me when she came home to dinner today It annoyed me EXCESSIVELY I m sorry faltered Anne vainly trying to recollect any incident of the morning connected with the Donnell children Clarice Almira told me that you pronounced our name DONnell Now Miss Shirley the correct pronunciation of our name is DonNELL accent on the last syllable I hope you ll remember this in future I ll try to gasped Anne choking back a wild desire to laugh I know by experience that it s very unpleasant to have one s name SPELLED wrong and I suppose it must be even worse to have it pronounced wrong Certainly it is And Clarice Almira also informed me that you call my son Jacob He told me his name was Jacob protested Anne I might well have expected that said missus H B Donnell in a tone which implied that gratitude in children was not to be looked for in this degenerate age That boy has such plebeian tastes Miss Shirley When he was born I wanted to call him saint Clair it sounds SO aristocratic doesn t it But his father insisted he should be called Jacob after his uncle I yielded because Uncle Jacob was a rich old bachelor And what do you think Miss Shirley When our innocent boy was five years old Uncle Jacob actually went and got married and now he has three boys of his own Did you ever hear of such ingratitude The moment the invitation to the wedding for he had the impertinence to send us an invitation Miss Shirley came to the house I said No more Jacobs for me thank you From that day I called my son saint Clair and saint Clair I am determined he shall be called His father obstinately continues to call him Jacob and the boy himself has a perfectly unaccountable preference for the vulgar name But saint Clair he is and saint Clair he shall remain You will kindly remember this Miss Shirley will you not THANK you I told Clarice Almira that I was sure it was only a misunderstanding and that a word would set it right Donnell accent on the last syllable and saint Clair on no account Jacob You ll remember THANK you When missus H B DonNELL had skimmed away Anne locked the school door and went home At the foot of the hill she found Paul Irving by the Birch Path He held out to her a cluster of the dainty little wild orchids which Avonlea children called rice lillies Please teacher I found these in mister Wright s field he said shyly and I came back to give them to you because I thought you were the kind of lady that would like them and because he lifted his big beautiful eyes I like you teacher You darling said Anne taking the fragrant spikes As if Paul s words had been a spell of magic discouragement and weariness passed from her spirit and hope upwelled in her heart like a dancing fountain She went through the Birch Path light footedly attended by the sweetness of her orchids as by a benediction Well how did you get along Marilla wanted to know Ask me that a month later and I may be able to tell you I can t now I don t know myself I m too near it My thoughts feel as if they had been all stirred up until they were thick and muddy The only thing I feel really sure of having accomplished today is that I taught Cliffie Wright that A is A He never knew it before Isn t it something to have started a soul along a path that may end in Shakespeare and Paradise Lost missus Lynde came up later on with more encouragement That good lady had waylaid the schoolchildren at her gate and demanded of them how they liked their new teacher And every one of them said they liked you splendid Anne except Anthony Pye I must admit he didn t He said you weren t any good just like all girl teachers There s the Pye leaven for you But never mind I m not going to mind said Anne quietly and I m going to make Anthony Pye like me yet Patience and kindness will surely win him Well you can never tell about a Pye said missus Rachel cautiously They go by contraries like dreams often as not As for that DonNELL woman she ll get no DonNELLing from me I can assure you The name is DONnell and always has been The woman is crazy that s what She has a pug dog she calls Queenie and it has its meals at the table along with the family eating off a china plate I d be afraid of a judgment if I was her Thomas says Donnell himself is a sensible hard working man but he hadn t much gumption when he picked out a wife that s what VI All Sorts and Conditions of Men and women A September day on Prince Edward Island hills a crisp wind blowing up over the sand dunes from the sea a long red road winding through fields and woods now looping itself about a corner of thick set spruces now threading a plantation of young maples with great feathery sheets of ferns beneath them now dipping down into a hollow where a brook flashed out of the woods and into them again now basking in open sunshine between ribbons of golden rod and smoke blue asters air athrill with the pipings of myriads of crickets those glad little pensioners of the summer hills a plump brown pony ambling along the road two girls behind him full to the lips with the simple priceless joy of youth and life Oh this is a day left over from Eden isn t it Diana and Anne sighed for sheer happiness The air has magic in it Look at the purple in the cup of the harvest valley Diana And oh do smell the dying fir It s coming up from that little sunny hollow where mister Eben Wright has been cutting fence poles Bliss is it on such a day to be alive but to smell dying fir is very heaven That s two thirds Wordsworth and one third Anne Shirley It doesn t seem possible that there should be dying fir in heaven does it And yet it doesn t seem to me that heaven would be quite perfect if you couldn t get a whiff of dead fir as you went through its woods Perhaps we ll have the odor there without the death Yes I think that will be the way That delicious aroma must be the souls of the firs and of course it will be just souls in heaven Trees haven t souls said practical Diana but the smell of dead fir is certainly lovely I m going to make a cushion and fill it with fir needles You d better make one too Anne I think I shall and use it for my naps I d be certain to dream I was a dryad or a woodnymph then But just this minute I m well content to be Anne Shirley Avonlea schoolma am driving over a road like this on such a sweet friendly day It s a lovely day but we have anything but a lovely task before us sighed Diana Why on earth did you offer to canvass this road Anne Almost all the cranks in Avonlea live along it and we ll probably be treated as if we were begging for ourselves It s the very worst road of all That is why I chose it Of course Gilbert and Fred would have taken this road if we had asked them But you see Diana I feel myself responsible for the A V I S since I was the first to suggest it and it seems to me that I ought to do the most disagreeable things I m sorry on your account but you needn t say a word at the cranky places I ll do all the talking missus Lynde would say I was well able to missus Lynde doesn t know whether to approve of our enterprise or not She inclines to when she remembers that mister and missus Allan are in favor of it but the fact that village improvement societies first originated in the States is a count against it So she is halting between two opinions and only success will justify us in missus Lynde s eyes Priscilla is going to write a paper for our next Improvement meeting and I expect it will be good for her aunt is such a clever writer and no doubt it runs in the family I shall never forget the thrill it gave me when I found out that missus Charlotte E Morgan was Priscilla s aunt It seemed so wonderful that I was a friend of the girl whose aunt wrote Edgewood Days and The Rosebud Garden Where does missus Morgan live In Toronto And Priscilla says she is coming to the Island for a visit next summer and if it is possible Priscilla is going to arrange to have us meet her That seems almost too good to be true but it s something pleasant to imagine after you go to bed The Avonlea Village Improvement Society was an organized fact Gilbert Blythe was president Fred Wright vice president Anne Shirley secretary and Diana Barry treasurer The Improvers as they were promptly christened were to meet once a fortnight at the homes of the members It was admitted that they could not expect to affect many improvements so late in the season but they meant to plan the next summer s campaign collect and discuss ideas write and read papers and as Anne said educate the public sentiment generally There was some disapproval of course and which the Improvers felt much more keenly a good deal of ridicule mister Elisha Wright was reported to have said that a more appropriate name for the organization would be Courting Club missus Hiram Sloane declared she had heard the Improvers meant to plough up all the roadsides and set them out with geraniums mister Levi Boulter warned his neighbors that the Improvers would insist that everybody pull down his house and rebuild it after plans approved by the society mister James Spencer sent them word that he wished they would kindly shovel down the church hill Eben Wright told Anne that he wished the Improvers could induce old Josiah Sloane to keep his whiskers trimmed mister Lawrence Bell said he would whitewash his barns if nothing else would please them but he would NOT hang lace curtains in the cowstable windows mister Major Spencer asked Clifton Sloane an Improver who drove the milk to the Carmody cheese factory if it was true that everybody would have to have his milk stand hand painted next summer and keep an embroidered centerpiece on it In spite of or perhaps human nature being what it is because of this the Society went gamely to work at the only improvement they could hope to bring about that fall At the second meeting in the Barry parlor Oliver Sloane moved that they start a subscription to re shingle and paint the hall Julia Bell seconded it with an uneasy feeling that she was doing something not exactly ladylike Gilbert put the motion it was carried unanimously and Anne gravely recorded it in her minutes The next thing was to appoint a committee and Gertie Pye determined not to let Julia Bell carry off all the laurels boldly moved that Miss Jane Andrews be chairman of said committee This motion being also duly seconded and carried Jane returned the compliment by appointing Gertie on the committee along with Gilbert Anne Diana and Fred Wright The committee chose their routes in private conclave Anne and Diana were told off for the Newbridge road Gilbert and Fred for the White Sands road and Jane and Gertie for the Carmody road Because explained Gilbert to Anne as 
246_122825_000028_000001	train-clean-360	they walked home together 
none	none	through the Haunted Wood the Pyes all live along that road and they won t give a cent unless one of themselves canvasses them The next Saturday Anne and Diana started out They drove to the end of the road and canvassed homeward calling first on the Andrew girls If Catherine is alone we may get something said Diana but if Eliza is there we won t Eliza was there very much so and looked even grimmer than usual Miss Eliza was one of those people who give you the impression that life is indeed a vale of tears and that a smile never to speak of a laugh is a waste of nervous energy truly reprehensible The Andrew girls had been girls for fifty odd years and seemed likely to remain girls to the end of their earthly pilgrimage Catherine it was said had not entirely given up hope but Eliza who was born a pessimist had never had any They lived in a little brown house built in a sunny corner scooped out of Mark Andrew s beech woods Eliza complained that it was terrible hot in summer but Catherine was wont to say it was lovely and warm in winter Eliza was sewing patchwork not because it was needed but simply as a protest against the frivolous lace Catherine was crocheting Eliza listened with a frown and Catherine with a smile as the girls explained their errand To be sure whenever Catherine caught Eliza s eye she discarded the smile in guilty confusion but it crept back the next moment If I had money to waste said Eliza grimly I d burn it up and have the fun of seeing a blaze maybe but I wouldn t give it to that hall not a cent It s no benefit to the settlement just a place for young folks to meet and carry on when they s better be home in their beds Oh Eliza young folks must have some amusement protested Catherine I don t see the necessity We didn t gad about to halls and places when we were young Catherine Andrews This world is getting worse every day I think it s getting better said Catherine firmly YOU think Miss Eliza s voice expressed the utmost contempt It doesn t signify what you THINK Catherine Andrews Facts is facts Well I always like to look on the bright side Eliza There isn t any bright side Oh indeed there is cried Anne who couldn t endure such heresy in silence Why there are ever so many bright sides Miss Andrews It s really a beautiful world You won t have such a high opinion of it when you ve lived as long in it as I have retorted Miss Eliza sourly and you won t be so enthusiastic about improving it either How is your mother Diana Dear me but she has failed of late She looks terrible run down And how long is it before Marilla expects to be stone blind Anne The doctor thinks her eyes will not get any worse if she is very careful faltered Anne Eliza shook her head Doctors always talk like that just to keep people cheered up I wouldn t have much hope if I was her It s best to be prepared for the worst But oughtn t we be prepared for the best too pleaded Anne It s just as likely to happen as the worst Not in my experience and I ve fifty seven years to set against your sixteen retorted Eliza Going are you Well I hope this new society of yours will be able to keep Avonlea from running any further down hill but I haven t much hope of it Anne and Diana got themselves thankfully out and drove away as fast as the fat pony could go As they rounded the curve below the beech wood a plump figure came speeding over mister Andrews pasture waving to them excitedly It was Catherine Andrews and she was so out of breath that she could hardly speak but she thrust a couple of quarters into Anne s hand That s my contribution to painting the hall she gasped I d like to give you a dollar but I don t dare take more from my egg money for Eliza would find it out if I did I m real interested in your society and I believe you re going to do a lot of good I m an optimist I HAVE to be living with Eliza I must hurry back before she misses me she thinks I m feeding the hens I hope you ll have good luck canvassing and don t be cast down over what Eliza said The world IS getting better it certainly is The next house was Daniel Blair s Now it all depends on whether his wife is home or not said Diana as they jolted along a deep rutted lane If she is we won t get a cent Everybody says Dan Blair doesn t dare have his hair cut without asking her permission and it s certain she s very close to state it moderately She says she has to be just before she s generous But missus Lynde says she s so much before that generosity never catches up with her at all Anne related their experience at the Blair place to Marilla that evening We tied the horse and then rapped at the kitchen door Nobody came but the door was open and we could hear somebody in the pantry going on dreadfully We couldn t make out the words but Diana says she knows they were swearing by the sound of them I can t believe that of mister Blair for he is always so quiet and meek but at least he had great provocation for Marilla when that poor man came to the door red as a beet with perspiration streaming down his face he had on one of his wife s big gingham aprons I can t get this durned thing off he said for the strings are tied in a hard knot and I can t bust em so you ll have to excuse me ladies We begged him not to mention it and went in and sat down mister Blair sat down too he twisted the apron around to his back and rolled it up but he did look so ashamed and worried that I felt sorry for him and Diana said she feared we had called at an inconvenient time Oh not at all said mister Blair trying to smile you know he is always very polite I m a little busy getting ready to bake a cake as it were My wife got a telegram today that her sister from Montreal is coming tonight and she s gone to the train to meet her and left orders for me to make a cake for tea She writ out the recipe and told me what to do but I ve clean forgot half the directions already And it says flavor according to taste What does that mean How can you tell And what if my taste doesn t happen to be other people s taste Would a tablespoon of vanilla be enough for a small layer cake I felt sorrier than ever for the poor man He didn t seem to be in his proper sphere at all I had heard of henpecked husbands and now I felt that I saw one It was on my lips to say mister Blair if you ll give us a subscription for the hall I ll mix up your cake for you But I suddenly thought it wouldn t be neighborly to drive too sharp a bargain with a fellow creature in distress So I offered to mix the cake for him without any conditions at all He just jumped at my offer He said he d been used to making his own bread before he was married but he feared cake was beyond him and yet he hated to disappoint his wife He got me another apron and Diana beat the eggs and I mixed the cake mister Blair ran about and got us the materials He had forgotten all about his apron and when he ran it streamed out behind him and Diana said she thought she would die to see it He said he could bake the cake all right he was used to that and then he asked for our list and he put down four dollars So you see we were rewarded But even if he hadn t given a cent I d always feel that we had done a truly Christian act in helping him Theodore White s was the next stopping place Neither Anne nor Diana had ever been there before and they had only a very slight acquaintance with missus Theodore who was not given to hospitality Should they go to the back or front door While they held a whispered consultation missus Theodore appeared at the front door with an armful of newspapers Deliberately she laid them down one by one on the porch floor and the porch steps and then down the path to the very feet of her mystified callers Will you please wipe your feet carefully on the grass and then walk on these papers she said anxiously I ve just swept the house all over and I can t have any more dust tracked in The path s been real muddy since the rain yesterday Don t you dare laugh warned Anne in a whisper as they marched along the newspapers And I implore you Diana not to look at me no matter what she says or I shall not be able to keep a sober face The papers extended across the hall and into a prim fleckless parlor Anne and Diana sat down gingerly on the nearest chairs and explained their errand missus White heard them politely interrupting only twice once to chase out an adventurous fly and once to pick up a tiny wisp of grass that had fallen on the carpet from Anne s dress Anne felt wretchedly guilty but missus White subscribed two dollars and paid the money down to prevent us from having to go back for it Diana said when they got away missus White had the newspapers gathered up before they had their horse untied and as they drove out of the yard they saw her busily wielding a broom in the hall I ve always heard that missus Theodore White was the neatest woman alive and I ll believe it after this said Diana giving way to her suppressed laughter as soon as it was safe I am glad she has no children said Anne solemnly It would be dreadful beyond words for them if she had At the Spencers missus Isabella Spencer made them miserable by saying something ill natured about everyone in Avonlea mister Thomas Boulter refused to give anything because the hall when it had been built twenty years before hadn t been built on the site he recommended missus Esther Bell who was the picture of health took half an hour to detail all her aches and pains and sadly put down fifty cents because she wouldn t be there that time next year to do it no she would be in her grave Their worst reception however was at Simon Fletcher s When they drove into the yard they saw two faces peering at them through the porch window But although they rapped and waited patiently and persistently nobody came to the door Two decidedly ruffled and indignant girls drove away from Simon Fletcher s Even Anne admitted that she was beginning to feel discouraged But the tide turned after that Several Sloane homesteads came next where they got liberal subscriptions and from that to the end they fared well with only an occasional snub Their last place of call was at Robert Dickson s by the pond bridge They stayed to tea here although they were nearly home rather than risk offending missus Dickson who had the reputation of being a very touchy woman While they were there old missus James White called in I ve just been down to Lorenzo s she announced He s the proudest man in Avonlea this minute What do you think There s a brand new boy there and after seven girls that s quite an event I can tell you Anne pricked up her ears and when they drove away she said I m going straight to Lorenzo White s But he lives on the White Sands road and it s quite a distance out of our way protested Diana Gilbert and Fred will canvass him They are not going around until next Saturday and it will be too late by then said Anne firmly The novelty will be worn off Lorenzo White is dreadfully mean but he will subscribe to ANYTHING just now We mustn t let such a golden opportunity slip Diana The result justified Anne s foresight mister White met them in the yard beaming like the sun upon an Easter day When Anne asked for a subscription he agreed enthusiastically Certain certain Just put me down for a dollar more than the highest subscription you ve got That will be five dollars mister Daniel Blair put down four said Anne half afraid But Lorenzo did not flinch Five it is and here s the money on the spot Now I want you to come into the house There s something in there worth seeing something very few people have seen as yet Just come in and pass YOUR opinion What will we say if the baby isn t pretty whispered Diana in trepidation as they followed the excited Lorenzo into the house Oh there will certainly be something else nice to say about it said Anne easily There always is about a baby The baby WAS pretty however and mister White felt that he got his five dollars worth of the girls honest delight over the plump little newcomer But that was the first last and only time that Lorenzo White ever subscribed to anything Anne tired as she was made one more effort for the public weal that night slipping over the fields to interview mister Harrison who was as usual smoking his pipe on the veranda with Ginger beside him Strickly speaking he was on the Carmody road but Jane and Gertie who were not acquainted with him save by doubtful report had nervously begged Anne to canvass him mister Harrison however flatly refused to subscribe a cent and all Anne s wiles were in vain But I thought you approved of our society mister Harrison she mourned So I do so I do but my approval doesn t go as deep as my pocket Anne A few more experiences such as I have had today would make me as much of a pessimist as Miss Eliza Andrews Anne told her reflection in the east gable mirror at bedtime VII The Pointing of Duty Anne leaned back in her chair one mild October evening and sighed She was sitting at a table covered with text books and exercises but the closely written sheets of paper before her had no apparent connection with studies or school work What is the matter asked Gilbert who had arrived at the open kitchen door just in time to hear the sigh Anne colored and thrust her writing out of sight under some school compositions Nothing very dreadful I was just trying to write out some of my thoughts as Professor Hamilton advised me but I couldn t get them to please me They seem so still and foolish directly they re written down on white paper with black ink Fancies are like shadows you can t cage them they re such wayward dancing things But perhaps I ll learn the secret some day if I keep on trying I haven t a great many spare moments you know By the time I finish correcting school exercises and compositions I don t always feel like writing any of my own You are getting on splendidly in school Anne All the children like you said Gilbert sitting down on the stone step No not all Anthony Pye doesn t and WON T like me What is worse he doesn t respect me no he doesn t He simply holds me in contempt and I don t mind confessing to you that it worries me miserably It isn t that he is so very bad he is only rather mischievous but no worse than some of the others He seldom disobeys me but he obeys with a scornful air of toleration as if it wasn t worthwhile disputing the point or he would and it has a bad effect on the others I ve tried every way to win him but I m beginning to fear I never shall I want to for he s rather a cute little lad if he IS a Pye and I could like him if he d let me Probably it s merely the effect of what he hears at home Not altogether Anthony is an independent little chap and makes up his own mind about things He has always gone to men before and he says girl teachers are no good Well we ll see what patience and kindness will do I like overcoming difficulties and teaching is really very interesting work Paul Irving makes up for all that is lacking in the others That child is a perfect darling Gilbert and a genius into the bargain I m persuaded the world will hear of him some day concluded Anne in a tone of conviction I like teaching too said Gilbert It s good training for one thing Why Anne I ve learned more in the weeks I ve been teaching the young ideas of White Sands than I learned in all the years I went to school myself We all seem to be getting on pretty well The Newbridge people like Jane I hear and I think White Sands is tolerably satisfied with your humble servant all except mister Andrew Spencer I met missus Peter Blewett on my way home last night and she told me she thought it her duty to inform me that mister Spencer didn t approve of my methods Have you ever noticed asked Anne reflectively that when people say it is their duty to tell you a certain thing you may prepare for something disagreeable Why is it that they never seem to think it a duty to tell you the pleasant things they hear about you missus H B DonNELL called at the school again yesterday and told me she thought it HER duty to inform me that missus Harmon Andrew didn t approve of my reading fairy tales to the children and that mister Rogerson thought Prillie wasn t coming on fast enough in arithmetic If Prillie would spend less time making eyes at the boys over her slate she might do better I feel quite sure that Jack Gillis works her class sums for her though I ve never been able to catch him red handed Have you succeeded in reconciling missus DonNELL s hopeful son to his saintly name Yes laughed Anne but it was really a difficult task At first when I called him saint Clair he would not take the least notice until I d spoken two or three times and then when the other boys nudged him he would look up with such an aggrieved air as if I d called him John or Charlie and he couldn t be expected to know I meant him So I kept him in after school one night and talked kindly to him I told him his mother wished me to call him saint Clair and I couldn t go against her wishes He saw it when it was all explained out he s really a very reasonable little fellow and he said I could call him saint Clair but that he d lick the stuffing out of any of the boys that tried it Of course I had to rebuke him again for using such shocking language Since then I call him saint Clair and the boys call him Jake and all goes smoothly He informs me that he means to be a carpenter but missus DonNELL says I am to make a college professor out of him The mention of college gave a new direction to Gilbert s thoughts and they talked for a time of their plans and wishes gravely earnestly hopefully as youth loves to talk while the future is yet an untrodden path full of wonderful possibilities Gilbert had finally made up his mind that he was going to be a doctor It s a splendid profession he said enthusiastically A fellow has to fight something all through life didn t somebody once define man as a fighting animal and I want to fight disease and pain and ignorance which are all members one of another I want to do my share of honest real work in the world Anne add a little to the sum of human knowledge that all the good men have been accumulating since it began The folks who lived before me have done so much for me that I want to show my gratitude by doing something for the folks who will live after me It seems to me that is the only way a fellow can get square with his obligations to the race I d like to add some beauty to life said Anne dreamily I don t exactly want to make people KNOW more though I know that IS the noblest ambition but I d love to make them have a pleasanter time because of me to have some little joy or happy thought that would never have existed if I hadn t been born I think you re fulfilling that ambition every day said Gilbert admiringly And he was right Anne was one of the children of light by birthright After she had passed through a life with a smile or a word thrown across it like a gleam of sunshine the owner of that life saw it for the time being at least as hopeful and lovely and of good report Finally Gilbert rose regretfully Well I must run up to MacPhersons Moody Spurgeon came home from Queen s today for Sunday and he was to bring me out a book Professor Boyd is lending me And I must get Marilla s tea She went to see missus Keith this evening and she will soon be back Anne had tea ready when Marilla came home the fire was crackling cheerily a vase of frost bleached ferns and ruby red maple leaves adorned the table and delectable odors of ham and toast pervaded the air But Marilla sank into her chair with a deep sigh Are your eyes troubling you Does your head ache queried Anne anxiously No I m only tired and worried It s about Mary and those children Mary is worse she can t last much longer And as for the twins I don t know what is to become of them Hasn t their uncle been heard from Yes Mary had a letter from him He s working in a lumber camp and shacking it whatever that means Anyway he says he can t possibly take the children till the spring He expects to be married then and will have a home to take them to but he says she must get some of the neighbors to keep them for the winter She says she can t bear to ask any of them Mary never got on any too well with the East Grafton people and that s a fact And the long and short of it is Anne that I m sure Mary wants me to take those children she didn t say so but she LOOKED it Oh Anne clasped her hands all athrill with excitement And of course you will Marilla won t you I haven t made up my mind said Marilla rather tartly I don t rush into things in your headlong way Anne Third cousinship is a pretty slim claim And it will be a fearful responsibility to have two children of six years to look after twins at that Marilla had an idea that twins were just twice as bad as single children Twins are very interesting at least one pair of them said Anne It s only when there are two or three pairs that it gets monotonous And I think it would be real nice for you to have something to amuse you when I m away in school I don t reckon there d be much amusement in it more worry and bother than anything else I should say It wouldn t be so risky if they were even as old as you were when I took you I wouldn t mind Dora so much she seems good and quiet But that Davy is a limb Anne was fond of children and her heart yearned over the Keith twins The remembrance of her own neglected childhood was very vivid with her still She knew that Marilla s only vulnerable point was her stern devotion to what she believed to be her duty and Anne skillfully marshalled her arguments along this line If Davy is naughty it s all the more reason why he should have good training isn t it Marilla If we don t take them we don t know who will nor what kind of influences may surround them Suppose missus Keith s next door neighbors the Sprotts were to take them missus Lynde says Henry Sprott is the most profane man that ever lived and you can t believe a word his children say Wouldn t it be dreadful to have the twins learn anything like that Or suppose they went to the Wiggins missus Lynde says that mister Wiggins sells everything off the place that can be sold and brings his family up on skim milk You wouldn t like your relations to be starved even if they were only third cousins would you It seems to me Marilla that it is our duty to take them I suppose it is assented Marilla gloomily I daresay I ll tell Mary I ll take them You needn t look so delighted Anne It will mean a good deal of extra work for you I can t sew a stitch on account of my eyes so you ll have to see to the making and mending of their clothes And you don t like sewing I hate it said Anne calmly but if you are willing to take those children from a sense of duty surely I can do their sewing from a sense of duty It does people good to have to do things they don t like in moderation VIII Marilla Adopts Twins missus Rachel Lynde was sitting at her kitchen window knitting a quilt just as she had been sitting one evening several years previously when Matthew Cuthbert had driven down over the hill with what missus Rachel called his imported orphan But that had been in springtime and this was late autumn and all the woods were leafless and the fields sere and brown The sun was just setting with a great deal of purple and golden pomp behind the dark woods west of Avonlea when a buggy drawn by a comfortable brown nag came down the hill missus Rachel peered at it eagerly There s Marilla getting home from the funeral she said to her husband who was lying on the kitchen lounge Thomas Lynde lay more on the lounge nowadays than he had been used to do but missus Rachel who was so sharp at noticing anything beyond her own household had not as yet noticed this And she s got the twins with her yes there s Davy leaning over the dashboard grabbing at the pony s tail and Marilla jerking him back Dora s sitting up on the seat as prim as you please She always looks as if she d just been starched and ironed Well poor Marilla is going to have her hands full this winter and no mistake Still I don t see that she could do anything less than take them under the circumstances and she ll have Anne to help her Anne s tickled to death over the whole business and she has a real knacky way with children I must say Dear me it doesn t seem a day since poor Matthew brought Anne herself home and everybody laughed at the idea of Marilla bringing up a child And now she has adopted twins You re never safe from being surprised till you re dead The fat pony jogged over the bridge in Lynde s Hollow and along the Green Gables lane Marilla s face was rather grim It was ten miles from East Grafton and Davy Keith seemed to be possessed with a passion for perpetual motion It was beyond Marilla s power to make him sit still and she had been in an agony the whole way lest he fall over the back of the wagon and break his neck or tumble over the dashboard under the pony s heels In despair she finally threatened to whip him soundly when she got him home Whereupon Davy climbed into her lap regardless of the reins flung his chubby arms about her neck and gave her a bear like hug I don t believe you mean it he said smacking her wrinkled cheek affectionately You don t LOOK like a lady who d whip a little boy just cause he couldn t keep still Didn t you find it awful hard to keep still when you was only s old as me No I always kept still when I was told said Marilla trying to speak sternly albeit she felt her heart waxing soft within her under Davy s impulsive caresses Well I s pose that was cause you was a girl said Davy squirming back to his place after another hug You WAS a girl once I s pose though it s awful funny to think of it Dora can sit still but there ain t much fun in it I don t think Seems to me it must be slow to be a girl Here Dora let me liven you up a bit Davy s method of livening up was to grasp Dora s curls in his fingers and give them a tug Dora shrieked and then cried How can you be such a naughty boy and your poor mother just laid in her grave this very day demanded Marilla despairingly But she was glad to die said Davy confidentially I know cause she told me so She was awful tired of being sick We d a long talk the night before she died She told me you was going to take me and Dora for the winter and I was to be a good boy I m going to be good but can t you be good running round just as well as sitting still And she said I was always to be kind to Dora and stand up for her and I m going to Do you call pulling her hair being kind to her Well I ain t going to let anybody else pull it said Davy doubling up his fists and frowning They d just better try it I didn t hurt her much she just cried cause she s a girl I m glad I m a boy but I m sorry I m a twin When Jimmy Sprott s sister conterdicks him he just says I m oldern you so of course I know better and that settles HER But I can t tell Dora that and she just goes on thinking diffrunt from me You might let me drive the gee gee for a spell since I m a man Altogether Marilla was a thankful woman when she drove into her own yard where the wind of the autumn night was dancing with the brown leaves Anne was at the gate to meet them and lift the twins out Dora submitted calmly to be kissed but Davy responded to Anne s welcome with one of his hearty hugs and the cheerful announcement I m mister Davy Keith At the supper table Dora behaved like a little lady but Davy s manners left much to be desired I m so hungry I ain t got time to eat p litely he said when Marilla reproved him Dora ain t half as hungry as I am Look at all the ex cise I took on the road here That cake s awful nice and plummy We haven t had any cake at home for ever n ever so long cause mother was too sick to make it and missus Sprott said it was as much as she could do to bake our bread for us And missus Wiggins never puts any plums in HER cakes Catch her Can I have another piece Marilla would have refused but Anne cut a generous second slice However she reminded Davy that he ought to say Thank you for it Davy merely grinned at her and took a huge bite When he had finished the slice he said If you ll give me ANOTHER piece I ll say thank you for IT No you have had plenty of cake said Marilla in a tone which Anne knew and Davy was to learn to be final Davy winked at Anne and then leaning over the table snatched Dora s first piece of cake from which she had just taken one dainty little bite out of her very fingers and opening his mouth to the fullest extent crammed the whole slice in Dora s lip trembled and Marilla was speechless with horror Anne promptly exclaimed with her best schoolma am air Oh Davy gentlemen don t do things like that I know they don t said Davy as soon as he could speak but I ain t a gemplum But don t you want to be said shocked Anne Course I do But you can t be a gemplum till you grow up Oh indeed you can Anne hastened to say thinking she saw a chance to sow good seed betimes You can begin to be a gentleman when you are a little boy And gentlemen NEVER snatch things from ladies or forget to say thank you or pull anybody s hair They don t have much fun that s a fact said Davy frankly I guess I ll wait till I m grown up to be one Marilla with a resigned air had cut another piece of cake for Dora She did not feel able to cope with Davy just then It had been a hard day for her what with the funeral and the long drive At that moment she looked forward to the future with a pessimism that would have done credit to Eliza Andrews herself The twins were not noticeably alike although both were fair Dora had long sleek curls that never got out of order Davy had a crop of fuzzy little yellow ringlets all over his round head Dora s hazel eyes were gentle and mild Davy s were as roguish and dancing as an elf s Dora s nose was straight Davy s a positive snub Dora had a prunes and prisms mouth Davy s was all smiles and besides he had a dimple in one cheek and none in the other which gave him a dear comical lopsided look when he laughed Mirth and mischief lurked in every corner of his little face They d better go to bed said Marilla who thought it was the easiest way to dispose of them Dora will sleep with me and you can put Davy in the west gable You re not afraid to sleep alone are you Davy No but I ain t going to bed for ever so long yet said Davy comfortably Oh yes you are That was all the much tried Marilla said but something in her tone squelched even Davy He trotted obediently upstairs with Anne When I m grown up the very first thing I m going to do is stay up ALL night just to see what it would be like he told her confidentially In after years Marilla never thought of that first week of the twins sojourn at Green Gables without a shiver Not that it really was so much worse than the weeks that followed it but it seemed so by reason of its novelty There was seldom a waking minute of any day when Davy was not in mischief or devising it but his first notable exploit occurred two days after his arrival on Sunday morning a fine warm day as hazy and mild as September Anne dressed him for church while Marilla attended to Dora Davy at first objected strongly to having his face washed Marilla washed it yesterday and missus Wiggins scoured me with hard soap the day of the funeral That s enough for one week I don t see the good of being so awful clean It s lots more comfable being dirty Paul Irving washes his face every day of his own accord said Anne astutely Davy had been an inmate of Green Gables for little over forty eight hours but he already worshipped Anne and hated Paul Irving whom he had heard Anne praising enthusiastically the day after his arrival If Paul Irving washed his face every day that settled it He Davy Keith would do it too if it killed him The same consideration induced him to submit meekly to the other details of his toilet and he was really a handsome little lad when all was done Anne felt an almost maternal pride in him as she led him into the old Cuthbert pew Davy behaved quite well at first being occupied in casting covert glances at all the small boys within view and wondering which was Paul Irving The first two hymns and the Scripture reading passed off uneventfully mister Allan was praying when the sensation came Lauretta White was sitting in front of Davy her head slightly bent and her fair hair hanging in two long braids between which a tempting expanse of white neck showed encased in a loose lace frill Lauretta was a fat placid looking child of eight who had conducted herself irreproachably in church from the very first day her mother carried her there an infant of six months Davy thrust his hand into his pocket and produced a caterpillar a furry squirming caterpillar Marilla saw and clutched at him but she was too late Davy dropped the caterpillar down Lauretta s neck Right into the middle of mister Allan s prayer burst a series of piercing shrieks The minister stopped appalled and opened his eyes Every head in the congregation flew up Lauretta White was dancing up and down in her pew clutching frantically at the back of her dress Ow mommer mommer ow take it off ow get it out ow that bad boy put it down my neck ow mommer it s going further down ow ow ow missus White rose and with a set face carried the hysterical writhing Lauretta out of church Her shrieks died away in the distance and mister Allan proceeded with the service But everybody felt that it was a failure that day For the first time in her life Marilla took no notice of the text and Anne sat with scarlet cheeks of mortification When they got home Marilla put Davy to bed and made him stay there for the rest of the day She would not give him any dinner but allowed him a plain tea of bread and milk Anne carried it to him and sat sorrowfully by him while he ate it with an unrepentant relish But Anne s mournful eyes troubled him I s pose he said reflectively that Paul Irving wouldn t have dropped a caterpillar down a girl s neck in church would he Indeed he wouldn t said Anne sadly Well I m kind of sorry I did it then conceded Davy But it was such a jolly big caterpillar I picked him up on the church steps just as we went in It seemed a pity to waste him And say wasn t it fun to hear that girl yell Tuesday afternoon the Aid Society met at Green Gables Anne hurried home from school for she knew that Marilla would need all the assistance she could give Dora neat and proper in her nicely starched white dress and black sash was sitting with the members of the Aid in the parlor speaking demurely when spoken to keeping silence when not and in every way comporting herself as a model child Davy blissfully dirty was making mud pies in the barnyard I told him he might said Marilla wearily I thought it would keep him out of worse mischief He can only get dirty at that We ll have our teas over before we call him to his Dora can have hers with us but I would never dare to let Davy sit down at the table with all the Aids here When Anne went to call the Aids to tea she found that Dora was not in the parlor missus Jasper Bell said Davy had come to the front door and called her out A hasty consultation with Marilla in the pantry resulted in a decision to let both children have their teas together later on Tea was half over when the dining room was invaded by a forlorn figure Marilla and Anne stared in dismay the Aids in amazement Could that be Dora that sobbing nondescript in a drenched dripping dress and hair from which the water was streaming on Marilla s new coin spot rug Dora what has happened to you cried Anne with a guilty glance at missus Jasper Bell whose family was said to be the only one in the world in which accidents never occurred Davy made me walk the pigpen fence wailed Dora I didn t want to but he called me a fraid cat And I fell off into the pigpen and my dress got all dirty and the pig runned right over me My dress was just awful but Davy said if I d stand under the pump he d wash it clean and I did and he pumped water all over me but my dress ain t a bit cleaner and my pretty sash and shoes is all spoiled Anne did the honors of the table alone for the rest of the meal while Marilla went upstairs and redressed Dora in her old clothes Davy was caught and sent to bed without any supper Anne went to his room at twilight and talked to him seriously a method in which she had great faith not altogether unjustified by results She told him she felt very badly over his conduct I feel sorry now myself admitted Davy but the trouble is I never feel sorry for doing things till after I ve did them Dora wouldn t help me make pies cause she was afraid of messing her clo es and that made me hopping mad I s pose Paul Irving wouldn t have made HIS sister walk a pigpen fence if he knew she d fall in No he would never dream of such a thing Paul is a perfect little gentleman Davy screwed his eyes tight shut and seemed to meditate on this for a time Then he crawled up and put his arms about Anne s neck snuggling his flushed little face down on her shoulder Anne don t you like me a little bit even if I ain t a good boy like Paul Indeed I do said Anne sincerely Somehow it was impossible to help liking Davy But I d like you better still if you weren t so naughty I did something else today went on Davy in a muffled voice I m sorry now but I m awful scared to tell you You won t be very cross will you And you won t tell Marilla will you I don t know Davy Perhaps I ought to tell her But I think I can promise you I won t if you promise me that you will never do it again whatever it is No I never will Anyhow it s not likely I d find any more of them this year I found this one on the cellar steps Davy what is it you ve done I put a toad in Marilla s bed You can go and take it out if you like But say Anne wouldn t it be fun to leave it there Davy Keith Anne sprang from Davy s clinging arms and flew across the hall to Marilla s room The bed was slightly rumpled She threw back the blankets in nervous haste and there in very truth was the toad blinking at her from under a pillow How can I carry that awful thing out moaned Anne with a shudder The fire shovel suggested itself to her and she crept down to get it while Marilla was busy in the pantry Anne had her own troubles carrying that toad downstairs for it hopped off the shovel three times and once she thought she had lost it in the hall When she finally deposited it in the cherry orchard she drew a long breath of relief If Marilla knew she d never feel safe getting into bed again in her life I m so glad that little sinner repented in time There s Diana signaling to me from her window I m glad I really feel the need of some diversion for what with Anthony Pye in school and Davy Keith at home my nerves have had about all they can endure for one day IX A Question of Color That old nuisance of a Rachel Lynde was here again today pestering me for a subscription towards buying a carpet for the vestry room said mister Harrison wrathfully I detest that woman more than anybody I know She can put a whole sermon text comment and application into six words and throw it at you like a brick Anne who was perched on the edge of the veranda enjoying the charm of a mild west wind blowing across a newly ploughed field on a gray November twilight and piping a quaint little melody among the twisted firs below the garden turned her dreamy face over her shoulder The trouble is you and missus Lynde don t understand one another she explained That is always what is wrong when people don t like each other I didn t like missus Lynde at first either but as soon as I came to understand her I learned to missus Lynde may be an acquired taste with some folks but I didn t keep on eating bananas because I was told I d learn to like them if I did growled mister Harrison And as for understanding her I understand that she is a confirmed busybody and I told her so Oh that must have hurt her feelings very much said Anne reproachfully How could you say such a thing I said some dreadful things to missus Lynde long ago but it was when I had lost my temper I couldn t say them DELIBERATELY It was the truth and I believe in telling the truth to everybody But you don t tell the whole truth objected Anne You only tell the disagreeable part of the truth Now you ve told me a dozen times that my hair was red but you ve never once told me that I had a nice nose I daresay you know it without any telling chuckled mister Harrison I know I have red hair too although it s MUCH darker than it used to be so there s no need of telling me that either Well well I ll try and not mention it again since you re so sensitive You must excuse me Anne I ve got a habit of being outspoken and folks mustn t mind it But they can t help minding it And I don t think it s any help that it s your habit What would you think of a person who went about sticking pins and needles into people and saying Excuse me you mustn t mind it it s just a habit I ve got You d think he was crazy wouldn t you And as for missus Lynde being a busybody perhaps she is But did you tell her she had a very kind heart and always helped the poor and never said a word when Timothy Cotton stole a crock of butter out of her dairy and told his wife he d bought it from her missus Cotton cast it up to her the next time they met that it tasted of turnips and missus Lynde just said she was sorry it had turned out so poorly I suppose she has some good qualities conceded mister Harrison grudgingly Most folks have I have some myself though you might never suspect it But anyhow I ain t going to give anything to that carpet Folks are everlasting begging for money here it seems to me How s your project of painting the hall coming on Splendidly We had a meeting of the A V I S last Friday night and found that we had plenty of money subscribed to paint the hall and shingle the roof too MOST people gave very liberally mister Harrison Anne was a sweet souled lass but she could instill some venom into innocent italics when occasion required

none	none	We have decided on a very pretty green The roof will be dark red of course mister Roger Pye is going to get the paint in town today Who s got the job mister Joshua Pye of Carmody He has nearly finished the shingling We had to give him the contract for every one of the Pyes and there are four families you know said they wouldn t give a cent unless Joshua got it They had subscribed twelve dollars between them and we thought that was too much to lose although some people think we shouldn t have given in to the Pyes missus Lynde says they try to run everything The main question is will this Joshua do his work well If he does I don t see that it matters whether his name is Pye or Pudding He has the reputation of being a good workman though they say he s a very peculiar man He hardly ever talks He s peculiar enough all right then said mister Harrison drily Or at least folks here will call him so I never was much of a talker till I came to Avonlea and then I had to begin in self defense or missus Lynde would have said I was dumb and started a subscription to have me taught sign language

none	none	I must I have some sewing to do for Dora this evening Besides Davy is probably breaking Marilla s heart with some new mischief by this time This morning the first thing he said was Where does the dark go Anne I want to know I told him it went around to the other side of the world but after breakfast he declared it didn t that it went down the well Marilla says she caught him hanging over the well box four times today trying to reach down to the dark He s a limb declared mister Harrison He came over here yesterday and pulled six feathers out of Ginger s tail before I could get in from the barn The poor bird has been moping ever since Those children must be a sight of trouble to you folks Everything that s worth having is some trouble said Anne secretly resolving to forgive Davy s next offence whatever it might be since he had avenged her on Ginger mister Roger Pye brought the hall paint home that night and mister Joshua Pye a surly taciturn man began painting the next day He was not disturbed in his task The hall was situated on what was called the lower road In late autumn this road was always muddy and wet and people going to Carmody traveled by the longer upper road The hall was so closely surrounded by fir woods that it was invisible unless you were near it mister Joshua Pye painted away in the solitude and independence that were so dear to his unsociable heart Friday afternoon he finished his job and went home to Carmody Soon after his departure missus Rachel Lynde drove by having braved the mud of the lower road out of curiosity to see what the hall looked like in its new coat of paint When she rounded the spruce curve she saw The sight affected missus Lynde oddly She dropped the reins held up her hands and said Gracious Providence She stared as if she could not believe her eyes Then she laughed almost hysterically

none	none	I knew those Pyes would make a mess of things missus Lynde drove home meeting several people on the road and stopping to tell them about the hall The news flew like wildfire Gilbert Blythe poring over a text book at home heard it from his father s hired boy at sunset and rushed breathlessly to Green Gables joined on the way by Fred Wright They found Diana Barry Jane Andrews and Anne Shirley despair personified at the yard gate of Green Gables under the big leafless willows It isn t true surely Anne exclaimed Gilbert It is true answered Anne looking like the muse of tragedy missus Lynde called on her way from Carmody to tell me Oh it is simply dreadful What is the use of trying to improve anything What is dreadful asked Oliver Sloane arriving at this moment with a bandbox he had brought from town for Marilla Haven t you heard said Jane wrathfully Well its simply this Joshua Pye has gone and painted the hall blue instead of green a deep brilliant blue the shade they use for painting carts and wheelbarrows And missus Lynde says it is the most hideous color for a building especially when combined with a red roof that she ever saw or imagined You could simply have knocked me down with a feather when I heard it It s heartbreaking after all the trouble we ve had How on earth could such a mistake have happened wailed Diana The blame of this unmerciful disaster was eventually narrowed down to the Pyes The Improvers had decided to use Morton Harris paints and the Morton Harris paint cans were numbered according to a color card A purchaser chose his shade on the card and ordered by the accompanying number Number one hundred forty seven was the shade of green desired and when mister Roger Pye sent word to the Improvers by his son John Andrew that he was going to town and would get their paint for them the Improvers told John Andrew to tell his father to get one hundred forty seven John Andrew always averred that he did so but mister Roger Pye as stanchly declared that John Andrew told him one hundred fifty seven and there the matter stands to this day That night there was blank dismay in every Avonlea house where an Improver lived The gloom at Green Gables was so intense that it quenched even Davy Anne wept and would not be comforted I must cry even if I am almost seventeen Marilla she sobbed It is so mortifying And it sounds the death knell of our society We ll simply be laughed out of existence In life as in dreams however things often go by contraries The Avonlea people did not laugh they were too angry Their money had gone to paint the hall and consequently they felt themselves bitterly aggrieved by the mistake Public indignation centered on the Pyes Roger Pye and John Andrew had bungled the matter between them and as for Joshua Pye he must be a born fool not to suspect there was something wrong when he opened the cans and saw the color of the paint Joshua Pye when thus animadverted upon retorted that the Avonlea taste in colors was no business of his whatever his private opinion might be he had been hired to paint the hall not to talk about it and he meant to have his money for it The Improvers paid him his money in bitterness of spirit after consulting mister Peter Sloane who was a magistrate You ll have to pay it Peter told him You can t hold him responsible for the mistake since he claims he was never told what the color was supposed to be but just given the cans and told to go ahead But it s a burning shame and that hall certainly does look awful The luckless Improvers expected that Avonlea would be more prejudiced than ever against them but instead public sympathy veered around in their favor People thought the eager enthusiastic little band who had worked so hard for their object had been badly used missus Lynde told them to keep on and show the Pyes that there really were people in the world who could do things without making a muddle of them mister Major Spencer sent them word that he would clean out all the stumps along the road front of his farm and seed it down with grass at his own expense and missus Hiram Sloane called at the school one day and beckoned Anne mysteriously out into the porch to tell her that if the Sassiety wanted to make a geranium bed at the crossroads in the spring they needn t be afraid of her cow for she would see that the marauding animal was kept within safe bounds Even mister Harrison chuckled if he chuckled at all in private and was all sympathy outwardly Never mind Anne Most paints fade uglier every year but that blue is as ugly as it can be to begin with so it s bound to fade prettier And the roof is shingled and painted all right Folks will be able to sit in the hall after this without being leaked on You ve accomplished so much anyhow But Avonlea s blue hall will be a byword in all the neighboring settlements from this time out said Anne bitterly And it must be confessed that it was X Davy in Search of a Sensation Anne walking home from school through the Birch Path one November afternoon felt convinced afresh that life was a very wonderful thing The day had been a good day all had gone well in her little kingdom saint Clair Donnell had not fought any of the other boys over the question of his name Prillie Rogerson s face had been so puffed up from the effects of toothache that she did not once try to coquette with the boys in her vicinity Barbara Shaw had met with only ONE accident spilling a dipper of water over the floor and Anthony Pye had not been in school at all What a nice month this November has been said Anne who had never quite got over her childish habit of talking to herself November is usually such a disagreeable month as if the year had suddenly found out that she was growing old and could do nothing but weep and fret over it This year is growing old gracefully just like a stately old lady who knows she can be charming even with gray hair and wrinkles We ve had lovely days and delicious twilights This last fortnight has been so peaceful and even Davy has been almost well behaved I really think he is improving a great deal How quiet the woods are today not a murmur except that soft wind purring in the treetops It sounds like surf on a faraway shore How dear the woods are You beautiful trees I love every one of you as a friend Anne paused to throw her arm about a slim young birch and kiss its cream white trunk Diana rounding a curve in the path saw her and laughed Anne Shirley you re only pretending to be grown up I believe when you re alone you re as much a little girl as you ever were Well one can t get over the habit of being a little girl all at once said Anne gaily You see I was little for fourteen years and I ve only been grown uppish for scarcely three I m sure I shall always feel like a child in the woods These walks home from school are almost the only time I have for dreaming except the half hour or so before I go to sleep I m so busy with teaching and studying and helping Marilla with the twins that I haven t another moment for imagining things You don t know what splendid adventures I have for a little while after I go to bed in the east gable every night I always imagine I m something very brilliant and triumphant and splendid a great prima donna or a Red Cross nurse or a queen Last night I was a queen It s really splendid to imagine you are a queen You have all the fun of it without any of the inconveniences and you can stop being a queen whenever you want to which you couldn t in real life But here in the woods I like best to imagine quite different things I m a dryad living in an old pine or a little brown wood elf hiding under a crinkled leaf That white birch you caught me kissing is a sister of mine The only difference is she s a tree and I m a girl but that s no real difference Where are you going Diana Down to the Dicksons I promised to help Alberta cut out her new dress Can t you walk down in the evening Anne and come home with me I might since Fred Wright is away in town said Anne with a rather too innocent face Diana blushed tossed her head and walked on She did not look offended however Anne fully intended to go down to the Dicksons that evening but she did not When she arrived at Green Gables she found a state of affairs which banished every other thought from her mind Marilla met her in the yard a wild eyed Marilla Anne Dora is lost Dora Lost Anne looked at Davy who was swinging on the yard gate and detected merriment in his eyes Davy do you know where she is No I don t said Davy stoutly I haven t seen her since dinner time cross my heart I ve been away ever since one o clock said Marilla Thomas Lynde took sick all of a sudden and Rachel sent up for me to go at once When I left here Dora was playing with her doll in the kitchen and Davy was making mud pies behind the barn I only got home half an hour ago and no Dora to be seen Davy declares he never saw her since I left Neither I did avowed Davy solemnly She must be somewhere around said Anne She would never wander far away alone you know how timid she is Perhaps she has fallen asleep in one of the rooms Marilla shook her head I ve hunted the whole house through But she may be in some of the buildings A thorough search followed Every corner of house yard and outbuildings was ransacked by those two distracted people Anne roved the orchards and the Haunted Wood calling Dora s name Marilla took a candle and explored the cellar Davy accompanied each of them in turn and was fertile in thinking of places where Dora could possibly be Finally they met again in the yard It s a most mysterious thing groaned Marilla Where can she be said Anne miserably Maybe she s tumbled into the well suggested Davy cheerfully Anne and Marilla looked fearfully into each other s eyes The thought had been with them both through their entire search but neither had dared to put it into words She she might have whispered Marilla Anne feeling faint and sick went to the wellbox and peered over The bucket sat on the shelf inside Far down below was a tiny glimmer of still water The Cuthbert well was the deepest in Avonlea If Dora but Anne could not face the idea She shuddered and turned away Run across for mister Harrison said Marilla wringing her hands mister Harrison and John Henry are both away they went to town today I ll go for mister Barry mister Barry came back with Anne carrying a coil of rope to which was attached a claw like instrument that had been the business end of a grubbing fork Marilla and Anne stood by cold and shaken with horror and dread while mister Barry dragged the well and Davy astride the gate watched the group with a face indicative of huge enjoyment Finally mister Barry shook his head with a relieved air She can t be down there It s a mighty curious thing where she could have got to though Look here young man are you sure you ve no idea where your sister is I ve told you a dozen times that I haven t said Davy with an injured air Maybe a tramp come and stole her Nonsense said Marilla sharply relieved from her horrible fear of the well Anne do you suppose she could have strayed over to mister Harrison s She has always been talking about his parrot ever since that time you took her over I can t believe Dora would venture so far alone but I ll go over and see said Anne Nobody was looking at Davy just then or it would have been seen that a very decided change came over his face He quietly slipped off the gate and ran as fast as his fat legs could carry him to the barn Anne hastened across the fields to the Harrison establishment in no very hopeful frame of mind The house was locked the window shades were down and there was no sign of anything living about the place She stood on the veranda and called Dora loudly Ginger in the kitchen behind her shrieked and swore with sudden fierceness but between his outbursts Anne heard a plaintive cry from the little building in the yard which served mister Harrison as a toolhouse Anne flew to the door unhasped it and caught up a small mortal with a tearstained face who was sitting forlornly on an upturned nail keg Oh Dora Dora what a fright you have given us How came you to be here Davy and I came over to see Ginger sobbed Dora but we couldn t see him after all only Davy made him swear by kicking the door And then Davy brought me here and run out and shut the door and I couldn t get out I cried and cried I was frightened and oh I m so hungry and cold and I thought you d never come Anne Davy But Anne could say no more She carried Dora home with a heavy heart Her joy at finding the child safe and sound was drowned out in the pain caused by Davy s behavior The freak of shutting Dora up might easily have been pardoned But Davy had told falsehoods downright coldblooded falsehoods about it That was the ugly fact and Anne could not shut her eyes to it She could have sat down and cried with sheer disappointment She had grown to love Davy dearly how dearly she had not known until this minute and it hurt her unbearably to discover that he was guilty of deliberate falsehood Marilla listened to Anne s tale in a silence that boded no good Davy ward mister Barry laughed and advised that Davy be summarily dealt with When he had gone home Anne soothed and warmed the sobbing shivering Dora got her her supper and put her to bed Then she returned to the kitchen just as Marilla came grimly in leading or rather pulling the reluctant cobwebby Davy whom she had just found hidden away in the darkest corner of the stable She jerked him to the mat on the middle of the floor and then went and sat down by the east window Anne was sitting limply by the west window Between them stood the culprit His back was toward Marilla and it was a meek subdued frightened back but his face was toward Anne and although it was a little shamefaced there was a gleam of comradeship in Davy s eyes as if he knew he had done wrong and was going to be punished for it but could count on a laugh over it all with Anne later on But no half hidden smile answered him in Anne s gray eyes as there might have done had it been only a question of mischief There was something else something ugly and repulsive How could you behave so Davy she asked sorrowfully Davy squirmed uncomfortably I just did it for fun Things have been so awful quiet here for so long that I thought it would be fun to give you folks a big scare It was too In spite of fear and a little remorse Davy grinned over the recollection But you told a falsehood about it Davy said Anne more sorrowfully than ever Davy looked puzzled What s a falsehood Do you mean a whopper I mean a story that was not true Course I did said Davy frankly If I hadn t you wouldn t have been scared I HAD to tell it Anne was feeling the reaction from her fright and exertions Davy s impenitent attitude gave the finishing touch Two big tears brimmed up in her eyes Oh Davy how could you she said with a quiver in her voice Don t you know how wrong it was Davy was aghast Anne crying he had made Anne cry A flood of real remorse rolled like a wave over his warm little heart and engulfed it He rushed to Anne hurled himself into her lap flung his arms around her neck and burst into tears I didn t know it was wrong to tell whoppers he sobbed How did you expect me to know it was wrong All mister Sprott s children told them REGULAR every day and cross their hearts too I s pose Paul Irving never tells whoppers and here I ve been trying awful hard to be as good as him but now I s pose you ll never love me again But I think you might have told me it was wrong I m awful sorry I ve made you cry Anne and I ll never tell a whopper again Davy buried his face in Anne s shoulder and cried stormily Anne in a sudden glad flash of understanding held him tight and looked over his curly thatch at Marilla He didn t know it was wrong to tell falsehoods Marilla I think we must forgive him for that part of it this time if he will promise never to say what isn t true again I never will now that I know it s bad asseverated Davy between sobs If you ever catch me telling a whopper again you can Davy groped mentally for a suitable penance you can skin me alive Anne Don t say whopper Davy say falsehood said the schoolma am Why queried Davy settling comfortably down and looking up with a tearstained investigating face Why ain t whopper as good as falsehood I want to know It s just as big a word It s slang and it s wrong for little boys to use slang There s an awful lot of things it s wrong to do said Davy with a sigh I never s posed there was so many I m sorry it s wrong to tell whop falsehoods cause it s awful handy but since it is I m never going to tell any more What are you going to do to me for telling them this time I want to know Anne looked beseechingly at Marilla I don t want to be too hard on the child said Marilla I daresay nobody ever did tell him it was wrong to tell lies and those Sprott children were no fit companions for him Poor Mary was too sick to train him properly and I presume you couldn t expect a six year old child to know things like that by instinct I suppose we ll just have to assume he doesn t know ANYTHING right and begin at the beginning But he ll have to be punished for shutting Dora up and I can t think of any way except to send him to bed without his supper and we ve done that so often Can t you suggest something else Anne I should think you ought to be able to with that imagination you re always talking of But punishments are so horrid and I like to imagine only pleasant things said Anne cuddling Davy There are so many unpleasant things in the world already that there is no use in imagining any more In the end Davy was sent to bed as usual there to remain until noon next day He evidently did some thinking for when Anne went up to her room a little later she heard him calling her name softly Going in she found him sitting up

none	none	I love you when you laugh and when you sigh even when you look disdainful I never saw you look cross though Anthony Pye says you always look so but I don t wonder you look cross at him for he deserves it I love you in every dress you seem more adorable in each new dress than the last

none	none	Annetta Bell This extraordinary letter puzzled me not a little I knew Annetta couldn t have composed it any more than she could fly When I went to school the next day I took her for a walk down to the brook at recess and asked her to tell me the truth about the letter Annetta cried and fessed up freely She said she had never written a letter and she didn t know how to or what to say but there was bundle of love letters in her mother s top bureau drawer which had been written to her by an old beau It wasn t father sobbed Annetta it was someone who was studying for a minister and so he could write lovely letters but ma didn t marry him after all She said she couldn t make out what he was driving at half the time But I thought the letters were sweet and that I d just copy things out of them here and there to write you 
426_122821_000035_000003	train-clean-100	I put teacher where he put lady and I put in something of my own when I could think of it and I changed some words 
none	none	I put dress in place of mood I didn t know just what a mood was but I s posed it was something to wear I didn t s pose you d know the difference I don t see how you found out it wasn t all mine 
426_122821_000035_000007	train-clean-100	You must be awful clever teacher 
none	none	I told Annetta it was very wrong to copy another person s letter and pass it off as her own But I m afraid that all Annetta repented of was being found out And I do love you teacher she sobbed It was all true even if the minister wrote it first 
426_122821_000037_000002	train-clean-100	I do love you with all my heart 
none	none	It s very difficult to scold anybody properly under such circumstances Here is Barbara Shaw s letter I can t reproduce the blots of the original Dear teacher You said we might write about a visit I never visited but once It was at my Aunt Mary s last winter My Aunt Mary is a very particular woman and a great housekeeper 
426_122821_000041_000004	train-clean-100	The first night I was there we were at tea I knocked over a jug and broke it 
none	none	Aunt Mary said she had had that jug ever since she was married and nobody had ever broken it before When we got up I stepped on her dress and all the gathers tore out of the skirt The next morning when I got up I hit the pitcher against the basin and cracked them both and I upset a cup of tea on the tablecloth at breakfast When I was helping Aunt Mary with the dinner dishes I dropped a china plate and it smashed 
426_122821_000041_000008	train-clean-100	That evening I fell downstairs and sprained my ankle and had to stay in bed for a week 
none	none	I heard Aunt Mary tell Uncle Joseph it was a mercy or I d have broken everything in the house 
426_122821_000041_000010	train-clean-100	When I got better it was time to go home

none	none	I want to tell you about my Very Brave Aunt She lives in Ontario and one day she went out to the barn and saw a dog in the yard The dog had no business there so she got a stick and whacked him hard and drove him into the barn and shut him up Pretty soon a man came looking for an inaginary lion Query Did Willie mean a menagerie lion that had run away from a circus And it turned out that the dog was a lion and my Very Brave Aunt had druv him into the barn with a stick It was a wonder she was not et up but she was very brave Emerson Gillis says if she thought it was a dog she wasn t any braver than if it really was a dog But Emerson is jealous because he hasn t got a Brave Aunt himself nothing but uncles
426_122821_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 I have kept the best for the last 
none	none	You laugh at me because I think Paul is a genius but I am sure his letter will convince you that he is a very uncommon child Paul lives away down near the shore with his grandmother and he has no playmates no real playmates You remember our School Management professor told us that we must not have favorites among our pupils but I can t help loving Paul Irving the best of all mine I don t think it does any harm though for everybody loves Paul even missus Lynde who says she could never have believed she d get so fond of a Yankee The other boys in school like him too There is nothing weak or girlish about him in spite of his dreams and fancies He is very manly and can hold his own in all games He fought saint Clair Donnell recently because saint Clair said the Union Jack was away ahead of the Stars and Stripes as a flag The result was a drawn battle and a mutual agreement to respect each other s patriotism henceforth saint Clair says he can hit the HARDEST but Paul can hit the OFTENEST Paul s Letter
426_122821_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 My dear teacher 
none	none	You told us we might write you about some interesting people we knew 
426_122821_000050_000001	train-clean-100	I think the most interesting people I know are my rock people and I mean to tell you about them 
426_122821_000050_000002	train-clean-100	I have never told anybody about them except grandma and father but I would like to have you know about them because you understand things 
none	none	There are a great many people who do not understand things so there is no use in telling them My rock people live at the shore I used to visit them almost every evening before the winter came 
426_122821_000051_000002	train-clean-100	Now I can t go till spring but they will be there for people like that never change that is the splendid thing about them 
none	none	Nora was the first one of them I got acquainted with and so I think I love her the best She lives in Andrews Cove and she has black hair and black eyes and she knows all about the mermaids and the water kelpies You ought to hear the stories she can tell Then there are the Twin Sailors They don t live anywhere they sail all the time but they often come ashore to talk to me They are a pair of jolly tars and they have seen everything in the world and more than what is in the world Do you know what happened to the youngest Twin Sailor once He was sailing and he sailed right into a moonglade A moonglade is the track the full moon makes on the water when it is rising from the sea you know teacher Well the youngest Twin Sailor sailed along the moonglade till he came right up to the moon and there was a little golden door in the moon and he opened it and sailed right through He had some wonderful adventures in the moon but it would make this letter too long to tell them
426_122821_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 Then there is the Golden Lady of the cave 
none	none	One day I found a big cave down on the shore and I went away in and after a while I found the Golden Lady She has golden hair right down to her feet and her dress is all glittering and glistening like gold that is alive And she has a golden harp and plays on it all day long you can hear the music any time along shore if you listen carefully but most people would think it was only the wind among the rocks I ve never told Nora about the Golden Lady I was afraid it might hurt her feelings It even hurt her feelings if I talked too long with the Twin Sailors
426_122821_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 I always met the Twin Sailors at the Striped Rocks 
426_122821_000053_000001	train-clean-100	The youngest Twin Sailor is very good tempered but the oldest Twin Sailor can look dreadfully fierce at times 
426_122821_000053_000002	train-clean-100	I have my suspicions about that oldest Twin I believe he d be a pirate if he dared 
none	none	There s really something very mysterious about him He swore once and I told him if he ever did it again he needn t come ashore to talk to me because I d promised grandmother I d never associate with anybody that swore He was pretty well scared I can tell you and he said if I would forgive him he would take me to the sunset So the next evening when I was sitting on the Striped Rocks the oldest Twin came sailing over the sea in an enchanted boat and I got in her The boat was all pearly and rainbowy like the inside of the mussel shells and her sail was like moonshine Well we sailed right across to the sunset 
426_122821_000053_000009	train-clean-100	Think of that teacher I ve been in the sunset 
none	none	And what do you suppose it is The sunset is a land all flowers We sailed into a great garden and the clouds are beds of flowers 
426_122821_000053_000013	train-clean-100	We sailed into a great harbor all the color of gold and I stepped right out of the boat on a big meadow all covered with buttercups as big as roses 
426_122821_000053_000014	train-clean-100	I stayed there for ever so long 
none	none	It seemed nearly a year but the Oldest Twin says it was only a few minutes You see in the sunset land the time is ever so much longer than it is here
426_122821_000054_000000	train-clean-100	 Your loving pupil Paul Irving 
none	none	P S of course this letter isn t really true teacher P I XII A Jonah Day It really began the night before with a restless wakeful vigil of grumbling toothache When Anne arose in the dull bitter winter morning she felt that life was flat stale and unprofitable She went to school in no angelic mood Her cheek was swollen and her face ached The schoolroom was cold and smoky for the fire refused to burn and the children were huddled about it in shivering groups Anne sent them to their seats with a sharper tone than she had ever used before Anthony Pye strutted to his with his usual impertinent swagger and she saw him whisper something to his seat mate and then glance at her with a grin Never so it seemed to Anne had there been so many squeaky pencils as there were that morning and when Barbara Shaw came up to the desk with a sum she tripped over the coal scuttle with disastrous results The coal rolled to every part of the room her slate was broken into fragments and when she picked herself up her face stained with coal dust sent the boys into roars of laughter Anne turned from the second reader class which she was hearing Really Barbara she said icily if you cannot move without falling over something you d better remain in your seat It is positively disgraceful for a girl of your age to be so awkward Poor Barbara stumbled back to her desk her tears combining with the coal dust to produce an effect truly grotesque Never before had her beloved sympathetic teacher spoken to her in such a tone or fashion and Barbara was heartbroken Anne herself felt a prick of conscience but it only served to increase her mental irritation and the second reader class remember that lesson yet as well as the unmerciful infliction of arithmetic that followed Just as Anne was snapping the sums out saint Clair Donnell arrived breathlessly You are half an hour late saint Clair Anne reminded him frigidly
426_122822_000010_000001	train-clean-100	 Why is this 
none	none	Please miss I had to help ma make a pudding for dinner cause we re expecting company and Clarice Almira s sick was saint Clair s answer given in a perfectly respectful voice but nevertheless provocative of great mirth among his mates Take your seat and work out the six problems on page eighty four of your arithmetic for punishment said Anne saint Clair looked rather amazed at her tone but he went meekly to his desk and took out his slate Then he stealthily passed a small parcel to Joe Sloane across the aisle Anne caught him in the act and jumped to a fatal conclusion about that parcel Old missus Hiram Sloane had lately taken to making and selling nut cakes by way of adding to her scanty income The cakes were specially tempting to small boys and for several weeks Anne had had not a little trouble in regard to them On their way to school the boys would invest their spare cash at missus Hiram s bring the cakes along with them to school and if possible eat them and treat their mates during school hours Anne had warned them that if they brought any more cakes to school they would be confiscated and yet here was saint Clair Donnell coolly passing a parcel of them wrapped up in the blue and white striped paper missus Hiram used under her very eyes Joseph said Anne quietly bring that parcel here Joe startled and abashed obeyed He was a fat urchin who always blushed and stuttered when he was frightened Never did anybody look more guilty than poor Joe at that moment
426_122822_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 Throw it into the fire said Anne 
none	none	Joe looked very blank P p p lease m m miss he began Do as I tell you Joseph without any words about it B b but m m miss th th they re gasped Joe in desperation
426_122822_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 Joseph are you going to obey me or are you NOT said Anne 
none	none	A bolder and more self possessed lad than Joe Sloane would have been overawed by her tone and the dangerous flash of her eyes This was a new Anne whom none of her pupils had ever seen before Joe with an agonized glance at saint Clair went to the stove opened the big square front door and threw the blue and white parcel in before saint Clair who had sprung to his feet could utter a word 
426_122822_000022_000003	train-clean-100	Then he dodged back just in time 
none	none	For a few moments the terrified occupants of Avonlea school did not know whether it was an earthquake or a volcanic explosion that had occurred The innocent looking parcel which Anne had rashly supposed to contain missus Hiram s nut cakes really held an assortment of firecrackers and pinwheels for which Warren Sloane had sent to town by saint Clair Donnell s father the day before intending to have a birthday celebration that evening The crackers went off in a thunderclap of noise and the pinwheels bursting out of the door spun madly around the room hissing and spluttering Anne dropped into her chair white with dismay and all the girls climbed shrieking upon their desks Joe Sloane stood as one transfixed in the midst of the commotion and saint Clair helpless with laughter rocked to and fro in the aisle Prillie Rogerson fainted and Annetta Bell went into hysterics It seemed a long time although it was really only a few minutes before the last pinwheel subsided Anne recovering herself sprang to open doors and windows and let out the gas and smoke which filled the room Then she helped the girls carry the unconscious Prillie into the porch where Barbara Shaw in an agony of desire to be useful poured a pailful of half frozen water over Prillie s face and shoulders before anyone could stop her 
426_122822_000025_000000	train-clean-100	It was a full hour before quiet was restored but it was a quiet that might be felt 
none	none	Everybody realized that even the explosion had not cleared the teacher s mental atmosphere Nobody except Anthony Pye dared whisper a word Ned Clay accidentally squeaked his pencil while working a sum caught Anne s eye and wished the floor would open and swallow him up The geography class were whisked through a continent with a speed that made them dizzy The grammar class were parsed and analyzed within an inch of their lives Chester Sloane spelling odoriferous with two f s was made to feel that he could never live down the disgrace of it either in this world or that which is to come Anne knew that she had made herself ridiculous and that the incident would be laughed over that night at a score of tea tables but the knowledge only angered her further In a calmer mood she could have carried off the situation with a laugh but now that was impossible so she ignored it in icy disdain When Anne returned to the school after dinner all the children were as usual in their seats and every face was bent studiously over a desk except Anthony Pye s He peered across his book at Anne his black eyes sparkling with curiosity and mockery Anne twitched open the drawer of her desk in search of chalk and under her very hand a lively mouse sprang out of the drawer scampered over the desk and leaped to the floor Anne screamed and sprang back as if it had been a snake and Anthony Pye laughed aloud 
426_122822_000029_000000	train-clean-100	Then a silence fell a very creepy uncomfortable silence 
none	none	Annetta Bell was of two minds whether to go into hysterics again or not especially as she didn t know just where the mouse had gone 
426_122822_000029_000002	train-clean-100	But she decided not to 
none	none	Who could take any comfort out of hysterics with a teacher so white faced and so blazing eyed standing before one Who put that mouse in my desk said Anne Her voice was quite low but it made a shiver go up and down Paul Irving s spine Joe Sloane caught her eye felt responsible from the crown of his head to the sole of his feet but stuttered out wildly N n not m m me t t teacher n n not m m me Anne paid no attention to the wretched Joseph 
426_122822_000032_000001	train-clean-100	She looked at Anthony Pye and Anthony Pye looked back unabashed and unashamed 
426_122822_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 Anthony was it you 
none	none	Yes it was said Anthony insolently Anne took her pointer from her desk It was a long heavy hardwood pointer Come here Anthony It was far from being the most severe punishment Anthony Pye had ever undergone Anne even the stormy souled Anne she was at that moment could not have punished any child cruelly But the pointer nipped keenly and finally Anthony s bravado failed him he winced and the tears came to his eyes Anne conscience stricken dropped the pointer and told Anthony to go to his seat She sat down at her desk feeling ashamed repentant and bitterly mortified Her quick anger was gone and she would have given much to have been able to seek relief in tears 
426_122822_000038_000003	train-clean-100	So all her boasts had come to this she had actually whipped one of her pupils 
426_122822_000038_000004	train-clean-100	How Jane would triumph 
426_122822_000038_000005	train-clean-100	And how mister Harrison would chuckle 
none	none	But worse than this bitterest thought of all she had lost her last chance of winning Anthony Pye Never would he like her now Anne by what somebody has called a Herculaneum effort kept back her tears until she got home that night Then she shut herself in the east gable room and wept all her shame and remorse and disappointment into her pillows wept so long that Marilla grew alarmed invaded the room and insisted on knowing what the trouble was The trouble is I ve got things the matter with my conscience sobbed Anne Oh this has been such a Jonah day Marilla I m so ashamed of myself I lost my temper and whipped Anthony Pye I m glad to hear it said Marilla with decision It s what you should have done long ago Oh no no Marilla And I don t see how I can ever look those children in the face again I feel that I have humiliated myself to the very dust You don t know how cross and hateful and horrid I was 
426_122822_000042_000004	train-clean-100	I can t forget the expression in Paul Irving s eyes he looked so surprised and disappointed 
426_122822_000042_000005	train-clean-100	Oh Marilla I HAVE tried so hard to be patient and to win Anthony s liking and now it has all gone for nothing 
none	none	Marilla passed her hard work worn hand over the girl s glossy tumbled hair with a wonderful tenderness When Anne s sobs grew quieter she said very gently for her You take things too much to heart Anne 
426_122822_000044_000001	train-clean-100	We all make mistakes but people forget them 
none	none	And Jonah days come to everybody 
426_122822_000044_000003	train-clean-100	As for Anthony Pye why need you care if he does dislike you 
none	none	He is the only one
426_122822_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 I can t help it 
none	none	I want everybody to love me and it hurts me so when anybody doesn t And Anthony never will now Oh I just made an idiot of myself today Marilla I ll tell you the whole story Marilla listened to the whole story and if she smiled at certain parts of it Anne never knew When the tale was ended she said briskly Well never mind This day s done and there s a new one coming tomorrow with no mistakes in it yet as you used to say yourself Just come downstairs and have your supper You ll see if a good cup of tea and those plum puffs I made today won t hearten you up Plum puffs won t minister to a mind diseased said Anne disconsolately but Marilla thought it a good sign that she had recovered sufficiently to adapt a quotation The cheerful supper table with the twins bright faces and Marilla s matchless plum puffs of which Davy ate four did hearten her up considerably after all She had a good sleep that night and awakened in the morning to find herself and the world transformed It had snowed softly and thickly all through the hours of darkness and the beautiful whiteness glittering in the frosty sunshine looked like a mantle of charity cast over all the mistakes and humiliations of the past Every morn is a fresh beginning Every morn is the world made new sang Anne as she dressed Owing to the snow she had to go around by the road to school and she thought it was certainly an impish coincidence that Anthony Pye should come ploughing along just as she left the Green Gables lane 
426_122822_000052_000001	train-clean-100	She felt as guilty as if their positions were reversed but to her unspeakable astonishment Anthony not only lifted his cap which he had never done before but said easily 
none	none	Kind of bad walking ain t it 
426_122822_000053_000001	train-clean-100	Can I take those books for you teacher 
none	none	Anne surrendered her books and wondered if she could possibly be awake Anthony walked on in silence to the school but when Anne took her books she smiled down at him not the stereotyped kind smile she had so persistently assumed for his benefit but a sudden outflashing of good comradeship 
426_122822_000054_000001	train-clean-100	Anthony smiled no if the truth must be told Anthony GRINNED back 
none	none	A grin is not generally supposed to be a respectful thing yet Anne suddenly felt that if she had not yet won Anthony s liking she had somehow or other won his respect missus Rachel Lynde came up the next Saturday and confirmed this
426_122822_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 Well Anne I guess you ve won over Anthony Pye that s what 
none	none	He says he believes you are some good after all even if you are a girl Says that whipping you gave him was just as good as a man s I never expected to win him by whipping him though said Anne a little mournfully feeling that her ideals had played her false somewhere
426_122822_000057_000001	train-clean-100	 It doesn t seem right 
none	none	I m sure my theory of kindness can t be wrong No but the Pyes are an exception to every known rule that s what declared missus Rachel with conviction mister Harrison said Thought you d come to it when he heard it and Jane rubbed it in rather unmercifully XIII A Golden Picnic Anne on her way to Orchard Slope met Diana bound for Green Gables just where the mossy old log bridge spanned the brook below the Haunted Wood and they sat down by the margin of the Dryad s Bubble where tiny ferns were unrolling like curly headed green pixy folk wakening up from a nap I was just on my way over to invite you to help me celebrate my birthday on Saturday said Anne Your birthday But your birthday was in March That wasn t my fault laughed Anne If my parents had consulted me it would never have happened then I should have chosen to be born in spring of course It must be delightful to come into the world with the mayflowers and violets You would always feel that you were their foster sister But since I didn t the next best thing is to celebrate my birthday in the spring Priscilla is coming over Saturday and Jane will be home We ll all four start off to the woods and spend a golden day making the acquaintance of the spring We none of us really know her yet but we ll meet her back there as we never can anywhere else I want to explore all those fields and lonely places anyhow I have a conviction that there are scores of beautiful nooks there that have never really been SEEN although they may have been LOOKED at We ll make friends with wind and sky and sun and bring home the spring in our hearts It SOUNDS awfully nice said Diana with some inward distrust of Anne s magic of words But won t it be very damp in some places yet Oh we ll wear rubbers was Anne s concession to practicalities And I want you to come over early Saturday morning and help me prepare lunch I m going to have the daintiest things possible things that will match the spring you understand little jelly tarts and lady fingers and drop cookies frosted with pink and yellow icing and buttercup cake And we must have sandwiches too though they re NOT very poetical Saturday proved an ideal day for a picnic a day of breeze and blue warm sunny with a little rollicking wind blowing across meadow and orchard Over every sunlit upland and field was a delicate flower starred green mister Harrison harrowing at the back of his farm and feeling some of the spring witch work even in his sober middle aged blood saw four girls basket laden tripping across the end of his field where it joined a fringing woodland of birch and fir Their blithe voices and laughter echoed down to him It s so easy to be happy on a day like this isn t it Anne was saying with true Anneish philosophy Let s try to make this a really golden day girls a day to which we can always look back with delight We re to seek for beauty and refuse to see anything else Begone dull care Jane you are thinking of something that went wrong in school yesterday How do you know gasped Jane amazed Oh I know the expression I ve felt it often enough on my own face But put it out of your mind there s a dear It will keep till Monday or if it doesn t so much the better Oh girls girls see that patch of violets There s something for memory s picture gallery When I m eighty years old if I ever am I shall shut my eyes and see those violets just as I see them now That s the first good gift our day has given us If a kiss could be seen I think it would look like a violet said Priscilla Anne glowed I m so glad you SPOKE that thought Priscilla instead of just thinking it and keeping it to yourself This world would be a much more interesting place although it IS very interesting anyhow if people spoke out their real thoughts It would be too hot to hold some folks quoted Jane sagely I suppose it might be but that would be their own faults for thinking nasty things Anyhow we can tell all our thoughts today because we are going to have nothing but beautiful thoughts Everybody can say just what comes into her head THAT is conversation Here s a little path I never saw before Let s explore it The path was a winding one so narrow that the girls walked in single file and even then the fir boughs brushed their faces Under the firs were velvety cushions of moss and further on where the trees were smaller and fewer the ground was rich in a variety of green growing things What a lot of elephant s ears exclaimed Diana I m going to pick a big bunch they re so pretty How did such graceful feathery things ever come to have such a dreadful name asked Priscilla Because the person who first named them either had no imagination at all or else far too much said Anne Oh girls look at that That was a shallow woodland pool in the center of a little open glade where the path ended Later on in the season it would be dried up and its place filled with a rank growth of ferns but now it was a glimmering placid sheet round as a saucer and clear as crystal A ring of slender young birches encircled it and little ferns fringed its margin HOW sweet said Jane Let us dance around it like wood nymphs cried Anne dropping her basket and extending her hands But the dance was not a success for the ground was boggy and Jane s rubbers came off You can t be a wood nymph if you have to wear rubbers was her decision Well we must name this place before we leave it said Anne yielding to the indisputable logic of facts Everybody suggest a name and we ll draw lots Diana Birch Pool suggested Diana promptly Crystal Lake said Jane Anne standing behind them implored Priscilla with her eyes not to perpetrate another such name and Priscilla rose to the occasion with Glimmer glass Anne s selection was The Fairies Mirror The names were written on strips of birch bark with a pencil Schoolma am Jane produced from her pocket and placed in Anne s hat Then Priscilla shut her eyes and drew one Crystal Lake read Jane triumphantly Crystal Lake it was and if Anne thought that chance had played the pool a shabby trick she did not say so Pushing through the undergrowth beyond the girls came out to the young green seclusion of mister Silas Sloane s back pasture Across it they found the entrance to a lane striking up through the woods and voted to explore it also It rewarded their quest with a succession of pretty surprises First skirting mister Sloane s pasture came an archway of wild cherry trees all in bloom The girls swung their hats on their arms and wreathed their hair with the creamy fluffy blossoms Then the lane turned at right angles and plunged into a spruce wood so thick and dark that they walked in a gloom as of twilight with not a glimpse of sky or sunlight to be seen This is where the bad wood elves dwell whispered Anne They are impish and malicious but they can t harm us because they are not allowed to do evil in the spring There was one peeping at us around that old twisted fir and didn t you see a group of them on that big freckly toadstool we just passed The good fairies always dwell in the sunshiny places I wish there really were fairies said Jane Wouldn t it be nice to have three wishes granted you or even only one What would you wish for girls if you could have a wish granted I d wish to be rich and beautiful and clever I d wish to be tall and slender said Diana I would wish to be famous said Priscilla Anne thought of her hair and then dismissed the thought as unworthy I d wish it might be spring all the time and in everybody s heart and all our lives she said But that said Priscilla would be just wishing this world were like heaven Only like a part of heaven In the other parts there would be summer and autumn yes and a bit of winter too I think I want glittering snowy fields and white frosts in heaven sometimes Don t you Jane I I don t know said Jane uncomfortably Jane was a good girl a member of the church who tried conscientiously to live up to her profession and believed everything she had been taught But she never thought about heaven any more than she could help for all that Minnie May asked me the other day if we would wear our best dresses every day in heaven laughed Diana And didn t you tell her we would asked Anne Mercy no I told her we wouldn t be thinking of dresses at all there Oh I think we will a LITTLE said Anne earnestly There ll be plenty of time in all eternity for it without neglecting more important things I believe we ll all wear beautiful dresses or I suppose RAIMENT would be a more suitable way of speaking I shall want to wear pink for a few centuries at first it would take me that long to get tired of it I feel sure I do love pink so and I can never wear it in THIS world Past the spruces the lane dipped down into a sunny little open where a log bridge spanned a brook and then came the glory of a sunlit beechwood where the air was like transparent golden wine and the leaves fresh and green and the wood floor a mosaic of tremulous sunshine Then more wild cherries and a little valley of lissome firs and then a hill so steep that the girls lost their breath climbing it but when they reached the top and came out into the open the prettiest surprise of all awaited them Beyond were the back fields of the farms that ran out to the upper Carmody road Just before them hemmed in by beeches and firs but open to the south was a little corner and in it a garden or what had once been a garden A tumbledown stone dyke overgrown with mosses and grass surrounded it Along the eastern side ran a row of garden cherry trees white as a snowdrift There were traces of old paths still and a double line of rosebushes through the middle but all the rest of the space was a sheet of yellow and white narcissi in their airiest most lavish wind swayed bloom above the lush green grasses Oh how perfectly lovely three of the girls cried Anne only gazed in eloquent silence How in the world does it happen that there ever was a garden back here said Priscilla in amazement It must be Hester Gray s garden said Diana I ve heard mother speak of it but I never saw it before and I wouldn t have supposed that it could be in existence still You ve heard the story Anne No but the name seems familiar to me Oh you ve seen it in the graveyard She is buried down there in the poplar corner You know the little brown stone with the opening gates carved on it and Sacred to the memory of Hester Gray aged twenty two Jordan Gray is buried right beside her but there s no stone to him It s a wonder Marilla never told you about it Anne To be sure it happened thirty years ago and everybody has forgotten Well if there s a story we must have it said Anne Let s sit right down here among the narcissi and Diana will tell it Why girls there are hundreds of them they ve spread over everything It looks as if the garden were carpeted with moonshine and sunshine combined This is a discovery worth making To think that I ve lived within a mile of this place for six years and have never seen it before Now Diana Long ago began Diana this farm belonged to old mister David Gray He didn t live on it he lived where Silas Sloane lives now He had one son Jordan and he went up to Boston one winter to work and while he was there he fell in love with a girl named Hester Murray She was working in a store and she hated it She d been brought up in the country and she always wanted to get back When Jordan asked her to marry him she said she would if he d take her away to some quiet spot where she d see nothing but fields and trees So he brought her to Avonlea missus Lynde said he was taking a fearful risk in marrying a Yankee and it s certain that Hester was very delicate and a very poor housekeeper but mother says she was very pretty and sweet and Jordan just worshipped the ground she walked on Well mister Gray gave Jordan this farm and he built a little house back here and Jordan and Hester lived in it for four years She never went out much and hardly anybody went to see her except mother and missus Lynde Jordan made her this garden and she was crazy about it and spent most of her time in it She wasn t much of a housekeeper but she had a knack with flowers And then she got sick Mother says she thinks she was in consumption before she ever came here She never really laid up but just grew weaker and weaker all the time Jordan wouldn t have anybody to wait on her He did it all himself and mother says he was as tender and gentle as a woman Every day he d wrap her in a shawl and carry her out to the garden and she d lie there on a bench quite happy They say she used to make Jordan kneel down by her every night and morning and pray with her that she might die out in the garden when the time came And her prayer was answered One day Jordan carried her out to the bench and then he picked all the roses that were out and heaped them over her and she just smiled up at him and closed her eyes and that concluded Diana softly was the end Oh what a dear story sighed Anne wiping away her tears What became of Jordan asked Priscilla He sold the farm after Hester died and went back to Boston mister Jabez Sloane bought the farm and hauled the little house out to the road Jordan died about ten years after and he was brought home and buried beside Hester I can t understand how she could have wanted to live back here away from everything said Jane Oh I can easily understand THAT said Anne thoughtfully I wouldn t want it myself for a steady thing because although I love the fields and woods I love people too But I can understand it in Hester She was tired to death of the noise of the big city and the crowds of people always coming and going and caring nothing for her She just wanted to escape from it all to some still green friendly place where she could rest And she got just what she wanted which is something very few people do I believe She had four beautiful years before she died four years of perfect happiness so I think she was to be envied more than pitied And then to shut your eyes and fall asleep among roses with the one you loved best on earth smiling down at you oh I think it was beautiful She set out those cherry trees over there said Diana She told mother she d never live to eat their fruit but she wanted to think that something she had planted would go on living and helping to make the world beautiful after she was dead I m so glad we came this way said Anne the shining eyed This is my adopted birthday you know and this garden and its story is the birthday gift it has given me Did your mother ever tell you what Hester Gray looked like Diana No only just that she was pretty I m rather glad of that because I can imagine what she looked like without being hampered by facts I think she was very slight and small with softly curling dark hair and big sweet timid brown eyes and a little wistful pale face The girls left their baskets in Hester s garden and spent the rest of the afternoon rambling in the woods and fields surrounding it discovering many pretty nooks and lanes When they got hungry they had lunch in the prettiest spot of all on the steep bank of a gurgling brook where white birches shot up out of long feathery grasses The girls sat down by the roots and did full justice to Anne s dainties even the unpoetical sandwiches being greatly appreciated by hearty unspoiled appetites sharpened by all the fresh air and exercise they had enjoyed Anne had brought glasses and lemonade for her guests but for her own part drank cold brook water from a cup fashioned out of birch bark The cup leaked and the water tasted of earth as brook water is apt to do in spring but Anne thought it more appropriate to the occasion than lemonade Look do you see that poem she said suddenly pointing Where Jane and Diana stared as if expecting to see Runic rhymes on the birch trees There down in the brook that old green mossy log with the water flowing over it in those smooth ripples that look as if they d been combed and that single shaft of sunshine falling right athwart it far down into the pool Oh it s the most beautiful poem I ever saw I should rather call it a picture said Jane A poem is lines and verses Oh dear me no Anne shook her head with its fluffy wild cherry coronal positively The lines and verses are only the outward garments of the poem and are no more really it than your ruffles and flounces are YOU Jane The real poem is the soul within them and that beautiful bit is the soul of an unwritten poem It is not every day one sees a soul even of a poem I wonder what a soul a person s soul would look like said Priscilla dreamily Like that I should think answered Anne pointing to a radiance of sifted sunlight streaming through a birch tree Only with shape and features of course I like to fancy souls as being made of light And some are all shot through with rosy stains and quivers and some have a soft glitter like moonlight on the sea and some are pale and transparent like mist at dawn I read somewhere once that souls were like flowers said Priscilla Then your soul is a golden narcissus said Anne and Diana s is like a red red rose Jane s is an apple blossom pink and wholesome and sweet And your own is a white violet with purple streaks in its heart finished Priscilla Jane whispered to Diana that she really could not understand what they were talking about Could she The girls went home by the light of a calm golden sunset their baskets filled with narcissus blossoms from Hester s garden some of which Anne carried to the cemetery next day and laid upon Hester s grave Minstrel robins were whistling in the firs and the frogs were singing in the marshes All the basins among the hills were brimmed with topaz and emerald light Well we have had a lovely time after all said Diana as if she had hardly expected to have it when she set out It has been a truly golden day said Priscilla I m really awfully fond of the woods myself said Jane Anne said nothing She was looking afar into the western sky and thinking of little Hester Gray XIV A Danger Averted Anne walking home from the post office one Friday evening was joined by missus Lynde who was as usual cumbered with all the cares of church and state I ve just been down to Timothy Cotton s to see if I could get Alice Louise to help me for a few days she said I had her last week for though she s too slow to stop quick she s better than nobody But she s sick and can t come Timothy s sitting there too coughing and complaining He s been dying for ten years and he ll go on dying for ten years more That kind can t even die and have done with it they can t stick to anything even to being sick long enough to finish it They re a terrible shiftless family and what is to become of them I don t know but perhaps Providence does missus Lynde sighed as if she rather doubted the extent of Providential knowledge on the subject Marilla was in about her eyes again Tuesday wasn t she What did the specialist think of them she continued He was much pleased said Anne brightly He says there is a great improvement in them and he thinks the danger of her losing her sight completely is past But he says she ll never be able to read much or do any fine hand work again How are your preparations for your bazaar coming on The Ladies Aid Society was preparing for a fair and supper and missus Lynde was the head and front of the enterprise Pretty well and that reminds me missus Allan thinks it would be nice to fix up a booth like an old time kitchen and serve a supper of baked beans doughnuts pie and so on We re collecting old fashioned fixings everywhere missus Simon Fletcher is going to lend us her mother s braided rugs and missus Levi Boulter some old chairs and Aunt Mary Shaw will lend us her cupboard with the glass doors I suppose Marilla will let us have her brass candlesticks And we want all the old dishes we can get missus Allan is specially set on having a real blue willow ware platter if we can find one But nobody seems to have one Do you know where we could get one Miss Josephine Barry has one I ll write and ask her if she ll lend it for the occasion said Anne Well I wish you would I guess we ll have the supper in about a fortnight s time Uncle Abe Andrews is prophesying rain and storms for about that time and that s a pretty sure sign we ll have fine weather The said Uncle Abe it may be mentioned was at least like other prophets in that he had small honor in his own country He was in fact considered in the light of a standing joke for few of his weather predictions were ever fulfilled mister Elisha Wright who labored under the impression that he was a local wit used to say that nobody in Avonlea ever thought of looking in the Charlottetown dailies for weather probabilities No they just asked Uncle Abe what it was going to be tomorrow and expected the opposite Nothing daunted Uncle Abe kept on prophesying We want to have the fair over before the election comes off continued missus Lynde for the candidates will be sure to come and spend lots of money The Tories are bribing right and left so they might as well be given a chance to spend their money honestly for once Anne was a red hot Conservative out of loyalty to Matthew s memory but she said nothing She knew better than to get missus Lynde started on politics She had a letter for Marilla postmarked from a town in British Columbia It s probably from the children s uncle she said excitedly when she got home Oh Marilla I wonder what he says about them The best plan might be to open it and see said Marilla curtly A close observer might have thought that she was excited also but she would rather have died than show it Anne tore open the letter and glanced over the somewhat untidy and poorly written contents He says he can t take the children this spring he s been sick most of the winter and his wedding is put off He wants to know if we can keep them till the fall and he ll try and take them then We will of course won t we Marilla I don t see that there is anything else for us to do said Marilla rather grimly although she felt a secret relief Anyhow they re not so much trouble as they were or else we ve got used to them Davy has improved a great deal His MANNERS are certainly much better said Anne cautiously as if she were not prepared to say as much for his morals Anne had come home from school the previous evening to find Marilla away at an Aid meeting Dora asleep on the kitchen sofa and Davy in the sitting room closet blissfully absorbing the contents of a jar of Marilla s famous yellow plum preserves company jam Davy called it which he had been forbidden to touch He looked very guilty when Anne pounced on him and whisked him out of the closet Davy Keith don t you know that it is very wrong of you to be eating that jam when you were told never to meddle with anything in THAT closet Yes I knew it was wrong admitted Davy uncomfortably but plum jam is awful nice Anne I just peeped in and it looked so good I thought I d take just a weeny taste I stuck my finger in Anne groaned and licked it clean And it was so much gooder than I d ever thought that I got a spoon and just SAILED IN Anne gave him such a serious lecture on the sin of stealing plum jam that Davy became conscience stricken and promised with repentant kisses never to do it again Anyhow there ll be plenty of jam in heaven that s one comfort he said complacently Anne nipped a smile in the bud Perhaps there will if we want it she said But what makes you think so Why it s in the catechism said Davy Oh no there is nothing like THAT in the catechism Davy But I tell you there is persisted Davy It was in that question Marilla taught me last Sunday Why should we love God It says Because He makes preserves and redeems us Preserves is just a holy way of saying jam I must get a drink of water said Anne hastily When she came back it cost her some time and trouble to explain to Davy that a certain comma in the said catechism question made a great deal of difference in the meaning Well I thought it was too good to be true he said at last with a sigh of disappointed conviction And besides I didn t see when He d find time to make jam if it s one endless Sabbath day as the hymn says I don t believe I want to go to heaven Won t there ever be any Saturdays in heaven Anne Yes Saturdays and every other kind of beautiful days And every day in heaven will be more beautiful than the one before it Davy assured Anne who was rather glad that Marilla was not by to be shocked Marilla it is needless to say was bringing the twins up in the good old ways of theology and discouraged all fanciful speculations thereupon Davy and Dora were taught a hymn a catechism question and two Bible verses every Sunday Dora learned meekly and recited like a little machine with perhaps as much understanding or interest as if she were one Davy on the contrary had a lively curiosity and frequently asked questions which made Marilla tremble for his fate Chester Sloane says we ll do nothing all the time in heaven but walk around in white dresses and play on harps and he says he hopes he won t have to go till he s an old man cause maybe he ll like it better then And he thinks it will be horrid to wear dresses and I think so too Why can t men angels wear trousers Anne Chester Sloane is interested in those things cause they re going to make a minister of him He s got to be a minister cause his grandmother left the money to send him to college and he can t have it unless he is a minister She thought a minister was such a spectable thing to have in a family Chester says he doesn t mind much though he d rather be a blacksmith but he s bound to have all the fun he can before he begins to be a minister cause he doesn t expect to have much afterwards I ain t going to be a minister I m going to be a storekeeper like mister Blair and keep heaps of candy and bananas But I d rather like going to your kind of a heaven if they d let me play a mouth organ instead of a harp Do you s pose they would Yes I think they would if you wanted it was all Anne could trust herself to say The A V I S met at mister Harmon Andrews that evening and a full attendance had been requested since important business was to be discussed The A V I S was in a flourishing condition and had already accomplished wonders Early in the spring mister Major Spencer had redeemed his promise and had stumped graded and seeded down all the road front of his farm A dozen other men some prompted by a determination not to let a Spencer get ahead of them others goaded into action by Improvers in their own households had followed his example The result was that there were long strips of smooth velvet turf where once had been unsightly undergrowth or brush The farm fronts that had not been done looked so badly by contrast that their owners were secretly shamed into resolving to see what they could do another spring The triangle of ground at the cross roads had also been cleared and seeded down and Anne s bed of geraniums unharmed by any marauding cow was already set out in the center Altogether the Improvers thought that they were getting on beautifully even if mister Levi Boulter tactfully approached by a carefully selected committee in regard to the old house on his upper farm did bluntly tell them that he wasn t going to have it meddled with At this especial meeting they intended to draw up a petition to the school trustees humbly praying that a fence be put around the school grounds and a plan was also to be discussed for planting a few ornamental trees by the church if the funds of the society would permit of it for as Anne said there was no use in starting another subscription as long as the hall remained blue The members were assembled in the Andrews parlor and Jane was already on her feet to move the appointment of a committee which should find out and report on the price of said trees when Gertie Pye swept in pompadoured and frilled within an inch of her life Gertie had a habit of being late to make her entrance more effective spiteful people said Gertie s entrance in this instance was certainly effective for she paused dramatically on the middle of the floor threw up her hands rolled her eyes and exclaimed I ve just heard something perfectly awful What DO you think mister Judson Parker IS GOING TO RENT ALL THE ROAD FENCE OF HIS FARM TO A PATENT MEDICINE COMPANY TO PAINT ADVERTISEMENTS ON For once in her life Gertie Pye made all the sensation she desired If she had thrown a bomb among the complacent Improvers she could hardly have made more It CAN T be true said Anne blankly That s just what I said when I heard it first don t you know said Gertie who was enjoying herself hugely I said it couldn t be true that Judson Parker wouldn t have the HEART to do it don t you know But father met him this afternoon and asked him about it and he said it WAS true Just fancy His farm is side on to the Newbridge road and how perfectly awful it will look to see advertisements of pills and plasters all along it don t you know The Improvers DID know all too well Even the least imaginative among them could picture the grotesque effect of half a mile of board fence adorned with such advertisements All thought of church and school grounds vanished before this new danger Parliamentary rules and regulations were forgotten and Anne in despair gave up trying to keep minutes at all Everybody talked at once and fearful was the hubbub Oh let us keep calm implored Anne who was the most excited of them all and try to think of some way of preventing him I don t know how you re going to prevent him exclaimed Jane bitterly Everybody knows what Judson Parker is He d do ANYTHING for money He hasn t a SPARK of public spirit or ANY sense of the beautiful The prospect looked rather unpromising Judson Parker and his sister were the only Parkers in Avonlea so that no leverage could be exerted by family connections Martha Parker was a lady of all too certain age who disapproved of young people in general and the Improvers in particular Judson was a jovial smooth spoken man so uniformly goodnatured and bland that it was surprising how few friends he had Perhaps he had got the better in too many business transactions which seldom makes for popularity He was reputed to be very sharp and it was the general opinion that he hadn t much principle If Judson Parker has a chance to turn an honest penny as he says himself he ll never lose it declared Fred Wright Is there NOBODY who has any influence over him asked Anne despairingly He goes to see Louisa Spencer at White Sands suggested Carrie Sloane Perhaps she could coax him not to rent his fences Not she said Gilbert emphatically I know Louisa Spencer well She doesn t believe in Village Improvement Societies but she DOES believe in dollars and cents She d be more likely to urge Judson on than to dissuade him The only thing to do is to appoint a committee to wait on him and protest said Julia Bell and you must send girls for he d hardly be civil to boys but I won t go so nobody need nominate me Better send Anne alone said Oliver Sloane She can talk Judson over if anybody can Anne protested She was willing to go and do the talking but she must have others with her for moral support Diana and Jane were therefore appointed to support her morally and the Improvers broke up buzzing like angry bees with indignation Anne was so worried that she didn t sleep until nearly morning and then she dreamed that the trustees had put a fence around the school and painted Try Purple Pills all over it The committee waited on Judson Parker the next afternoon Anne pleaded eloquently against his nefarious design and Jane and Diana supported her morally and valiantly Judson was sleek suave flattering paid them several compliments of the delicacy of sunflowers felt real bad to refuse such charming young ladies but business was business couldn t afford to let sentiment stand in the way these hard times But I ll tell what I WILL do he said with a twinkle in his light full eyes I ll tell the agent he must use only handsome tasty colors red and yellow and so on I ll tell him he mustn t paint the ads BLUE on any account The vanquished committee retired thinking things not lawful to be uttered We have done all we can do and must simply trust the rest to Providence said Jane with an unconscious imitation of missus Lynde s tone and manner I wonder if mister Allan could do anything reflected Diana Anne shook her head No it s no use to worry mister Allan especially now when the baby s so sick Judson would slip away from him as smoothly as from us although he HAS taken to going to church quite regularly just now That is simply because Louisa Spencer s father is an elder and very particular about such things Judson Parker is the only man in Avonlea who would dream of renting his fences said Jane indignantly Even Levi Boulter or Lorenzo White would never stoop to that tightfisted as they are They would have too much respect for public opinion Public opinion was certainly down on Judson Parker when the facts became known but that did not help matters much Judson chuckled to himself and defied it and the Improvers were trying to reconcile themselves to the prospect of seeing the prettiest part of the Newbridge road defaced by advertisements when Anne rose quietly at the president s call for reports of committees on the occasion of the next meeting of the Society and announced that mister Judson Parker had instructed her to inform the Society that he was NOT going to rent his fences to the Patent Medicine Company Jane and Diana stared as if they found it hard to believe their ears Parliamentary etiquette which was generally very strictly enforced in the A V I S forbade them giving instant vent to their curiosity but after the Society adjourned Anne was besieged for explanations Anne had no explanation to give Judson Parker had overtaken her on the road the preceding evening and told her that he had decided to humor the A V I S in its peculiar prejudice against patent medicine advertisements That was all Anne would say then or ever afterwards and it was the simple truth but when Jane Andrews on her way home confided to Oliver Sloane her firm belief that there was more behind Judson Parker s mysterious change of heart than Anne Shirley had revealed she spoke the truth also Anne had been down to old missus Irving s on the shore road the preceding evening and had come home by a short cut which led her first over the low lying shore fields and then through the beech wood below Robert Dickson s by a little footpath that ran out to the main road just above the Lake of Shining Waters known to unimaginative people as Barry s pond Two men were sitting in their buggies reined off to the side of the road just at the entrance of the path One was Judson Parker the other was Jerry Corcoran a Newbridge man against whom as missus Lynde would have told you in eloquent italics nothing shady had ever been PROVED He was an agent for agricultural implements and a prominent personage in matters political He had a finger some people said ALL his fingers in every political pie that was cooked and as Canada was on the eve of a general election Jerry Corcoran had been a busy man for many weeks canvassing the county in the interests of his party s candidate Just as Anne emerged from under the overhanging beech boughs she heard Corcoran say If you ll vote for Amesbury Parker well I ve a note for that pair of harrows you ve got in the spring I suppose you wouldn t object to having it back eh We ll since you put it in that way drawled Judson with a grin I reckon I might as well do it A man must look out for his own interests in these hard times Both saw Anne at this moment and conversation abruptly ceased Anne bowed frostily and walked on with her chin slightly more tilted than usual Soon Judson Parker overtook her Have a lift Anne he inquired genially Thank you no said Anne politely but with a fine needle like disdain in her voice that pierced even Judson Parker s none too sensitive consciousness His face reddened and he twitched his reins angrily but the next second prudential considerations checked him He looked uneasily at Anne as she walked steadily on glancing neither to the right nor to the left Had she heard Corcoran s unmistakable offer and his own too plain acceptance of it Confound Corcoran If he couldn t put his meaning into less dangerous phrases he d get into trouble some of these long come shorts And confound redheaded school ma ams with a habit of popping out of beechwoods where they had no business to be If Anne had heard Judson Parker measuring her corn in his own half bushel as the country saying went and cheating himself thereby as such people generally do believed that she would tell it far and wide Now Judson Parker as has been seen was not overly regardful of public opinion but to be known as having accepted a bribe would be a nasty thing and if it ever reached Isaac Spencer s ears farewell forever to all hope of winning Louisa Jane with her comfortable prospects as the heiress of a well to do farmer Judson Parker knew that mister Spencer looked somewhat askance at him as it was he could not afford to take any risks Ahem Anne I ve been wanting to see you about that little matter we were discussing the other day I ve decided not to let my fences to that company after all A society with an aim like yours ought to be encouraged Anne thawed out the merest trifle Thank you she said And and you needn t mention that little conversation of mine with Jerry I have no intention of mentioning it in any case said Anne icily for she would have seen every fence in Avonlea painted with advertisements before she would have stooped to bargain with a man who would sell his vote Just so just so agreed Judson imagining that they understood each other beautifully I didn t suppose you would Of course I was only stringing Jerry he thinks he s so all fired cute and smart I ve no intention of voting for Amesbury I m going to vote for Grant as I ve always done you ll see that when the election comes off I just led Jerry on to see if he would commit himself And it s all right about the fence you can tell the Improvers that It takes all sorts of people to make a world as I ve often heard but I think there are some who could be spared Anne told her reflection in the east gable mirror that night I wouldn t have mentioned the disgraceful thing to a soul anyhow so my conscience is clear on THAT score I really don t know who or what is to be thanked for this I did nothing to bring it about and it s hard to believe that Providence ever works by means of the kind of politics men like Judson Parker and Jerry Corcoran have XV The Beginning of Vacation Anne locked the schoolhouse door on a still yellow evening when the winds were purring in the spruces around the playground and the shadows were long and lazy by the edge of the woods She dropped the key into her pocket with a sigh of satisfaction The school year was ended she had been reengaged for the next with many expressions of satisfaction only mister Harmon Andrews told her she ought to use the strap oftener and two delightful months of a well earned vacation beckoned her invitingly Anne felt at peace with the world and herself as she walked down the hill with her basket of flowers in her hand Since the earliest mayflowers Anne had never missed her weekly pilgrimage to Matthew s grave Everyone else in Avonlea except Marilla had already forgotten quiet shy unimportant Matthew Cuthbert but his memory was still green in Anne s heart and always would be She could never forget the kind old man who had been the first to give her the love and sympathy her starved childhood had craved At the foot of the hill a boy was sitting on the fence in the shadow of the spruces a boy with big dreamy eyes and a beautiful sensitive face He swung down and joined Anne smiling but there were traces of tears on his cheeks I thought I d wait for you teacher because I knew you were going to the graveyard he said slipping his hand into hers
246_122825_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 I m going there too 
none	none	I m taking this bouquet of geraniums to put on Grandpa Irving s grave for grandma And look teacher I m going to put this bunch of white roses beside Grandpa s grave in memory of my little mother because I can t go to her grave to put it there But don t you think she ll know all about it just the same Yes I am sure she will Paul You see teacher it s just three years today since my little mother died It s such a long long time but it hurts just as much as ever and I miss her just as much as ever Sometimes it seems to me that I just can t bear it it hurts so 
246_122825_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Paul s voice quivered and his lip trembled 
none	none	He looked down at his roses hoping that his teacher would not notice the tears in his eyes And yet said Anne very softly you wouldn t want it to stop hurting you wouldn t want to forget your little mother even if you could
246_122825_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 No indeed I wouldn t that s just the way I feel 
none	none	You re so good at understanding teacher 
246_122825_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Nobody else understands so well not even grandma although she s so good to me 
246_122825_000009_000003	train-clean-360	Father understood pretty well but still I couldn t talk much to him about mother because it made him feel so bad 
none	none	When he put his hand over his face I always knew it was time to stop Poor father he must be dreadfully lonesome without me but you see he has nobody but a housekeeper now and he thinks housekeepers are no good to bring up little boys especially when he has to be away from home so much on business 
246_122825_000009_000006	train-clean-360	Grandmothers are better next to mothers 
none	none	Someday when I m brought up I ll go back to father and we re never going to be parted again Paul had talked so much to Anne about his mother and father that she felt as if she had known them She thought his mother must have been very like what he was himself in temperament and disposition and she had an idea that Stephen Irving was a rather reserved man with a deep and tender nature which he kept hidden scrupulously from the world
246_122825_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Father s not very easy to get acquainted with Paul had said once 
246_122825_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 I never got really acquainted with him until after my little mother died But he s splendid when you do get to know him 
none	none	I love him the best in all the world and Grandma Irving next and then you teacher I d love you next to father if it wasn t my DUTY to love Grandma Irving best because she s doing so much for me YOU know teacher I wish she would leave the lamp in my room till I go to sleep though 
246_122825_000011_000006	train-clean-360	She takes it right out as soon as she tucks me up because she says I mustn t be a coward I m NOT scared but I d RATHER have the light 
none	none	My little mother used always to sit beside me and hold my hand till I went to sleep 
246_122825_000011_000008	train-clean-360	I expect she spoiled me 
none	none	Mothers do sometimes you know No Anne did not know this although she might imagine it She thought sadly of HER little mother the mother who had thought her so perfectly beautiful and who had died so long ago and was buried beside her boyish husband in that unvisited grave far away Anne could not remember her mother and for this reason she almost envied Paul My birthday is next week said Paul as they walked up the long red hill basking in the June sunshine and father wrote me that he is sending me something that he thinks I ll like better than anything else he could send I believe it has come already for Grandma is keeping the bookcase drawer locked and that is something new And when I asked her why she just looked mysterious and said little boys mustn t be too curious 
246_122825_000013_000003	train-clean-360	It s very exciting to have a birthday isn t it 
none	none	I ll be eleven

none	none	Grandma says I m very small for my age and that it s all because I don t eat enough porridge I do my very best but Grandma gives such generous platefuls there s nothing mean about Grandma I can tell you Ever since you and I had that talk about praying going home from Sunday School that day teacher when you said we ought to pray about all our difficulties I ve prayed every night that God would give me enough grace to enable me to eat every bit of my porridge in the mornings But I ve never been able to do it yet and whether it s because I have too little grace or too much porridge I really can t decide Grandma says father was brought up on porridge and it certainly did work well in his case for you ought to see the shoulders he has But sometimes concluded Paul with a sigh and a meditative air I really think porridge will be the death of me Anne permitted herself a smile since Paul was not looking at her All Avonlea knew that old missus Irving was bringing her grandson up in accordance with the good old fashioned methods of diet and morals Let us hope not dear she said cheerfully

none	none	I m almost sure she watched me the last time I went to the cave I don t mind if she finds out it is only for HER sake I don t want her to so that her feelings won t be hurt But if she is DETERMINED to have her feelings hurt it can t be helped If I were to go to the shore some night with you do you think I could see your rock people too

none	none	No I don t think you could see MY rock people I m the only person who can see them

none	none	You re one of the kind that can We re both that kind YOU know teacher he added squeezing her hand chummily
246_122825_000021_000006	train-clean-360	 Isn t it splendid to be that kind teacher 
none	none	Splendid Anne agreed gray shining eyes looking down into blue shining ones Anne and Paul both knew How fair the realm Imagination opens to the view 
246_122825_000024_000000	train-clean-360	and both knew the way to that happy land 
none	none	There the rose of joy bloomed immortal by dale and stream clouds never darkened the sunny sky sweet bells never jangled out of tune and kindred spirits abounded 
246_122825_000024_000002	train-clean-360	The knowledge of that land s geography 
none	none	east o the sun west o the moon is priceless lore not to be bought in any market place It must be the gift of the good fairies at birth and the years can never deface it or take it away 
246_122825_000024_000005	train-clean-360	It is better to possess it living in a garret than to be the inhabitant of palaces without it 
none	none	The Avonlea graveyard was as yet the grass grown solitude it had always been To be sure the Improvers had an eye on it and Priscilla Grant had read a paper on cemeteries before the last meeting of the Society At some future time the Improvers meant to have the lichened wayward old board fence replaced by a neat wire railing the grass mown and the leaning monuments straightened up Anne put on Matthew s grave the flowers she had brought for it and then went over to the little poplar shaded corner where Hester Gray slept Ever since the day of the spring picnic Anne had put flowers on Hester s grave when she visited Matthew s The evening before she had made a pilgrimage back to the little deserted garden in the woods and brought therefrom some of Hester s own white roses I thought you would like them better than any others dear she said softly Anne was still sitting there when a shadow fell over the grass and she looked up to see missus Allan They walked home together missus Allan s face was not the face of the girlbride whom the minister had brought to Avonlea five years before It had lost some of its bloom and youthful curves and there were fine patient lines about eyes and mouth A tiny grave in that very cemetery accounted for some of them and some new ones had come during the recent illness now happily over of her little son But missus Allan s dimples were as sweet and sudden as ever her eyes as clear and bright and true and what her face lacked of girlish beauty was now more than atoned for in added tenderness and strength I suppose you are looking forward to your vacation Anne she said as they left the graveyard Anne nodded Yes I could roll the word as a sweet morsel under my tongue I think the summer is going to be lovely For one thing missus Morgan is coming to the Island in July and Priscilla is going to bring her up 
246_122825_000032_000004	train-clean-360	I feel one of my old thrills at the mere thought 
none	none	I hope you ll have a good time Anne You ve worked very hard this past year and you have succeeded Oh I don t know I ve come so far short in so many things I haven t done what I meant to do when I began to teach last fall I haven t lived up to my ideals None of us ever do said missus Allan with a sigh But then Anne you know what Lowell says Not failure but low aim is crime We must have ideals and try to live up to them even if we never quite succeed 
246_122825_000035_000002	train-clean-360	Life would be a sorry business without them 
none	none	With them it s grand and great Hold fast to your ideals Anne I shall try But I have to let go most of my theories said Anne laughing a little I had the most beautiful set of theories you ever knew when I started out as a schoolma am but every one of them has failed me at some pinch or another Even the theory on corporal punishment teased missus Allan But Anne flushed I shall never forgive myself for whipping Anthony
246_122825_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Nonsense dear he deserved it 
none	none	And it agreed with him You have had no trouble with him since and he has come to think there s nobody like you Your kindness won his love after the idea that a girl was no good was rooted out of his stubborn mind
246_122825_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 He may have deserved it but that is not the point 
none	none	If I had calmly and deliberately decided to whip him because I thought it a just punishment for him I would not feel over it as I do But the truth is missus Allan that I just flew into a temper and whipped him because of that I wasn t thinking whether it was just or unjust even if he hadn t deserved it I d have done it just the same 
246_122825_000041_000004	train-clean-360	That is what humiliates me 
none	none	Well we all make mistakes dear so just put it behind you We should regret our mistakes and learn from them but never carry them forward into the future with us 
246_122825_000042_000002	train-clean-360	There goes Gilbert Blythe on his wheel home for his vacation too I suppose 
none	none	How are you and he getting on with your studies Pretty well We plan to finish the Virgil tonight there are only twenty lines to do Then we are not going to study any more until September
246_122825_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you think you will ever get to college 
none	none	Oh I don t know Anne looked dreamily afar to the opal tinted horizon
246_122825_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 Marilla s eyes will never be much better than they are now although we are so thankful to think that they will not get worse 
none	none	And then there are the twins somehow I don t believe their uncle will ever really send for them Perhaps college may be around the bend in the road but I haven t got to the bend yet and I don t think much about it lest I might grow discontented Well I should like to see you go to college Anne but if you never do don t be discontented about it We make our own lives wherever we are after all college can only help us to do it more easily They are broad or narrow according to what we put into them not what we get out Life is rich and full here everywhere if we can only learn how to open our whole hearts to its richness and fulness I think I understand what you mean said Anne thoughtfully and I know I have so much to feel thankful for oh so much my work and Paul Irving and the dear twins and all my friends Do you know missus Allan I m so thankful for friendship It beautifies life so much True friendship is a very helpful thing indeed said missus Allan and we should have a very high ideal of it and never sully it by any failure in truth and sincerity I fear the name of friendship is often degraded to a kind of intimacy that has nothing of real friendship in it Yes like Gertie Pye s and Julia Bell s They are very intimate and go everywhere together but Gertie is always saying nasty things of Julia behind her back and everybody thinks she is jealous of her because she is always so pleased when anybody criticizes Julia 
246_122825_000049_000002	train-clean-360	I think it is desecration to call that friendship 
none	none	If we have friends we should look only for the best in them and give them the best that is in us don t you think Then friendship would be the most beautiful thing in the world
246_122825_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Friendship IS very beautiful smiled missus Allan but some day 
246_122825_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Then she paused abruptly 
none	none	In the delicate white browed face beside her with its candid eyes and mobile features there was still far more of the child than of the woman Anne s heart so far harbored only dreams of friendship and ambition and missus Allan did not wish to brush the bloom from her sweet unconsciousness So she left her sentence for the future years to finish XVI The Substance of Things Hoped For Anne said Davy appealingly scrambling up on the shiny leather covered sofa in the Green Gables kitchen where Anne sat reading a letter Anne I m AWFUL hungry You ve no idea I ll get you a piece of bread and butter in a minute said Anne absently Her letter evidently contained some exciting news for her cheeks were as pink as the roses on the big bush outside and her eyes were as starry as only Anne s eyes could be But I ain t bread and butter hungry said Davy in a disgusted tone I m plum cake hungry Oh laughed Anne laying down her letter and putting her arm about Davy to give him a squeeze that s a kind of hunger that can be endured very comfortably Davy boy You know it s one of Marilla s rules that you can t have anything but bread and butter between meals Well gimme a piece then please Davy had been at last taught to say please but he generally tacked it on as an afterthought He looked with approval at the generous slice Anne presently brought to him You always put such a nice lot of butter on it Anne Marilla spreads it pretty thin It slips down a lot easier when there s plenty of butter The slice slipped down with tolerable ease judging from its rapid disappearance Davy slid head first off the sofa turned a double somersault on the rug and then sat up and announced decidedly Anne I ve made up my mind about heaven I don t want to go there Why not asked Anne gravely Cause heaven is in Simon Fletcher s garret and I don t like Simon Fletcher Heaven in Simon Fletcher s garret gasped Anne too amazed even to laugh Davy Keith whatever put such an extraordinary idea into your head Milty Boulter says that s where it is It was last Sunday in Sunday School The lesson was about Elijah and Elisha and I up and asked Miss Rogerson where heaven was Miss Rogerson looked awful offended She was cross anyhow because when she d asked us what Elijah left Elisha when he went to heaven Milty Boulter said His old clo es and us fellows all laughed before we thought I wish you could think first and do things afterwards cause then you wouldn t do them But Milty didn t mean to be disrespeckful He just couldn t think of the name of the thing Miss Rogerson said heaven was where God was and I wasn t to ask questions like that Milty nudged me and said in a whisper Heaven s in Uncle Simon s garret and I ll esplain about it on the road home So when we was coming home he esplained Milty s a great hand at esplaining things Even if he don t know anything about a thing he ll make up a lot of stuff and so you get it esplained all the same His mother is missus Simon s sister and he went with her to the funeral when his cousin Jane Ellen died The minister said she d gone to heaven though Milty says she was lying right before them in the coffin But he s posed they carried the coffin to the garret afterwards Well when Milty and his mother went upstairs after it was all over to get her bonnet he asked her where heaven was that Jane Ellen had gone to and she pointed right to the ceiling and said Up there Milty knew there wasn t anything but the garret over the ceiling so that s how HE found out And he s been awful scared to go to his Uncle Simon s ever since Anne took Davy on her knee and did her best to straighten out this theological tangle also She was much better fitted for the task than Marilla for she remembered her own childhood and had an instinctive understanding of the curious ideas that seven year olds sometimes get about matters that are of course very plain and simple to grown up people She had just succeeded in convincing Davy that heaven was NOT in Simon Fletcher s garret when Marilla came in from the garden where she and Dora had been picking peas Dora was an industrious little soul and never happier than when helping in various small tasks suited to her chubby fingers She fed chickens picked up chips wiped dishes and ran errands galore She was neat faithful and observant she never had to be told how to do a thing twice and never forgot any of her little duties Davy on the other hand was rather heedless and forgetful but he had the born knack of winning love and even yet Anne and Marilla liked him the better While Dora proudly shelled the peas and Davy made boats of the pods with masts of matches and sails of paper Anne told Marilla about the wonderful contents of her letter Oh Marilla what do you think I ve had a letter from Priscilla and she says that missus Morgan is on the Island and that if it is fine Thursday they are going to drive up to Avonlea and will reach here about twelve They will spend the afternoon with us and go to the hotel at White Sands in the evening because some of missus Morgan s American friends are staying there Oh Marilla isn t it wonderful I can hardly believe I m not dreaming I daresay missus Morgan is a lot like other people said Marilla drily although she did feel a trifle excited herself missus Morgan was a famous woman and a visit from her was no commonplace occurrence They ll be here to dinner then Yes and oh Marilla may I cook every bit of the dinner myself I want to feel that I can do something for the author of The Rosebud Garden if it is only to cook a dinner for her You won t mind will you Goodness I m not so fond of stewing over a hot fire in July that it would vex me very much to have someone else do it You re quite welcome to the job Oh thank you said Anne as if Marilla had just conferred a tremendous favor I ll make out the menu this very night You d better not try to put on too much style warned Marilla a little alarmed by the high flown sound of menu You ll likely come to grief if you do Oh I m not going to put on any style if you mean trying to do or have things we don t usually have on festal occasions assured Anne That would be affectation and although I know I haven t as much sense and steadiness as a girl of seventeen and a schoolteacher ought to have I m not so silly as THAT But I want to have everything as nice and dainty as possible Davy boy don t leave those peapods on the back stairs someone might slip on them I ll have a light soup to begin with you know I can make lovely cream of onion soup and then a couple of roast fowls I ll have the two white roosters I have real affection for those roosters and they ve been pets ever since the gray hen hatched out just the two of them little balls of yellow down But I know they would have to be sacrificed sometime and surely there couldn t be a worthier occasion than this But oh Marilla I cannot kill them not even for missus Morgan s sake I ll have to ask John Henry Carter to come over and do it for me I ll do it volunteered Davy if Marilla ll hold them by the legs cause I guess it d take both my hands to manage the axe It s awful jolly fun to see them hopping about after their heads are cut off Then I ll have peas and beans and creamed potatoes and a lettuce salad for vegetables resumed Anne and for dessert lemon pie with whipped cream and coffee and cheese and lady fingers I ll make the pies and lady fingers tomorrow and do up my white muslin dress And I must tell Diana tonight for she ll want to do up hers missus Morgan s heroines are nearly always dressed in white muslin and Diana and I have always resolved that that was what we would wear if we ever met her It will be such a delicate compliment don t you think Davy dear you mustn t poke peapods into the cracks of the floor I must ask mister and missus Allan and Miss Stacy to dinner too for they re all very anxious to meet missus Morgan It s so fortunate she s coming while Miss Stacy is here Davy dear don t sail the peapods in the water bucket go out to the trough Oh I do hope it will be fine Thursday and I think it will for Uncle Abe said last night when he called at mister Harrison s that it was going to rain most of this week That s a good sign agreed Marilla Anne ran across to Orchard Slope that evening to tell the news to Diana who was also very much excited over it and they discussed the matter in the hammock swung under the big willow in the Barry garden Oh Anne mayn t I help you cook the dinner implored Diana You know I can make splendid lettuce salad Indeed you may said Anne unselfishly And I shall want you to help me decorate too I mean to have the parlor simply a BOWER of blossoms and the dining table is to be adorned with wild roses Oh I do hope everything will go smoothly missus Morgan s heroines NEVER get into scrapes or are taken at a disadvantage and they are always so selfpossessed and such good housekeepers They seem to be BORN good housekeepers You remember that Gertrude in Edgewood Days kept house for her father when she was only eight years old When I was eight years old I hardly knew how to do a thing except bring up children missus Morgan must be an authority on girls when she has written so much about them and I do want her to have a good opinion of us I ve imagined it all out a dozen different ways what she ll look like and what she ll say and what I ll say And I m so anxious about my nose There are seven freckles on it as you can see They came at the A V I S picnic when I went around in the sun without my hat I suppose it s ungrateful of me to worry over them when I should be thankful they re not spread all over my face as they once were but I do wish they hadn t come all missus Morgan s heroines have such perfect complexions I can t recall a freckled one among them Yours are not very noticeable comforted Diana Try a little lemon juice on them tonight The next day Anne made her pies and lady fingers did up her muslin dress and swept and dusted every room in the house a quite unnecessary proceeding for Green Gables was as usual in the apple pie order dear to Marilla s heart But Anne felt that a fleck of dust would be a desecration in a house that was to be honored by a visit from Charlotte E Morgan She even cleaned out the catch all closet under the stairs although there was not the remotest possibility of missus Morgan s seeing its interior But I want to FEEL that it is in perfect order even if she isn t to see it Anne told Marilla You know in her book Golden Keys she makes her two heroines Alice and Louisa take for their motto that verse of Longfellow s In the elder days of art Builders wrought with greatest care Each minute and unseen part For the gods see everywhere and so they always kept their cellar stairs scrubbed and never forgot to sweep under the beds I should have a guilty conscience if I thought this closet was in disorder when missus Morgan was in the house Ever since we read Golden Keys last April Diana and I have taken that verse for our motto too That night John Henry Carter and Davy between them contrived to execute the two white roosters and Anne dressed them the usually distasteful task glorified in her eyes by the destination of the plump birds I don t like picking fowls she told Marilla but isn t it fortunate we don t have to put our souls into what our hands may be doing I ve been picking chickens with my hands but in imagination I ve been roaming the Milky Way I thought you d scattered more feathers over the floor than usual remarked Marilla Then Anne put Davy to bed and made him promise that he would behave perfectly the next day If I m as good as good can be all day tomorrow will you let me be just as bad as I like all the next day asked Davy I couldn t do that said Anne discreetly but I ll take you and Dora for a row in the flat right to the bottom of the pond and we ll go ashore on the sandhills and have a picnic It s a bargain said Davy I ll be good you bet I meant to go over to mister Harrison s and fire peas from my new popgun at Ginger but another day ll do as well I espect it will be just like Sunday but a picnic at the shore ll make up for THAT XVII A Chapter of Accidents Anne woke three times in the night and made pilgrimages to her window to make sure that Uncle Abe s prediction was not coming true Finally the morning dawned pearly and lustrous in a sky full of silver sheen and radiance and the wonderful day had arrived Diana appeared soon after breakfast with a basket of flowers over one arm and HER muslin dress over the other for it would not do to don it until all the dinner preparations were completed Meanwhile she wore her afternoon pink print and a lawn apron fearfully and wonderfully ruffled and frilled and very neat and pretty and rosy she was You look simply sweet said Anne admiringly Diana sighed But I ve had to let out every one of my dresses AGAIN I weigh four pounds more than I did in July Anne WHERE will this end missus Morgan s heroines are all tall and slender Well let s forget our troubles and think of our mercies said Anne gaily missus Allan says that whenever we think of anything that is a trial to us we should also think of something nice that we can set over against it If you are slightly too plump you ve got the dearest dimples and if I have a freckled nose the SHAPE of it is all right Do you think the lemon juice did any good Yes I really think it did said Diana critically and much elated Anne led the way to the garden which was full of airy shadows and wavering golden lights We ll decorate the parlor first We have plenty of time for Priscilla said they d be here about twelve or half past at the latest so we ll have dinner at one 
16_122827_000000_000000	train-clean-360	There may have been two happier and more excited girls somewhere in Canada or the United States at that moment but I doubt it 
16_122827_000000_000001	train-clean-360	Every snip of the scissors as rose and peony and bluebell fell seemed to chirp missus Morgan is coming today Anne wondered how mister Harrison COULD go on placidly mowing hay in the field across the lane just as if nothing were going to happen 
16_122827_000001_000000	train-clean-360	The parlor at Green Gables was a rather severe and gloomy apartment with rigid horsehair furniture stiff lace curtains and white antimacassars that were always laid at a perfectly correct angle except at such times as they clung to unfortunate people s buttons 
16_122827_000001_000001	train-clean-360	Even Anne had never been able to infuse much grace into it for Marilla would not permit any alterations 
16_122827_000001_000002	train-clean-360	But it is wonderful what flowers can accomplish if you give them a fair chance when Anne and Diana finished with the room you would not have recognized it 
16_122827_000002_000000	train-clean-360	A great blue bowlful of snowballs overflowed on the polished table 
16_122827_000002_000001	train-clean-360	The shining black mantelpiece was heaped with roses and ferns 
16_122827_000002_000002	train-clean-360	Every shelf of the what not held a sheaf of bluebells the dark corners on either side of the grate were lighted up with jars full of glowing crimson peonies and the grate itself was aflame with yellow poppies 
16_122827_000002_000003	train-clean-360	All this splendor and color mingled with the sunshine falling through the honeysuckle vines at the windows in a leafy riot of dancing shadows over walls and floor made of the usually dismal little room the veritable bower of Anne s imagination and even extorted a tribute of admiration from Marilla who came in to criticize and remained to praise 
16_122827_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Now we must set the table said Anne in the tone of a priestess about to perform some sacred rite in honor of a divinity 
none	none	We ll have a big vaseful of wild roses in the center and one single rose in front of everybody s plate and a special bouquet of rosebuds only by missus Morgan s an allusion to The Rosebud Garden you know 
16_122827_000004_000000	train-clean-360	The table was set in the sitting room with Marilla s finest linen and the best china glass and silver 
16_122827_000004_000001	train-clean-360	You may be perfectly certain that every article placed on it was polished or scoured to the highest possible perfection of gloss and glitter 
none	none	Then the girls tripped out to the kitchen which was filled with appetizing odors emanating from the oven where the chickens were already sizzling splendidly Anne prepared the potatoes and Diana got the peas and beans ready Then while Diana shut herself into the pantry to compound the lettuce salad Anne whose cheeks were already beginning to glow crimson as much with excitement as from the heat of the fire prepared the bread sauce for the chickens minced her onions for the soup and finally whipped the cream for her lemon pies 
16_122827_000006_000000	train-clean-360	And what about Davy all this time 
16_122827_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Was he redeeming his promise to be good 
none	none	He was indeed 
16_122827_000006_000003	train-clean-360	To be sure he insisted on remaining in the kitchen for his curiosity wanted to see all that went on 
none	none	But as he sat quietly in a corner busily engaged in untying the knots in a piece of herring net he had brought home from his last trip to the shore nobody objected to this 
16_122827_000007_000000	train-clean-360	At half past eleven the lettuce salad was made the golden circles of the pies were heaped with whipped cream and everything was sizzling and bubbling that ought to sizzle and bubble 
none	none	We d better go and dress now said Anne for they may be here by twelve 
16_122827_000008_000001	train-clean-360	We must have dinner at sharp one for the soup must be served as soon as it s done 
none	none	Serious indeed were the toilet rites presently performed in the east gable Anne peered anxiously at her nose and rejoiced to see that its freckles were not at all prominent thanks either to the lemon juice or to the unusual flush on her cheeks When they were ready they looked quite as sweet and trim and girlish as ever did any of missus Morgan s heroines
16_122827_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 I do hope I ll be able to say something once in a while and not sit like a mute said Diana anxiously 
16_122827_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 All missus Morgan s heroines converse so beautifully 
16_122827_000010_000002	train-clean-360	But I m afraid I ll be tongue tied and stupid 
16_122827_000010_000003	train-clean-360	And I ll be sure to say I seen I haven t often said it since Miss Stacy taught here but in moments of excitement it s sure to pop out 
none	none	Anne if I were to say I seen before missus Morgan I d die of mortification 
16_122827_000010_000005	train-clean-360	And it would be almost as bad to have nothing to say 
16_122827_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 I m nervous about a good many things said Anne but I don t think there is much fear that I won t be able to talk 
16_122827_000012_000000	train-clean-360	And to do her justice there wasn t 
none	none	Anne shrouded her muslin glories in a big apron and went down to concoct her soup Marilla had dressed herself and the twins and looked more excited than she had ever been known to look before 
16_122827_000013_000002	train-clean-360	At half past twelve the Allans and Miss Stacy came 
16_122827_000013_000003	train-clean-360	Everything was going well but Anne was beginning to feel nervous 
16_122827_000013_000004	train-clean-360	It was surely time for Priscilla and missus Morgan to arrive 
16_122827_000013_000005	train-clean-360	She made frequent trips to the gate and looked as anxiously down the lane as ever her namesake in the Bluebeard story peered from the tower casement 
16_122827_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Suppose they don t come at all she said piteously 
16_122827_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t suppose it 
none	none	It would be too mean said Diana who however was beginning to have uncomfortable misgivings on the subject Anne said Marilla coming out from the parlor Miss Stacy wants to see Miss Barry s willowware platter Anne hastened to the sitting room closet to get the platter 
16_122827_000017_000001	train-clean-360	She had in accordance with her promise to missus Lynde written to Miss Barry of Charlottetown asking for the loan of it 
none	none	Miss Barry was an old friend of Anne s and she promptly sent the platter out with a letter exhorting Anne to be very careful of it for she had paid twenty dollars for it The platter had served its purpose at the Aid bazaar and had then been returned to the Green Gables closet for Anne would not trust anybody but herself to take it back to town She carried the platter carefully to the front door where her guests were enjoying the cool breeze that blew up from the brook 
16_122827_000018_000001	train-clean-360	It was examined and admired then just as Anne had taken it back into her own hands a terrific crash and clatter sounded from the kitchen pantry Marilla Diana and Anne fled out the latter pausing only long enough to set the precious platter hastily down on the second step of the stairs 
none	none	When they reached the pantry a truly harrowing spectacle met their eyes a guilty looking small boy scrambling down from the table with his clean print blouse liberally plastered with yellow filling and on the table the shattered remnants of what had been two brave becreamed lemon pies 
16_122827_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Davy had finished ravelling out his herring net and had wound the twine into a ball 
16_122827_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Then he had gone into the pantry to put it up on the shelf above the table where he already kept a score or so of similar balls which so far as could be discovered served no useful purpose save to yield the joy of possession 
16_122827_000020_000002	train-clean-360	Davy had to climb on the table and reach over to the shelf at a dangerous angle something he had been forbidden by Marilla to do as he had come to grief once before in the experiment 
none	none	The result in this instance was disastrous 
16_122827_000020_000004	train-clean-360	Davy slipped and came sprawling squarely down on the lemon pies 
16_122827_000020_000005	train-clean-360	His clean blouse was ruined for that time and the pies for all time 
16_122827_000020_000006	train-clean-360	It is however an ill wind that blows nobody good and the pig was eventually the gainer by Davy s mischance 
16_122827_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Davy Keith said Marilla shaking him by the shoulder didn t I forbid you to climb up on that table again 
16_122827_000021_000001	train-clean-360	didn t I 
none	none	forbid you to climb up on that table again Didn t I
16_122827_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I forgot whimpered Davy 
none	none	You ve told me not to do such an awful lot of things that I can t remember them all Well you march upstairs and stay there till after dinner 
16_122827_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Perhaps you ll get them sorted out in your memory by that time 
none	none	No Anne never you mind interceding for him 
16_122827_000023_000003	train-clean-360	I m not punishing him because he spoiled your pies that was an accident 
16_122827_000023_000004	train-clean-360	I m punishing him for his disobedience 
16_122827_000023_000005	train-clean-360	Go Davy I say 
16_122827_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Ain t I to have any dinner wailed Davy 
16_122827_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 You can come down after dinner is over and have yours in the kitchen 
16_122827_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh all right said Davy somewhat comforted 
none	none	I know Anne ll save some nice bones for me won t you Anne Cause you know I didn t mean to fall on the pies Say Anne since they ARE spoiled can t I take some of the pieces upstairs with me No no lemon pie for you Master Davy said Marilla pushing him toward the hall
16_122827_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 What shall we do for dessert asked Anne looking regretfully at the wreck and ruin 
16_122827_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Get out a crock of strawberry preserves said Marilla consolingly There s plenty of whipped cream left in the bowl for it 
16_122827_000030_000000	train-clean-360	One o clock came but no Priscilla or missus Morgan 
none	none	Anne was in an agony 
16_122827_000030_000002	train-clean-360	Everything was done to a turn and the soup was just what soup should be but couldn t be depended on to remain so for any length of time 
16_122827_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t believe they re coming after all said Marilla crossly 
none	none	Anne and Diana sought comfort in each other s eyes 
16_122827_000033_000000	train-clean-360	At half past one Marilla again emerged from the parlor 
16_122827_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Girls we MUST have dinner 
none	none	Everybody is hungry and it s no use waiting any longer 
16_122827_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Priscilla and missus Morgan are not coming that s plain and nothing is being improved by waiting 
16_122827_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Anne and Diana set about lifting the dinner with all the zest gone out of the performance 
16_122827_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t believe I ll be able to eat a mouthful said Diana dolefully 
none	none	Nor I But I hope everything will be nice for Miss Stacy s and mister and missus Allan s sakes said Anne listlessly 
16_122827_000038_000000	train-clean-360	When Diana dished the peas she tasted them and a very peculiar expression crossed her face 
none	none	Anne did YOU put sugar in these peas
16_122827_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said Anne mashing the potatoes with the air of one expected to do her duty 
16_122827_000040_000001	train-clean-360	 I put a spoonful of sugar in 
16_122827_000040_000002	train-clean-360	We always do 
16_122827_000040_000003	train-clean-360	Don t you like it 
none	none	But I put a spoonful in too when I set them on the stove said Diana Anne dropped her masher and tasted the peas also 
16_122827_000042_000001	train-clean-360	Then she made a grimace 
none	none	How awful I never dreamed you had put sugar in because I knew your mother never does 
16_122827_000043_000002	train-clean-360	I happened to think of it for a wonder 
16_122827_000043_000003	train-clean-360	I m always forgetting it so I popped a spoonful in 
16_122827_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 It s a case of too many cooks I guess said Marilla who had listened to this dialogue with a rather guilty expression 
none	none	I didn t think you d remember about the sugar Anne for I m perfectly certain you never did before so I put in a spoonful 
16_122827_000045_000000	train-clean-360	The guests in the parlor heard peal after peal of laughter from the kitchen but they never knew what the fun was about 
16_122827_000045_000001	train-clean-360	There were no green peas on the dinner table that day however 
none	none	Well said Anne sobering down again with a sigh of recollection we have the salad anyhow and I don t think anything has happened to the beans 
16_122827_000046_000001	train-clean-360	Let s carry the things in and get it over 
16_122827_000047_000000	train-clean-360	It cannot be said that that dinner was a notable success socially The Allans and Miss Stacy exerted themselves to save the situation and Marilla s customary placidity was not noticeably ruffled 
16_122827_000047_000001	train-clean-360	But Anne and Diana between their disappointment and the reaction from their excitement of the forenoon could neither talk nor eat 
none	none	Anne tried heroically to bear her part in the conversation for the sake of her guests but all the sparkle had been quenched in her for the time being and in spite of her love for the Allans and Miss Stacy she couldn t help thinking how nice it would be when everybody had gone home and she could bury her weariness and disappointment in the pillows of the east gable 
16_122827_000048_000000	train-clean-360	There is an old proverb that really seems at times to be inspired it never rains but it pours The measure of that day s tribulations was not yet full 
16_122827_000048_000001	train-clean-360	Just as mister Allan had finished returning thanks there arose a strange ominous sound on the stairs as of some hard heavy object bounding from step to step finishing up with a grand smash at the bottom 
16_122827_000048_000002	train-clean-360	Everybody ran out into the hall 
none	none	Anne gave a shriek of dismay 
16_122827_000049_000000	train-clean-360	At the bottom of the stairs lay a big pink conch shell amid the fragments of what had been Miss Barry s platter and at the top of the stairs knelt a terrified Davy gazing down with wide open eyes at the havoc 
16_122827_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Davy said Marilla ominously did you throw that conch down ON PURPOSE 
16_122827_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 No I never did whimpered Davy 
none	none	I was just kneeling here quiet as quiet to watch you folks through the bannisters and my foot struck that old thing and pushed it off and I m awful hungry and I do wish you d lick a fellow and have done with it instead of always sending him upstairs to miss all the fun Don t blame Davy said Anne gathering up the fragments with trembling fingers
16_122827_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 It was my fault 
none	none	I set that platter there and forgot all about it 
16_122827_000052_000003	train-clean-360	I am properly punished for my carelessness but oh what will Miss Barry say 
16_122827_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Well you know she only bought it so it isn t the same as if it was an heirloom said Diana trying to console 
16_122827_000054_000000	train-clean-360	The guests went away soon after feeling that it was the most tactful thing to do and Anne and Diana washed the dishes talking less than they had ever been known to do before 
16_122827_000054_000001	train-clean-360	Then Diana went home with a headache and Anne went with another to the east gable where she stayed until Marilla came home from the post office at sunset with a letter from Priscilla written the day before 
none	none	missus Morgan had sprained her ankle so severely that she could not leave her room
16_122827_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 And oh Anne dear wrote Priscilla I m so sorry but I m afraid we won t get up to Green Gables at all now for by the time Aunty s ankle is well she will have to go back to Toronto 
16_122827_000055_000001	train-clean-360	She has to be there by a certain date 
16_122827_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Well sighed Anne laying the letter down on the red sandstone step of the back porch where she was sitting while the twilight rained down out of a dappled sky I always thought it was too good to be true that missus Morgan should really come 
16_122827_000056_000001	train-clean-360	But there that speech sounds as pessimistic as Miss Eliza Andrews and I m ashamed of making it 
16_122827_000056_000002	train-clean-360	After all it was NOT too good to be true things just as good and far better are coming true for me all the time 
16_122827_000056_000003	train-clean-360	And I suppose the events of today have a funny side too 
16_122827_000056_000004	train-clean-360	Perhaps when Diana and I are old and gray we shall be able to laugh over them 
16_122827_000056_000005	train-clean-360	But I feel that I can t expect to do it before then for it has truly been a bitter disappointment 
16_122827_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 You ll probably have a good many more and worse disappointments than that before you get through life said Marilla who honestly thought she was making a comforting speech 
16_122827_000057_000001	train-clean-360	 It seems to me Anne that you are never going to outgrow your fashion of setting your heart so on things and then crashing down into despair because you don t get them 
16_122827_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 I know I m too much inclined that way agreed Anne ruefully 
16_122827_000058_000001	train-clean-360	 When I think something nice is going to happen I seem to fly right up on the wings of anticipation and then the first thing I realize I drop down to earth with a thud 
16_122827_000058_000002	train-clean-360	But really Marilla the flying part IS glorious as long as it lasts it s like soaring through a sunset 
16_122827_000058_000003	train-clean-360	I think it almost pays for the thud 
16_122827_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Well maybe it does admitted Marilla 
16_122827_000059_000001	train-clean-360	 I d rather walk calmly along and do without both flying and thud 
16_122827_000059_000002	train-clean-360	But everybody has her own way of living 
none	none	I used to think there was only one right way but since I ve had you and the twins to bring up I don t feel so sure of it 
16_122827_000059_000004	train-clean-360	What are you going to do about Miss Barry s platter 
16_122827_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Pay her back the twenty dollars she paid for it I suppose 
16_122827_000060_000001	train-clean-360	I m so thankful it wasn t a cherished heirloom because then no money could replace it 
16_122827_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Maybe you could find one like it somewhere and buy it for her 
16_122827_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 I m afraid not 
16_122827_000062_000001	train-clean-360	Platters as old as that are very scarce 
16_122827_000062_000002	train-clean-360	missus Lynde couldn t find one anywhere for the supper 
16_122827_000062_000003	train-clean-360	I only wish I could for of course Miss Barry would just as soon have one platter as another if both were equally old and genuine 
16_122827_000062_000004	train-clean-360	Marilla look at that big star over mister Harrison s maple grove with all that holy hush of silvery sky about it 
none	none	It gives me a feeling that is like a prayer After all when one can see stars and skies like that little disappointments and accidents can t matter so much can they
16_122827_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Where s Davy said Marilla with an indifferent glance at the star 
none	none	In bed I ve promised to take him and Dora to the shore for a picnic tomorrow 
16_122827_000064_000002	train-clean-360	Of course the original agreement was that he must be good But he TRIED to be good and I hadn t the heart to disappoint him 
16_122827_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 You ll drown yourself or the twins rowing about the pond in that flat grumbled Marilla 
16_122827_000065_000001	train-clean-360	 I ve lived here for sixty years and I ve never been on the pond yet 
16_122827_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 Well it s never too late to mend said Anne roguishly 
16_122827_000066_000001	train-clean-360	 Suppose you come with us tomorrow 
16_122827_000066_000002	train-clean-360	We ll shut Green Gables up and spend the whole day at the shore daffing the world aside 
16_122827_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 No thank you said Marilla with indignant emphasis 
16_122827_000067_000001	train-clean-360	 I d be a nice sight wouldn t I rowing down the pond in a flat 
16_122827_000067_000002	train-clean-360	I think I hear Rachel pronouncing on it 
none	none	There s mister Harrison driving away somewhere Do you suppose there is any truth in the gossip that mister Harrison is going to see Isabella Andrews
16_122827_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 No I m sure there isn t 
16_122827_000068_000001	train-clean-360	He just called there one evening on business with mister Harmon Andrews and missus Lynde saw him and said she knew he was courting because he had a white collar on 
16_122827_000068_000002	train-clean-360	I don t believe mister Harrison will ever marry 
16_122827_000068_000003	train-clean-360	He seems to have a prejudice against marriage 
16_122827_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Well you can never tell about those old bachelors 
none	none	And if he had a white collar on I d agree with Rachel that it looks suspicious for I m sure he never was seen with one before
16_122827_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 I think he only put it on because he wanted to conclude a business deal with Harmon Andrews said Anne 
16_122827_000070_000001	train-clean-360	 I ve heard him say that s the only time a man needs to be particular about his appearance because if he looks prosperous the party of the second part won t be so likely to try to cheat him 
16_122827_000070_000002	train-clean-360	I really feel sorry for mister Harrison I don t believe he feels satisfied with his life 
16_122827_000070_000003	train-clean-360	It must be very lonely to have no one to care about except a parrot don t you think 
16_122827_000070_000004	train-clean-360	But I notice mister Harrison doesn t like to be pitied 
none	none	Nobody does I imagine There s Gilbert coming up the lane said Marilla If he wants you to go for a row on the pond mind you put on your coat and rubbers There s a heavy dew tonight XVIII An Adventure on the Tory Road Anne said Davy sitting up in bed and propping his chin on his hands Anne where is sleep People go to sleep every night and of course I know it s the place where I do the things I dream but I want to know WHERE it is and how I get there and back without knowing anything about it and in my nighty too Where is it Anne was kneeling at the west gable window watching the sunset sky that was like a great flower with petals of crocus and a heart of fiery yellow 
16_122828_000000_000001	train-clean-360	She turned her head at Davy s question and answered dreamily 
16_122828_000001_000000	train-clean-360	 Over the mountains of the moon Down the valley of the shadow 
16_122828_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Paul Irving would have known the meaning of this or made a meaning out of it for himself if he didn t but practical Davy who as Anne often despairingly remarked hadn t a particle of imagination was only puzzled and disgusted 
none	none	Anne I believe you re just talking nonsense
16_122828_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course I was dear boy 
16_122828_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Don t you know that it is only very foolish folk who talk sense all the time 
none	none	Well I think you might give a sensible answer when I ask a sensible question said Davy in an injured tone
16_122828_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh you are too little to understand said Anne 
16_122828_000006_000001	train-clean-360	But she felt rather ashamed of saying it for had she not in keen remembrance of many similar snubs administered in her own early years solemnly vowed that she would never tell any child it was too little to understand 
16_122828_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Yet here she was doing it so wide sometimes is the gulf between theory and practice 
16_122828_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I m doing my best to grow said Davy but it s a thing you can t hurry much 
16_122828_000007_000001	train-clean-360	If Marilla wasn t so stingy with her jam I believe I d grow a lot faster 
16_122828_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Marilla is not stingy Davy said Anne severely 
16_122828_000008_000001	train-clean-360	 It is very ungrateful of you to say such a thing 
none	none	There s another word that means the same thing and sounds a lot better but I don t just remember it said Davy frowning intently
16_122828_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 I heard Marilla say she was it herself the other day 
16_122828_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 If you mean ECONOMICAL it s a VERY different thing from being stingy It is an excellent trait in a person if she is economical 
16_122828_000010_000001	train-clean-360	If Marilla had been stingy she wouldn t have taken you and Dora when your mother died 
16_122828_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Would you have liked to live with missus Wiggins 
16_122828_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 You just bet I wouldn t Davy was emphatic on that point 
16_122828_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 Nor I don t want to go out to Uncle Richard neither 
none	none	I d far rather live here even if Marilla is that long tailed word when it comes to jam cause YOU RE here Anne Say Anne won t you tell me a story fore I go to sleep 
16_122828_000011_000004	train-clean-360	I don t want a fairy story 
none	none	They re all right for girls I s pose but I want something exciting lots of killing and shooting in it and a house on fire and in trusting things like that 
16_122828_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Fortunately for Anne Marilla called out at this moment from her room 
none	none	Anne Diana s signaling at a great rate 
16_122828_000013_000001	train-clean-360	You d better see what she wants 
none	none	Anne ran to the east gable and saw flashes of light coming through the twilight from Diana s window in groups of five which meant according to their old childish code Come over at once for I have something important to reveal Anne threw her white shawl over her head and hastened through the Haunted Wood and across mister Bell s pasture corner to Orchard Slope
16_122828_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 I ve good news for you Anne said Diana 
16_122828_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 Mother and I have just got home from Carmody and I saw Mary Sentner from Spencer vale in mister Blair s store 
16_122828_000015_000002	train-clean-360	She says the old Copp girls on the Tory Road have a willow ware platter and she thinks it s exactly like the one we had at the supper 
none	none	She says they ll likely sell it for Martha Copp has never been known to keep anything she COULD sell but if they won t there s a platter at Wesley Keyson s at Spencervale and she knows they d sell it but she isn t sure it s just the same kind as Aunt Josephine s
16_122828_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll go right over to Spencervale after it tomorrow said Anne resolutely and you must come with me 
16_122828_000016_000001	train-clean-360	It will be such a weight off my mind for I have to go to town day after tomorrow and how can I face your Aunt Josephine without a willow ware platter 
16_122828_000016_000002	train-clean-360	It would be even worse than the time I had to confess about jumping on the spare room bed 
16_122828_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Both girls laughed over the old memory concerning which if any of my readers are ignorant and curious I must refer them to Anne s earlier history 
16_122828_000018_000000	train-clean-360	The next afternoon the girls fared forth on their platter hunting expedition 
16_122828_000018_000001	train-clean-360	It was ten miles to Spencervale and the day was not especially pleasant for traveling 
16_122828_000018_000002	train-clean-360	It was very warm and windless and the dust on the road was such as might have been expected after six weeks of dry weather 
none	none	Oh I do wish it would rain soon sighed Anne
16_122828_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 Everything is so parched up 
none	none	The poor fields just seem pitiful to me and the trees seem to be stretching out their hands pleading for rain 
16_122828_000019_000003	train-clean-360	As for my garden it hurts me every time I go into it 
16_122828_000019_000004	train-clean-360	I suppose I shouldn t complain about a garden when the farmers crops are suffering so 
16_122828_000019_000005	train-clean-360	mister Harrison says his pastures are so scorched up that his poor cows can hardly get a bite to eat and he feels guilty of cruelty to animals every time he meets their eyes 
16_122828_000020_000000	train-clean-360	After a wearisome drive the girls reached Spencervale and turned down the Tory Road a green solitary highway where the strips of grass between the wheel tracks bore evidence to lack of travel 
16_122828_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Along most of its extent it was lined with thick set young spruces crowding down to the roadway with here and there a break where the back field of a Spencervale farm came out to the fence or an expanse of stumps was aflame with fireweed and goldenrod 
none	none	Why is it called the Tory Road asked Anne mister 
16_122828_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Allan says it is on the principle of calling a place a grove because there are no trees in it said Diana for nobody lives along the road except the Copp girls and old Martin Bovyer at the further end who is a Liberal 
16_122828_000022_000002	train-clean-360	The Tory government ran the road through when they were in power just to show they were doing something 
16_122828_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Diana s father was a Liberal for which reason she and Anne never discussed politics 
16_122828_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Green Gables folk had always been Conservatives 
16_122828_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Finally the girls came to the old Copp homestead a place of such exceeding external neatness that even Green Gables would have suffered by contrast 
16_122828_000024_000001	train-clean-360	The house was a very old fashioned one situated on a slope which fact had necessitated the building of a stone basement under one end 
16_122828_000024_000002	train-clean-360	The house and out buildings were all whitewashed to a condition of blinding perfection and not a weed was visible in the prim kitchen garden surrounded by its white paling 
16_122828_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 The shades are all down said Diana ruefully 
16_122828_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 I believe that nobody is home 
16_122828_000026_000000	train-clean-360	This proved to be the case 
16_122828_000026_000001	train-clean-360	The girls looked at each other in perplexity 
16_122828_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know what to do said Anne 
16_122828_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 If I were sure the platter was the right kind I would not mind waiting until they came home 
16_122828_000027_000002	train-clean-360	But if it isn t it may be too late to go to Wesley Keyson s afterward 
16_122828_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Diana looked at a certain little square window over the basement 
16_122828_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 That is the pantry window I feel sure she said because this house is just like Uncle Charles at Newbridge and that is their pantry window 
16_122828_000029_000001	train-clean-360	The shade isn t down so if we climbed up on the roof of that little house we could look into the pantry and might be able to see the platter 
none	none	Do you think it would be any harm
16_122828_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 No I don t think so decided Anne after due reflection since our motive is not idle curiosity 
16_122828_000031_000000	train-clean-360	This important point of ethics being settled Anne prepared to mount the aforesaid little house a construction of lathes with a peaked roof which had in times past served as a habitation for ducks 
16_122828_000031_000001	train-clean-360	The Copp girls had given up keeping ducks 
none	none	because they were such untidy birds and the house had not been in use for some years save as an abode of correction for setting hens 
16_122828_000031_000003	train-clean-360	Although scrupulously whitewashed it had become somewhat shaky and Anne felt rather dubious as she scrambled up from the vantage point of a keg placed on a box 
16_122828_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 I m afraid it won t bear my weight she said as she gingerly stepped on the roof 
16_122828_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Lean on the window sill advised Diana and Anne accordingly leaned Much to her delight she saw as she peered through the pane a willow ware platter exactly such as she was in quest of on the shelf in front of the window 
16_122828_000033_000001	train-clean-360	So much she saw before the catastrophe came 
16_122828_000033_000002	train-clean-360	In her joy Anne forgot the precarious nature of her footing incautiously ceased to lean on the window sill gave an impulsive little hop of pleasure and the next moment she had crashed through the roof up to her armpits and there she hung quite unable to extricate herself Diana dashed into the duck house and seizing her unfortunate friend by the waist tried to draw her down 
none	none	Ow don t shrieked poor Anne There are some long splinters sticking into me 
16_122828_000034_000002	train-clean-360	See if you can put something under my feet then perhaps I can draw myself up 
16_122828_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Diana hastily dragged in the previously mentioned keg and Anne found that it was just sufficiently high to furnish a secure resting place for her feet 
16_122828_000035_000001	train-clean-360	But she could not release herself 
16_122828_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Could I pull you out if I crawled up suggested Diana 
none	none	Anne shook her head hopelessly
16_122828_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 No the splinters hurt too badly 
16_122828_000038_000001	train-clean-360	If you can find an axe you might chop me out though 
none	none	Oh dear I do really begin to believe that I was born under an ill omened star 
16_122828_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Diana searched faithfully but no axe was to be found 
16_122828_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll have to go for help she said returning to the prisoner 
16_122828_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 No indeed you won t said Anne vehemently 
16_122828_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 If you do the story of this will get out everywhere and I shall be ashamed to show my face No we must just wait until the Copp girls come home and bind them to secrecy 
16_122828_000041_000002	train-clean-360	They ll know where the axe is and get me out 
16_122828_000041_000003	train-clean-360	I m not uncomfortable as long as I keep perfectly still not uncomfortable in BODY I mean 
16_122828_000041_000004	train-clean-360	I wonder what the Copp girls value this house at 
16_122828_000041_000005	train-clean-360	I shall have to pay for the damage I ve done but I wouldn t mind that if I were only sure they would understand my motive in peeping in at their pantry window 
none	none	My sole comfort is that the platter is just the kind I want and if Miss Copp will only sell it to me I shall be resigned to what has happened What if the Copp girls don t come home until after night or till tomorrow suggested Diana
16_122828_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 If they re not back by sunset you ll have to go for other assistance I suppose said Anne reluctantly but you mustn t go until you really have to 
none	none	Oh dear this is a dreadful predicament 
16_122828_000043_000002	train-clean-360	I wouldn t mind my misfortunes so much if they were romantic as missus Morgan s heroines always are but they are always just simply ridiculous 
16_122828_000043_000003	train-clean-360	Fancy what the Copp girls will think when they drive into their yard and see a girl s head and shoulders sticking out of the roof of one of their outhouses Listen is that a wagon 
16_122828_000043_000004	train-clean-360	No Diana I believe it is thunder 
16_122828_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Thunder it was undoubtedly and Diana having made a hasty pilgrimage around the house returned to announce that a very black cloud was rising rapidly in the northwest 
16_122828_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 I believe we re going to have a heavy thunder shower she exclaimed in dismay Oh Anne what will we do 
16_122828_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 We must prepare for it said Anne tranquilly 
16_122828_000046_000001	train-clean-360	A thunderstorm seemed a trifle in comparison with what had already happened 
16_122828_000046_000002	train-clean-360	 You d better drive the horse and buggy into that open shed 
16_122828_000046_000003	train-clean-360	Fortunately my parasol is in the buggy 
16_122828_000046_000004	train-clean-360	Here take my hat with you 
none	none	Marilla told me I was a goose to put on my best hat to come to the Tory Road and she was right as she always is 
16_122828_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Diana untied the pony and drove into the shed just as the first heavy drops of rain fell 
none	none	There she sat and watched the resulting downpour which was so thick and heavy that she could hardly see Anne through it holding the parasol bravely over her bare head There was not a great deal of thunder but for the best part of an hour the rain came merrily down 
16_122828_000047_000003	train-clean-360	Occasionally Anne slanted back her parasol and waved an encouraging hand to her friend But conversation at that distance was quite out of the question 
16_122828_000047_000004	train-clean-360	Finally the rain ceased the sun came out and Diana ventured across the puddles of the yard 
16_122828_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Did you get very wet she asked anxiously 
none	none	Oh no returned Anne cheerfully
16_122828_000049_000001	train-clean-360	 My head and shoulders are quite dry and my skirt is only a little damp where the rain beat through the lathes 
16_122828_000049_000002	train-clean-360	Don t pity me Diana for I haven t minded it at all 
16_122828_000049_000003	train-clean-360	I kept thinking how much good the rain will do and how glad my garden must be for it and imagining what the flowers and buds would think when the drops began to fall 
16_122828_000049_000004	train-clean-360	I imagined out a most interesting dialogue between the asters and the sweet peas and the wild canaries in the lilac bush and the guardian spirit of the garden 
16_122828_000049_000005	train-clean-360	When I go home I mean to write it down 
16_122828_000049_000006	train-clean-360	I wish I had a pencil and paper to do it now because I daresay I ll forget the best parts before I reach home 
16_122828_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Diana the faithful had a pencil and discovered a sheet of wrapping paper in the box of the buggy 
none	none	Anne folded up her dripping parasol put on her hat spread the wrapping paper on a shingle Diana handed up and wrote out her garden idyl under conditions that could hardly be considered as favorable to literature Nevertheless the result was quite pretty and Diana was enraptured when Anne read it to her
16_122828_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Anne it s sweet just sweet 
none	none	DO send it to the Canadian Woman Anne shook her head
16_122828_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh no it wouldn t be suitable at all 
none	none	There is no PLOT in it you see 
16_122828_000053_000002	train-clean-360	It s just a string of fancies 
16_122828_000053_000003	train-clean-360	I like writing such things but of course nothing of the sort would ever do for publication for editors insist on plots so Priscilla says 
16_122828_000053_000004	train-clean-360	Oh there s Miss Sarah Copp now PLEASE Diana go and explain 
16_122828_000054_000000	train-clean-360	Miss Sarah Copp was a small person garbed in shabby black with a hat chosen less for vain adornment than for qualities that would wear well She looked as amazed as might be expected on seeing the curious tableau in her yard but when she heard Diana s explanation she was all sympathy 
16_122828_000054_000001	train-clean-360	She hurriedly unlocked the back door produced the axe and with a few skillfull blows set Anne free 
16_122828_000054_000002	train-clean-360	The latter somewhat tired and stiff ducked down into the interior of her prison and thankfully emerged into liberty once more 
16_122828_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Miss Copp she said earnestly 
16_122828_000055_000001	train-clean-360	 I assure you I looked into your pantry window only to discover if you had a willow ware platter 
16_122828_000055_000002	train-clean-360	I didn t see anything else I didn t LOOK for anything else 
16_122828_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Bless you that s all right said Miss Sarah amiably 
16_122828_000056_000001	train-clean-360	 You needn t worry there s no harm done 
16_122828_000056_000002	train-clean-360	Thank goodness we Copps keep our pantries presentable at all times and don t care who sees into them 
16_122828_000056_000003	train-clean-360	As for that old duckhouse I m glad it s smashed for maybe now Martha will agree to having it taken down 
16_122828_000056_000004	train-clean-360	She never would before for fear it might come in handy sometime and I ve had to whitewash it every spring 
16_122828_000056_000005	train-clean-360	But you might as well argue with a post as with Martha 
16_122828_000056_000006	train-clean-360	She went to town today I drove her to the station 
16_122828_000056_000007	train-clean-360	And you want to buy my platter 
none	none	Well what will you give for it
16_122828_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Twenty dollars said Anne who was never meant to match business wits with a Copp or she would not have offered her price at the start 
16_122828_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I ll see said Miss Sarah cautiously 
none	none	That platter is mine fortunately or I d never dare to sell it when Martha wasn t here As it is I daresay she ll raise a fuss 
16_122828_000058_000003	train-clean-360	Martha s the boss of this establishment I can tell you 
16_122828_000058_000004	train-clean-360	I m getting awful tired of living under another woman s thumb 
16_122828_000058_000005	train-clean-360	But come in come in 
16_122828_000058_000006	train-clean-360	You must be real tired and hungry 
none	none	I ll do the best I can for you in the way of tea but I warn you not to expect anything but bread and butter and some cowcumbers 
16_122828_000058_000008	train-clean-360	Martha locked up all the cake and cheese and preserves afore she went 
16_122828_000058_000009	train-clean-360	She always does because she says I m too extravagant with them if company comes 
none	none	The girls were hungry enough to do justice to any fare and they enjoyed Miss Sarah s excellent bread and butter and cowcumbers thoroughly When the meal was over Miss Sarah said I don t know as I mind selling the platter 
16_122828_000060_000001	train-clean-360	But it s worth twenty five dollars 
16_122828_000060_000002	train-clean-360	It s a very old platter 
none	none	Diana gave Anne s foot a gentle kick under the table meaning Don t agree she ll let it go for twenty if you hold out But Anne was not minded to take any chances in regard to that precious platter 
16_122828_000061_000001	train-clean-360	She promptly agreed to give twenty five and Miss Sarah looked as if she felt sorry she hadn t asked for thirty 
16_122828_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I guess you may have it 
16_122828_000062_000001	train-clean-360	I want all the money I can scare up just now 
16_122828_000062_000002	train-clean-360	The fact is Miss Sarah threw up her head importantly with a proud flush on her thin cheeks I m going to be married to Luther Wallace 
16_122828_000062_000003	train-clean-360	He wanted me twenty years ago 
none	none	I liked him real well but he was poor then and father packed him off I s pose I shouldn t have let him go so meek but I was timid and frightened of father 
16_122828_000062_000006	train-clean-360	Besides I didn t know men were so skurse 
16_122828_000063_000000	train-clean-360	When the girls were safely away Diana driving and Anne holding the coveted platter carefully on her lap the green rain freshened solitudes of the Tory Road were enlivened by ripples of girlish laughter 
none	none	I ll amuse your Aunt Josephine with the strange eventful history of this afternoon when I go to town tomorrow 
16_122828_000064_000001	train-clean-360	We ve had a rather trying time but it s over now 
16_122828_000064_000002	train-clean-360	I ve got the platter and that rain has laid the dust beautifully 
16_122828_000064_000003	train-clean-360	So all s well that ends well 
16_122828_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 We re not home yet said Diana rather pessimistically and there s no telling what may happen before we are 
none	none	You re such a girl to have adventures Anne Having adventures comes natural to some people said Anne serenely You just have a gift for them or you haven t XIX Just a Happy Day After all Anne had said to Marilla once I believe the nicest and sweetest days are not those on which anything very splendid or wonderful or exciting happens but just those that bring simple little pleasures following one another softly like pearls slipping off a string Life at Green Gables was full of just such days for Anne s adventures and misadventures like those of other people did not all happen at once but were sprinkled over the year with long stretches of harmless happy days between filled with work and dreams and laughter and lessons Such a day came late in August In the forenoon Anne and Diana rowed the delighted twins down the pond to the sandshore to pick sweet grass and paddle in the surf over which the wind was harping an old lyric learned when the world was young In the afternoon Anne walked down to the old Irving place to see Paul She found him stretched out on the grassy bank beside the thick fir grove that sheltered the house on the north absorbed in a book of fairy tales He sprang up radiantly at sight of her Oh I m so glad you ve come teacher he said eagerly because Grandma s away You ll stay and have tea with me won t you It s so lonesome to have tea all by oneself YOU know teacher I ve had serious thoughts of asking Young Mary Joe to sit down and eat her tea with me but I expect Grandma wouldn t approve She says the French have to be kept in their place And anyhow it s difficult to talk with Young Mary Joe She just laughs and says Well yous do beat all de kids I ever knowed That isn t my idea of conversation Of course I ll stay to tea said Anne gaily I was dying to be asked My mouth has been watering for some more of your grandma s delicious shortbread ever since I had tea here before Paul looked very sober If it depended on me teacher he said standing before Anne with his hands in his pockets and his beautiful little face shadowed with sudden care You should have shortbread with a right good will But it depends on Mary Joe I heard Grandma tell her before she left that she wasn t to give me any shortcake because it was too rich for little boys stomachs But maybe Mary Joe will cut some for you if I promise I won t eat any Let us hope for the best Yes let us agreed Anne whom this cheerful philosophy suited exactly and if Mary Joe proves hard hearted and won t give me any shortbread it doesn t matter in the least so you are not to worry over that You re sure you won t mind if she doesn t said Paul anxiously Perfectly sure dear heart Then I won t worry said Paul with a long breath of relief especially as I really think Mary Joe will listen to reason She s not a naturally unreasonable person but she has learned by experience that it doesn t do to disobey Grandma s orders Grandma is an excellent woman but people must do as she tells them She was very much pleased with me this morning because I managed at last to eat all my plateful of porridge It was a great effort but I succeeded Grandma says she thinks she ll make a man of me yet But teacher I want to ask you a very important question You will answer it truthfully won t you I ll try promised Anne Do you think I m wrong in my upper story asked Paul as if his very existence depended on her reply Goodness no Paul exclaimed Anne in amazement Certainly you re not What put such an idea into your head Mary Joe but she didn t know I heard her missus Peter Sloane s hired girl Veronica came to see Mary Joe last evening and I heard them talking in the kitchen as I was going through the hall I heard Mary Joe say Dat Paul he is de queeres leetle boy He talks dat queer I tink dere s someting wrong in his upper story I couldn t sleep last night for ever so long thinking of it and wondering if Mary Joe was right I couldn t bear to ask Grandma about it somehow but I made up my mind I d ask you I m so glad you think I m all right in my upper story Of course you are Mary Joe is a silly ignorant girl and you are never to worry about anything she says said Anne indignantly secretly resolving to give missus Irving a discreet hint as to the advisability of restraining Mary Joe s tongue Well that s a weight off my mind said Paul I m perfectly happy now teacher thanks to you It wouldn t be nice to have something wrong in your upper story would it teacher I suppose the reason Mary Joe imagines I have is because I tell her what I think about things sometimes It is a rather dangerous practice admitted Anne out of the depths of her own experience Well by and by I ll tell you the thoughts I told Mary Joe and you can see for yourself if there s anything queer in them said Paul but I ll wait till it begins to get dark That is the time I ache to tell people things and when nobody else is handy I just HAVE to tell Mary Joe But after this I won t if it makes her imagine I m wrong in my upper story I ll just ache and bear it And if the ache gets too bad you can come up to Green Gables and tell me your thoughts suggested Anne with all the gravity that endeared her to children who so dearly love to be taken seriously Yes I will But I hope Davy won t be there when I go because he makes faces at me I don t mind VERY much because he is such a little boy and I am quite a big one but still it is not pleasant to have faces made at you And Davy makes such terrible ones Sometimes I am frightened he will never get his face straightened out again He makes them at me in church when I ought to be thinking of sacred things Dora likes me though and I like her but not so well as I did before she told Minnie May Barry that she meant to marry me when I grew up I may marry somebody when I grow up but I m far too young to be thinking of it yet don t you think teacher Rather young agreed teacher Speaking of marrying reminds me of another thing that has been troubling me of late continued Paul missus Lynde was down here one day last week having tea with Grandma and Grandma made me show her my little mother s picture the one father sent me for my birthday present I didn t exactly want to show it to missus Lynde missus Lynde is a good kind woman but she isn t the sort of person you want to show your mother s picture to YOU know teacher But of course I obeyed Grandma missus Lynde said she was very pretty but kind of actressy looking and must have been an awful lot younger than father Then she said Some of these days your pa will be marrying again likely How will you like to have a new ma Master Paul Well the idea almost took my breath away teacher but I wasn t going to let missus Lynde see THAT I just looked her straight in the face like this and I said missus Lynde father made a pretty good job of picking out my first mother and I could trust him to pick out just as good a one the second time And I CAN trust him teacher But still I hope if he ever does give me a new mother he ll ask my opinion about her before it s too late There s Mary Joe coming to call us to tea I ll go and consult with her about the shortbread As a result of the consultation Mary Joe cut the shortbread and added a dish of preserves to the bill of fare Anne poured the tea and she and Paul had a very merry meal in the dim old sitting room whose windows were open to the gulf breezes and they talked so much nonsense that Mary Joe was quite scandalized and told Veronica the next evening that de school mees was as queer as Paul After tea Paul took Anne up to his room to show her his mother s picture which had been the mysterious birthday present kept by missus Irving in the bookcase Paul s little low ceilinged room was a soft whirl of ruddy light from the sun that was setting over the sea and swinging shadows from the fir trees that grew close to the square deep set window From out this soft glow and glamor shone a sweet girlish face with tender mother eyes that was hanging on the wall at the foot of the bed That s my little mother said Paul with loving pride I got Grandma to hang it there where I d see it as soon as I opened my eyes in the morning I never mind not having the light when I go to bed now because it just seems as if my little mother was right here with me Father knew just what I would like for a birthday present although he never asked me Isn t it wonderful how much fathers DO know Your mother was very lovely Paul and you look a little like her But her eyes and hair are darker than yours My eyes are the same color as father s said Paul flying about the room to heap all available cushions on the window seat but father s hair is gray He has lots of it but it is gray You see father is nearly fifty That s ripe old age isn t it But it s only OUTSIDE he s old INSIDE he s just as young as anybody Now teacher please sit here and I ll sit at your feet May I lay my head against your knee That s the way my little mother and I used to sit Oh this is real splendid I think Now I want to hear those thoughts which Mary Joe pronounces so queer said Anne patting the mop of curls at her side Paul never needed any coaxing to tell his thoughts at least to congenial souls I thought them out in the fir grove one night he said dreamily Of course I didn t BELIEVE them but I THOUGHT them YOU know teacher And then I wanted to tell them to somebody and there was nobody but Mary Joe Mary Joe was in the pantry setting bread and I sat down on the bench beside her and I said Mary Joe do you know what I think I think the evening star is a lighthouse on the land where the fairies dwell And Mary Joe said Well yous are de queer one Dare ain t no such ting as fairies I was very much provoked Of course I knew there are no fairies but that needn t prevent my thinking there is You know teacher But I tried again quite patiently I said Well then Mary Joe do you know what I think I think an angel walks over the world after the sun sets a great tall white angel with silvery folded wings and sings the flowers and birds to sleep Children can hear him if they know how to listen Then Mary Joe held up her hands all over flour and said Well yous are de queer leetle boy Yous make me feel scare And she really did looked scared I went out then and whispered the rest of my thoughts to the garden There was a little birch tree in the garden and it died Grandma says the salt spray killed it but I think the dryad belonging to it was a foolish dryad who wandered away to see the world and got lost And the little tree was so lonely it died of a broken heart And when the poor foolish little dryad gets tired of the world and comes back to her tree HER heart will break said Anne Yes but if dryads are foolish they must take the consequences just as if they were real people said Paul gravely Do you know what I think about the new moon teacher I think it is a little golden boat full of dreams And when it tips on a cloud some of them spill out and fall into your sleep Exactly teacher Oh you DO know And I think the violets are little snips of the sky that fell down when the angels cut out holes for the stars to shine through And the buttercups are made out of old sunshine and I think the sweet peas will be butterflies when they go to heaven Now teacher do you see anything so very queer about those thoughts No laddie dear they are not queer at all they are strange and beautiful thoughts for a little boy to think and so people who couldn t think anything of the sort themselves if they tried for a hundred years think them queer But keep on thinking them Paul some day you are going to be a poet I believe When Anne reached home she found a very different type of boyhood waiting to be put to bed Davy was sulky and when Anne had undressed him he bounced into bed and buried his face in the pillow Davy you have forgotten to say your prayers said Anne rebukingly No I didn t forget said Davy defiantly but I ain t going to say my prayers any more I m going to give up trying to be good cause no matter how good I am you d like Paul Irving better So I might as well be bad and have the fun of it I don t like Paul Irving BETTER said Anne seriously I like you just as well only in a different way But I want you to like me the same way pouted Davy You can t like different people the same way You don t like Dora and me the same way do you Davy sat up and reflected No o o he admitted at last I like Dora because she s my sister but I like you because you re YOU And I like Paul because he is Paul and Davy because he is Davy said Anne gaily Well I kind of wish I d said my prayers then said Davy convinced by this logic But it s too much bother getting out now to say them I ll say them twice over in the morning Anne Won t that do as well No Anne was positive it would not do as well So Davy scrambled out and knelt down at her knee When he had finished his devotions he leaned back on his little bare brown heels and looked up at her Anne I m gooder than I used to be Yes indeed you are Davy said Anne who never hesitated to give credit where credit was due I KNOW I m gooder said Davy confidently and I ll tell you how I know it Today Marilla give me two pieces of bread and jam one for me and one for Dora One was a good deal bigger than the other and Marilla didn t say which was mine But I give the biggest piece to Dora That was good of me wasn t it Very good and very manly Davy Of course admitted Davy Dora wasn t very hungry and she only et half her slice and then she give the rest to me But I didn t know she was going to do that when I give it to her so I WAS good Anne In the twilight Anne sauntered down to the Dryad s Bubble and saw Gilbert Blythe coming down through the dusky Haunted Wood She had a sudden realization that Gilbert was a schoolboy no longer And how manly he looked the tall frank faced fellow with the clear straightforward eyes and the broad shoulders Anne thought Gilbert was a very handsome lad even though he didn t look at all like her ideal man She and Diana had long ago decided what kind of a man they admired and their tastes seemed exactly similar He must be very tall and distinguished looking with melancholy inscrutable eyes and a melting sympathetic voice There was nothing either melancholy or inscrutable in Gilbert s physiognomy but of course that didn t matter in friendship Gilbert stretched himself out on the ferns beside the Bubble and looked approvingly at Anne If Gilbert had been asked to describe his ideal woman the description would have answered point for point to Anne even to those seven tiny freckles whose obnoxious presence still continued to vex her soul Gilbert was as yet little more than a boy but a boy has his dreams as have others and in Gilbert s future there was always a girl with big limpid gray eyes and a face as fine and delicate as a flower He had made up his mind also that his future must be worthy of its goddess Even in quiet Avonlea there were temptations to be met and faced White Sands youth were a rather fast set and Gilbert was popular wherever he went But he meant to keep himself worthy of Anne s friendship and perhaps some distant day her love and he watched over word and thought and deed as jealously as if her clear eyes were to pass in judgment on it She held over him the unconscious influence that every girl whose ideals are high and pure wields over her friends an influence which would endure as long as she was faithful to those ideals and which she would as certainly lose if she were ever false to them In Gilbert s eyes Anne s greatest charm was the fact that she never stooped to the petty practices of so many of the Avonlea girls the small jealousies the little deceits and rivalries the palpable bids for favor Anne held herself apart from all this not consciously or of design but simply because anything of the sort was utterly foreign to her transparent impulsive nature crystal clear in its motives and aspirations But Gilbert did not attempt to put his thoughts into words for he had already too good reason to know that Anne would mercilessly and frostily nip all attempts at sentiment in the bud or laugh at him which was ten times worse You look like a real dryad under that birch tree he said teasingly I love birch trees said Anne laying her cheek against the creamy satin of the slim bole with one of the pretty caressing gestures that came so natural to her Then you ll be glad to hear that mister Major Spencer has decided to set out a row of white birches all along the road front of his farm by way of encouraging the A V I S said Gilbert He was talking to me about it today Major Spencer is the most progressive and public spirited man in Avonlea And mister William Bell is going to set out a spruce hedge along his road front and up his lane Our Society is getting on splendidly Anne It is past the experimental stage and is an accepted fact The older folks are beginning to take an interest in it and the White Sands people are talking of starting one too Even Elisha Wright has come around since that day the Americans from the hotel had the picnic at the shore They praised our roadsides so highly and said they were so much prettier than in any other part of the Island And when in due time the other farmers follow mister Spencer s good example and plant ornamental trees and hedges along their road fronts Avonlea will be the prettiest settlement in the province The Aids are talking of taking up the graveyard said Anne and I hope they will because there will have to be a subscription for that and it would be no use for the Society to try it after the hall affair But the Aids would never have stirred in the matter if the Society hadn t put it into their thoughts unofficially Those trees we planted on the church grounds are flourishing and the trustees have promised me that they will fence in the school grounds next year If they do I ll have an arbor day and every scholar shall plant a tree and we ll have a garden in the corner by the road We ve succeeded in almost all our plans so far except in getting the old Boulter house removed said Gilbert and I ve given THAT up in despair Levi won t have it taken down just to vex us There s a contrary streak in all the Boulters and it s strongly developed in him Julia Bell wants to send another committee to him but I think the better way will just be to leave him severely alone said Anne sagely And trust to Providence as missus Lynde says smiled Gilbert Certainly no more committees They only aggravate him Julia Bell thinks you can do anything if you only have a committee to attempt it Next spring Anne we must start an agitation for nice lawns and grounds We ll sow good seed betimes this winter I ve a treatise here on lawns and lawnmaking and I m going to prepare a paper on the subject soon Well I suppose our vacation is almost over School opens Monday Has Ruby Gillis got the Carmody school Yes Priscilla wrote that she had taken her own home school so the Carmody trustees gave it to Ruby I m sorry Priscilla is not coming back but since she can t I m glad Ruby has got the school She will be home for Saturdays and it will seem like old times to have her and Jane and Diana and myself all together again Marilla just home from missus Lynde s was sitting on the back porch step when Anne returned to the house Rachel and I have decided to have our cruise to town tomorrow she said mister Lynde is feeling better this week and Rachel wants to go before he has another sick spell I intend to get up extra early tomorrow morning for I ve ever so much to do said Anne virtuously For one thing I m going to shift the feathers from my old bedtick to the new one I ought to have done it long ago but I ve just kept putting it off it s such a detestable task It s a very bad habit to put off disagreeable things and I never mean to again or else I can t comfortably tell my pupils not to do it That would be inconsistent Then I want to make a cake for mister Harrison and finish my paper on gardens for the A V I S and write Stella and wash and starch my muslin dress and make Dora s new apron You won t get half done said Marilla pessimistically I never yet planned to do a lot of things but something happened to prevent me XX The Way It Often Happens Anne rose betimes the next morning and blithely greeted the fresh day when the banners of the sunrise were shaken triumphantly across the pearly skies Green Gables lay in a pool of sunshine flecked with the dancing shadows of poplar and willow Beyond the land was mister Harrison s wheatfield a great windrippled expanse of pale gold The world was so beautiful that Anne spent ten blissful minutes hanging idly over the garden gate drinking the loveliness in After breakfast Marilla made ready for her journey Dora was to go with her having been long promised this treat Now Davy you try to be a good boy and don t bother Anne she straitly charged him If you are good I ll bring you a striped candy cane from town For alas Marilla had stooped to the evil habit of bribing people to be good I won t be bad on purpose but s posen I m bad zacksidentally Davy wanted to know You ll have to guard against accidents admonished Marilla Anne if mister Shearer comes today get a nice roast and some steak If he doesn t you ll have to kill a fowl for dinner tomorrow Anne nodded I m not going to bother cooking any dinner for just Davy and myself today she said That cold ham bone will do for noon lunch and I ll have some steak fried for you when you come home at night I m going to help mister Harrison haul dulse this morning announced Davy He asked me to and I guess he ll ask me to dinner too mister Harrison is an awful kind man He s a real sociable man I hope I ll be like him when I grow up I mean BEHAVE like him I don t want to LOOK like him But I guess there s no danger for missus Lynde says I m a very handsome child Do you s pose it ll last Anne I want to know I daresay it will said Anne gravely You ARE a handsome boy Davy Marilla looked volumes of disapproval but you must live up to it and be just as nice and gentlemanly as you look to be And you told Minnie May Barry the other day when you found her crying cause some one said she was ugly that if she was nice and kind and loving people wouldn t mind her looks said Davy discontentedly Seems to me you can t get out of being good in this world for some reason or nother You just HAVE to behave Don t you want to be good asked Marilla who had learned a great deal but had not yet learned the futility of asking such questions Yes I want to be good but not TOO good said Davy cautiously You don t have to be very good to be a Sunday School superintendent mister Bell s that and he s a real bad man Indeed he s not said Marila indignantly He is he says he is himself asseverated Davy He said it when he prayed in Sunday School last Sunday He said he was a vile worm and a miserable sinner and guilty of the blackest niquity What did he do that was so bad Marilla Did he kill anybody Or steal the collection cents I want to know Fortunately missus Lynde came driving up the lane at this moment and Marilla made off feeling that she had escaped from the snare of the fowler and wishing devoutly that mister Bell were not quite so highly figurative in his public petitions especially in the hearing of small boys who were always wanting to know Anne left alone in her glory worked with a will The floor was swept the beds made the hens fed the muslin dress washed and hung out on the line Then Anne prepared for the transfer of feathers She mounted to the garret and donned the first old dress that came to hand a navy blue cashmere she had worn at fourteen It was decidedly on the short side and as skimpy as the notable wincey Anne had worn upon the occasion of her debut at Green Gables but at least it would not be materially injured by down and feathers Anne completed her toilet by tying a big red and white spotted handkerchief that had belonged to Matthew over her head and thus accoutred betook herself to the kitchen chamber whither Marilla before her departure had helped her carry the feather bed A cracked mirror hung by the chamber window and in an unlucky moment Anne looked into it There were those seven freckles on her nose more rampant than ever or so it seemed in the glare of light from the unshaded window Oh I forgot to rub that lotion on last night she thought I d better run down to the pantry and do it now Anne had already suffered many things trying to remove those freckles On one occasion the entire skin had peeled off her nose but the freckles remained A few days previously she had found a recipe for a freckle lotion in a magazine and as the ingredients were within her reach she straightway compounded it much to the disgust of Marilla who thought that if Providence had placed freckles on your nose it was your bounden duty to leave them there Anne scurried down to the pantry which always dim from the big willow growing close to the window was now almost dark by reason of the shade drawn to exclude flies Anne caught the bottle containing the lotion from the shelf and copiously anointed her nose therewith by means of a little sponge sacred to the purpose This important duty done she returned to her work Any one who has ever shifted feathers from one tick to another will not need to be told that when Anne finished she was a sight to behold Her dress was white with down and fluff and her front hair escaping from under the handkerchief was adorned with a veritable halo of feathers At this auspicious moment a knock sounded at the kitchen door That must be mister Shearer thought Anne I m in a dreadful mess but I ll have to run down as I am for he s always in a hurry Down flew Anne to the kitchen door If ever a charitable floor did open to swallow up a miserable befeathered damsel the Green Gables porch floor should promptly have engulfed Anne at that moment On the doorstep were standing Priscilla Grant golden and fair in silk attire a short stout gray haired lady in a tweed suit and another lady tall stately wonderfully gowned with a beautiful highbred face and large black lashed violet eyes whom Anne instinctively felt as she would have said in her earlier days to be missus Charlotte E Morgan In the dismay of the moment one thought stood out from the confusion of Anne s mind and she grasped at it as at the proverbial straw All missus Morgan s heroines were noted for rising to the occasion No matter what their troubles were they invariably rose to the occasion and showed their superiority over all ills of time space and quantity Anne therefore felt it was HER duty to rise to the occasion and she did it so perfectly that Priscilla afterward declared she never admired Anne Shirley more than at that moment No matter what her outraged feelings were she did not show them She greeted Priscilla and was introduced to her companions as calmly and composedly as if she had been arrayed in purple and fine linen To be sure it was somewhat of a shock to find that the lady she had instinctively felt to be missus Morgan was not missus Morgan at all but an unknown missus Pendexter while the stout little gray haired woman was missus Morgan but in the greater shock the lesser lost its power Anne ushered her guests to the spare room and thence into the parlor where she left them while she hastened out to help Priscilla unharness her horse It s dreadful to come upon you so unexpectedly as this apologized Priscilla but I did not know till last night that we were coming Aunt Charlotte is going away Monday and she had promised to spend today with a friend in town But last night her friend telephoned to her not to come because they were quarantined for scarlet fever So I suggested we come here instead for I knew you were longing to see her We called at the White Sands Hotel and brought missus Pendexter with us She is a friend of aunt s and lives in New York and her husband is a millionaire We can t stay very long for missus Pendexter has to be back at the hotel by five o clock Several times while they were putting away the horse Anne caught Priscilla looking at her in a furtive puzzled way She needn t stare at me so Anne thought a little resentfully If she doesn t KNOW what it is to change a feather bed she might IMAGINE it When Priscilla had gone to the parlor and before Anne could escape upstairs Diana walked into the kitchen Anne caught her astonished friend by the arm Diana Barry who do you suppose is in that parlor at this very moment missus Charlotte E Morgan and a New York millionaire s wife and here I am like THIS and NOT A THING IN THE HOUSE FOR DINNER BUT A COLD HAM BONE Diana By this time Anne had become aware that Diana was staring at her in precisely the same bewildered fashion as Priscilla had done It was really too much Oh Diana don t look at me so she implored YOU at least must know that the neatest person in the world couldn t empty feathers from one tick into another and remain neat in the process It it isn t the feathers hesitated Diana It s it s your nose Anne My nose Oh Diana surely nothing has gone wrong with it Anne rushed to the little looking glass over the sink One glance revealed the fatal truth Her nose was a brilliant scarlet Anne sat down on the sofa her dauntless spirit subdued at last What is the matter with it asked Diana curiosity overcoming delicacy I thought I was rubbing my freckle lotion on it but I must have used that red dye Marilla has for marking the pattern on her rugs was the despairing response What shall I do Wash it off said Diana practically Perhaps it won t wash off First I dye my hair then I dye my nose Marilla cut my hair off when I dyed it but that remedy would hardly be practicable in this case Well this is another punishment for vanity and I suppose I deserve it though there s not much comfort in THAT It is really almost enough to make one believe in ill luck though missus Lynde says there is no such thing because everything is foreordained Fortunately the dye washed off easily and Anne somewhat consoled betook herself to the east gable while Diana ran home Presently Anne came down again clothed and in her right mind The muslin dress she had fondly hoped to wear was bobbing merrily about on the line outside so she was forced to content herself with her black lawn She had the fire on and the tea steeping when Diana returned the latter wore HER muslin at least and carried a covered platter in her hand Mother sent you this she said lifting the cover and displaying a nicely carved and jointed chicken to Anne s greatful eyes The chicken was supplemented by light new bread excellent butter and cheese Marilla s fruit cake and a dish of preserved plums floating in their golden syrup as in congealed summer sunshine There was a big bowlful of pink and white asters also by way of decoration yet the spread seemed very meager beside the elaborate one formerly prepared for missus Morgan Anne s hungry guests however did not seem to think anything was lacking and they ate the simple viands with apparent enjoyment But after the first few moments Anne thought no more of what was or was not on her bill of fare missus Morgan s appearance might be somewhat disappointing as even her loyal worshippers had been forced to admit to each other but she proved to be a delightful conversationalist She had traveled extensively and was an excellent storyteller She had seen much of men and women and crystalized her experiences into witty little sentences and epigrams which made her hearers feel as if they were listening to one of the people in clever books But under all her sparkle there was a strongly felt undercurrent of true womanly sympathy and kindheartedness which won affection as easily as her brilliancy won admiration Nor did she monopolize the conversation She could draw others out as skillfully and fully as she could talk herself and Anne and Diana found themselves chattering freely to her missus Pendexter said little she merely smiled with her lovely eyes and lips and ate chicken and fruit cake and preserves with such exquisite grace that she conveyed the impression of dining on ambrosia and honeydew But then as Anne said to Diana later on anybody so divinely beautiful as missus Pendexter didn t need to talk it was enough for her just to LOOK After dinner they all had a walk through Lover s Lane and Violet Vale and the Birch Path then back through the Haunted Wood to the Dryad s Bubble where they sat down and talked for a delightful last half hour missus Morgan wanted to know how the Haunted Wood came by its name and laughed until she cried when she heard the story and Anne s dramatic account of a certain memorable walk through it at the witching hour of twilight It has indeed been a feast of reason and flow of soul hasn t it said Anne when her guests had gone and she and Diana were alone again I don t know which I enjoyed more listening to missus Morgan or gazing at missus Pendexter I believe we had a nicer time than if we d known they were coming and been cumbered with much serving You must stay to tea with me Diana and we ll talk it all over Priscilla says missus Pendexter s husband s sister is married to an English earl and yet she took a second helping of the plum preserves said Diana as if the two facts were somehow incompatible I daresay even the English earl himself wouldn t have turned up his aristocratic nose at Marilla s plum preserves said Anne proudly Anne did not mention the misfortune which had befallen HER nose when she related the day s history to Marilla that evening But she took the bottle of freckle lotion and emptied it out of the window I shall never try any beautifying messes again she said darkly resolute They may do for careful deliberate people but for anyone so hopelessly given over to making mistakes as I seem to be it s tempting fate to meddle with them XXI Sweet Miss Lavendar School opened and Anne returned to her work with fewer theories but considerably more experience She had several new pupils six and seven year olds just venturing round eyed into a world of wonder Among them were Davy and Dora Davy sat with Milty Boulter who had been going to school for a year and was therefore quite a man of the world Dora had made a compact at Sunday School the previous Sunday to sit with Lily Sloane but Lily Sloane not coming the first day she was temporarily assigned to Mirabel Cotton who was ten years old and therefore in Dora s eyes one of the big girls I think school is great fun Davy told Marilla when he got home that night You said I d find it hard to sit still and I did you mostly do tell the truth I notice but you can wriggle your legs about under the desk and that helps a lot It s splendid to have so many boys to play with I sit with Milty Boulter and he s fine He s longer than me but I m wider It s nicer to sit in the back seats but you can t sit there till your legs grow long enough to touch the floor Milty drawed a picture of Anne on his slate and it was awful ugly and I told him if he made pictures of Anne like that I d lick him at recess I thought first I d draw one of him and put horns and a tail on it but I was afraid it would hurt his feelings and Anne says you should never hurt anyone s feelings It seems it s dreadful to have your feelings hurt It s better to knock a boy down than hurt his feelings if you MUST do something Milty said he wasn t scared of me but he d just as soon call it somebody else to blige me so he rubbed out Anne s name and printed Barbara Shaw s under it Milty doesn t like Barbara cause she calls him a sweet little boy and once she patted him on his head Dora said primly that she liked school but she was very quiet even for her and when at twilight Marilla bade her go upstairs to bed she hesitated and began to cry I m I m frightened she sobbed I I don t want to go upstairs alone in the dark What notion have you got into your head now demanded Marilla I m sure you ve gone to bed alone all summer and never been frightened before Dora still continued to cry so Anne picked her up cuddled her sympathetically and whispered Tell Anne all about it sweetheart What are you frightened of Of of Mirabel Cotton s uncle sobbed Dora Mirabel Cotton told me all about her family today in school Nearly everybody in her family has died all her grandfathers and grandmothers and ever so many uncles and aunts They have a habit of dying Mirabel says Mirabel s awful proud of having so many dead relations and she told me what they all died of and what they said and how they looked in their coffins And Mirabel says one of her uncles was seen walking around the house after he was buried Her mother saw him I don t mind the rest so much but I can t help thinking about that uncle Anne went upstairs with Dora and sat by her until she fell asleep The next day Mirabel Cotton was kept in at recess and gently but firmly given to understand that when you were so unfortunate as to possess an uncle who persisted in walking about houses after he had been decently interred it was not in good taste to talk about that eccentric gentleman to your deskmate of tender years Mirabel thought this very harsh The Cottons had not much to boast of How was she to keep up her prestige among her schoolmates if she were forbidden to make capital out of the family ghost September slipped by into a gold and crimson graciousness of October One Friday evening Diana came over I d a letter from Ella Kimball today Anne and she wants us to go over to tea tomorrow afternoon to meet her cousin Irene Trent from town But we can t get one of our horses to go for they ll all be in use tomorrow and your pony is lame so I suppose we can t go Why can t we walk suggested Anne If we go straight back through the woods we ll strike the West Grafton road not far from the Kimball place I was through that way last winter and I know the road It s no more than four miles and we won t have to walk home for Oliver Kimball will be sure to drive us He ll be only too glad of the excuse for he goes to see Carrie Sloane and they say his father will hardly ever let him have a horse It was accordingly arranged that they should walk and the following afternoon they set out going by way of Lover s Lane to the back of the Cuthbert farm where they found a road leading into the heart of acres of glimmering beech and maple woods which were all in a wondrous glow of flame and gold lying in a great purple stillness and peace It s as if the year were kneeling to pray in a vast cathedral full of mellow stained light isn t it said Anne dreamily It doesn t seem right to hurry through it does it It seems irreverent like running in a church We MUST hurry though said Diana glancing at her watch We ve left ourselves little enough time as it is Well I ll walk fast but don t ask me to talk said Anne quickening her pace I just want to drink the day s loveliness in I feel as if she were holding it out to my lips like a cup of airy wine and I ll take a sip at every step Perhaps it was because she was so absorbed in drinking it in that Anne took the left turning when they came to a fork in the road She should have taken the right but ever afterward she counted it the most fortunate mistake of her life They came out finally to a lonely grassy road with nothing in sight along it but ranks of spruce saplings Why where are we exclaimed Diana in bewilderment This isn t the West Grafton road No it s the base line road in Middle Grafton said Anne rather shamefacedly I must have taken the wrong turning at the fork I don t know where we are exactly but we must be all of three miles from Kimballs still Then we can t get there by five for it s half past four now said Diana with a despairing look at her watch We ll arrive after they have had their tea and they ll have all the bother of getting ours over again We d better turn back and go home suggested Anne humbly But Diana after consideration vetoed this No we may as well go and spend the evening since we have come this far A few yards further on the girls came to a place where the road forked again Which of these do we take asked Diana dubiously Anne shook her head I don t know and we can t afford to make any more mistakes Here is a gate and a lane leading right into the wood There must be a house at the other side Let us go down and inquire What a romantic old lane this it said Diana as they walked along its twists and turns It ran under patriarchal old firs whose branches met above creating a perpetual gloom in which nothing except moss could grow On either hand were brown wood floors crossed here and there by fallen lances of sunlight All was very still and remote as if the world and the cares of the world were far away I feel as if we were walking through an enchanted forest said Anne in a hushed tone Do you suppose we ll ever find our way back to the real world again Diana We shall presently come to a palace with a spellbound princess in it I think Around the next turn they came in sight not indeed of a palace but of a little house almost as surprising as a palace would have been in this province of conventional wooden farmhouses all as much alike in general characteristics as if they had grown from the same seed Anne stopped short in rapture and Diana exclaimed Oh I know where we are now That is the little stone house where Miss Lavendar Lewis lives Echo Lodge she calls it I think I ve often heard of it but I ve never seen it before Isn t it a romantic spot It s the sweetest prettiest place I ever saw or imagined said Anne delightedly It looks like a bit out of a story book or a dream The house was a low eaved structure built of undressed blocks of red Island sandstone with a little peaked roof out of which peered two dormer windows with quaint wooden hoods over them and two great chimneys The whole house was covered with a luxuriant growth of ivy finding easy foothold on the rough stonework and turned by autumn frosts to most beautiful bronze and wine red tints Before the house was an oblong garden into which the lane gate where the girls were standing opened The house bounded it on one side on the three others it was enclosed by an old stone dyke so overgrown with moss and grass and ferns that it looked like a high green bank On the right and left the tall dark spruces spread their palm like branches over it but below it was a little meadow green with clover aftermath sloping down to the blue loop of the Grafton River No other house or clearing was in sight nothing but hills and valleys covered with feathery young firs I wonder what sort of a person Miss Lewis is speculated Diana as they opened the gate into the garden They say she is very peculiar She ll be interesting then said Anne decidedly Peculiar people are always that at least whatever else they are or are not Didn t I tell you we would come to an enchanted palace I knew the elves hadn t woven magic over that lane for nothing But Miss Lavendar Lewis is hardly a spellbound princess laughed Diana She s an old maid she s forty five and quite gray I ve heard Oh that s only part of the spell asserted Anne confidently At heart she s young and beautiful still and if we only knew how to unloose the spell she would step forth radiant and fair again But we don t know how it s always and only the prince who knows that and Miss Lavendar s prince hasn t come yet Perhaps some fatal mischance has befallen him though THAT S against the law of all fairy tales I m afraid he came long ago and went away again said Diana They say she used to be engaged to Stephan Irving Paul s father when they were young But they quarreled and parted Hush warned Anne The door is open The girls paused in the porch under the tendrils of ivy and knocked at the open door There was a patter of steps inside and a rather odd little personage presented herself a girl of about fourteen with a freckled face a snub nose a mouth so wide that it did really seem as if it stretched from ear to ear and two long braids of fair hair tied with two enormous bows of blue ribbon Is Miss Lewis at home asked Diana Yes ma am Come in ma am I ll tell Miss Lavendar you re here ma am She s upstairs ma am With this the small handmaiden whisked out of sight and the girls left alone looked about them with delighted eyes The interior of this wonderful little house was quite as interesting as its exterior The room had a low ceiling and two square small paned windows curtained with muslin frills All the furnishings were old fashioned but so well and daintily kept that the effect was delicious But it must be candidly admitted that the most attractive feature to two healthy girls who had just tramped four miles through autumn air was a table set out with pale blue china and laden with delicacies while little golden hued ferns scattered over the cloth gave it what Anne would have termed a festal air Miss Lavendar must be expecting company to tea she whispered There are six places set But what a funny little girl she has She looked like a messenger from pixy land I suppose she could have told us the road but I was curious to see Miss Lavendar S s sh she s coming And with that Miss Lavendar Lewis was standing in the doorway The girls were so surprised that they forgot good manners and simply stared They had unconsciously been expecting to see the usual type of elderly spinster as known to their experience a rather angular personage with prim gray hair and spectacles Nothing more unlike Miss Lavendar could possibly be imagined She was a little lady with snow white hair beautifully wavy and thick and carefully arranged in becoming puffs and coils Beneath it was an almost girlish face pink cheeked and sweet lipped with big soft brown eyes and dimples actually dimples She wore a very dainty gown of cream muslin with pale hued roses on it a gown which would have seemed ridiculously juvenile on most women of her age but which suited Miss Lavendar so perfectly that you never thought about it at all Charlotta the Fourth says that you wished to see me she said in a voice that matched her appearance We wanted to ask the right road to West Grafton said Diana We are invited to tea at mister Kimball s but we took the wrong path coming through the woods and came out to the base line instead of the West Grafton road Do we take the right or left turning at your gate The left said Miss Lavendar with a hesitating glance at her tea table Then she exclaimed as if in a sudden little burst of resolution But oh won t you stay and have tea with me Please do mister Kimball s will have tea over before you get there And Charlotta the Fourth and I will be so glad to have you Diana looked mute inquiry at Anne We d like to stay said Anne promptly for she had made up her mind that she wanted to know more of this surprising Miss Lavendar if it won t inconvenience you But you are expecting other guests aren t you Miss Lavendar looked at her tea table again and blushed I know you ll think me dreadfully foolish she said I AM foolish and I m ashamed of it when I m found out but never unless I AM found out I m not expecting anybody I was just pretending I was You see I was so lonely I love company that is the right kind of company but so few people ever come here because it is so far out of the way Charlotta the Fourth was lonely too So I just pretended I was going to have a tea party I cooked for it and decorated the table for it and set it with my mother s wedding china and I dressed up for it Diana secretly thought Miss Lavendar quite as peculiar as report had pictured her The idea of a woman of forty five playing at having a tea party just as if she were a little girl But Anne of the shining eyes exclaimed joyfuly Oh do YOU imagine things too That too revealed a kindred spirit to Miss Lavendar Yes I do she confessed boldly Of course it s silly in anybody as old as I am But what is the use of being an independent old maid if you can t be silly when you want to and when it doesn t hurt anybody A person must have some compensations I don t believe I could live at times if I didn t pretend things I m not often caught at it though and Charlotta the Fourth never tells But I m glad to be caught today for you have really come and I have tea all ready for you Will you go up to the spare room and take off your hats It s the white door at the head of the stairs I must run out to the kitchen and see that Charlotta the Fourth isn t letting the tea boil Charlotta the Fourth is a very good girl but she WILL let the tea boil Miss Lavendar tripped off to the kitchen on hospitable thoughts intent and the girls found their way up to the spare room an apartment as white as its door lighted by the ivy hung dormer window and looking as Anne said like the place where happy dreams grew This is quite an adventure isn t it said Diana And isn t Miss Lavendar sweet if she IS a little odd She doesn t look a bit like an old maid She looks just as music sounds I think answered Anne When they went down Miss Lavendar was carrying in the teapot and behind her looking vastly pleased was Charlotta the Fourth with a plate of hot biscuits Now you must tell me your names said Miss Lavendar I m so glad you are young girls I love young girls It s so easy to pretend I m a girl myself when I m with them I do hate with a little grimace to believe I m old Now who are you just for convenience sake Diana Barry And Anne Shirley May I pretend that I ve known you for a hundred years and call you Anne and Diana right away You may the girls said both together Then just let s sit comfily down and eat everything said Miss Lavendar happily Charlotta you sit at the foot and help with the chicken It is so fortunate that I made the sponge cake and doughnuts Of course it was foolish to do it for imaginary guests I know Charlotta the Fourth thought so didn t you Charlotta But you see how well it has turned out Of course they wouldn t have been wasted for Charlotta the Fourth and I could have eaten them through time But sponge cake is not a thing that improves with time That was a merry and memorable meal and when it was over they all went out to the garden lying in the glamor of sunset I do think you have the loveliest place here said Diana looking round her admiringly Why do you call it Echo Lodge asked Anne Charlotta said Miss Lavendar go into the house and bring out the little tin horn that is hanging over the clock shelf Charlotta the Fourth skipped off and returned with the horn Blow it Charlotta commanded Miss Lavendar Charlotta accordingly blew a rather raucous strident blast There was moment s stillness and then from the woods over the river came a multitude of fairy echoes sweet elusive silvery as if all the horns of elfland were blowing against the sunset Anne and Diana exclaimed in delight Now laugh Charlotta laugh loudly Charlotta who would probably have obeyed if Miss Lavendar had told her to stand on her head climbed upon the stone bench and laughed loud and heartily Back came the echoes as if a host of pixy people were mimicking her laughter in the purple woodlands and along the fir fringed points People always admire my echoes very much said Miss Lavendar as if the echoes were her personal property I love them myself They are very good company with a little pretending On calm evenings Charlotta the Fourth and I often sit out here and amuse ourselves with them Charlotta take back the horn and hang it carefully in its place Why do you call her Charlotta the Fourth asked Diana who was bursting with curiosity on this point Just to keep her from getting mixed up with other Charlottas in my thoughts said Miss Lavendar seriously They all look so much alike there s no telling them apart Her name isn t really Charlotta at all It is let me see what is it I THINK it s Leonora yes it IS Leonora You see it is this way When mother died ten years ago I couldn t stay here alone and I couldn t afford to pay the wages of a grown up girl So I got little Charlotta Bowman to come and stay with me for board and clothes Her name really was Charlotta she was Charlotta the First She was just thirteen She stayed with me till she was sixteen and then she went away to Boston because she could do better there Her sister came to stay with me then Her name was Julietta missus Bowman had a weakness for fancy names I think but she looked so like Charlotta that I kept calling her that all the time and she didn t mind So I just gave up trying to remember her right name She was Charlotta the Second and when she went away Evelina came and she was Charlotta the Third Now I have Charlotta the Fourth but when she is sixteen she s fourteen now she will want to go to Boston too and what I shall do then I really do not know Charlotta the Fourth is the last of the Bowman girls and the best The other Charlottas always let me see that they thought it silly of me to pretend things but Charlotta the Fourth never does no matter what she may really think I don t care what people think about me if they don t let me see it Well said Diana looking regretfully at the setting sun I suppose we must go if we want to get to mister Kimball s before dark We ve had a lovely time Miss Lewis Won t you come again to see me pleaded Miss Lavendar Tall Anne put her arm about the little lady Indeed we shall she promised Now that we have discovered you we ll wear out our welcome coming to see you Yes we must go we must tear ourselves away as Paul Irving says every time he comes to Green Gables Paul Irving There was a subtle change in Miss Lavendar s voice Who is he I didn t think there was anybody of that name in Avonlea Anne felt vexed at her own heedlessness She had forgotten about Miss Lavendar s old romance when Paul s name slipped out He is a little pupil of mine she explained slowly He came from Boston last year to live with his grandmother missus Irving of the shore road Is he Stephen Irving s son Miss Lavendar asked bending over her namesake border so that her face was hidden Yes I m going to give you girls a bunch of lavendar apiece said Miss Lavendar brightly as if she had not heard the answer to her question It s very sweet don t you think Mother always loved it She planted these borders long ago Father named me Lavendar because he was so fond of it The very first time he saw mother was when he visited her home in East Grafton with her brother He fell in love with her at first sight and they put him in the spare room bed to sleep and the sheets were scented with lavendar and he lay awake all night and thought of her He always loved the scent of lavendar after that and that was why he gave me the name Don t forget to come back soon girls dear We ll be looking for you Charlotta the Fourth and I She opened the gate under the firs for them to pass through She looked suddenly old and tired the glow and radiance had faded from her face her parting smile was as sweet with ineradicable youth as ever but when the girls looked back from the first curve in the lane they saw her sitting on the old stone bench under the silver poplar in the middle of the garden with her head leaning wearily on her hand She does look lonely said Diana softly We must come often to see her I think her parents gave her the only right and fitting name that could possibly be given her said Anne If they had been so blind as to name her Elizabeth or Nellie or Muriel she must have been called Lavendar just the same I think It s so suggestive of sweetness and old fashioned graces and silk attire Now my name just smacks of bread and butter patchwork and chores Oh I don t think so said Diana Anne seems to me real stately and like a queen But I d like Kerrenhappuch if it happened to be your name I think people make their names nice or ugly just by what they are themselves I can t bear Josie or Gertie for names now but before I knew the Pye girls I thought them real pretty That s a lovely idea Diana said Anne enthusiastically Living so that you beautify your name even if it wasn t beautiful to begin with making it stand in people s thoughts for something so lovely and pleasant that they never think of it by itself Thank you Diana XXII Odds and Ends So you had tea at the stone house with Lavendar Lewis said Marilla at the breakfast table next morning What is she like now It s over fifteen years since I saw her last it was one Sunday in Grafton church I suppose she has changed a great deal Davy Keith when you want something you can t reach ask to have it passed and don t spread yourself over the table in that fashion Did you ever see Paul Irving doing that when he was here to meals But Paul s arms are longer n mine brumbled Davy They ve had eleven years to grow and mine ve only had seven Sides I DID ask but you and Anne was so busy talking you didn t pay any tention Sides Paul s never been here to any meal escept tea and it s easier to be p lite at tea than at breakfast You ain t half as hungry It s an awful long while between supper and breakfast Now Anne that spoonful ain t any bigger than it was last year and I M ever so much bigger Of course I don t know what Miss Lavendar used to look like but I don t fancy somehow that she has changed a great deal said Anne after she had helped Davy to maple syrup giving him two spoonfuls to pacify him Her hair is snow white but her face is fresh and almost girlish and she has the sweetest brown eyes such a pretty shade of wood brown with little golden glints in them and her voice makes you think of white satin and tinkling water and fairy bells all mixed up together She was reckoned a great beauty when she was a girl said Marilla I never knew her very well but I liked her as far as I did know her Some folks thought her peculiar even then DAVY if ever I catch you at such a trick again you ll be made to wait for your meals till everyone else is done like the French Most conversations between Anne and Marilla in the presence of the twins were punctuated by these rebukes Davy ward In this instance Davy sad to relate not being able to scoop up the last drops of his syrup with his spoon had solved the difficulty by lifting his plate in both hands and applying his small pink tongue to it Anne looked at him with such horrified eyes that the little sinner turned red and said half shamefacedly half defiantly There ain t any wasted that way People who are different from other people are always called peculiar said Anne And Miss Lavendar is certainly different though it s hard to say just where the difference comes in Perhaps it is because she is one of those people who never grow old One might as well grow old when all your generation do said Marilla rather reckless of her pronouns If you don t you don t fit in anywhere Far as I can learn Lavendar Lewis has just dropped out of everything She s lived in that out of the way place until everybody has forgotten her That stone house is one of the oldest on the Island Old mister Lewis built it eighty years ago when he came out from England Davy stop joggling Dora s elbow Oh I saw you You needn t try to look innocent What does make you behave so this morning Maybe I got out of the wrong side of the bed suggested Davy Milty Boulter says if you do that things are bound to go wrong with you all day His grandmother told him But which is the right side And what are you to do when your bed s against the wall I want to know I ve always wondered what went wrong between Stephen Irving and Lavendar Lewis continued Marilla ignoring Davy They were certainly engaged twenty five years ago and then all at once it was broken off I don t know what the trouble was but it must have been something terrible for he went away to the States and never come home since Perhaps it was nothing very dreadful after all I think the little things in life often make more trouble than the big things said Anne with one of those flashes of insight which experience could not have bettered Marilla please don t say anything about my being at Miss Lavendar s to missus Lynde She d be sure to ask a hundred questions and somehow I wouldn t like it nor Miss Lavendar either if she knew I feel sure I daresay Rachel would be curious admitted Marilla though she hasn t as much time as she used to have for looking after other people s affairs She s tied home now on account of Thomas and she s feeling pretty downhearted for I think she s beginning to lose hope of his ever getting better Rachel will be left pretty lonely if anything happens to him with all her children settled out west except Eliza in town and she doesn t like her husband Marilla s pronouns slandered Eliza who was very fond of her husband Rachel says if he d only brace up and exert his will power he d get better But what is the use of asking a jellyfish to sit up straight continued Marilla Thomas Lynde never had any will power to exert His mother ruled him till he married and then Rachel carried it on It s a wonder he dared to get sick without asking her permission But there I shouldn t talk so Rachel has been a good wife to him He d never have amounted to anything without her that s certain He was born to be ruled and it s well he fell into the hands of a clever capable manager like Rachel He didn t mind her way It saved him the bother of ever making up his own mind about anything Davy do stop squirming like an eel I ve nothing else to do protested Davy I can t eat any more and it s no fun watching you and Anne eat Well you and Dora go out and give the hens their wheat said Marilla And don t you try to pull any more feathers out of the white rooster s tail either I wanted some feathers for an Injun headdress said Davy sulkily Milty Boulter has a dandy one made out of the feathers his mother give him when she killed their old white gobbler You might let me have some That rooster s got ever so many more n he wants You may have the old feather duster in the garret said Anne and I ll dye them green and red and yellow for you You do spoil that boy dreadfully said Marilla when Davy with a radiant face had followed prim Dora out Marilla s education had made great strides in the past six years but she had not yet been able to rid herself of the idea that it was very bad for a child to have too many of its wishes indulged All the boys of his class have Indian headdresses and Davy wants one too said Anne I know how it feels I ll never forget how I used to long for puffed sleeves when all the other girls had them And Davy isn t being spoiled He is improving every day Think what a difference there is in him since he came here a year ago He certainly doesn t get into as much mischief since he began to go to school acknowledged Marilla I suppose he works off the tendency with the other boys But it s a wonder to me we haven t heard from Richard Keith before this Never a word since last May I ll be afraid to hear from him sighed Anne beginning to clear away the dishes If a letter should come I d dread opening it for fear it would tell us to send the twins to him A month later a letter did come But it was not from Richard Keith A friend of his wrote to say that Richard Keith had died of consumption a fortnight previously The writer of the letter was the executor of his will and by that will the sum of two thousand dollars was left to Miss Marilla Cuthbert in trust for David and Dora Keith until they came of age or married In the meantime the interest was to be used for their maintenance It seems dreadful to be glad of anything in connection with a death said Anne soberly I m sorry for poor mister Keith but I AM glad that we can keep the twins It s a very good thing about the money said Marilla practically I wanted to keep them but I really didn t see how I could afford to do it especially when they grew older The rent of the farm doesn t do any more than keep the house and I was bound that not a cent of your money should be spent on them You do far too much for them as it is Dora didn t need that new hat you bought her any more than a cat needs two tails But now the way is made clear and they are provided for Davy and Dora were delighted when they heard that they were to live at Green Gables for good The death of an uncle whom they had never seen could not weigh a moment in the balance against that But Dora had one misgiving Was Uncle Richard buried she whispered to Anne Yes dear of course He he isn t like Mirabel Cotton s uncle is he in a still more agitated whisper He won t walk about houses after being buried will he Anne XXIII Miss Lavendar s Romance I think I ll take a walk through to Echo Lodge this evening said Anne one Friday afternoon in December It looks like snow said Marilla dubiously I ll be there before the snow comes and I mean to stay all night Diana can t go because she has company and I m sure Miss Lavendar will be looking for me tonight It s a whole fortnight since I was there Anne had paid many a visit to Echo Lodge since that October day Sometimes she and Diana drove around by the road sometimes they walked through the woods When Diana could not go Anne went alone Between her and Miss Lavendar had sprung up one of those fervent helpful friendships possible only between a woman who has kept the freshness of youth in her heart and soul and a girl whose imagination and intuition supplied the place of experience Anne had at last discovered a real kindred spirit while into the little lady s lonely sequestered life of dreams Anne and Diana came with the wholesome joy and exhilaration of the outer existence which Miss Lavendar the world forgetting by the world forgot had long ceased to share they brought an atmosphere of youth and reality to the little stone house Charlotta the Fourth always greeted them with her very widest smile and Charlotta s smiles WERE fearfully wide loving them for the sake of her adored mistress as well as for their own Never had there been such high jinks held in the little stone house as were held there that beautiful late lingering autumn when November seemed October over again and even December aped the sunshine and hazes of summer But on this particular day it seemed as if December had remembered that it was time for winter and had turned suddenly dull and brooding with a windless hush predictive of coming snow Nevertheless Anne keenly enjoyed her walk through the great gray maze of the beechlands though alone she never found it lonely her imagination peopled her path with merry companions and with these she carried on a gay pretended conversation that was wittier and more fascinating than conversations are apt to be in real life where people sometimes fail most lamentably to talk up to the requirements In a make believe assembly of choice spirits everybody says just the thing you want her to say and so gives you the chance to say just what YOU want to say Attended by this invisible company Anne traversed the woods and arrived at the fir lane just as broad feathery flakes began to flutter down softly At the first bend she came upon Miss Lavendar standing under a big broad branching fir She wore a gown of warm rich red and her head and shoulders were wrapped in a silvery gray silk shawl You look like the queen of the fir wood fairies called Anne merrily I thought you would come tonight Anne said Miss Lavendar running forward And I m doubly glad for Charlotta the Fourth is away Her mother is sick and she had to go home for the night I should have been very lonely if you hadn t come even the dreams and the echoes wouldn t have been enough company Oh Anne how pretty you are she added suddenly looking up at the tall slim girl with the soft rose flush of walking on her face How pretty and how young It s so delightful to be seventeen isn t it I do envy you concluded Miss Lavendar candidly But you are only seventeen at heart smiled Anne No I m old or rather middle aged which is far worse sighed Miss Lavendar Sometimes I can pretend I m not but at other times I realize it And I can t reconcile myself to it as most women seem to I m just as rebellious as I was when I discovered my first gray hair Now Anne don t look as if you were trying to understand Seventeen CAN T understand I m going to pretend right away that I am seventeen too and I can do it now that you re here You always bring youth in your hand like a gift We re going to have a jolly evening Tea first what do you want for tea We ll have whatever you like Do think of something nice and indigestible There were sounds of riot and mirth in the little stone house that night What with cooking and feasting and making candy and laughing and pretending it is quite true that Miss Lavendar and Anne comported themselves in a fashion entirely unsuited to the dignity of a spinster of forty five and a sedate schoolma am Then when they were tired they sat down on the rug before the grate in the parlor lighted only by the soft fireshine and perfumed deliciously by Miss Lavendar s open rose jar on the mantel The wind had risen and was sighing and wailing around the eaves and the snow was thudding softly against the windows as if a hundred storm sprites were tapping for entrance I m so glad you re here Anne said Miss Lavendar nibbling at her candy If you weren t I should be blue very blue almost navy blue Dreams and make believes are all very well in the daytime and the sunshine but when dark and storm come they fail to satisfy One wants real things then But you don t know this seventeen never knows it At seventeen dreams DO satisfy because you think the realities are waiting for you further on When I was seventeen Anne I didn t think forty five would find me a white haired little old maid with nothing but dreams to fill my life But you aren t an old maid said Anne smiling into Miss Lavendar s wistful woodbrown eyes Old maids are BORN they don t BECOME Some are born old maids some achieve old maidenhood and some have old maidenhood thrust upon them parodied Miss Lavendar whimsically You are one of those who have achieved it then laughed Anne and you ve done it so beautifully that if every old maid were like you they would come into the fashion I think I always like to do things as well as possible said Miss Lavendar meditatively and since an old maid I had to be I was determined to be a very nice one People say I m odd but it s just because I follow my own way of being an old maid and refuse to copy the traditional pattern Anne did anyone ever tell you anything about Stephen Irving and me Yes said Anne candidly I ve heard that you and he were engaged once So we were twenty five years ago a lifetime ago And we were to have been married the next spring I had my wedding dress made although nobody but mother and Stephen ever knew THAT We d been engaged in a way almost all our lives you might say When Stephen was a little boy his mother would bring him here when she came to see my mother and the second time he ever came he was nine and I was six he told me out in the garden that he had pretty well made up his mind to marry me when he grew up I remember that I said Thank you and when he was gone I told mother very gravely that there was a great weight off my mind because I wasn t frightened any more about having to be an old maid How poor mother laughed And what went wrong asked Anne breathlessly We had just a stupid silly commonplace quarrel So commonplace that if you ll believe me I don t even remember just how it began I hardly know who was the more to blame for it Stephen did really begin it but I suppose I provoked him by some foolishness of mine He had a rival or two you see I was vain and coquettish and liked to tease him a little He was a very high strung sensitive fellow Well we parted in a temper on both sides But I thought it would all come right and it would have if Stephen hadn t come back too soon Anne my dear I m sorry to say Miss Lavendar dropped her voice as if she were about to confess a predilection for murdering people that I am a dreadfully sulky person Oh you needn t smile it s only too true I DO sulk and Stephen came back before I had finished sulking I wouldn t listen to him and I wouldn t forgive him and so he went away for good He was too proud to come again And then I sulked because he didn t come I might have sent for him perhaps but I couldn t humble myself to do that I was just as proud as he was pride and sulkiness make a very bad combination Anne But I could never care for anybody else and I didn t want to I knew I would rather be an old maid for a thousand years than marry anybody who wasn t Stephen Irving Well it all seems like a dream now of course How sympathetic you look Anne as sympathetic as only seventeen can look But don t overdo it I m really a very happy contented little person in spite of my broken heart My heart did break if ever a heart did when I realized that Stephen Irving was not coming back But Anne a broken heart in real life isn t half as dreadful as it is in books It s a good deal like a bad tooth though you won t think THAT a very romantic simile It takes spells of aching and gives you a sleepless night now and then but between times it lets you enjoy life and dreams and echoes and peanut candy as if there were nothing the matter with it And now you re looking disappointed You don t think I m half as interesting a person as you did five minutes ago when you believed I was always the prey of a tragic memory bravely hidden beneath external smiles That s the worst or the best of real life Anne It WON T let you be miserable It keeps on trying to make you comfortable and succeeding even when you re determined to be unhappy and romantic Isn t this candy scrumptious I ve eaten far more than is good for me already but I m going to keep recklessly on After a little silence Miss Lavendar said abruptly It gave me a shock to hear about Stephen s son that first day you were here Anne I ve never been able to mention him to you since but I ve wanted to know all about him What sort of a boy is he He is the dearest sweetest child I ever knew Miss Lavendar and he pretends things too just as you and I do I d like to see him said Miss Lavendar softly as if talking to herself I wonder if he looks anything like the little dream boy who lives here with me MY little dream boy If you would like to see Paul I ll bring him through with me sometime said Anne I would like it but not too soon I want to get used to the thought There might be more pain than pleasure in it if he looked too much like Stephen or if he didn t look enough like him In a month s time you may bring him Accordingly a month later Anne and Paul walked through the woods to the stone house and met Miss Lavendar in the lane She had not been expecting them just then and she turned very pale So this is Stephen s boy she said in a low tone taking Paul s hand and looking at him as he stood beautiful and boyish in his smart little fur coat and cap He he is very like his father Everybody says I m a chip off the old block remarked Paul quite at his ease Anne who had been watching the little scene drew a relieved breath She saw that Miss Lavendar and Paul had taken to each other and that there would be no constraint or stiffness Miss Lavendar was a very sensible person in spite of her dreams and romance and after that first little betrayal she tucked her feelings out of sight and entertained Paul as brightly and naturally as if he were anybody s son who had come to see her They all had a jolly afternoon together and such a feast of fat things by way of supper as would have made old missus Irving hold up her hands in horror believing that Paul s digestion would be ruined for ever Come again laddie said Miss Lavendar shaking hands with him at parting You may kiss me if you like said Paul gravely Miss Lavendar stooped and kissed him How did you know I wanted to she whispered Because you looked at me just as my little mother used to do when she wanted to kiss me As a rule I don t like to be kissed Boys don t You know Miss Lewis But I think I rather like to have you kiss me And of course I ll come to see you again I think I d like to have you for a particular friend of mine if you don t object I I don t think I shall object said Miss Lavendar She turned and went in very quickly but a moment later she was waving a gay and smiling good bye to them from the window I like Miss Lavendar announced Paul as they walked through the beech woods I like the way she looked at me and I like her stone house and I like Charlotta the Fourth I wish Grandma Irving had a Charlotta the Fourth instead of a Mary Joe I feel sure Charlotta the Fourth wouldn t think I was wrong in my upper story when I told her what I think about things Wasn t that a splendid tea we had teacher Grandma says a boy shouldn t be thinking about what he gets to eat but he can t help it sometimes when he is real hungry YOU know teacher I don t think Miss Lavendar would make a boy eat porridge for breakfast if he didn t like it She d get things for him he did like But of course Paul was nothing if not fair minded that mightn t be very good for him It s very nice for a change though teacher YOU know XXIV A Prophet in His Own Country One May day Avonlea folks were mildly excited over some Avonlea Notes signed Observer which appeared in the Charlottetown Daily Enterprise Gossip ascribed the authorship thereof to Charlie Sloane partly because the said Charlie had indulged in similar literary flights in times past and partly because one of the notes seemed to embody a sneer at Gilbert Blythe Avonlea juvenile society persisted in regarding Gilbert Blythe and Charlie Sloane as rivals in the good graces of a certain damsel with gray eyes and an imagination Gossip as usual was wrong Gilbert Blythe aided and abetted by Anne had written the notes putting in the one about himself as a blind Only two of the notes have any bearing on this history Rumor has it that there will be a wedding in our village ere the daisies are in bloom A new and highly respected citizen will lead to the hymeneal altar one of our most popular ladies Uncle Abe our well known weather prophet predicts a violent storm of thunder and lightning for the evening of the twenty third of May beginning at seven o clock sharp The area of the storm will extend over the greater part of the Province People traveling that evening will do well to take umbrellas and mackintoshes with them Uncle Abe really has predicted a storm for sometime this spring said Gilbert but do you suppose mister Harrison really does go to see Isabella Andrews No said Anne laughing I m sure he only goes to play checkers with mister Harrison Andrews but missus Lynde says she knows Isabella Andrews must be going to get married she s in such good spirits this spring Poor old Uncle Abe felt rather indignant over the notes He suspected that Observer was making fun of him He angrily denied having assigned any particular date for his storm but nobody believed him Life in Avonlea continued on the smooth and even tenor of its way The planting was put in the Improvers celebrated an Arbor Day Each Improver set out or caused to be set out five ornamental trees As the society now numbered forty members this meant a total of two hundred young trees Early oats greened over the red fields apple orchards flung great blossoming arms about the farmhouses and the Snow Queen adorned itself as a bride for her husband Anne liked to sleep with her window open and let the cherry fragrance blow over her face all night She thought it very poetical Marilla thought she was risking her life Thanksgiving should be celebrated in the spring said Anne one evening to Marilla as they sat on the front door steps and listened to the silver sweet chorus of the frogs I think it would be ever so much better than having it in November when everything is dead or asleep Then you have to remember to be thankful but in May one simply can t help being thankful that they are alive if for nothing else I feel exactly as Eve must have felt in the garden of Eden before the trouble began IS that grass in the hollow green or golden It seems to me Marilla that a pearl of a day like this when the blossoms are out and the winds don t know where to blow from next for sheer crazy delight must be pretty near as good as heaven Marilla looked scandalized and glanced apprehensively around to make sure the twins were not within earshot They came around the corner of the house just then Ain t it an awful nice smelling evening asked Davy sniffing delightedly as he swung a hoe in his grimy hands He had been working in his garden That spring Marilla by way of turning Davy s passion for reveling in mud and clay into useful channels had given him and Dora a small plot of ground for a garden Both had eagerly gone to work in a characteristic fashion Dora planted weeded and watered carefully systematically and dispassionately As a result her plot was already green with prim orderly little rows of vegetables and annuals Davy however worked with more zeal than discretion he dug and hoed and raked and watered and transplanted so energetically that his seeds had no chance for their lives How is your garden coming on Davy boy asked Anne Kind of slow said Davy with a sigh I don t know why the things don t grow better Milty Boulter says I must have planted them in the dark of the moon and that s the whole trouble He says you must never sow seeds or kill pork or cut your hair or do any portant thing in the wrong time of the moon Is that true Anne I want to know Maybe if you didn t pull your plants up by the roots every other day to see how they re getting on at the other end they d do better said Marilla sarcastically I only pulled six of them up protested Davy I wanted to see if there was grubs at the roots Milty Boulter said if it wasn t the moon s fault it must be grubs But I only found one grub He was a great big juicy curly grub I put him on a stone and got another stone and smashed him flat He made a jolly SQUISH I tell you I was sorry there wasn t more of them Dora s garden was planted same time s mine and her things are growing all right It CAN T be the moon Davy concluded in a reflective tone Marilla look at that apple tree said Anne Why the thing is human It is reaching out long arms to pick its own pink skirts daintily up and provoke us to admiration Those Yellow Duchess trees always bear well said Marilla complacently That tree ll be loaded this year I m real glad they re great for pies But neither Marilla nor Anne nor anybody else was fated to make pies out of Yellow Duchess apples that year The twenty third of May came an unseasonably warm day as none realized more keenly than Anne and her little beehive of pupils sweltering over fractions and syntax in the Avonlea schoolroom A hot breeze blew all the forenoon but after noon hour it died away into a heavy stillness At half past three Anne heard a low rumble of thunder She promptly dismissed school at once so that the children might get home before the storm came As they went out to the playground Anne perceived a certain shadow and gloom over the world in spite of the fact that the sun was still shining brightly Annetta Bell caught her hand nervously Oh teacher look at that awful cloud Anne looked and gave an exclamation of dismay In the northwest a mass of cloud such as she had never in all her life beheld before was rapidly rolling up It was dead black save where its curled and fringed edges showed a ghastly livid white There was something about it indescribably menacing as it gloomed up in the clear blue sky now and again a bolt of lightning shot across it followed by a savage growl It hung so low that it almost seemed to be touching the tops of the wooded hills mister Harmon Andrews came clattering up the hill in his truck wagon urging his team of grays to their utmost speed He pulled them to a halt opposite the school Guess Uncle Abe s hit it for once in his life Anne he shouted His storm s coming a leetle ahead of time Did ye ever see the like of that cloud Here all you young ones that are going my way pile in and those that ain t scoot for the post office if ye ve more n a quarter of a mile to go and stay there till the shower s over Anne caught Davy and Dora by the hands and flew down the hill along the Birch Path and past Violet Vale and Willowmere as fast as the twins fat legs could go They reached Green Gables not a moment too soon and were joined at the door by Marilla who had been hustling her ducks and chickens under shelter As they dashed into the kitchen the light seemed to vanish as if blown out by some mighty breath the awful cloud rolled over the sun and a darkness as of late twilight fell across the world At the same moment with a crash of thunder and a blinding glare of lightning the hail swooped down and blotted the landscape out in one white fury Through all the clamor of the storm came the thud of torn branches striking the house and the sharp crack of breaking glass In three minutes every pane in the west and north windows was broken and the hail poured in through the apertures covering the floor with stones the smallest of which was as big as a hen s egg For three quarters of an hour the storm raged unabated and no one who underwent it ever forgot it Marilla for once in her life shaken out of her composure by sheer terror knelt by her rocking chair in a corner of the kitchen gasping and sobbing between the deafening thunder peals Anne white as paper had dragged the sofa away from the window and sat on it with a twin on either side Davy at the first crash had howled Anne Anne is it the Judgment Day Anne Anne I never meant to be naughty and then had buried his face in Anne s lap and kept it there his little body quivering Dora somewhat pale but quite composed sat with her hand clasped in Anne s quiet and motionless It is doubtful if an earthquake would have disturbed Dora Then almost as suddenly as it began the storm ceased The hail stopped the thunder rolled and muttered away to the eastward and the sun burst out merry and radiant over a world so changed that it seemed an absurd thing to think that a scant three quarters of an hour could have effected such a transformation Marilla rose from her knees weak and trembling and dropped on her rocker Her face was haggard and she looked ten years older Have we all come out of that alive she asked solemnly You bet we have piped Davy cheerfully quite his own man again I wasn t a bit scared either only just at the first It come on a fellow so sudden I made up my mind quick as a wink that I wouldn t fight Teddy Sloane Monday as I d promised but now maybe I will Say Dora was you scared Yes I was a little scared said Dora primly but I held tight to Anne s hand and said my prayers over and over again Well I d have said my prayers too if I d have thought of it said Davy but he added triumphantly you see I came through just as safe as you for all I didn t say them Anne got Marilla a glassful of her potent currant wine HOW potent it was Anne in her earlier days had had all too good reason to know and then they went to the door to look out on the strange scene Far and wide was a white carpet knee deep of hailstones drifts of them were heaped up under the eaves and on the steps When three or four days later those hailstones melted the havoc they had wrought was plainly seen for every green growing thing in the field or garden was cut off Not only was every blossom stripped from the apple trees but great boughs and branches were wrenched away And out of the two hundred trees set out by the Improvers by far the greater number were snapped off or torn to shreds Can it possibly be the same world it was an hour ago asked Anne dazedly It MUST have taken longer than that to play such havoc The like of this has never been known in Prince Edward Island said Marilla never I remember when I was a girl there was a bad storm but it was nothing to this We ll hear of terrible destruction you may be sure I do hope none of the children were caught out in it murmured Anne anxiously As it was discovered later none of the children had been since all those who had any distance to go had taken mister Andrews excellent advice and sought refuge at the post office There comes John Henry Carter said Marilla John Henry came wading through the hailstones with a rather scared grin Oh ain t this awful Miss Cuthbert mister Harrison sent me over to see if yous had come out all right We re none of us killed said Marilla grimly and none of the buildings was struck I hope you got off equally well Yas m Not quite so well ma am We was struck The lightning knocked over the kitchen chimbly and come down the flue and knocked over Ginger s cage and tore a hole in the floor and went into the sullar Yas m Was Ginger hurt queried Anne Yas m He was hurt pretty bad He was killed Later on Anne went over to comfort mister Harrison She found him sitting by the table stroking Ginger s gay dead body with a trembling hand Poor Ginger won t call you any more names Anne he said mournfully Anne could never have imagined herself crying on Ginger s account but the tears came into her eyes He was all the company I had Anne and now he s dead Well well I m an old fool to care so much I ll let on I don t care I know you re going to say something sympathetic as soon as I stop talking but don t If you did I d cry like a baby Hasn t this been a terrible storm I guess folks won t laugh at Uncle Abe s predictions again Seems as if all the storms that he s been prophesying all his life that never happened came all at once Beats all how he struck the very day though don t it Look at the mess we have here I must hustle round and get some boards to patch up that hole in the floor Avonlea folks did nothing the next day but visit each other and compare damages The roads were impassable for wheels by reason of the hailstones so they walked or rode on horseback The mail came late with ill tidings from all over the province Houses had been struck people killed and injured the whole telephone and telegraph system had been disorganized and any number of young stock exposed in the fields had perished Uncle Abe waded out to the blacksmith s forge early in the morning and spent the whole day there It was Uncle Abe s hour of triumph and he enjoyed it to the full It would be doing Uncle Abe an injustice to say that he was glad the storm had happened but since it had to be he was very glad he had predicted it to the very day too Uncle Abe forgot that he had ever denied setting the day As for the trifling discrepancy in the hour that was nothing Gilbert arrived at Green Gables in the evening and found Marilla and Anne busily engaged in nailing strips of oilcloth over the broken windows Goodness only knows when we ll get glass for them said Marilla mister Barry went over to Carmody this afternoon but not a pane could he get for love or money Lawson and Blair were cleaned out by the Carmody people by ten o clock Was the storm bad at White Sands Gilbert I should say so I was caught in the school with all the children and I thought some of them would go mad with fright Three of them fainted and two girls took hysterics and Tommy Blewett did nothing but shriek at the top of his voice the whole time I only squealed once said Davy proudly My garden was all smashed flat he continued mournfully but so was Dora s he added in a tone which indicated that there was yet balm in Gilead Anne came running down from the west gable Oh Gilbert have you heard the news mister Levi Boulter s old house was struck and burned to the ground It seems to me that I m dreadfully wicked to feel glad over THAT when so much damage has been done mister Boulter says he believes the A V I S magicked up that storm on purpose Well one thing is certain said Gilbert laughing Observer has made Uncle Abe s reputation as a weather prophet Uncle Abe s storm will go down in local history It is a most extraordinary coincidence that it should have come on the very day we selected I actually have a half guilty feeling as if I really had magicked it up We may as well rejoice over the old house being removed for there s not much to rejoice over where our young trees are concerned Not ten of them have escaped Ah well we ll just have to plant them over again next spring said Anne philosophically That is one good thing about this world there are always sure to be more springs XXV An Avonlea Scandal One blithe June morning a fortnight after Uncle Abe s storm Anne came slowly through the Green Gables yard from the garden carrying in her hands two blighted stalks of white narcissus Look Marilla she said sorrowfully holding up the flowers before the eyes of a grim lady with her hair coifed in a green gingham apron who was going into the house with a plucked chicken these are the only buds the storm spared and even they are imperfect I m so sorry I wanted some for Matthew s grave He was always so fond of June lilies I kind of miss them myself admitted Marilla though it doesn t seem right to lament over them when so many worse things have happened all the crops destroyed as well as the fruit But people have sown their oats over again said Anne comfortingly and mister Harrison says he thinks if we have a good summer they will come out all right though late And my annuals are all coming up again but oh nothing can replace the June lilies Poor little Hester Gray will have none either I went all the way back to her garden last night but there wasn t one I m sure she ll miss them I don t think it s right for you to say such things Anne I really don t said Marilla severely Hester Gray has been dead for thirty years and her spirit is in heaven I hope Yes but I believe she loves and remembers her garden here still said Anne I m sure no matter how long I d lived in heaven I d like to look down and see somebody putting flowers on my grave If I had had a garden here like Hester Gray s it would take me more than thirty years even in heaven to forget being homesick for it by spells Well don t let the twins hear you talking like that was Marilla s feeble protest as she carried her chicken into the house Anne pinned her narcissi on her hair and went to the lane gate where she stood for awhile sunning herself in the June brightness before going in to attend to her Saturday morning duties The world was growing lovely again old Mother Nature was doing her best to remove the traces of the storm and though she was not to succeed fully for many a moon she was really accomplishing wonders I wish I could just be idle all day today Anne told a bluebird who was singing and swinging on a willow bough but a schoolma am who is also helping to bring up twins can t indulge in laziness birdie How sweet you are singing little bird You are just putting the feelings of my heart into song ever so much better than I could myself Why who is coming An express wagon was jolting up the lane with two people on the front seat and a big trunk behind When it drew near Anne recognized the driver as the son of the station agent at Bright River but his companion was a stranger a scrap of a woman who sprang nimbly down at the gate almost before the horse came to a standstill She was a very pretty little person evidently nearer fifty than forty but with rosy cheeks sparkling black eyes and shining black hair surmounted by a wonderful beflowered and beplumed bonnet In spite of having driven eight miles over a dusty road she was as neat as if she had just stepped out of the proverbial bandbox Is this where mister James A Harrison lives she inquired briskly No mister Harrison lives over there said Anne quite lost in astonishment Well I DID think this place seemed too tidy MUCH too tidy for James A to be living here unless he has greatly changed since I knew him chirped the little lady Is it true that James A is going to be married to some woman living in this settlement No oh no cried Anne flushing so guiltily that the stranger looked curiously at her as if she half suspected her of matrimonial designs on mister Harrison But I saw it in an Island paper persisted the Fair Unknown A friend sent a marked copy to me friends are always so ready to do such things James A s name was written in over new citizen Oh that note was only meant as a joke gasped Anne mister Harrison has no intention of marrying ANYBODY I assure you he hasn t I m very glad to hear it said the rosy lady climbing nimbly back to her seat in the wagon because he happens to be married already I am his wife Oh you may well look surprised I suppose he has been masquerading as a bachelor and breaking hearts right and left Well well James A nodding vigorously over the fields at the long white house your fun is over I am here though I wouldn t have bothered coming if I hadn t thought you were up to some mischief I suppose turning to Anne that parrot of his is as profane as ever His parrot is dead I THINK gasped poor Anne who couldn t have felt sure of her own name at that precise moment Dead Everything will be all right then cried the rosy lady jubilantly I can manage James A if that bird is out of the way With which cryptic utterance she went joyfully on her way and Anne flew to the kitchen door to meet Marilla Anne who was that woman Marilla said Anne solemnly but with dancing eyes do I look as if I were crazy Not more so than usual said Marilla with no thought of being sarcastic Well then do you think I am awake Anne what nonsense has got into you Who was that woman I say Marilla if I m not crazy and not asleep she can t be such stuff as dreams are made of she must be real Anyway I m sure I couldn t have imagined such a bonnet She says she is mister Harrison s wife Marilla Marilla stared in her turn His wife Anne Shirley Then what has he been passing himself off as an unmarried man for I don t suppose he did really said Anne trying to be just He never said he wasn t married People simply took it for granted Oh Marilla what will missus Lynde say to this They found out what missus Lynde had to say when she came up that evening missus Lynde wasn t surprised missus Lynde had always expected something of the sort missus Lynde had always known there was SOMETHING about mister Harrison To think of his deserting his wife she said indignantly It s like something you d read of in the States but who would expect such a thing to happen right here in Avonlea But we don t know that he deserted her protested Anne determined to believe her friend innocent till he was proved guilty We don t know the rights of it at all Well we soon will I m going straight over there said missus Lynde who had never learned that there was such a word as delicacy in the dictionary I m not supposed to know anything about her arrival and mister Harrison was to bring some medicine for Thomas from Carmody today so that will be a good excuse I ll find out the whole story and come in and tell you on the way back missus Lynde rushed in where Anne had feared to tread Nothing would have induced the latter to go over to the Harrison place but she had her natural and proper share of curiosity and she felt secretly glad that missus Lynde was going to solve the mystery She and Marilla waited expectantly for that good lady s return but waited in vain missus Lynde did not revisit Green Gables that night Davy arriving home at nine o clock from the Boulter place explained why I met missus Lynde and some strange woman in the Hollow he said and gracious how they were talking both at once missus Lynde said to tell you she was sorry it was too late to call tonight Anne I m awful hungry We had tea at Milty s at four and I think missus Boulter is real mean She didn t give us any preserves or cake and even the bread was skurce Davy when you go visiting you must never criticize anything you are given to eat said Anne solemnly It is very bad manners All right I ll only think it said Davy cheerfully Do give a fellow some supper Anne Anne looked at Marilla who followed her into the pantry and shut the door cautiously You can give him some jam on his bread I know what tea at Levi Boulter s is apt to be Davy took his slice of bread and jam with a sigh It s a kind of disappointing world after all he remarked Milty has a cat that takes fits she s took a fit regular every day for three weeks Milty says it s awful fun to watch her I went down today on purpose to see her have one but the mean old thing wouldn t take a fit and just kept healthy as healthy though Milty and me hung round all the afternoon and waited But never mind Davy brightened up as the insidious comfort of the plum jam stole into his soul maybe I ll see her in one sometime yet It doesn t seem likely she d stop having them all at once when she s been so in the habit of it does it This jam is awful nice Davy had no sorrows that plum jam could not cure Sunday proved so rainy that there was no stirring abroad but by Monday everybody had heard some version of the Harrison story The school buzzed with it and Davy came home full of information Marilla mister Harrison has a new wife well not ezackly new but they ve stopped being married for quite a spell Milty says I always s posed people had to keep on being married once they d begun but Milty says no there s ways of stopping if you can t agree Milty says one way is just to start off and leave your wife and that s what mister Harrison did Milty says mister Harrison left his wife because she throwed things at him HARD things and Arty Sloane says it was because she wouldn t let him smoke and Ned Clay says it was cause she never let up scolding him I wouldn t leave MY wife for anything like that I d just put my foot down and say missus Davy you ve just got to do what ll please ME cause I m a MAN THAT D settle her pretty quick I guess But Annetta Clay says SHE left HIM because he wouldn t scrape his boots at the door and she doesn t blame her I m going right over to mister Harrison s this minute to see what she s like Davy soon returned somewhat cast down missus Harrison was away she s gone to Carmody with missus Rachel Lynde to get new paper for the parlor And mister Harrison said to tell Anne to go over and see him cause he wants to have a talk with her And say the floor is scrubbed and mister Harrison is shaved though there wasn t any preaching yesterday The Harrison kitchen wore a very unfamiliar look to Anne The floor was indeed scrubbed to a wonderful pitch of purity and so was every article of furniture in the room the stove was polished until she could see her face in it the walls were whitewashed and the window panes sparkled in the sunlight By the table sat mister Harrison in his working clothes which on Friday had been noted for sundry rents and tatters but which were now neatly patched and brushed He was sprucely shaved and what little hair he had was carefully trimmed Sit down Anne sit down said mister Harrison in a tone but two degrees removed from that which Avonlea people used at funerals Emily s gone over to Carmody with Rachel Lynde she s struck up a lifelong friendship already with Rachel Lynde Beats all how contrary women are Well Anne my easy times are over all over It s neatness and tidiness for me for the rest of my natural life I suppose mister Harrison did his best to speak dolefully but an irrepressible twinkle in his eye betrayed him mister Harrison you are glad your wife is come back cried Anne shaking her finger at him You needn t pretend you re not because I can see it plainly mister Harrison relaxed into a sheepish smile Well well I m getting used to it he conceded I can t say I was sorry to see Emily A man really needs some protection in a community like this where he can t play a game of checkers with a neighbor without being accused of wanting to marry that neighbor s sister and having it put in the paper Nobody would have supposed you went to see Isabella Andrews if you hadn t pretended to be unmarried said Anne severely I didn t pretend I was If anybody d have asked me if I was married I d have said I was But they just took it for granted I wasn t anxious to talk about the matter I was feeling too sore over it It would have been nuts for missus Rachel Lynde if she had known my wife had left me wouldn t it now But some people say that you left her She started it Anne she started it I m going to tell you the whole story for I don t want you to think worse of me than I deserve nor of Emily neither But let s go out on the veranda Everything is so fearful neat in here that it kind of makes me homesick I suppose I ll get used to it after awhile but it eases me up to look at the yard Emily hasn t had time to tidy it up yet As soon as they were comfortably seated on the veranda mister Harrison began his tale of woe I lived in Scottsford New Brunswick before I came here Anne My sister kept house for me and she suited me fine she was just reasonably tidy and she let me alone and spoiled me so Emily says But three years ago she died Before she died she worried a lot about what was to become of me and finally she got me to promise I d get married She advised me to take Emily Scott because Emily had money of her own and was a pattern housekeeper I said says I Emily Scott wouldn t look at me You ask her and see says my sister and just to ease her mind I promised her I would and I did And Emily said she d have me Never was so surprised in my life Anne a smart pretty little woman like her and an old fellow like me I tell you I thought at first I was in luck Well we were married and took a little wedding trip to saint John for a fortnight and then we went home We got home at ten o clock at night and I give you my word Anne that in half an hour that woman was at work housecleaning Oh I know you re thinking my house needed it you ve got a very expressive face Anne your thoughts just come out on it like print but it didn t not that bad It had got pretty mixed up while I was keeping bachelor s hall I admit but I d got a woman to come in and clean it up before I was married and there d been considerable painting and fixing done I tell you if you took Emily into a brand new white marble palace she d be into the scrubbing as soon as she could get an old dress on Well she cleaned house till one o clock that night and at four she was up and at it again And she kept on that way far s I could see she never stopped It was scour and sweep and dust everlasting except on Sundays and then she was just longing for Monday to begin again But it was her way of amusing herself and I could have reconciled myself to it if she d left me alone But that she wouldn t do She d set out to make me over but she hadn t caught me young enough I wasn t allowed to come into the house unless I changed my boots for slippers at the door I darsn t smoke a pipe for my life unless I went to the barn And I didn t use good enough grammar Emily d been a schoolteacher in her early life and she d never got over it Then she hated to see me eating with my knife Well there it was pick and nag everlasting But I s pose Anne to be fair I was cantankerous too I didn t try to improve as I might have done I just got cranky and disagreeable when she found fault I told her one day she hadn t complained of my grammar when I proposed to her It wasn t an overly tactful thing to say A woman would forgive a man for beating her sooner than for hinting she was too much pleased to get him Well we bickered along like that and it wasn t exactly pleasant but we might have got used to each other after a spell if it hadn t been for Ginger Ginger was the rock we split on at last Emily didn t like parrots and she couldn t stand Ginger s profane habits of speech I was attached to the bird for my brother the sailor s sake My brother the sailor was a pet of mine when we were little tads and he d sent Ginger to me when he was dying I didn t see any sense in getting worked up over his swearing There s nothing I hate worse n profanity in a human being but in a parrot that s just repeating what it s heard with no more understanding of it than I d have of Chinese allowances might be made But Emily couldn t see it that way Women ain t logical She tried to break Ginger of swearing but she hadn t any better success than she had in trying to make me stop saying I seen and them things Seemed as if the more she tried the worse Ginger got same as me Well things went on like this both of us getting raspier till the CLIMAX came Emily invited our minister and his wife to tea and another minister and HIS wife that was visiting them I d promised to put Ginger away in some safe place where nobody would hear him Emily wouldn t touch his cage with a ten foot pole and I meant to do it for I didn t want the ministers to hear anything unpleasant in my house But it slipped my mind Emily was worrying me so much about clean collars and grammar that it wasn t any wonder and I never thought of that poor parrot till we sat down to tea Just as minister number one was in the very middle of saying grace Ginger who was on the veranda outside the dining room window lifted up HIS voice The gobbler had come into view in the yard and the sight of a gobbler always had an unwholesome effect on Ginger He surpassed himself that time You can smile Anne and I don t deny I ve chuckled some over it since myself but at the time I felt almost as much mortified as Emily I went out and carried Ginger to the barn I can t say I enjoyed the meal I knew by the look of Emily that there was trouble brewing for Ginger and James A When the folks went away I started for the cow pasture and on the way I did some thinking I felt sorry for Emily and kind of fancied I hadn t been so thoughtful of her as I might and besides I wondered if the ministers would think that Ginger had learned his vocabulary from me The long and short of it was I decided that Ginger would have to be mercifully disposed of and when I d druv the cows home I went in to tell Emily so But there was no Emily and there was a letter on the table just according to the rule in story books Emily writ that I d have to choose between her and Ginger she d gone back to her own house and there she would stay till I went and told her I d got rid of that parrot I was all riled up Anne and I said she might stay till doomsday if she waited for that and I stuck to it I packed up her belongings and sent them after her It made an awful lot of talk Scottsford was pretty near as bad as Avonlea for gossip and everybody sympathized with Emily It kept me all cross and cantankerous and I saw I d have to get out or I d never have any peace I concluded I d come to the Island I d been here when I was a boy and I liked it but Emily had always said she wouldn t live in a place where folks were scared to walk out after dark for fear they d fall off the edge So just to be contrary I moved over here And that s all there is to it I hadn t ever heard a word from or about Emily till I come home from the back field Saturday and found her scrubbing the floor but with the first decent dinner I d had since she left me all ready on the table She told me to eat it first and then we d talk by which I concluded that Emily had learned some lessons about getting along with a man So she s here and she s going to stay seeing that Ginger s dead and the Island s some bigger than she thought There s missus Lynde and her now No don t go Anne Stay and get acquainted with Emily She took quite a notion to you Saturday wanted to know who that handsome redhaired girl was at the next house missus Harrison welcomed Anne radiantly and insisted on her staying to tea James A has been telling me all about you and how kind you ve been making cakes and things for him she said I want to get acquainted with all my new neighbors just as soon as possible missus Lynde is a lovely woman isn t she So friendly When Anne went home in the sweet June dusk missus Harrison went with her across the fields where the fireflies were lighting their starry lamps I suppose said missus Harrison confidentially that James A has told you our story Yes Then I needn t tell it for James A is a just man and he would tell the truth The blame was far from being all on his side I can see that now I wasn t back in my own house an hour before I wished I hadn t been so hasty but I wouldn t give in I see now that I expected too much of a man And I was real foolish to mind his bad grammar It doesn t matter if a man does use bad grammar so long as he is a good provider and doesn t go poking round the pantry to see how much sugar you ve used in a week I feel that James A and I are going to be real happy now I wish I knew who Observer is so that I could thank him I owe him a real debt of gratitude Anne kept her own counsel and missus Harrison never knew that her gratitude found its way to its object Anne felt rather bewildered over the far reaching consequences of those foolish notes They had reconciled a man to his wife and made the reputation of a prophet missus Lynde was in the Green Gables kitchen She had been telling the whole story to Marilla Well and how do you like missus Harrison she asked Anne Very much I think she s a real nice little woman That s exactly what she is said missus Rachel with emphasis and as I ve just been sayin to Marilla I think we ought all to overlook mister Harrison s peculiarities for her sake and try to make her feel at home here that s what Well I must get back Thomas ll be wearying for me I get out a little since Eliza came and he s seemed a lot better these past few days but I never like to be long away from him I hear Gilbert Blythe has resigned from White Sands He ll be off to college in the fall I suppose missus Rachel looked sharply at Anne but Anne was bending over a sleepy Davy nodding on the sofa and nothing was to be read in her face She carried Davy away her oval girlish cheek pressed against his curly yellow head As they went up the stairs Davy flung a tired arm about Anne s neck and gave her a warm hug and a sticky kiss You re awful nice Anne Milty Boulter wrote on his slate today and showed it to Jennie Sloane Roses red and vi lets blue Sugar s sweet and so are you and that spresses my feelings for you ezackly Anne XXVI Around the Bend Thomas Lynde faded out of life as quietly and unobtrusively as he had lived it His wife was a tender patient unwearied nurse Sometimes Rachel had been a little hard on her Thomas in health when his slowness or meekness had provoked her but when he became ill no voice could be lower no hand more gently skillful no vigil more uncomplaining You ve been a good wife to me Rachel he once said simply when she was sitting by him in the dusk holding his thin blanched old hand in her work hardened one A good wife I m sorry I ain t leaving you better off but the children will look after you They re all smart capable children just like their mother A good mother a good woman He had fallen asleep then and the next morning just as the white dawn was creeping up over the pointed firs in the hollow Marilla went softly into the east gable and wakened Anne Anne Thomas Lynde is gone their hired boy just brought the word I m going right down to Rachel On the day after Thomas Lynde s funeral Marilla went about Green Gables with a strangely preoccupied air Occasionally she looked at Anne seemed on the point of saying something then shook her head and buttoned up her mouth After tea she went down to see missus Rachel and when she returned she went to the east gable where Anne was correcting school exercises How is missus Lynde tonight asked the latter She s feeling calmer and more composed answered Marilla sitting down on Anne s bed a proceeding which betokened some unusual mental excitement for in Marilla s code of household ethics to sit on a bed after it was made up was an unpardonable offense But she s very lonely Eliza had to go home today her son isn t well and she felt she couldn t stay any longer When I ve finished these exercises I ll run down and chat awhile with missus Lynde said Anne I had intended to study some Latin composition tonight but it can wait I suppose Gilbert Blythe is going to college in the fall said Marilla jerkily How would you like to go too Anne Anne looked up in astonishment I would like it of course Marilla But it isn t possible I guess it can be made possible I ve always felt that you should go I ve never felt easy to think you were giving it all up on my account But Marilla I ve never been sorry for a moment that I stayed home I ve been so happy Oh these past two years have just been delightful Oh yes I know you ve been contented enough But that isn t the question exactly You ought to go on with your education You ve saved enough to put you through one year at Redmond and the money the stock brought in will do for another year and there s scholarships and things you might win Yes but I can t go Marilla Your eyes are better of course but I can t leave you alone with the twins They need so much looking after I won t be alone with them That s what I meant to discuss with you I had a long talk with Rachel tonight Anne she s feeling dreadful bad over a good many things She s not left very well off It seems they mortgaged the farm eight years ago to give the youngest boy a start when he went west and they ve never been able to pay much more than the interest since And then of course Thomas illness has cost a good deal one way or another The farm will have to be sold and Rachel thinks there ll be hardly anything left after the bills are settled She says she ll have to go and live with Eliza and it s breaking her heart to think of leaving Avonlea A woman of her age doesn t make new friends and interests easy And Anne as she talked about it the thought came to me that I would ask her to come and live with me but I thought I ought to talk it over with you first before I said anything to her If I had Rachel living with me you could go to college How do you feel about it I feel as if somebody had handed me the moon and I didn t know exactly what to do with it said Anne dazedly But as for asking missus Lynde to come here that is for you to decide Marilla Do you think are you sure you would like it missus Lynde is a good woman and a kind neighbor but but But she s got her faults you mean to say Well she has of course but I think I d rather put up with far worse faults than see Rachel go away from Avonlea I d miss her terrible She s the only close friend I ve got here and I d be lost without her We ve been neighbors for forty five years and we ve never had a quarrel though we came rather near it that time you flew at missus Rachel for calling you homely and redhaired Do you remember Anne I should think I do said Anne ruefully People don t forget things like that How I hated poor missus Rachel at that moment And then that apology you made her Well you were a handful in all conscience Anne I did feel so puzzled and bewildered how to manage you Matthew understood you better Matthew understood everything said Anne softly as she always spoke of him Well I think it could be managed so that Rachel and I wouldn t clash at all It always seemed to me that the reason two women can t get along in one house is that they try to share the same kitchen and get in each other s way Now if Rachel came here she could have the north gable for her bedroom and the spare room for a kitchen as well as not for we don t really need a spare room at all She could put her stove there and what furniture she wanted to keep and be real comfortable and independent She ll have enough to live on of course her children ll see to that so all I d be giving her would be house room Yes Anne far as I m concerned I d like it Then ask her said Anne promptly I d be very sorry myself to see missus Rachel go away And if she comes continued Marilla You can go to college as well as not She ll be company for me and she ll do for the twins what I can t do so there s no reason in the world why you shouldn t go Anne had a long meditation at her window that night Joy and regret struggled together in her heart She had come at last suddenly and unexpectedly to the bend in the road and college was around it with a hundred rainbow hopes and visions but Anne realized as well that when she rounded that curve she must leave many sweet things behind all the little simple duties and interests which had grown so dear to her in the last two years and which she had glorified into beauty and delight by the enthusiasm she had put into them She must give up her school and she loved every one of her pupils even the stupid and naughty ones The mere thought of Paul Irving made her wonder if Redmond were such a name to conjure with after all I ve put out a lot of little roots these two years Anne told the moon and when I m pulled up they re going to hurt a great deal But it s best to go I think and as Marilla says there s no good reason why I shouldn t I must get out all my ambitions and dust them Anne sent in her resignation the next day and missus Rachel after a heart to heart talk with Marilla gratefully accepted the offer of a home at Green Gables She elected to remain in her own house for the summer however the farm was not to be sold until the fall and there were many arrangements to be made I certainly never thought of living as far off the road as Green Gables sighed missus Rachel to herself But really Green Gables doesn t seem as out of the world as it used to do Anne has lots of company and the twins make it real lively And anyhow I d rather live at the bottom of a well than leave Avonlea These two decisions being noised abroad speedily ousted the arrival of missus Harrison in popular gossip Sage heads were shaken over Marilla Cuthbert s rash step in asking missus Rachel to live with her People opined that they wouldn t get on together They were both too fond of their own way and many doleful predictions were made none of which disturbed the parties in question at all They had come to a clear and distinct understanding of the respective duties and rights of their new arrangements and meant to abide by them I won t meddle with you nor you with me missus Rachel had said decidedly and as for the twins I ll be glad to do all I can for them but I won t undertake to answer Davy s questions that s what I m not an encyclopedia neither am I a Philadelphia lawyer You ll miss Anne for that Sometimes Anne s answers were about as queer as Davy s questions said Marilla drily The twins will miss her and no mistake but her future can t be sacrificed to Davy s thirst for information When he asks questions I can t answer I ll just tell him children should be seen and not heard That was how I was brought up and I don t know but what it was just as good a way as all these new fangled notions for training children Well Anne s methods seem to have worked fairly well with Davy said missus Lynde smilingly He is a reformed character that s what He isn t a bad little soul conceded Marilla I never expected to get as fond of those children as I have Davy gets round you somehow and Dora is a lovely child although she is kind of well kind of Monotonous Exactly supplied missus Rachel Like a book where every page is the same that s what Dora will make a good reliable woman but she ll never set the pond on fire Well that sort of folks are comfortable to have round even if they re not as interesting as the other kind Gilbert Blythe was probably the only person to whom the news of Anne s resignation brought unmixed pleasure Her pupils looked upon it as a sheer catastrophe Annetta Bell had hysterics when she went home Anthony Pye fought two pitched and unprovoked battles with other boys by way of relieving his feelings Barbara Shaw cried all night Paul Irving defiantly told his grandmother that she needn t expect him to eat any porridge for a week I can t do it Grandma he said I don t really know if I can eat ANYTHING I feel as if there was a dreadful lump in my throat I d have cried coming home from school if Jake Donnell hadn t been watching me I believe I will cry after I go to bed It wouldn t show on my eyes tomorrow would it And it would be such a relief But anyway I can t eat porridge I m going to need all my strength of mind to bear up against this Grandma and I won t have any left to grapple with porridge Oh Grandma I don t know what I ll do when my beautiful teacher goes away Milty Boulter says he bets Jane Andrews will get the school I suppose Miss Andrews is very nice But I know she won t understand things like Miss Shirley Diana also took a very pessimistic view of affairs It will be horribly lonesome here next winter she mourned one twilight when the moonlight was raining airy silver through the cherry boughs and filling the east gable with a soft dream like radiance in which the two girls sat and talked Anne on her low rocker by the window Diana sitting Turkfashion on the bed You and Gilbert will be gone and the Allans too They are going to call mister Allan to Charlottetown and of course he ll accept It s too mean We ll be vacant all winter I suppose and have to listen to a long string of candidates and half of them won t be any good I hope they won t call mister Baxter from East Grafton here anyhow said Anne decidedly He wants the call but he does preach such gloomy sermons mister Bell says he s a minister of the old school but missus Lynde says there s nothing whatever the matter with him but indigestion His wife isn t a very good cook it seems and missus Lynde says that when a man has to eat sour bread two weeks out of three his theology is bound to get a kink in it somewhere missus Allan feels very badly about going away She says everybody has been so kind to her since she came here as a bride that she feels as if she were leaving lifelong friends And then there s the baby s grave you know She says she doesn t see how she can go away and leave that it was such a little mite of a thing and only three months old and she says she is afraid it will miss its mother although she knows better and wouldn t say so to mister Allan for anything She says she has slipped through the birch grove back of the manse nearly every night to the graveyard and sung a little lullaby to it She told me all about it last evening when I was up putting some of those early wild roses on Matthew s grave I promised her that as long as I was in Avonlea I would put flowers on the baby s grave and when I was away I felt sure that That I would do it supplied Diana heartily Of course I will And I ll put them on Matthew s grave too for your sake Anne Oh thank you I meant to ask you to if you would And on little Hester Gray s too Please don t forget hers Do you know I ve thought and dreamed so much about little Hester Gray that she has become strangely real to me I think of her back there in her little garden in that cool still green corner and I have a fancy that if I could steal back there some spring evening just at the magic time twixt light and dark and tiptoe so softly up the beech hill that my footsteps could not frighten her I would find the garden just as it used to be all sweet with June lilies and early roses with the tiny house beyond it all hung with vines and little Hester Gray would be there with her soft eyes and the wind ruffling her dark hair wandering about putting her fingertips under the chins of the lilies and whispering secrets with the roses and I would go forward oh so softly and hold out my hands and say to her Little Hester Gray won t you let me be your playmate for I love the roses too And we would sit down on the old bench and talk a little and dream a little or just be beautifully silent together And then the moon would rise and I would look around me and there would be no Hester Gray and no little vine hung house and no roses only an old waste garden starred with June lilies amid the grasses and the wind sighing oh so sorrowfully in the cherry trees And I would not know whether it had been real or if I had just imagined it all Diana crawled up and got her back against the headboard of the bed When your companion of twilight hour said such spooky things it was just as well not to be able to fancy there was anything behind you I m afraid the Improvement Society will go down when you and Gilbert are both gone she remarked dolefully Not a bit of fear of it said Anne briskly coming back from dreamland to the affairs of practical life It is too firmly established for that especially since the older people are becoming so enthusiastic about it Look what they are doing this summer for their lawns and lanes Besides I ll be watching for hints at Redmond and I ll write a paper for it next winter and send it over Don t take such a gloomy view of things Diana And don t grudge me my little hour of gladness and jubilation now Later on when I have to go away I ll feel anything but glad It s all right for you to be glad you re going to college and you ll have a jolly time and make heaps of lovely new friends I hope I shall make new friends said Anne thoughtfully The possibilities of making new friends help to make life very fascinating But no matter how many friends I make they ll never be as dear to me as the old ones especially a certain girl with black eyes and dimples Can you guess who she is Diana But there ll be so many clever girls at Redmond sighed Diana and I m only a stupid little country girl who says I seen sometimes though I really know better when I stop to think Well of course these past two years have really been too pleasant to last I know SOMEBODY who is glad you are going to Redmond anyhow Anne I m going to ask you a question a serious question Don t be vexed and do answer seriously Do you care anything for Gilbert Ever so much as a friend and not a bit in the way you mean said Anne calmly and decidedly she also thought she was speaking sincerely Diana sighed She wished somehow that Anne had answered differently Don t you mean EVER to be married Anne Perhaps some day when I meet the right one said Anne smiling dreamily up at the moonlight But how can you be sure when you do meet the right one persisted Diana Oh I should know him SOMETHING would tell me You know what my ideal is Diana But people s ideals change sometimes Mine won t And I COULDN T care for any man who didn t fulfill it What if you never meet him Then I shall die an old maid was the cheerful response I daresay it isn t the hardest death by any means Oh I suppose the dying would be easy enough it s the living an old maid I shouldn t like said Diana with no intention of being humorous Although I wouldn t mind being an old maid VERY much if I could be one like Miss Lavendar But I never could be When I m forty five I ll be horribly fat And while there might be some romance about a thin old maid there couldn t possibly be any about a fat one Oh mind you Nelson Atkins proposed to Ruby Gillis three weeks ago Ruby told me all about it She says she never had any intention of taking him because any one who married him will have to go in with the old folks but Ruby says that he made such a perfectly beautiful and romantic proposal that it simply swept her off her feet But she didn t want to do anything rash so she asked for a week to consider and two days later she was at a meeting of the Sewing Circle at his mother s and there was a book called The Complete Guide to Etiquette lying on the parlor table Ruby said she simply couldn t describe her feelings when in a section of it headed The Deportment of Courtship and Marriage she found the very proposal Nelson had made word for word She went home and wrote him a perfectly scathing refusal and she says his father and mother have taken turns watching him ever since for fear he ll drown himself in the river but Ruby says they needn t be afraid for in the Deportment of Courtship and Marriage it told how a rejected lover should behave and there s nothing about drowning in THAT And she says Wilbur Blair is literally pining away for her but she s perfectly helpless in the matter Anne made an impatient movement I hate to say it it seems so disloyal but well I don t like Ruby Gillis now I liked her when we went to school and Queen s together though not so well as you and Jane of course But this last year at Carmody she seems so different so so I know nodded Diana It s the Gillis coming out in her she can t help it missus Lynde says that if ever a Gillis girl thought about anything but the boys she never showed it in her walk and conversation She talks about nothing but boys and what compliments they pay her and how crazy they all are about her at Carmody And the strange thing is they ARE too Diana admitted this somewhat resentfully Last night when I saw her in mister Blair s store she whispered to me that she d just made a new mash I wouldn t ask her who it was because I knew she was dying to BE asked Well it s what Ruby always wanted I suppose You remember even when she was little she always said she meant to have dozens of beaus when she grew up and have the very gayest time she could before she settled down She s so different from Jane isn t she Jane is such a nice sensible lady like girl Dear old Jane is a jewel agreed Anne but she added leaning forward to bestow a tender pat on the plump dimpled little hand hanging over her pillow there s nobody like my own Diana after all Do you remember that evening we first met Diana and swore eternal friendship in your garden We ve kept that oath I think we ve never had a quarrel nor even a coolness I shall never forget the thrill that went over me the day you told me you loved me I had had such a lonely starved heart all through my childhood I m just beginning to realize how starved and lonely it really was Nobody cared anything for me or wanted to be bothered with me I should have been miserable if it hadn t been for that strange little dream life of mine wherein I imagined all the friends and love I craved But when I came to Green Gables everything was changed And then I met you You don t know what your friendship meant to me I want to thank you here and now dear for the warm and true affection you ve always given me And always always will sobbed Diana I shall NEVER love anybody any GIRL half as well as I love you And if I ever do marry and have a little girl of my own I m going to name her ANNE XXVII An Afternoon at the Stone House Where are you going all dressed up Anne Davy wanted to know You look bully in that dress Anne had come down to dinner in a new dress of pale green muslin the first color she had worn since Matthew s death It became her perfectly bringing out all the delicate flower like tints of her face and the gloss and burnish of her hair Davy how many times have I told you that you mustn t use that word she rebuked I m going to Echo Lodge Take me with you entreated Davy I would if I were driving But I m going to walk and it s too far for your eight year old legs Besides Paul is going with me and I fear you don t enjoy yourself in his company Oh I like Paul lots better n I did said Davy beginning to make fearful inroads into his pudding Since I ve got pretty good myself I don t mind his being gooder so much If I can keep on I ll catch up with him some day both in legs and goodness Sides Paul s real nice to us second primer boys in school He won t let the other big boys meddle with us and he shows us lots of games How came Paul to fall into the brook at noon hour yesterday asked Anne I met him on the playground such a dripping figure that I sent him promptly home for clothes without waiting to find out what had happened Well it was partly a zacksident explained Davy He stuck his head in on purpose but the rest of him fell in zacksidentally We was all down at the brook and Prillie Rogerson got mad at Paul about something she s awful mean and horrid anyway if she IS pretty and said that his grandmother put his hair up in curl rags every night Paul wouldn t have minded what she said I guess but Gracie Andrews laughed and Paul got awful red cause Gracie s his girl you know He s CLEAN GONE on her brings her flowers and carries her books as far as the shore road He got as red as a beet and said his grandmother didn t do any such thing and his hair was born curly And then he laid down on the bank and stuck his head right into the spring to show them Oh it wasn t the spring we drink out of seeing a horrified look on Marilla s face it was the little one lower down But the bank s awful slippy and Paul went right in I tell you he made a bully splash Oh Anne Anne I didn t mean to say that it just slipped out before I thought He made a SPLENDID splash But he looked so funny when he crawled out all wet and muddy The girls laughed more n ever but Gracie didn t laugh She looked sorry Gracie s a nice girl but she s got a snub nose When I get big enough to have a girl I won t have one with a snub nose I ll pick one with a pretty nose like yours Anne A boy who makes such a mess of syrup all over his face when he is eating his pudding will never get a girl to look at him said Marilla severely But I ll wash my face before I go courting protested Davy trying to improve matters by rubbing the back of his hand over the smears And I ll wash behind my ears too without being told I remembered to this morning Marilla I don t forget half as often as I did But and Davy sighed there s so many corners about a fellow that it s awful hard to remember them all Well if I can t go to Miss Lavendar s I ll go over and see missus Harrison missus Harrison s an awful nice woman I tell you She keeps a jar of cookies in her pantry a purpose for little boys and she always gives me the scrapings out of a pan she s mixed up a plum cake in A good many plums stick to the sides you see mister Harrison was always a nice man but he s twice as nice since he got married over again I guess getting married makes folks nicer Why don t YOU get married Marilla I want to know Marilla s state of single blessedness had never been a sore point with her so she answered amiably with an exchange of significant looks with Anne that she supposed it was because nobody would have her But maybe you never asked anybody to have you protested Davy Oh Davy said Dora primly shocked into speaking without being spoken to it s the MEN that have to do the asking I don t know why they have to do it ALWAYS grumbled Davy Seems to me everything s put on the men in this world Can I have some more pudding Marilla You ve had as much as was good for you said Marilla but she gave him a moderate second helping I wish people could live on pudding Why can t they Marilla I want to know Because they d soon get tired of it I d like to try that for myself said skeptical Davy But I guess it s better to have pudding only on fish and company days than none at all They never have any at Milty Boulter s Milty says when company comes his mother gives them cheese and cuts it herself one little bit apiece and one over for manners If Milty Boulter talks like that about his mother at least you needn t repeat it said Marilla severely Bless my soul Davy had picked this expression up from mister Harrison and used it with great gusto Milty meant it as a compelment He s awful proud of his mother cause folks say she could scratch a living on a rock I I suppose them pesky hens are in my pansy bed again said Marilla rising and going out hurriedly The slandered hens were nowhere near the pansy bed and Marilla did not even glance at it Instead she sat down on the cellar hatch and laughed until she was ashamed of herself When Anne and Paul reached the stone house that afternoon they found Miss Lavendar and Charlotta the Fourth in the garden weeding raking clipping and trimming as if for dear life Miss Lavendar herself all gay and sweet in the frills and laces she loved dropped her shears and ran joyously to meet her guests while Charlotta the Fourth grinned cheerfully Welcome Anne I thought you d come today You belong to the afternoon so it brought you Things that belong together are sure to come together What a lot of trouble that would save some people if they only knew it But they don t and so they waste beautiful energy moving heaven and earth to bring things together that DON T belong And you Paul why you ve grown You re half a head taller than when you were here before Yes I ve begun to grow like pigweed in the night as missus Lynde says said Paul in frank delight over the fact Grandma says it s the porridge taking effect at last Perhaps it is Goodness knows Paul sighed deeply I ve eaten enough to make anyone grow I do hope now that I ve begun I ll keep on till I m as tall as father He is six feet you know Miss Lavendar Yes Miss Lavendar did know the flush on her pretty cheeks deepened a little she took Paul s hand on one side and Anne s on the other and walked to the house in silence Is it a good day for the echoes Miss Lavendar queried Paul anxiously The day of his first visit had been too windy for echoes and Paul had been much disappointed Yes just the best kind of a day answered Miss Lavendar rousing herself from her reverie But first we are all going to have something to eat I know you two folks didn t walk all the way back here through those beechwoods without getting hungry and Charlotta the Fourth and I can eat any hour of the day we have such obliging appetites So we ll just make a raid on the pantry Fortunately it s lovely and full I had a presentiment that I was going to have company today and Charlotta the Fourth and I prepared I think you are one of the people who always have nice things in their pantry declared Paul Grandma s like that too But she doesn t approve of snacks between meals I wonder he added meditatively if I OUGHT to eat them away from home when I know she doesn t approve Oh I don t think she would disapprove after you have had a long walk That makes a difference said Miss Lavendar exchanging amused glances with Anne over Paul s brown curls I suppose that snacks ARE extremely unwholesome That is why we have them so often at Echo Lodge We Charlotta the Fourth and I live in defiance of every known law of diet We eat all sorts of indigestible things whenever we happen to think of it by day or night and we flourish like green bay trees We are always intending to reform When we read any article in a paper warning us against something we like we cut it out and pin it up on the kitchen wall so that we ll remember it But we never can somehow until after we ve gone and eaten that very thing Nothing has ever killed us yet but Charlotta the Fourth has been known to have bad dreams after we had eaten doughnuts and mince pie and fruit cake before we went to bed Grandma lets me have a glass of milk and a slice of bread and butter before I go to bed and on Sunday nights she puts jam on the bread said Paul So I m always glad when it s Sunday night for more reasons than one Sunday is a very long day on the shore road Grandma says it s all too short for her and that father never found Sundays tiresome when he was a little boy It wouldn t seem so long if I could talk to my rock people but I never do that because Grandma doesn t approve of it on Sundays I think a good deal but I m afraid my thoughts are worldly Grandma says we should never think anything but religious thoughts on Sundays But teacher here said once that every really beautiful thought was religious no matter what it was about or what day we thought it on But I feel sure Grandma thinks that sermons and Sunday School lessons are the only things you can think truly religious thoughts about And when it comes to a difference of opinion between Grandma and teacher I don t know what to do In my heart Paul laid his hand on his breast and raised very serious blue eyes to Miss Lavendar s immediately sympathetic face I agree with teacher But then you see Grandma has brought father up HER way and made a brilliant success of him and teacher has never brought anybody up yet though she s helping with Davy and Dora But you can t tell how they ll turn out till they ARE grown up So sometimes I feel as if it might be safer to go by Grandma s opinions I think it would agreed Anne solemnly Anyway I daresay that if your Grandma and I both got down to what we really do mean under our different ways of expressing it we d find out we both meant much the same thing You d better go by her way of expressing it since it s been the result of experience We ll have to wait until we see how the twins do turn out before we can be sure that my way is equally good After lunch they went back to the garden where Paul made the acquaintance of the echoes to his wonder and delight while Anne and Miss Lavendar sat on the stone bench under the poplar and talked So you are going away in the fall said Miss Lavendar wistfully I ought to be glad for your sake Anne but I m horribly selfishly sorry I shall miss you so much Oh sometimes I think it is of no use to make friends They only go out of your life after awhile and leave a hurt that is worse than the emptiness before they came That sounds like something Miss Eliza Andrews might say but never Miss Lavendar said Anne NOTHING is worse than emptiness and I m not going out of your life There are such things as letters and vacations Dearest I m afraid you re looking a little pale and tired Oh hoo hoo hoo went Paul on the dyke where he had been making noises diligently not all of them melodious in the making but all coming back transmuted into the very gold and silver of sound by the fairy alchemists over the river Miss Lavendar made an impatient movement with her pretty hands I m just tired of everything even of the echoes There is nothing in my life but echoes echoes of lost hopes and dreams and joys They re beautiful and mocking Oh Anne it s horrid of me to talk like this when I have company It s just that I m getting old and it doesn t agree with me I know I ll be fearfully cranky by the time I m sixty But perhaps all I need is a course of blue pills At this moment Charlotta the Fourth who had disappeared after lunch returned and announced that the northeast corner of mister John Kimball s pasture was red with early strawberries and wouldn t Miss Shirley like to go and pick some Early strawberries for tea exclaimed Miss Lavendar Oh I m not so old as I thought and I don t need a single blue pill Girls when you come back with your strawberries we ll have tea out here under the silver poplar I ll have it all ready for you with home grown cream Anne and Charlotta the Fourth accordingly betook themselves back to mister Kimball s pasture a green remote place where the air was as soft as velvet and fragrant as a bed of violets and golden as amber Oh isn t it sweet and fresh back here breathed Anne I just feel as if I were drinking in the sunshine Yes ma am so do I That s just exactly how I feel too ma am agreed Charlotta the Fourth who would have said precisely the same thing if Anne had remarked that she felt like a pelican of the wilderness Always after Anne had visited Echo Lodge Charlotta the Fourth mounted to her little room over the kitchen and tried before her looking glass to speak and look and move like Anne Charlotta could never flatter herself that she quite succeeded but practice makes perfect as Charlotta had learned at school and she fondly hoped that in time she might catch the trick of that dainty uplift of chin that quick starry outflashing of eyes that fashion of walking as if you were a bough swaying in the wind It seemed so easy when you watched Anne Charlotta the Fourth admired Anne wholeheartedly It was not that she thought her so very handsome Diana Barry s beauty of crimson cheek and black curls was much more to Charlotta the Fourth s taste than Anne s moonshine charm of luminous gray eyes and the pale everchanging roses of her cheeks But I d rather look like you than be pretty she told Anne sincerely Anne laughed sipped the honey from the tribute and cast away the sting She was used to taking her compliments mixed Public opinion never agreed on Anne s looks People who had heard her called handsome met her and were disappointed People who had heard her called plain saw her and wondered where other people s eyes were Anne herself would never believe that she had any claim to beauty When she looked in the glass all she saw was a little pale face with seven freckles on the nose thereof Her mirror never revealed to her the elusive ever varying play of feeling that came and went over her features like a rosy illuminating flame or the charm of dream and laughter alternating in her big eyes While Anne was not beautiful in any strictly defined sense of the word she possessed a certain evasive charm and distinction of appearance that left beholders with a pleasurable sense of satisfaction in that softly rounded girlhood of hers with all its strongly felt potentialities Those who knew Anne best felt without realizing that they felt it that her greatest attraction was the aura of possibility surrounding her the power of future development that was in her She seemed to walk in an atmosphere of things about to happen As they picked Charlotta the Fourth confided to Anne her fears regarding Miss Lavendar The warm hearted little handmaiden was honestly worried over her adored mistress condition Miss Lavendar isn t well Miss Shirley ma am I m sure she isn t though she never complains She hasn t seemed like herself this long while ma am not since that day you and Paul were here together before I feel sure she caught cold that night ma am After you and him had gone she went out and walked in the garden for long after dark with nothing but a little shawl on her There was a lot of snow on the walks and I feel sure she got a chill ma am Ever since then I ve noticed her acting tired and lonesome like She don t seem to take an interest in anything ma am She never pretends company s coming nor fixes up for it nor nothing ma am It s only when you come she seems to chirk up a bit And the worst sign of all Miss Shirley ma am Charlotta the Fourth lowered her voice as if she were about to tell some exceedingly weird and awful symptom indeed is that she never gets cross now when I breaks things Why Miss Shirley ma am yesterday I bruk her green and yaller bowl that s always stood on the bookcase Her grandmother brought it out from England and Miss Lavendar was awful choice of it I was dusting it just as careful Miss Shirley ma am and it slipped out so fashion afore I could grab holt of it and bruk into about forty millyun pieces I tell you I was sorry and scared I thought Miss Lavendar would scold me awful ma am and I d ruther she had than take it the way she did She just come in and hardly looked at it and said It s no matter Charlotta Take up the pieces and throw them away Just like that Miss Shirley ma am take up the pieces and throw them away as if it wasn t her grandmother s bowl from England Oh she isn t well and I feel awful bad about it She s got nobody to look after her but me Charlotta the Fourth s eyes brimmed up with tears Anne patted the little brown paw holding the cracked pink cup sympathetically I think Miss Lavendar needs a change Charlotta She stays here alone too much Can t we induce her to go away for a little trip Charlotta shook her head with its rampant bows disconsolately I don t think so Miss Shirley ma am Miss Lavendar hates visiting She s only got three relations she ever visits and she says she just goes to see them as a family duty Last time when she come home she said she wasn t going to visit for family duty no more I ve come home in love with loneliness Charlotta she says to me and I never want to stray from my own vine and fig tree again My relations try so hard to make an old lady of me and it has a bad effect on me Just like that Miss Shirley ma am It has a very bad effect on me So I don t think it would do any good to coax her to go visiting We must see what can be done said Anne decidedly as she put the last possible berry in her pink cup Just as soon as I have my vacation I ll come through and spend a whole week with you We ll have a picnic every day and pretend all sorts of interesting things and see if we can t cheer Miss Lavendar up That will be the very thing Miss Shirley ma am exclaimed Charlotta the Fourth in rapture She was glad for Miss Lavendar s sake and for her own too With a whole week in which to study Anne constantly she would surely be able to learn how to move and behave like her When the girls got back to Echo Lodge they found that Miss Lavendar and Paul had carried the little square table out of the kitchen to the garden and had everything ready for tea Nothing ever tasted so delicious as those strawberries and cream eaten under a great blue sky all curdled over with fluffy little white clouds and in the long shadows of the wood with its lispings and its murmurings After tea Anne helped Charlotta wash the dishes in the kitchen while Miss Lavendar sat on the stone bench with Paul and heard all about his rock people She was a good listener this sweet Miss Lavendar but just at the last it struck Paul that she had suddenly lost interest in the Twin Sailors Miss Lavendar why do you look at me like that he asked gravely How do I look Paul Just as if you were looking through me at somebody I put you in mind of said Paul who had such occasional flashes of uncanny insight that it wasn t quite safe to have secrets when he was about You do put me in mind of somebody I knew long ago said Miss Lavendar dreamily When you were young Yes when I was young Do I seem very old to you Paul Do you know I can t make up my mind about that said Paul confidentially Your hair looks old I never knew a young person with white hair But your eyes are as young as my beautiful teacher s when you laugh I tell you what Miss Lavendar Paul s voice and face were as solemn as a judge s I think you would make a splendid mother You have just the right look in your eyes the look my little mother always had I think it s a pity you haven t any boys of your own I have a little dream boy Paul Oh have you really How old is he About your age I think He ought to be older because I dreamed him long before you were born But I ll never let him get any older than eleven or twelve because if I did some day he might grow up altogether and then I d lose him I know nodded Paul That s the beauty of dream people they stay any age you want them You and my beautiful teacher and me myself are the only folks in the world that I know of that have dream people Isn t it funny and nice we should all know each other But I guess that kind of people always find each other out Grandma never has dream people and Mary Joe thinks I m wrong in the upper story because I have them But I think it s splendid to have them YOU know Miss Lavendar Tell me all about your little dream boy He has blue eyes and curly hair He steals in and wakens me with a kiss every morning Then all day he plays here in the garden and I play with him Such games as we have We run races and talk with the echoes and I tell him stories And when twilight comes I know interrupted Paul eagerly He comes and sits beside you SO because of course at twelve he d be too big to climb into your lap and lays his head on your shoulder SO and you put your arms about him and hold him tight tight and rest your cheek on his head yes that s the very way Oh you DO know Miss Lavendar Anne found the two of them there when she came out of the stone house and something in Miss Lavendar s face made her hate to disturb them I m afraid we must go Paul if we want to get home before dark Miss Lavendar I m going to invite myself to Echo Lodge for a whole week pretty soon If you come for a week I ll keep you for two threatened Miss Lavendar XXVIII The Prince Comes Back to the Enchanted Palace The last day of school came and went A triumphant semi annual examination was held and Anne s pupils acquitted themselves splendidly At the close they gave her an address and a writing desk All the girls and ladies present cried and some of the boys had it cast up to them later on that they cried too although they always denied it missus Harmon Andrews missus Peter Sloane and missus William Bell walked home together and talked things over I do think it is such a pity Anne is leaving when the children seem so much attached to her sighed missus Peter Sloane who had a habit of sighing over everything and even finished off her jokes that way To be sure she added hastily we all know we ll have a good teacher next year too Jane will do her duty I ve no doubt said missus Andrews rather stiffly I don t suppose she ll tell the children quite so many fairy tales or spend so much time roaming about the woods with them But she has her name on the Inspector s Roll of Honor and the Newbridge people are in a terrible state over her leaving I m real glad Anne is going to college said missus Bell She has always wanted it and it will be a splendid thing for her Well I don t know missus Andrews was determined not to agree fully with anybody that day I don t see that Anne needs any more education She ll probably be marrying Gilbert Blythe if his infatuation for her lasts till he gets through college and what good will Latin and Greek do her then If they taught you at college how to manage a man there might be some sense in her going missus Harmon Andrews so Avonlea gossip whispered had never learned how to manage her man and as a result the Andrews household was not exactly a model of domestic happiness I see that the Charlottetown call to mister Allan is up before the Presbytery said missus Bell That means we ll be losing him soon I suppose They re not going before September said missus Sloane It will be a great loss to the community though I always did think that missus Allan dressed rather too gay for a minister s wife But we are none of us perfect Did you notice how neat and snug mister Harrison looked today I never saw such a changed man He goes to church every Sunday and has subscribed to the salary Hasn t that Paul Irving grown to be a big boy said missus Andrews He was such a mite for his age when he came here I declare I hardly knew him today He s getting to look a lot like his father He s a smart boy said missus Bell He s smart enough but missus Andrews lowered her voice I believe he tells queer stories Gracie came home from school one day last week with the greatest rigmarole he had told her about people who lived down at the shore stories there couldn t be a word of truth in you know I told Gracie not to believe them and she said Paul didn t intend her to But if he didn t what did he tell them to her for Anne says Paul is a genius said missus Sloane He may be You never know what to expect of them Americans said missus Andrews missus Andrews only acquaintance with the word genius was derived from the colloquial fashion of calling any eccentric individual a queer genius She probably thought with Mary Joe that it meant a person with something wrong in his upper story Back in the schoolroom Anne was sitting alone at her desk as she had sat on the first day of school two years before her face leaning on her hand her dewy eyes looking wistfully out of the window to the Lake of Shining Waters Her heart was so wrung over the parting with her pupils that for a moment college had lost all its charm She still felt the clasp of Annetta Bell s arms about her neck and heard the childish wail I ll NEVER love any teacher as much as you Miss Shirley never never For two years she had worked earnestly and faithfully making many mistakes and learning from them She had had her reward She had taught her scholars something but she felt that they had taught her much more lessons of tenderness self control innocent wisdom lore of childish hearts Perhaps she had not succeeded in inspiring any wonderful ambitions in her pupils but she had taught them more by her own sweet personality than by all her careful precepts that it was good and necessary in the years that were before them to live their lives finely and graciously holding fast to truth and courtesy and kindness keeping aloof from all that savored of falsehood and meanness and vulgarity They were perhaps all unconscious of having learned such lessons but they would remember and practice them long after they had forgotten the capital of Afghanistan and the dates of the Wars of the Roses Another chapter in my life is closed said Anne aloud as she locked her desk She really felt very sad over it but the romance in the idea of that closed chapter did comfort her a little Anne spent a fortnight at Echo Lodge early in her vacation and everybody concerned had a good time She took Miss Lavendar on a shopping expedition to town and persuaded her to buy a new organdy dress then came the excitement of cutting and making it together while the happy Charlotta the Fourth basted and swept up clippings Miss Lavendar had complained that she could not feel much interest in anything but the sparkle came back to her eyes over her pretty dress What a foolish frivolous person I must be she sighed I m wholesomely ashamed to think that a new dress even it is a forget me not organdy should exhilarate me so when a good conscience and an extra contribution to Foreign Missions couldn t do it Midway in her visit Anne went home to Green Gables for a day to mend the twins stockings and settle up Davy s accumulated store of questions In the evening she went down to the shore road to see Paul Irving As she passed by the low square window of the Irving sitting room she caught a glimpse of Paul on somebody s lap but the next moment he came flying through the hall Oh Miss Shirley he cried excitedly you can t think what has happened Something so splendid Father is here just think of that Father is here Come right in Father this is my beautiful teacher YOU know father Stephen Irving came forward to meet Anne with a smile He was a tall handsome man of middle age with iron gray hair deep set dark blue eyes and a strong sad face splendidly modeled about chin and brow Just the face for a hero of romance Anne thought with a thrill of intense satisfaction It was so disappointing to meet someone who ought to be a hero and find him bald or stooped or otherwise lacking in manly beauty Anne would have thought it dreadful if the object of Miss Lavendar s romance had not looked the part So this is my little son s beautiful teacher of whom I have heard so much said mister Irving with a hearty handshake Paul s letters have been so full of you Miss Shirley that I feel as if I were pretty well acquainted with you already I want to thank you for what you have done for Paul I think that your influence has been just what he needed Mother is one of the best and dearest of women but her robust matter of fact Scotch common sense could not always understand a temperament like my laddie s What was lacking in her you have supplied Between you I think Paul s training in these two past years has been as nearly ideal as a motherless boy s could be Everybody likes to be appreciated Under mister Irving s praise Anne s face burst flower like into rosy bloom and the busy weary man of the world looking at her thought he had never seen a fairer sweeter slip of girlhood than this little down east schoolteacher with her red hair and wonderful eyes Paul sat between them blissfully happy I never dreamed father was coming he said radiantly Even Grandma didn t know it It was a great surprise As a general thing Paul shook his brown curls gravely I don t like to be surprised You lose all the fun of expecting things when you re surprised But in a case like this it is all right Father came last night after I had gone to bed And after Grandma and Mary Joe had stopped being surprised he and Grandma came upstairs to look at me not meaning to wake me up till morning But I woke right up and saw father I tell you I just sprang at him With a hug like a bear s said mister Irving putting his arms around Paul s shoulder smilingly I hardly knew my boy he had grown so big and brown and sturdy I don t know which was the most pleased to see father Grandma or I continued Paul Grandma s been in kitchen all day making the things father likes to eat She wouldn t trust them to Mary Joe she says That s HER way of showing gladness I like best just to sit and talk to father But I m going to leave you for a little while now if you ll excuse me I must get the cows for Mary Joe That is one of my daily duties When Paul had scampered away to do his daily duty mister Irving talked to Anne of various matters But Anne felt that he was thinking of something else underneath all the time Presently it came to the surface In Paul s last letter he spoke of going with you to visit an old friend of mine Miss Lewis at the stone house in Grafton Do you know her well Yes indeed she is a very dear friend of mine was Anne s demure reply which gave no hint of the sudden thrill that tingled over her from head to foot at mister Irving s question Anne felt instinctively that romance was peeping at her around a corner mister Irving rose and went to the window looking out on a great golden billowing sea where a wild wind was harping For a few moments there was silence in the little dark walled room Then he turned and looked down into Anne s sympathetic face with a smile half whimsical half tender I wonder how much you know he said I know all about it replied Anne promptly You see she explained hastily Miss Lavendar and I are very intimate She wouldn t tell things of such a sacred nature to everybody We are kindred spirits Yes I believe you are Well I am going to ask a favor of you I would like to go and see Miss Lavendar if she will let me Will you ask her if I may come Would she not Oh indeed she would Yes this was romance the very the real thing with all the charm of rhyme and story and dream It was a little belated perhaps like a rose blooming in October which should have bloomed in June but none the less a rose all sweetness and fragrance with the gleam of gold in its heart Never did Anne s feet bear her on a more willing errand than on that walk through the beechwoods to Grafton the next morning She found Miss Lavendar in the garden Anne was fearfully excited Her hands grew cold and her voice trembled Miss Lavendar I have something to tell you something very important Can you guess what it is Anne never supposed that Miss Lavendar could GUESS but Miss Lavendar s face grew very pale and Miss Lavendar said in a quiet still voice from which all the color and sparkle that Miss Lavendar s voice usually suggested had faded Stephen Irving is home How did you know Who told you cried Anne disappointedly vexed that her great revelation had been anticipated Nobody I knew that must be it just from the way you spoke He wants to come and see you said Anne May I send him word that he may Yes of course fluttered Miss Lavendar There is no reason why he shouldn t He is only coming as any old friend might Anne had her own opinion about that as she hastened into the house to write a note at Miss Lavendar s desk Oh it s delightful to be living in a storybook she thought gaily It will come out all right of course it must and Paul will have a mother after his own heart and everybody will be happy But mister Irving will take Miss Lavendar away and dear knows what will happen to the little stone house and so there are two sides to it as there seems to be to everything in this world The important note was written and Anne herself carried it to the Grafton post office where she waylaid the mail carrier and asked him to leave it at the Avonlea office It s so very important Anne assured him anxiously The mail carrier was a rather grumpy old personage who did not at all look the part of a messenger of Cupid and Anne was none too certain that his memory was to be trusted But he said he would do his best to remember and she had to be contented with that Charlotta the Fourth felt that some mystery pervaded the stone house that afternoon a mystery from which she was excluded Miss Lavendar roamed about the garden in a distracted fashion Anne too seemed possessed by a demon of unrest and walked to and fro and went up and down Charlotta the Fourth endured it till patience ceased to be a virtue then she confronted Anne on the occasion of that romantic young person s third aimless peregrination through the kitchen Please Miss Shirley ma am said Charlotta the Fourth with an indignant toss of her very blue bows it s plain to be seen you and Miss Lavendar have got a secret and I think begging your pardon if I m too forward Miss Shirley ma am that it s real mean not to tell me when we ve all been such chums Oh Charlotta dear I d have told you all about it if it were my secret but it s Miss Lavendar s you see However I ll tell you this much and if nothing comes of it you must never breathe a word about it to a living soul You see Prince Charming is coming tonight He came long ago but in a foolish moment went away and wandered afar and forgot the secret of the magic pathway to the enchanted castle where the princess was weeping her faithful heart out for him But at last he remembered it again and the princess is waiting still because nobody but her own dear prince could carry her off Oh Miss Shirley ma am what is that in prose gasped the mystified Charlotta Anne laughed In prose an old friend of Miss Lavendar s is coming to see her tonight Do you mean an old beau of hers demanded the literal Charlotta That is probably what I do mean in prose answered Anne gravely It is Paul s father Stephen Irving And goodness knows what will come of it but let us hope for the best Charlotta I hope that he ll marry Miss Lavendar was Charlotta s unequivocal response Some women s intended from the start to be old maids and I m afraid I m one of them Miss Shirley ma am because I ve awful little patience with the men But Miss Lavendar never was And I ve been awful worried thinking what on earth she d do when I got so big I d HAVE to go to Boston There ain t any more girls in our family and dear knows what she d do if she got some stranger that might laugh at her pretendings and leave things lying round out of their place and not be willing to be called Charlotta the Fifth She might get someone who wouldn t be as unlucky as me in breaking dishes but she d never get anyone who d love her better And the faithful little handmaiden dashed to the oven door with a sniff They went through the form of having tea as usual that night at Echo Lodge but nobody really ate anything After tea Miss Lavendar went to her room and put on her new forget me not organdy while Anne did her hair for her Both were dreadfully excited but Miss Lavendar pretended to be very calm and indifferent I must really mend that rent in the curtain tomorrow she said anxiously inspecting it as if it were the only thing of any importance just then Those curtains have not worn as well as they should considering the price I paid Dear me Charlotta has forgotten to dust the stair railing AGAIN I really MUST speak to her about it Anne was sitting on the porch steps when Stephen Irving came down the lane and across the garden This is the one place where time stands still he said looking around him with delighted eyes There is nothing changed about this house or garden since I was here twenty five years ago It makes me feel young again You know time always does stand still in an enchanted palace said Anne seriously It is only when the prince comes that things begin to happen mister Irving smiled a little sadly into her uplifted face all astar with its youth and promise Sometimes the prince comes too late he said He did not ask Anne to translate her remark into prose Like all kindred spirits he understood Oh no not if he is the real prince coming to the true princess said Anne shaking her red head decidedly as she opened the parlor door When he had gone in she shut it tightly behind him and turned to confront Charlotta the Fourth who was in the hall all nods and becks and wreathed smiles Oh Miss Shirley ma am she breathed I peeked from the kitchen window and he s awful handsome and just the right age for Miss Lavendar And oh Miss Shirley ma am do you think it would be much harm to listen at the door It would be dreadful Charlotta said Anne firmly so just you come away with me out of the reach of temptation I can t do anything and it s awful to hang round just waiting sighed Charlotta What if he don t propose after all Miss Shirley ma am You can never be sure of them men My older sister Charlotta the First thought she was engaged to one once But it turned out HE had a different opinion and she says she ll never trust one of them again And I heard of another case where a man thought he wanted one girl awful bad when it was really her sister he wanted all the time When a man don t know his own mind Miss Shirley ma am how s a poor woman going to be sure of it We ll go to the kitchen and clean the silver spoons said Anne That s a task which won t require much thinking fortunately for I COULDN T think tonight And it will pass the time It passed an hour Then just as Anne laid down the last shining spoon they heard the front door shut Both sought comfort fearfully in each other s eyes Oh Miss Shirley ma am gasped Charlotta if he s going away this early there s nothing into it and never will be They flew to the window mister Irving had no intention of going away He and Miss Lavendar were strolling slowly down the middle path to the stone bench Oh Miss Shirley ma am he s got his arm around her waist whispered Charlotta the Fourth delightedly He must have proposed to her or she d never allow it Anne caught Charlotta the Fourth by her own plump waist and danced her around the kitchen until they were both out of breath Oh Charlotta she cried gaily I m neither a prophetess nor the daughter of a prophetess but I m going to make a prediction There ll be a wedding in this old stone house before the maple leaves are red Do you want that translated into prose Charlotta No I can understand that said Charlotta A wedding ain t poetry Why Miss Shirley ma am you re crying What for Oh because it s all so beautiful and story bookish and romantic and sad said Anne winking the tears out of her eyes It s all perfectly lovely but there s a little sadness mixed up in it too somehow Oh of course there s a resk in marrying anybody conceded Charlotta the Fourth but when all s said and done Miss Shirley ma am there s many a worse thing than a husband XXIX 
177-122839-0000	train-other-500	Poetry and Prose For the next month Anne lived in what for Avonlea might be called a whirl of excitement The preparation of her own modest outfit for Redmond was of secondary importance
177-122839-0001	train-other-500	Miss Lavendar was getting ready to be married and the stone house was the scene of endless consultations and plannings and discussions with Charlotta the Fourth hovering on the outskirts of things in agitated delight and wonder Then the dressmaker came
177-122839-0002	train-other-500	and there was the rapture and wretchedness of choosing fashions and being fitted Anne and Diana spent half their time at Echo Lodge and there were nights when Anne could not sleep for wondering whether she had done right in advising Miss Lavendar to select brown rather than navy blue for her traveling dress
none	none	 and to have her gray silk made princess 
177-122839-0003	train-other-500	Everybody concerned in Miss Lavendar s story was very happy
none	none	 Paul Irving rushed to Green Gables to talk the news over with Anne as soon as his father had told him 
177-122839-0004	train-other-500	I knew I could trust father to pick me out a nice little second mother he said proudly It s a fine thing to have a father you can depend on teacher I just love Miss Lavendar Grandma is pleased too She says she s real glad father didn t pick out an American for his second wife because
none	none	 although it turned out all right the first time such a thing wouldn t be likely to happen twice 
177-122839-0005	train-other-500	missus Lynde says she thoroughly approves of the match and thinks its likely Miss Lavendar will give up her queer notions and be like other people now that she s going to be married
none	none	 But I hope she won t give her queer notions up teacher because I like them And I don t want her to be like other people There are too many other people around as it is 
177-122839-0006	train-other-500	YOU know teacher Charlotta the Fourth was another radiant person Oh Miss Shirley ma am it has all turned out so beautiful
none	none	 When mister Irving and Miss Lavendar come back from their tower I m to go up to Boston and live with them and me only fifteen and the other girls never went till they were sixteen 
177-122839-0007	train-other-500	Ain t mister Irving splendid He just worships the ground she treads on and it makes me feel so queer sometimes to see the look in his eyes when he s watching her It beggars description Miss Shirley ma am I m awful thankful they re so fond of each other It s the best way when all s said and done
none	none	 though some folks can get along without it I ve got an aunt who has been married three times and says she married the first time for love and the last two times for strictly business 
177-122839-0008	train-other-500	and was happy with all three except at the times of the funerals But I think she took a resk Miss Shirley ma am Oh it s all so romantic breathed Anne to Marilla that night
none	none	 If I hadn t taken the wrong path that day we went to mister Kimball s I d never have known Miss Lavendar and if I hadn t met her I d never have taken Paul there and he d never have written to his father about visiting Miss Lavendar just as mister Irving was starting for San Francisco mister Irving says whenever he got that letter he made up his mind to send his partner to San Francisco and come here instead He hadn t heard anything of Miss Lavendar for fifteen years Somebody had told him then that she was to be married and he thought 
177-122839-0009	train-other-500	she was and never asked anybody anything about her And now everything has come right And I had a hand in bringing it about Perhaps as missus Lynde says
none	none	 everything is foreordained and it was bound to happen anyway 
177-122839-0010	train-other-500	But even so it s nice to think one was an instrument used by predestination Yes indeed it s very romantic I can t see that it s so terribly romantic at all said Marilla rather crisply
177-122839-0011	train-other-500	Marilla thought Anne was too worked up about it and had plenty to do with getting ready for college without traipsing to Echo Lodge two days out of three helping Miss Lavendar
none	none	 In the first place two young fools quarrel and turn sulky then Steve Irving goes to the States and after a spell gets married up there and is perfectly happy from all accounts Then his wife dies and after a decent interval he thinks he ll come home and see if his first fancy ll have him Meanwhile she s been living single probably because nobody nice enough came along to want her and they meet and agree to be married after all 
177-122839-0012	train-other-500	Now where is the romance in all that Oh there isn t any when you put it that way gasped Anne rather as if somebody had thrown cold water over her I suppose that s how it looks in prose
177-122839-0013	train-other-500	But it s very different if you look at it through poetry and I think it s nicer Anne recovered herself and her eyes shone and her cheeks flushed
none	none	 to look at it through poetry 
177-122839-0014	train-other-500	Marilla glanced at the radiant young face and refrained from further sarcastic comments Perhaps some realization came to her that after all it was better to have like Anne the vision and the faculty divine that gift
177-122839-0015	train-other-500	which the world cannot bestow or take away of looking at life through some transfiguring or revealing medium
none	none	 whereby everything seemed 
177-122839-0016	train-other-500	apparelled in celestial light wearing a glory and a freshness not visible to those who like herself and Charlotta the Fourth looked at things only through prose When s the wedding to be she asked after a pause The last Wednesday in August
none	none	 They are to be married in the garden under the honeysuckle trellis the very spot where mister Irving proposed to her twenty five years ago 
177-122839-0017	train-other-500	Marilla that IS romantic even in prose There s to be nobody there except missus Irving and Paul and Gilbert and Diana and I and Miss Lavendar s cousins
none	none	 And they will leave on the six o clock train for a trip to the Pacific coast When they come back in the fall Paul and Charlotta the Fourth are to go up to Boston to live with them But Echo Lodge is to be left just as it is only of course they ll sell the hens and cow and board up the windows and every summer they re coming down to live in it I m so glad It would have hurt me dreadfully next winter at Redmond to think of that dear stone house all stripped and deserted with empty rooms 
177-122839-0018	train-other-500	or far worse still with other people living in it
none	none	 But I can think of it now just as I ve always seen it 
177-122839-0019	train-other-500	waiting happily for the summer to bring life and laughter back to it again There was more romance in the world than that which had fallen to the share of the middle aged lovers of the stone house
177-122839-0020	train-other-500	Anne stumbled suddenly on it one evening when she went over to Orchard Slope by the wood cut and came out into the Barry garden Diana Barry and Fred Wright were standing together under the big willow Diana was leaning against the gray trunk her lashes cast down on very crimson cheeks
177-122839-0021	train-other-500	One hand was held by Fred who stood with his face bent toward her stammering something in low earnest tones There were no other people in the world except their two selves at that magic moment so neither of them saw Anne who after one
177-122839-0022	train-other-500	dazed glance of comprehension turned and sped noiselessly back through the spruce wood never stopping till she gained her own gable room where she sat breathlessly down by her window and tried to collect her scattered wits Diana and Fred are in love with each other
177-122839-0023	train-other-500	she gasped Oh it does seem so so so HOPELESSLY grown up Anne of late had not been without her suspicions that Diana was proving false to the melancholy Byronic hero of her early dreams
177-122839-0024	train-other-500	But as things seen are mightier than things heard or suspected the realization that it was actually so came to her with almost the shock of perfect surprise This was succeeded by a queer little lonely feeling
177-122839-0025	train-other-500	as if somehow Diana had gone forward into a new world shutting a gate behind her leaving Anne on the outside Things are changing so fast it almost frightens me Anne thought a little sadly And I m afraid
177-122839-0026	train-other-500	that this can t help making some difference between Diana and me I m sure I can t tell her all my secrets after this she might tell Fred And
none	none	 what CAN she see in Fred 
177-122839-0027	train-other-500	He s very nice and jolly but he s just Fred Wright It is always a very puzzling question what can somebody see in somebody else But how fortunate after all that it is so for if everybody saw alike well
177-122839-0028	train-other-500	in that case as the old Indian said Everybody would want my squaw It was plain that Diana DID see something in Fred Wright however Anne s eyes might be holden Diana came to Green Gables the next evening a pensive shy young lady
177-122839-0029	train-other-500	and told Anne the whole story in the dusky seclusion of the east gable Both girls cried and kissed and laughed I m so happy said Diana but it does seem ridiculous to think of me being engaged
none	none	 What is it really like to be engaged asked Anne curiously Well 
177-122839-0030	train-other-500	that all depends on who you re engaged to answered Diana with that
none	none	 maddening air of superior wisdom always assumed by those who are engaged over those who are not 
177-122839-0031	train-other-500	It s perfectly lovely to be engaged to Fred
none	none	 but I think it would be simply horrid to be engaged to anyone else 
177-122839-0032	train-other-500	There s not much comfort for the rest of us in that seeing that there is only one Fred laughed Anne Oh Anne you don t understand said Diana in vexation I didn t mean THAT it s so hard to explain
177-122839-0033	train-other-500	Never mind you ll understand sometime when your own turn comes Bless you dearest of Dianas I understand now What is an imagination for if not to enable you to peep at life through other people s eyes
177-122839-0034	train-other-500	You must be my bridesmaid you know Anne Promise me that wherever you may be when I m married
none	none	 I ll come from the ends of the earth if necessary 
177-122839-0035	train-other-500	promised Anne solemnly Of course it won t be for ever so long yet said Diana blushing Three years at the very least for I m only eighteen and mother says no daughter of hers shall be married before she s twenty one
177-122839-0036	train-other-500	Besides Fred s father is going to buy the Abraham Fletcher farm for him and he says he s got to have it two thirds paid for
none	none	 before he ll give it to him in his own name 
177-122839-0037	train-other-500	But three years isn t any too much time to get ready for housekeeping for I haven t a speck of fancy work made yet But I m going to begin crocheting doilies tomorrow
none	none	 Myra Gillis had thirty seven doilies when she was married and I m determined I shall have as many as she had 
177-122839-0038	train-other-500	I suppose it would be perfectly impossible to keep house with only thirty six doilies conceded Anne with a solemn face but dancing eyes Diana looked hurt I didn t think you d make fun of me Anne she said reproachfully Dearest I wasn t making fun of you
177-122839-0039	train-other-500	cried Anne repentantly I was only teasing you a bit I think you ll make the sweetest little housekeeper in the world And I think it s perfectly lovely of you to be planning already for your home o dreams
177-122839-0040	train-other-500	Anne had no sooner uttered the phrase home o dreams than it captivated her fancy and she immediately began the erection of one of her own It was of course tenanted by an ideal master dark proud and melancholy
none	none	 but oddly enough Gilbert Blythe persisted in hanging about too 
177-122839-0041	train-other-500	helping her arrange pictures lay out gardens and accomplish sundry other tasks which a proud and melancholy hero evidently considered beneath his dignity Anne tried to
177-122839-0042	train-other-500	banish Gilbert s image from her castle in Spain but somehow he went on being there so Anne being in a hurry gave up the attempt and pursued her aerial architecture with such success that her home o dreams was built and furnished before Diana spoke again
none	none	 I suppose Anne you must think it s funny I should like Fred so well when he s so different from the kind of man I ve always said I would marry 
177-122839-0043	train-other-500	the tall slender kind But somehow I wouldn t want Fred to be tall and slender because don t you see he wouldn t be Fred then Of course added Diana rather dolefully we will be a dreadfully pudgy couple
177-122839-0044	train-other-500	But after all that s better than one of us being short and fat and the other tall and lean like Morgan Sloane and his wife missus Lynde says it always makes her think of the long and short of it when she sees them together Well said Anne to herself that night as she brushed her hair before her gilt framed mirror
177-122839-0045	train-other-500	I am glad Diana is so happy and satisfied But when my turn comes if it ever does I do hope there ll be something a little more thrilling about it But then Diana thought so too once
none	none	 I ve heard her say time and again she d never get engaged any poky commonplace way he d HAVE to do something splendid to win her But she has changed Perhaps I ll change too But I won t and I m determined I won t Oh I think these engagements are dreadfully unsettling things when they happen to your intimate friends XXX A Wedding at the Stone House The last week in August came Miss Lavendar was to be married in it Two weeks later Anne and Gilbert would leave for Redmond College In a week s time missus Rachel Lynde would move to Green Gables and set up her lares and penates in the erstwhile spare room which was already prepared for her coming She had sold all her superfluous household plenishings by auction and was at present reveling in the congenial occupation of helping the Allans pack up mister Allan was to preach his farewell sermon the next Sunday The old order was changing rapidly to give place to the new as Anne felt with a little sadness threading all her excitement and happiness Changes ain t totally pleasant but they re excellent things said mister Harrison philosophically Two years is about long enough for things to stay exactly the same If they stayed put any longer they might grow mossy mister Harrison was smoking on his veranda His wife had self sacrificingly told that he might smoke in the house if he took care to sit by an open window mister Harrison rewarded this concession by going outdoors altogether to smoke in fine weather and so mutual goodwill reigned Anne had come over to ask missus Harrison for some of her yellow dahlias She and Diana were going through to Echo Lodge that evening to help Miss Lavendar and Charlotta the Fourth with their final preparations for the morrow s bridal Miss Lavendar herself never had dahlias she did not like them and they would not have suited the fine retirement of her old fashioned garden But flowers of any kind were rather scarce in Avonlea and the neighboring districts that summer thanks to Uncle Abe s storm and Anne and Diana thought that a certain old cream colored stone jug usually kept sacred to doughnuts brimmed over with yellow dahlias would be just the thing to set in a dim angle of the stone house stairs against the dark background of red hall paper I s pose you ll be starting off for college in a fortnight s time continued mister Harrison Well we re going to miss you an awful lot Emily and me To be sure missus Lynde ll be over there in your place There ain t nobody but a substitute can be found for them The irony of mister Harrison s tone is quite untransferable to paper In spite of his wife s intimacy with missus Lynde the best that could be said of the relationship between her and mister Harrison even under the new regime was that they preserved an armed neutrality Yes I m going said Anne I m very glad with my head and very sorry with my heart I s pose you ll be scooping up all the honors that are lying round loose at Redmond I may try for one or two of them confessed Anne but I don t care so much for things like that as I did two years ago What I want to get out of my college course is some knowledge of the best way of living life and doing the most and best with it I want to learn to understand and help other people and myself mister Harrison nodded That s the idea exactly That s what college ought to be for instead of for turning out a lot of B A s so chock full of book learning and vanity that there ain t room for anything else You re all right College won t be able to do you much harm I reckon Diana and Anne drove over to Echo Lodge after tea taking with them all the flowery spoil that several predatory expeditions in their own and their neighbors gardens had yielded They found the stone house agog with excitement Charlotta the Fourth was flying around with such vim and briskness that her blue bows seemed really to possess the power of being everywhere at once Like the helmet of Navarre Charlotta s blue bows waved ever in the thickest of the fray Praise be to goodness you ve come she said devoutly for there s heaps of things to do and the frosting on that cake WON T harden and there s all the silver to be rubbed up yet and the horsehair trunk to be packed and the roosters for the chicken salad are running out there beyant the henhouse yet crowing Miss Shirley ma am And Miss Lavendar ain t to be trusted to do a thing I was thankful when mister Irving came a few minutes ago and took her off for a walk in the woods Courting s all right in its place Miss Shirley ma am but if you try to mix it up with cooking and scouring everything s spoiled That s MY opinion Miss Shirley ma am Anne and Diana worked so heartily that by ten o clock even Charlotta the Fourth was satisfied She braided her hair in innumerable plaits and took her weary little bones off to bed But I m sure I shan t sleep a blessed wink Miss Shirley ma am for fear that something ll go wrong at the last minute the cream won t whip or mister Irving ll have a stroke and not be able to come He isn t in the habit of having strokes is he asked Diana the dimpled corners of her mouth twitching To Diana Charlotta the Fourth was if not exactly a thing of beauty certainly a joy forever They re not things that go by habit said Charlotta the Fourth with dignity They just HAPPEN and there you are ANYBODY can have a stroke You don t have to learn how mister Irving looks a lot like an uncle of mine that had one once just as he was sitting down to dinner one day But maybe everything ll go all right In this world you ve just got to hope for the best and prepare for the worst and take whatever God sends The only thing I m worried about is that it won t be fine tomorrow said Diana Uncle Abe predicted rain for the middle of the week and ever since the big storm I can t help believing there s a good deal in what Uncle Abe says Anne who knew better than Diana just how much Uncle Abe had to do with the storm was not much disturbed by this She slept the sleep of the just and weary and was roused at an unearthly hour by Charlotta the Fourth Oh Miss Shirley ma am it s awful to call you so early came wailing through the keyhole but there s so much to do yet and oh Miss Shirley ma am I m skeered it s going to rain and I wish you d get up and tell me you think it ain t Anne flew to the window hoping against hope that Charlotta the Fourth was saying this merely by way of rousing her effectually But alas the morning did look unpropitious Below the window Miss Lavendar s garden which should have been a glory of pale virgin sunshine lay dim and windless and the sky over the firs was dark with moody clouds Isn t it too mean said Diana We must hope for the best said Anne determinedly If it only doesn t actually rain a cool pearly gray day like this would really be nicer than hot sunshine But it will rain mourned Charlotta creeping into the room a figure of fun with her many braids wound about her head the ends tied up with white thread sticking out in all directions It ll hold off till the last minute and then pour cats and dogs And all the folks will get sopping and track mud all over the house and they won t be able to be married under the honeysuckle and it s awful unlucky for no sun to shine on a bride say what you will Miss Shirley ma am I knew things were going too well to last Charlotta the Fourth seemed certainly to have borrowed a leaf out of Miss Eliza Andrews book It did not rain though it kept on looking as if it meant to By noon the rooms were decorated the table beautifully laid and upstairs was waiting a bride adorned for her husband You do look sweet said Anne rapturously Lovely echoed Diana Everything s ready Miss Shirley ma am and nothing dreadful has happened YET was Charlotta s cheerful statement as she betook herself to her little back room to dress Out came all the braids the resultant rampant crinkliness was plaited into two tails and tied not with two bows alone but with four of brand new ribbon brightly blue The two upper bows rather gave the impression of overgrown wings sprouting from Charlotta s neck somewhat after the fashion of Raphael s cherubs But Charlotta the Fourth thought them very beautiful and after she had rustled into a white dress so stiffly starched that it could stand alone she surveyed herself in her glass with great satisfaction a satisfaction which lasted until she went out in the hall and caught a glimpse through the spare room door of a tall girl in some softly clinging gown pinning white star like flowers on the smooth ripples of her ruddy hair Oh I ll NEVER be able to look like Miss Shirley thought poor Charlotta despairingly You just have to be born so I guess don t seem s if any amount of practice could give you that AIR By one o clock the guests had come including mister and missus Allan for mister Allan was to perform the ceremony in the absence of the Grafton minister on his vacation There was no formality about the marriage Miss Lavendar came down the stairs to meet her bridegroom at the foot and as he took her hand she lifted her big brown eyes to his with a look that made Charlotta the Fourth who intercepted it feel queerer than ever They went out to the honeysuckle arbor where mister Allan was awaiting them The guests grouped themselves as they pleased Anne and Diana stood by the old stone bench with Charlotta the Fourth between them desperately clutching their hands in her cold tremulous little paws mister Allan opened his blue book and the ceremony proceeded Just as Miss Lavendar and Stephen Irving were pronounced man and wife a very beautiful and symbolic thing happened The sun suddenly burst through the gray and poured a flood of radiance on the happy bride Instantly the garden was alive with dancing shadows and flickering lights What a lovely omen thought Anne as she ran to kiss the bride Then the three girls left the rest of the guests laughing around the bridal pair while they flew into the house to see that all was in readiness for the feast Thanks be to goodness it s over Miss Shirley ma am breathed Charlotta the Fourth and they re married safe and sound no matter what happens now The bags of rice are in the pantry ma am and the old shoes are behind the door and the cream for whipping is on the sullar steps At half past two mister and missus Irving left and everybody went to Bright River to see them off on the afternoon train As Miss Lavendar I beg her pardon missus Irving stepped from the door of her old home Gilbert and the girls threw the rice and Charlotta the Fourth hurled an old shoe with such excellent aim that she struck mister Allan squarely on the head But it was reserved for Paul to give the prettiest send off He popped out of the porch ringing furiously a huge old brass dinner bell which had adorned the dining room mantel Paul s only motive was to make a joyful noise but as the clangor died away from point and curve and hill across the river came the chime of fairy wedding bells ringing clearly sweetly faintly and more faint as if Miss Lavendar s beloved echoes were bidding her greeting and farewell And so amid this benediction of sweet sounds Miss Lavendar drove away from the old life of dreams and make believes to a fuller life of realities in the busy world beyond Two hours later Anne and Charlotta the Fourth came down the lane again Gilbert had gone to West Grafton on an errand and Diana had to keep an engagement at home Anne and Charlotta had come back to put things in order and lock up the little stone house The garden was a pool of late golden sunshine with butterflies hovering and bees booming but the little house had already that indefinable air of desolation which always follows a festivity Oh dear me don t it look lonesome sniffed Charlotta the Fourth who had been crying all the way home from the station A wedding ain t much cheerfuller than a funeral after all when it s all over Miss Shirley ma am A busy evening followed The decorations had to be removed the dishes washed the uneaten delicacies packed into a basket for the delectation of Charlotta the Fourth s young brothers at home Anne would not rest until everything was in apple pie order after Charlotta had gone home with her plunder Anne went over the still rooms feeling like one who trod alone some banquet hall deserted and closed the blinds Then she locked the door and sat down under the silver poplar to wait for Gilbert feeling very tired but still unweariedly thinking long long thoughts What are you thinking of Anne asked Gilbert coming down the walk He had left his horse and buggy out at the road Of Miss Lavendar and mister Irving answered Anne dreamily Isn t it beautiful to think how everything has turned out how they have come together again after all the years of separation and misunderstanding Yes it s beautiful said Gilbert looking steadily down into Anne s uplifted face but wouldn t it have been more beautiful still Anne if there had been NO separation or misunderstanding if they had come hand in hand all the way through life with no memories behind them but those which belonged to each other For a moment Anne s heart fluttered queerly and for the first time her eyes faltered under Gilbert s gaze and a rosy flush stained the paleness of her face It was as if a veil that had hung before her inner consciousness had been lifted giving to her view a revelation of unsuspected feelings and realities Perhaps after all romance did not come into one s life with pomp and blare like a gay knight riding down perhaps it crept to one s side like an old friend through quiet ways perhaps it revealed itself in seeming prose until some sudden shaft of illumination flung athwart its pages betrayed the rhythm and the music perhaps perhaps love unfolded naturally out of a beautiful friendship as a golden hearted rose slipping from its green sheath Then the veil dropped again but the Anne who walked up the dark lane was not quite the same Anne who had driven gaily down it the evening before The page of girlhood had been turned as by an unseen finger and the page of womanhood was before her with all its charm and mystery its pain and gladness Gilbert wisely said nothing more but in his silence he read the history of the next four years in the light of Anne s remembered blush Four years of earnest happy work and then the guerdon of a useful knowledge gained and a sweet heart won Behind them in the garden the little stone house brooded among the shadows It was lonely but not forsaken It had not yet done with dreams and laughter and the joy of life there were to be future summers for the little stone house meanwhile it could wait And over the river in purple durance the echoes bided their time Note The correct words were obtained from the L C Page Company Inc edition of this book copyright nineteen oh nine Thirteenth Impression April nineteen eleven Italic emphases
