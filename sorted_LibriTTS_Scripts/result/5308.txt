1018_133447_000005_000000	train-clean-360	American tourists sure appreciators of all that is ancient and picturesque in England invariably come to a halt holding their breath in a sudden catch of wonder as they pass through the half ruinous gateway which admits to the Close of Wrychester 
1018_133447_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Nowhere else in England is there a fairer prospect of old world peace 
1018_133447_000005_000002	train-clean-360	There before their eyes set in the centre of a great green sward fringed by tall elms and giant beeches rises the vast fabric of the thirteenth century Cathedral its high spire piercing the skies in which rooks are for ever circling and calling 
1018_133447_000005_000003	train-clean-360	The time worn stone at a little distance delicate as lacework is transformed at different hours of the day into shifting shades of colour varying from grey to purple the massiveness of the great nave and transepts contrasts impressively with the gradual tapering of the spire rising so high above turret and clerestory that it at last becomes a mere line against the ether 
1018_133447_000005_000004	train-clean-360	In morning as in afternoon or in evening here is a perpetual atmosphere of rest and not around the great church alone but in the quaint and ancient houses which fence in the Close 
476_133471_000061_000001	train-clean-360	 here 
none	none	is a perpetual atmosphere of rest and not around the great church alone but in the quaint and ancient houses which fence in the Close Little less old than the mighty mass of stone on which their ivy framed windows look these houses make the casual observer feel that here if anywhere in the world life must needs run smoothly Under those high gables behind those mullioned windows in the beautiful old gardens lying between the stone porches and the elm shadowed lawn nothing one would think could possibly exist but leisured and pleasant existence even the busy streets of the old city outside the crumbling gateway seem for the moment far off In one of the oldest of these houses half hidden behind trees and shrubs in a corner of the Close three people sat at breakfast one fine May morning The room in which they sat was in keeping with the old house and its surroundings a long low ceilinged room with oak panelling around its walls and oak beams across its roof a room of old furniture and old pictures and old books its antique atmosphere relieved by great masses of flowers set here and there in old china bowls through its wide windows the casements of which were thrown wide open there was an inviting prospect of a high edged flower garden and seen in vistas through the trees and shrubberies of patches of the west front of the Cathedral now sombre and grey in shadow But on the garden and into this flower scented room the sun was shining gaily through the trees and making gleams of light on the silver and china on the table and on the faces of the three people who sat around it Of these three two were young and the third was one of those men whose age it is
476_133471_000071_000001	train-clean-360	 never 
none	none	easy to guess a tall clean shaven bright eyed alert looking man good looking in a clever professional sort of way a man whom no one could have taken for anything but a member of one of the learned callings 
1018_133447_000007_000001	train-clean-360	In some lights he looked no more than forty a strong light betrayed the fact that his dark hair had a streak of grey in it and was showing a tendency to whiten about the temples 
1018_133447_000007_000002	train-clean-360	A strong intellectually superior man this scrupulously groomed and well dressed as befitted what he really was a medical practitioner with an excellent connection amongst the exclusive society of a cathedral town 
1018_133447_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 what 
1018_133447_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 what 
476_133471_000071_000005	train-clean-360	what 
none	none	he really was a medical practitioner with an excellent connection amongst the exclusive society of a cathedral town Around him hung an undeniable air of content and prosperity as he turned over a pile of letters which stood by his plate or glanced at the morning newspaper which lay at his elbow it was easy to see that he had no cares beyond those of the day and that they so far as he knew then were not likely to affect him greatly Seeing him in these pleasant domestic circumstances at the head of his table with abundant evidences of comfort and refinement and modest luxury about him any one would have said without hesitation that doctor Mark Ransford was undeniably one of the fortunate folk of this world 
1018_133447_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The second person of the three was a boy of apparently seventeen a well built handsome lad of the senior schoolboy type who was devoting himself in business like fashion to two widely differing pursuits one the consumption of eggs and bacon and dry toast the other the study of a Latin textbook which he had propped up in front of him against the old fashioned silver cruet 
1018_133447_000008_000001	train-clean-360	His quick eyes wandered alternately between his book and his plate now and then he muttered a line or two to himself 
none	none	His companions took no notice of these combinations of eating and learning they knew from experience that it was his way to make up at breakfast time for the moments he had stolen from his studies the night before 
1018_133447_000009_000000	train-clean-360	It was not difficult to see that the third member of the party a girl of nineteen or twenty was the boy s sister 
1018_133447_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Each had a wealth of brown hair inclining in the girl s case to a shade that had tints of gold in it each had grey eyes in which there was a mixture of blue each had a bright vivid colour each was undeniably good looking and eminently healthy 
none	none	No one would have doubted that both had lived a good deal of an open air existence the boy was already muscular and sinewy the girl looked as if she was well acquainted with the tennis racket and the golf stick Nor would any one have made the mistake of thinking that these two were blood relations of the man at the head of the table between them and him there was not the least resemblance of feature of colour or of manner 
1018_133447_000010_000000	train-clean-360	While the boy learnt the last lines of his Latin and the doctor turned over the newspaper the girl read a letter evidently from the large sprawling handwriting the missive of some girlish correspondent 
1018_133447_000010_000001	train-clean-360	She was deep in it when from one of the turrets of the Cathedral a bell began to ring 
1018_133447_000010_000002	train-clean-360	At that she glanced at her brother 
none	none	There s Martin Dick she said
1018_133447_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 You ll have to hurry 
none	none	Many a long year before that in one of the bygone centuries a worthy citizen of Wrychester Martin by name had left a sum of money to the Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral on condition that as long as ever the Cathedral stood they should cause to be rung a bell from its smaller bell tower for three minutes before nine o clock every morning all the year round What Martin s object had been no one now knew but this bell served to remind young gentlemen going to offices and boys going to school that the hour of their servitude was near 
1018_133447_000012_000002	train-clean-360	And Dick Bewery without a word bolted half his coffee snatched up his book grabbed at a cap which lay with more books on a chair close by and vanished through the open window 
1018_133447_000012_000003	train-clean-360	The doctor laughed laid aside his newspaper and handed his cup across the table 
1018_133447_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t think you need bother yourself about Dick s ever being late Mary he said 
none	none	You are not quite aware of the power of legs that are only seventeen years old 
1018_133447_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Dick could get to any given point in just about one fourth of the time that I could for instance moreover he has a cunning knowledge of every short cut in the city 
1018_133447_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Mary Bewery took the empty cup and began to refill it 
1018_133447_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t like him to be late she remarked 
1018_133447_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 It s the beginning of bad habits 
none	none	Oh well said Ransford indulgently
1018_133447_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 He s pretty free from anything of that sort you know 
1018_133447_000016_000002	train-clean-360	I haven t even suspected him of smoking yet 
1018_133447_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 That s because he thinks smoking would stop his growth and interfere with his cricket answered Mary 
1018_133447_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 He would smoke if it weren t for that 
1018_133447_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 That s giving him high praise then said Ransford 
1018_133447_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 You couldn t give him higher 
none	none	Know how to repress his inclinations 
1018_133447_000018_000003	train-clean-360	An excellent thing and most unusual I fancy 
1018_133447_000018_000004	train-clean-360	Most people don t 
1018_133447_000019_000000	train-clean-360	He took his refilled cup rose from the table and opened a box of cigarettes which stood on the mantelpiece 
1018_133447_000019_000001	train-clean-360	And the girl instead of picking up her letter again glanced at him a little doubtfully 
1018_133447_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 That reminds me of of something I wanted to say to you she said You re quite right about people not repressing their inclinations 
1018_133447_000020_000001	train-clean-360	I I wish some people would 
1018_133447_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Ransford turned quickly from the hearth and gave her a sharp look beneath which her colour heightened 
1018_133447_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Her eyes shifted their gaze away to her letter and she picked it up and began to fold it nervously 
none	none	And at that Ransford rapped out a name putting a quick suggestion of meaning inquiry into his voice
1018_133447_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Bryce he asked 
1018_133447_000023_000000	train-clean-360	The girl nodded her face showing distinct annoyance and dislike 
1018_133447_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Before saying more Ransford lighted a cigarette 
none	none	Been at it again he said at last
1018_133447_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 Since last time 
1018_133447_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Twice she answered 
1018_133447_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 I didn t like to tell you I ve hated to bother you about it 
1018_133447_000025_000002	train-clean-360	But what am I to do 
1018_133447_000025_000003	train-clean-360	I dislike him intensely I can t tell why but it s there and nothing could ever alter the feeling And though I told him before that it was useless he mentioned it again yesterday at missus Folliot s garden party 
1018_133447_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Confound his impudence growled Ransford 
none	none	Oh well I ll have to settle with him myself 
1018_133447_000026_000002	train-clean-360	It s useless trifling with anything like that 
1018_133447_000026_000003	train-clean-360	I gave him a quiet hint before 
1018_133447_000026_000004	train-clean-360	And since he won t take it all right 
1018_133447_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 But what shall you do she asked anxiously 
1018_133447_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 Not send him away 
none	none	If he s any decency about him he ll go after what I say to him answered Ransford
1018_133447_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 Don t you trouble yourself about it I m not at all keen about him 
1018_133447_000028_000002	train-clean-360	He s a clever enough fellow and a good assistant but I don t like him personally never did 
1018_133447_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t want to think that anything that I say should lose him his situation or whatever you call it she remarked slowly 
1018_133447_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 That would seem 
1018_133447_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 No need to bother interrupted Ransford 
1018_133447_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 He ll get another in two minutes so to speak 
none	none	Anyway we can t have this going on 
1018_133447_000030_000003	train-clean-360	The fellow must be an ass 
1018_133447_000030_000004	train-clean-360	When I was young 
1018_133447_000031_000000	train-clean-360	He stopped short at that and turning away looked out across the garden as if some recollection had suddenly struck him 
1018_133447_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 When you were young which is of course such an awfully long time since said the girl a little teasingly 
none	none	What
1018_133447_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Only that if a woman said No unmistakably once a man took it as final replied Ransford 
1018_133447_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 At least so I was always given to believe Nowadays 
1018_133447_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 You forget that mister Pemberton Bryce is what most people would call a very pushing young man said Mary 
none	none	If he doesn t get what he wants in this world it won t be for not asking for it 
1018_133447_000034_000002	train-clean-360	But if you must speak to him and I really think you must will you tell him that he is not going to get me 
1018_133447_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Perhaps he ll take it finally from you as my guardian 
1018_133447_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know if parents and guardians count for much in these degenerate days said Ransford 
1018_133447_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 But I won t have him annoying you And I suppose it has come to annoyance 
none	none	It s very annoying to be asked three times by a man whom you ve told flatly once for all that you don t want him at any time ever she answered
1018_133447_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 It s irritating 
1018_133447_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 All right said Ransford quietly 
1018_133447_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll speak to him 
1018_133447_000037_000002	train-clean-360	There s going to be no annoyance for you under this roof 
1018_133447_000038_000000	train-clean-360	The girl gave him a quick glance and Ransford turned away from her and picked up his letters 
1018_133447_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you she said 
1018_133447_000057_000002	train-clean-360	Thank you 
none	none	she said
1018_133447_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 But there s no need to tell me that because I know it already 
1018_133447_000039_000002	train-clean-360	Now I wonder if you ll tell me something more 
1018_133447_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Ransford turned back with a sudden apprehension 
1018_133447_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Well he asked brusquely 
none	none	What
1018_133447_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 When are you going to tell me all about Dick and myself she asked You promised that you would you know some day 
1018_133447_000042_000001	train-clean-360	And a whole year s gone by since then 
1018_133447_000042_000002	train-clean-360	And Dick s seventeen 
none	none	He won t be satisfied always just to know no more than that our father and mother died when we were very little and that you ve been guardian and all that you have been to us 
1018_133447_000042_000004	train-clean-360	Will he now 
1018_133447_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Ransford laid down his letters again and thrusting his hands in his pockets squared his shoulders against the mantelpiece 
none	none	Don t you think you might wait until you re twenty one he asked Why she said with a laugh
1018_133447_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 I m just twenty do you really think I shall be any wiser in twelve months 
1018_133447_000044_000002	train-clean-360	Of course I shan t 
1018_133447_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 You don t know that he replied 
1018_133447_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 You may be a great deal wiser 
1018_133447_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 But what has that got to do with it she persisted 
none	none	Is there any reason why I shouldn t be told everything 
1018_133447_000047_000000	train-clean-360	She was looking at him with a certain amount of demand and Ransford who had always known that some moment of this sort must inevitably come felt that she was not going to be put off with ordinary excuses 
1018_133447_000047_000001	train-clean-360	He hesitated and she went on speaking 
1018_133447_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 You know she continued almost pleadingly 
1018_133447_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 We don t know anything at all 
none	none	I never have known and until lately Dick has been too young to care Has he begun asking questions demanded Ransford hastily
1018_133447_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Once or twice lately yes replied Mary 
1018_133447_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 It s only natural She laughed a little a forced laugh 
1018_133447_000050_000002	train-clean-360	 They say she went on that it doesn t matter nowadays if you can t tell who your grandfather was but just think we don t know who our father was except that his name was John Bewery 
1018_133447_000050_000003	train-clean-360	That doesn t convey much 
none	none	You know more said Ransford
1018_133447_000051_000001	train-clean-360	 I told you always have told you that he was an early friend of mine a man of business who with your mother died young and I as their friend became guardian to you and Dick 
1018_133447_000051_000002	train-clean-360	Is is there anything much more that I could tell 
1018_133447_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 There s something I should very much like to know personally she answered after a pause which lasted so long that Ransford began to feel uncomfortable under it 
1018_133447_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 Don t be angry or hurt if I tell you plainly what it is 
none	none	I m quite sure it s never even occurred to Dick but I m three years ahead of him 
1018_133447_000052_000003	train-clean-360	It s this have we been dependent on you 
1018_133447_000053_000000	train-clean-360	Ransford s face flushed and he turned deliberately to the window and for a moment stood staring out on his garden and the glimpses of the Cathedral 
1018_133447_000053_000001	train-clean-360	And just as deliberately as he had turned away he turned back 
1018_133447_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 No he said 
1018_133447_000054_000001	train-clean-360	 Since you ask me I ll tell you that 
1018_133447_000054_000002	train-clean-360	You ve both got money due to you when you re of age 
1018_133447_000054_000003	train-clean-360	It it s in my hands 
1018_133447_000054_000004	train-clean-360	Not a great lot but sufficient to to cover all your expenses Education everything 
none	none	When you re twenty one I ll hand over yours when Dick s twenty one his 
1018_133447_000054_000006	train-clean-360	Perhaps I ought to have told you all that before but I didn t think it necessary 
1018_133447_000054_000007	train-clean-360	I I dare say I ve a tendency to let things slide 
1018_133447_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 You ve never let things slide about us she replied quickly with a sudden glance which made him turn away again 
1018_133447_000055_000001	train-clean-360	 And I only wanted to know because I d got an idea that well that we were owing everything to you 
1018_133447_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Not from me he exclaimed 
none	none	No that would never be she said
1018_133447_000057_000001	train-clean-360	 But don t you understand I wanted to know something 
none	none	Thank you 
1018_133447_000057_000003	train-clean-360	I won t ask more now 
1018_133447_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 I ve always meant to tell you a good deal remarked Ransford after another pause 
1018_133447_000058_000001	train-clean-360	 You see I can scarcely yet realize that you re both growing up 
1018_133447_000058_000002	train-clean-360	You were at school a year ago 
1018_133447_000058_000003	train-clean-360	And Dick is still very young Are are you more satisfied now he went on anxiously 
1018_133447_000058_000004	train-clean-360	 If not 
1018_133447_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 I m quite satisfied she answered 
1018_133447_000059_000001	train-clean-360	 Perhaps some day you ll tell me more about our father and mother but never mind even that now 
1018_133447_000059_000002	train-clean-360	You re sure you haven t minded my asking what I have asked 
1018_133447_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course not of course not he said hastily 
none	none	I ought to have remembered 
1018_133447_000060_000002	train-clean-360	And but we ll talk again 
1018_133447_000060_000003	train-clean-360	I must get into the surgery and have a word with Bryce too 
none	none	If you could only make him see reason and promise not to offend again she said
1018_133447_000061_000001	train-clean-360	 Wouldn t that solve the difficulty 
1018_133447_000062_000000	train-clean-360	Ransford shook his head and made no answer 
none	none	He picked up his letters again and went out and down a long stone walled passage which led to his surgery at the side of the house 
1018_133447_000062_000002	train-clean-360	He was alone there when he had shut the door and he relieved his feelings with a deep groan 
1018_133447_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Heaven help me if the lad ever insists on the real truth and on having proofs and facts given to him he muttered 
1018_133447_000063_000001	train-clean-360	 I shouldn t mind telling her when she s a bit older but he wouldn t understand as she would Anyway thank God I can keep up the pleasant fiction about the money without her ever knowing that I told her a deliberate lie just now But what s in the future 
1018_133447_000063_000002	train-clean-360	Here s one man to be dismissed already and there ll be others and one of them will be the favoured man 
1018_133447_000063_000003	train-clean-360	That man will have to be told 
1018_133447_000063_000004	train-clean-360	And so will she then 
none	none	And my God she doesn t see and mustn t see that I m madly in love with her myself 
1018_133447_000063_000006	train-clean-360	She s no idea of it and she shan t have I must must continue to be only the guardian 
none	none	He laughed a little cynically as he laid his letters down on his desk and proceeded to open them in which occupation he was presently interrupted by the opening of the side door and the entrance of mister Pemberton Bryce CHAPTER II MAKING AN ENEMY It was characteristic of Pemberton Bryce that he always walked into a room as if its occupant were asleep and he was afraid of waking him He had a gentle step which was soft without being stealthy and quiet movements which brought him suddenly to anybody s side before his presence was noticed He was by Ransford s desk ere Ransford knew he was in the surgery and Ransford s sudden realization of his presence roused a certain feeling of irritation in his mind which he instantly endeavoured to suppress it was no use getting cross with a man of whom you were about to rid yourself he said to himself And for the moment after replying to his assistant s greeting a greeting as quiet as his entrance he went on reading his letters and Bryce turned off to that part of the surgery in which the drugs were kept and busied himself in making up some prescription Ten minutes went by in silence then Ransford pushed his correspondence aside laid a paper weight on it and twisting his chair round looked at the man to whom he was going to say some unpleasant things Within himself he was revolving a question how would Bryce take it He had never liked this assistant of his although he had then had him in employment for nearly two years There was something about Pemberton Bryce which he did not understand and could not fathom He had come to him with excellent testimonials and good recommendations he was well up to his work successful with patients thoroughly capable as a general practitioner there was no fault to be found with him on any professional grounds But to Ransford his personality was objectionable why he was not quite sure Outwardly Bryce was rather more than presentable a tall good looking man of twenty eight or thirty whom some people women especially would call handsome he was the sort of young man who knows the value of good clothes and a smart appearance and his professional manner was all that could be desired But Ransford could not help distinguishing between Bryce the doctor and Bryce the man and Bryce the man he did not like Outside the professional part of him Bryce seemed to him to be undoubtedly deep sly cunning he conveyed the impression of being one of those men whose ears are always on the stretch who take everything in and give little out There was a curious air of watchfulness and of secrecy about him in private matters which was as repellent to Ransford s thinking as it was hard to explain Anyway in private affairs he did not like his assistant and he liked him less than ever as he glanced at him on this particular occasion I want a word with you he said curtly I d better say it now Bryce who was slowly pouring some liquid from one bottle into another looked quietly across the room and did not interrupt himself in his work Ransford knew that he must have recognized a certain significance in the words just addressed to him but he showed no outward sign of it and the liquid went on trickling from one bottle to the other with the same uniform steadiness Yes said Bryce inquiringly One moment He finished his task calmly put the corks in the bottles labelled one restored the other to a shelf and turned round Not a man to be easily startled not easily turned from a purpose this thought Ransford as he glanced at Bryce s eyes which had a trick of fastening their gaze on people with an odd disconcerting persistency I m sorry to say what I must say he began But you ve brought it on yourself I gave you a hint some time ago that your attentions were not welcome to Miss Bewery Bryce made no immediate response Instead leaning almost carelessly and indifferently against the table at which he had been busy with drugs and bottles he took a small file from his waistcoat pocket and began to polish his carefully cut nails Yes he said after a pause Well In spite of it continued Ransford you ve since addressed her again on the matter not merely once but twice Bryce put his file away and thrusting his hands in his pockets crossed his feet as he leaned back against the table his whole attitude suggesting whether meaningly or not that he was very much at his ease There s a great deal to be said on a point like this he observed If a man wishes a certain young woman to become his wife what right has any other man or the young woman herself for that matter to say that he mustn t express his desires to her None said Ransford provided he only does it once and takes the answer he gets as final I disagree with you entirely retorted Bryce On the last particular at any rate A man who considers any word of a woman s as being final is a fool What a woman thinks on Monday she s almost dead certain not to think on Tuesday The whole history of human relationship is on my side there It s no opinion it s a fact Ransford stared at this frank remark and Bryce went on coolly and imperturbably as if he had been discussing a medical problem A man who takes a woman s first answer as final he continued is I repeat a fool There are lots of reasons why a woman shouldn t know her own mind at the first time of asking She may be too surprised She mayn t be quite decided She may say one thing when she really means another That often happens She isn t much better equipped at the second time of asking And there are women young ones who aren t really certain of themselves at the third time All that s common sense I ll tell you what it is suddenly exclaimed Ransford after remaining silent for a moment under this flow of philosophy I m not going to discuss theories and ideas I know one young woman at any rate who is certain of herself Miss Bewery does not feel any inclination to you now nor at any time to be She s told you so three times And you should take her answer and behave yourself accordingly Bryce favoured his senior with a searching look How does Miss Bewery know that she mayn t be inclined to in the future he asked She may come to regard me with favour No she won t declared Ransford Better hear the truth and be done with it She doesn t like you and she doesn t want to either Why can t you take your answer like a man What s your conception of a man asked Bryce That and a good one exclaimed Ransford May satisfy you but not me said Bryce Mine s different My conception of a man is of a being who s got some perseverance You can get anything in this world anything by pegging away for it You re not going to get my ward suddenly said Ransford That s flat She doesn t want you and she s now said so three times And I support her What have you against me asked Bryce calmly If as you say you support her in her resolution not to listen to my proposals you must have something against me 
476_133471_000041_000002	train-clean-360	What is it 
none	none	That s a question you ve no right to put replied Ransford for it s utterly unnecessary So I m not going to answer it I ve nothing against you as regards your work nothing I m willing to give you an excellent testimonial Oh remarked Bryce quietly That means you wish me to go away I certainly think it would be best said Ransford In that case continued Bryce more coolly than ever I shall certainly want to know what you have against me or what Miss Bewery has against me Why am I objected to as a suitor You at any rate know who I am you know that my father is of our own profession and a man of reputation and standing and that I myself came to you on high recommendation Looked at from my standpoint I m a thoroughly eligible young man And there s a point you forget there s no mystery about me Ransford turned sharply in his chair as he noticed the emphasis which Bryce put on his last word What do you mean he demanded What I ve just said replied Bryce There s no mystery attaching to me Any question about me can be answered Now you can t say that as regards your ward
476_133471_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 That s a fact 
none	none	doctor Ransford Ransford in years gone by had practised himself in the art of restraining his temper naturally a somewhat quick one And he made a strong effort in that direction now recognizing that there was something behind his assistant s last remark and that Bryce meant him to know it was there I ll repeat what I ve just said he answered What do you mean by that I hear things said Bryce People will talk even a doctor can t refuse to hear what gossiping and garrulous patients say Since she came to you from school a year ago Wrychester people have been much interested in Miss Bewery and in her brother too And there are a good many residents of the Close you know their nice inquisitive ways who want to know who the sister and brother really are and what your relationship is to them Confound their impudence growled Ransford By all means agreed Bryce And for all I care let them be confounded too But if you imagine that the choice and select coteries of a cathedral town consisting mainly of the relicts of deceased deans canons prebendaries and the like and of maiden aunts elderly spinsters and tea table haunting curates are free from gossip why you re a singularly innocent person They d better not begin gossiping about my affairs said Ransford Otherwise You can t stop them from gossiping about your affairs interrupted Bryce cheerfully Of course they gossip about your affairs have gossiped about them will continue to gossip about them It s human nature You ve heard them asked Ransford who was too vexed to keep back his curiosity You yourself As you are aware I am often asked out to tea replied Bryce and to garden parties and tennis parties and choice and cosy functions patronized by curates and associated with crumpets I have heard with these ears I can even repeat the sort of thing I have heard That dear delightful Miss Bewery what a charming girl And that good looking boy her brother quite a dear Now I wonder who they really are Wards of doctor Ransford of course Really how very romantic and just a little eh unusual Such a comparatively young man to have such a really charming girl as his ward Can t be more than forty five himself and she s twenty how very very romantic Really one would think there ought to be a chaperon Damn said Ransford under his breath Just so agreed Bryce But that s the sort of thing Do you want more I can supply an unlimited quantity in the piece if you like But it s all according to sample So in addition to your other qualities remarked Ransford you re a gossiper Bryce smiled slowly and shook his head No he replied I m a listener A good one too But do you see my point I say there s no mystery about me If Miss Bewery will honour me with her hand she ll get a man whose antecedents will bear the strictest investigation Are you inferring that hers won t demanded Ransford I m not inferring anything said Bryce I am speaking for myself of myself Pressing my own claim if you like on you the guardian You might do much worse than support my claims doctor Ransford Claims man retorted Ransford You ve got no claims What are you talking about Claims My pretensions then answered Bryce If there is a mystery as Wrychester people say there is about Miss Bewery it would be safe with me Whatever you may think I m a thoroughly dependable man when it s in my own interest And when it isn t asked Ransford What are you then as you re so candid I could be a very bad enemy replied Bryce There was a moment s silence during which the two men looked attentively at each other I ve told you the truth said Ransford at last Miss Bewery flatly refuses to entertain any idea whatever of ever marrying you She earnestly hopes that that eventuality may never be mentioned to her again Will you give me your word of honour to respect her wishes No answered Bryce I won t Why not asked Ransford with a faint show of anger A woman s wishes Because I may consider that I see signs of a changed mind in her said Bryce That s why You ll never see any change of mind declared Ransford That s certain Is that your fixed determination It is answered Bryce I m not the sort of man who is easily repelled Then in that case said Ransford we had better part company He rose from his desk and going over to a safe which stood in a corner unlocked it and took some papers from an inside drawer He consulted one of these and turned to Bryce You remember our agreement he continued Your engagement was to be determined by a three months notice on either side or at my will at any time by payment of three months salary Quite right agreed Bryce I remember of course Then I ll give you a cheque for three months salary now said Ransford and sat down again at his desk That will settle matters definitely and I hope agreeably Bryce made no reply He remained leaning against the table watching Ransford write the cheque And when Ransford laid the cheque down at the edge of the desk he made no movement towards it You must see remarked Ransford half apologetically that it s the only thing I can do I can t have any man who s not not welcome to her to put it plainly causing any annoyance to my ward I repeat Bryce you must see it I have nothing to do with what you see answered Bryce Your opinions are not mine and mine aren t yours You re really turning me away as if I were a dishonest foreman because in my opinion it would be a very excellent thing for her and for myself if Miss Bewery would consent to marry me That s the plain truth Ransford allowed himself to take a long and steady look at Bryce The thing was done now and his dismissed assistant seemed to be taking it quietly and Ransford s curiosity was aroused I can t make you out he exclaimed I don t know whether you re the most cynical young man I ever met or whether you re the most obtuse Not the last anyway interrupted Bryce I assure you of that Can t you see for yourself then man that the girl doesn t want you said Ransford Hang it for anything you know to the contrary she may have might have other ideas Bryce who had been staring out of a side window for the last minute or two suddenly laughed and lifting a hand pointed into the garden And Ransford turned and saw Mary Bewery walking there with a tall lad whom he recognized as one Sackville Bonham stepson of mister Folliot a wealthy resident of the Close The two young people were laughing and chatting together with evident great friendliness Perhaps remarked Bryce quietly her ideas run in that direction In which case doctor Ransford you ll have trouble For missus Folliot mother of yonder callow youth who s the apple of her eye is one of the inquisitive ladies of whom I ve just told you and if her son unites himself with anybody she ll want to know exactly who that anybody is You d far better have supported me as an aspirant However I suppose there s no more to say Nothing answered Ransford Except to say good day and good bye to you You needn t remain I ll see to everything And I m going out now I think you d better not exchange any farewells with any one Bryce nodded silently and Ransford picking up his hat and gloves left the surgery by the side door A moment later Bryce saw him crossing the Close CHAPTER III saint WRYTHA S STAIR The summarily dismissed assistant thus left alone stood for a moment in evident deep thought before he moved towards Ransford s desk and picked up the cheque He looked at it carefully folded it neatly and put it away in his pocket book after that he proceeded to collect a few possessions of his own instruments books from various drawers and shelves He was placing these things in a small hand bag when a gentle tap sounded on the door by which patients approached the surgery Come in he called There was no response although the door was slightly ajar instead the knock was repeated and at that Bryce crossed the room and flung the door open A man stood outside an elderly slight figured quiet looking man who looked at Bryce with a half deprecating half nervous air the air of a man who was shy in manner and evidently fearful of seeming to intrude Bryce s quick observant eyes took him in at a glance noting a much worn and lined face thin grey hair and tired eyes this was a man he said to himself who had seen trouble Nevertheless not a poor man if his general appearance was anything to go by he was well and even expensively dressed in the style generally affected by well to do merchants and city men his clothes were fashionably cut his silk hat was new his linen and boots irreproachable a fine diamond pin gleamed in his carefully arranged cravat Why then this unmistakably furtive and half frightened manner which seemed to be somewhat relieved at the sight of Bryce Is this is doctor Ransford within asked the stranger I was told this is his house doctor Ransford is out replied Bryce Just gone out not five minutes ago This is his surgery Can I be of use The man hesitated looking beyond Bryce into the room No thank you he said at last I no I don t want professional services I just called to see doctor Ransford I the fact is I once knew some one of that name It s no matter at present Bryce stepped outside and pointed across the Close doctor Ransford he said went over there I rather fancy he s gone to the Deanery he has a case there If you went through Paradise you d very likely meet him coming back the Deanery is the big house in the far corner yonder The stranger followed Bryce s outstretched finger Paradise he said wonderingly What s that Bryce pointed to a long stretch of grey wall which projected from the south wall of the Cathedral into the Close It s an enclosure between the south porch and the transept he said Full of old tombs and trees a sort of wilderness why called Paradise I don t know There s a short cut across it to the Deanery and that part of the Close through that archway you see over there If you go across you re almost sure to meet doctor Ransford I m much obliged to you said the stranger Thank you He turned away in the direction which Bryce had indicated and Bryce went back only to go out again and call after him If you don t meet him shall I say you ll call again he asked And what name The stranger shook his head It s immaterial he answered I ll see him somewhere or later Many thanks He went on his way towards Paradise and Bryce returned to the surgery and completed his preparations for departure And in the course of things he more than once looked through the window into the garden and saw Mary Bewery still walking and talking with young Sackville Bonham No he muttered to himself I won t trouble to exchange any farewells not because of Ransford s hint but because there s no need If Ransford thinks he s going to drive me out of Wrychester before I choose to go he s badly mistaken it ll be time enough to say farewell when I take my departure and that won t be just yet Now I wonder who that old chap was Knew some one of Ransford s name once did he Probably Ransford himself in which case he knows more of Ransford than anybody in Wrychester knows for nobody in Wrychester knows anything beyond a few years back No doctor Ransford no farewells to anybody A mere departure till I turn up again But Bryce was not to get away from the old house without something in the nature of a farewell As he walked out of the surgery by the side entrance Mary Bewery who had just parted from young Bonham in the garden and was about to visit her dogs in the stable yard came along she and Bryce met face to face The girl flushed not so much from embarrassment as from vexation Bryce cool as ever showed no sign of any embarrassment Instead he laughed tapping the hand bag which he carried under one arm Summarily turned out as if I had been stealing the spoons he remarked I go with my small belongings This is my first reward for devotion I have nothing to say to you answered Mary sweeping by him with a highly displeased glance Except that you have brought it on yourself A very feminine retort observed Bryce But there is no malice in it Your anger won t last more than shall we say a day You may say what you like she replied As I just said I have nothing to say now or at any time That remains to be proved remarked Bryce The phrase is one of much elasticity But for the present I go He walked out into the Close and without as much as a backward look struck off across the sward in the direction in which ten minutes before he had sent the strange man He had rooms in a quiet lane on the farther side of the Cathedral precinct and his present intention was to go to them to leave his bag and make some further arrangements He had no idea of leaving Wrychester he knew of another doctor in the city who was badly in need of help he would go to him would tell him if need be why he had left Ransford He had a multiplicity of schemes and ideas in his head and he began to consider some of them as he stepped out of the Close into the ancient enclosure which all Wrychester folk knew by its time honoured name of Paradise This was really an outer court of the old cloisters its high walls half ruinous almost wholly covered with ivy shut in an expanse of turf liberally furnished with yew and cypress and studded with tombs and gravestones In one corner rose a gigantic elm in another a broken stairway of stone led to a doorway set high in the walls of the nave across the enclosure itself was a pathway which led towards the houses in the south east corner of the Close It was a curious gloomy spot little frequented save by people who went across it rather than follow the gravelled paths outside and it was untenanted when Bryce stepped into it But just as he walked through the archway he saw Ransford Ransford was emerging hastily from a postern door in the west porch so hastily that Bryce checked himself to look at him And though they were twenty yards apart Bryce saw that Ransford s face was very pale almost to whiteness and that he was unmistakably agitated Instantly he connected that agitation with the man who had come to the surgery door They ve met mused Bryce and stopped staring after Ransford s retreating figure Now what is it in that man s mere presence that s upset Ransford He looks like a man who s had a nasty unexpected shock a bad un He remained standing in the archway gazing after the retreating figure until Ransford had disappeared within his own garden still wondering and speculating but not about his own affairs he turned across Paradise at last and made his way towards the farther corner There was a little wicket gate there set in the ivied wall as Bryce opened it a man in the working dress of a stone mason whom he recognized as being one of the master mason s staff came running out of the bushes His face too was white and his eyes were big with excitement And recognizing Bryce he halted panting What is it Varner asked Bryce calmly Something happened The man swept his hand across his forehead as if he were dazed and then jerked his thumb over his shoulder A man he gasped Foot of saint Wrytha s Stair there doctor Dead or if not dead near it I saw it Bryce seized Varner s arm and gave it a shake You saw what he demanded Saw him fall Or rather flung panted Varner Somebody couldn t see who nohow flung him right through yon doorway up there He fell right over the steps crash Bryce looked over the tops of the yews and cypresses at the doorway in the clerestory to which Varner pointed a low open archway gained by the half ruinous stair It was forty feet at least from the ground You saw him thrown he exclaimed Thrown down there Impossible man Tell you I saw it asserted Varner doggedly I was looking at one of those old tombs yonder somebody wants some repairs doing and the jackdaws were making such a to do up there by the roof I glanced up at them And I saw this man thrown through that door fairly flung through it God do you think I could mistake my own eyes Did you see who flung him asked Bryce No I saw a hand just for one second as it might be by the edge of the doorway answered Varner I was more for watching him He sort of tottered for a second on the step outside the door turned over and screamed I can hear it now and crashed down on the flags beneath How long since demanded Bryce Five or six minutes said Varner I rushed to him I ve been doing what I could But I saw it was no good so I was running for help Bryce pushed him towards the bushes by which they were standing Take me to him he said Come on Varner turned back making a way through the cypresses He led Bryce to the foot of the great wall of the nave There in the corner formed by the angle of nave and transept on a broad pavement of flagstones lay the body of a man crumpled up in a curiously twisted position And with one glance even before he reached it Bryce knew what body it was that of the man who had come shyly and furtively to Ransford s door Look exclaimed Varner suddenly pointing He s stirring Bryce whose gaze was fastened on the twisted figure saw a slight movement which relaxed as suddenly as it had occurred Then came stillness That s the end he muttered The man s dead I ll guarantee that before I put a hand on him Dead enough he went on as he reached the body and dropped on one knee by it His neck s broken The mason bent down and looked half curiously half fearfully at the dead man Then he glanced upward at the open door high above them in the walls It s a fearful drop that sir he said And he came down with such violence You re sure it s over with him He died just as we came up answered Bryce That movement we saw was the last effort involuntary of course 
476_133471_000042_000003	train-clean-360	Look here 
none	none	Varner you ll have to get help You d better fetch some of the cathedral people some of the vergers No he broke off suddenly as the low strains of an organ came from within the great building They re just beginning the morning service of course it s ten o clock Never mind them go straight to the police Bring them back I ll stay here The mason turned off towards the gateway of the Close and while the strains of the organ grew louder Bryce bent over the dead man wondering what had really happened Thrown from an open doorway in the clerestory over saint Wrytha s Stair it seemed almost impossible But a sudden thought struck him supposing two men wishing to talk in privacy unobserved had gone up into the clerestory of the Cathedral as they easily could by more than one door by more than one stair and supposing they had quarrelled and one of them had flung or pushed the other through the door above what then And on the heels of that thought hurried another this man now lying dead had come to the surgery seeking Ransford and had subsequently gone away presumably in search of him and Bryce himself had just seen Ransford obviously agitated and pale of cheek leaving the west porch what did it all mean what was the apparently obvious inference to be drawn Here was the stranger dead and Varner was ready to swear that he had seen him thrown flung violently through the door forty feet above That was murder Then who was the murderer Bryce looked carefully and narrowly around him Now that Varner had gone away there was not a human being in sight nor anywhere near so far as he knew On one side of him and the dead man rose the grey walls of nave and transept on the other the cypresses and yews rising amongst the old tombs and monuments Assuring himself that no one was near no eye watching he slipped his hand into the inner breast pocket of the dead man s smart morning coat Such a man must carry papers papers would reveal something And Bryce wanted to know anything anything that would give information and let him into whatever secret there might be between this unlucky stranger and Ransford But the breast pocket was empty there was no pocket book there there were no papers there Nor were there any papers elsewhere in the other pockets which he hastily searched there was not even a card with a name on it But he found a purse full of money banknotes gold silver and in one of its compartments a scrap of paper folded curiously after the fashion of the cocked hat missives of another age in which envelopes had not been invented Bryce hurriedly unfolded this and after one glance at its contents made haste to secrete it in his own pocket He had only just done this and put back the purse when he heard Varner s voice and a second later the voice of Inspector Mitchington a well known police official And at that Bryce sprang to his feet and when the mason and his companions emerged from the bushes was standing looking thoughtfully at the dead man He turned to Mitchington with a shake of the head Dead he said in a hushed voice Died as we got to him Broken all to pieces I should say neck and spine certainly I suppose Varner s told you what he saw Mitchington a sharp eyed dark complexioned man quick of movement nodded and after one glance at the body looked up at the open doorway high above them That the door he asked turning to Varner And it was open It s always open answered Varner Least ways it s been open like that all this spring to my knowledge What is there behind it inquired Mitchington Sort of gallery that runs all round the nave replied Varner Clerestory gallery that s what it is People can go up there and walk around lots of em do tourists you know There s two or three ways up to it staircases in the turrets Mitchington turned to one of the two constables who had followed him Let Varner show you the way up there he said Go quietly don t make any fuss the morning service is just beginning Say nothing to anybody just take a quiet look around along that gallery especially near the door there and come back here He looked down at the dead man again as the mason and the constable went away A stranger I should think doctor tourist most likely But thrown down That man Varner is positive That looks like foul play Oh there s no doubt of that asserted Bryce You ll have to go into that pretty deeply But the inside of the Cathedral s like a rabbit warren and whoever threw the man through that doorway no doubt knew how to slip away unobserved Now you ll have to remove the body to the mortuary of course but just let me fetch doctor Ransford first I d like some other medical man than myself to see him before he s moved I ll have him here in five minutes He turned away through the bushes and emerging upon the Close ran across the lawns in the direction of the house which he had left not twenty minutes before He had but one idea as he ran he wanted to see Ransford face to face with the dead man wanted to watch him to observe him to see how he looked how he behaved Then he Bryce would know something But he was to know something before that He opened the door of the surgery suddenly but with his usual quietness of touch And on the threshold he paused Ransford the very picture of despair stood just within his face convulsed beating one hand upon the other CHAPTER IV THE ROOM AT THE MITRE In the few seconds which elapsed before Ransford recognized Bryce s presence Bryce took a careful if swift observation of his late employer That Ransford was visibly upset by something was plain enough to see his face was still pale he was muttering to himself one clenched fist was pounding the open palm of the other hand altogether he looked like a man who is suddenly confronted with some fearful difficulty And when Bryce having looked long enough to satisfy his wishes coughed gently he started in such a fashion as to suggest that his nerves had become unstrung What is it what are you doing there he demanded almost fiercely What do you mean by coming in like that Bryce affected to have seen nothing I came to fetch you he answered There s been an accident in Paradise man fallen from that door at the head of saint Wrytha s Stair I wish you d come but I may as well tell you that he s past help dead Dead A man exclaimed Ransford What man A workman Bryce had already made up his mind about telling Ransford of the stranger s call at the surgery He would say nothing at that time at any rate It was improbable that any one but himself knew of the call the side entrance to the surgery was screened from the Close by a shrubbery it was very unlikely that any passer by had seen the man call or go away No he would keep his knowledge secret until it could be made better use of Not a workman not a townsman a stranger he answered Looks like a well to do tourist A slightly built elderly man grey haired Ransford who had turned to his desk to master himself looked round with a sudden sharp glance and for the moment Bryce was taken aback For he had condemned Ransford and yet that glance was one of apparently genuine surprise a glance which almost convinced him against his will against only too evident facts that Ransford was hearing of the Paradise affair for the first time An elderly man grey haired slightly built said Ransford Dark clothes silk hat Precisely replied Bryce who was now considerably astonished Do you know him I saw such a man entering the Cathedral a while ago answered Ransford A stranger certainly Come along then He had fully recovered his self possession by that time and he led the way from the surgery and across the Close as if he were going on an ordinary professional visit He kept silence as they walked rapidly towards Paradise and Bryce was silent too He had studied Ransford a good deal during their two years acquaintanceship and he knew Ransford s power of repressing and commanding his feelings and concealing his thoughts And now he decided that the look and start which he had at first taken to be of the nature of genuine astonishment were cunningly assumed and he was not surprised when having reached the group of men gathered around the body Ransford showed nothing but professional interest Have you done anything towards finding out who this unfortunate man is asked Ransford after a brief examination as he turned to Mitchington Evidently a stranger but he probably has papers on him There s nothing on him except a purse with plenty of money in it answered Mitchington I ve been through his pockets myself there isn t a scrap of paper not even as much as an old letter But he s evidently a tourist or something of the sort and so he ll probably have stayed in the city all night and I m going to inquire at the hotels There ll be an inquest of course remarked Ransford mechanically Well we can do nothing Mitchington You d better have the body removed to the mortuary He turned and looked up the broken stairway at the foot of which they were standing You say he fell down that he asked Whatever was he doing up there Mitchington looked at Bryce Haven t you told doctor Ransford how it was he asked No answered Bryce He glanced at Ransford indicating Varner who had come back with the constable and was standing by He didn t fall he went on watching Ransford narrowly He was violently flung out of that doorway Varner here saw it Ransford s cheek flushed and he was unable to repress a slight start He looked at the mason You actually saw it he exclaimed Why what did you see Him answered Varner nodding at the dead man Flung head and heels clean through that doorway up there Hadn t a chance to save himself he hadn t Just grabbed at nothing and came down Give a year s wages if I hadn t seen it and heard him scream Ransford was watching Varner with a set concentrated look Who flung him he asked suddenly You say you saw Aye sir but not as much as all that replied the mason I just saw a hand and that was all But he added turning to the police with a knowing look there s one thing I can swear to it was a gentleman s hand I saw the white shirt cuff and a bit of a black sleeve Ransford turned away But he just as suddenly turned back to the inspector You ll have to let the Cathedral authorities know Mitchington he said Better get the body removed though first do it now before the morning service is over And let me hear what you find out about his identity if you can discover anything in the city He went away then without another word or a further glance at the dead man But Bryce had already assured himself of what he was certain was a fact that a look of unmistakable relief had swept across Ransford s face for the fraction of a second when he knew that there were no papers on the dead man He himself waited after Ransford had gone waited until the police had fetched a stretcher when he personally superintended the removal of the body to the mortuary outside the Close And there a constable who had come over from the police station gave a faint hint as to further investigation I saw that poor gentleman last night sir he said to the inspector He was standing at the door of the Mitre talking to another gentleman a tallish man Then I ll go across there said Mitchington Come with me if you like doctor Bryce This was precisely what Bryce desired he was already anxious to acquire all the information he could get And he walked over the way with the inspector to the quaint old world inn which filled almost one side of the little square known as Monday Market and in at the courtyard where looking out of the bow window which had served as an outer bar in the coaching days they found the landlady of the Mitre missus Partingley Bryce saw at once that she had heard the news What s this mister Mitchington she demanded as they drew near across the cobble paved yard Somebody s been in to say there s been an accident to a gentleman a stranger I hope it isn t one of the two we ve got in the house I should say it is ma am answered the inspector He was seen outside here last night by one of our men anyway The landlady uttered an expression of distress and opening a side door motioned them to step into her parlour Which of them is it she asked anxiously There s two came together last night they did a tall one and a short one Dear
476_133471_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 dear me 
none	none	is it a bad accident now inspector The man s dead ma am replied Mitchington grimly And we want to know who he is Have you got his name and the other gentleman s missus Partingley uttered another exclamation of distress and astonishment lifting her plump hands in horror But her business faculties remained alive and she made haste to produce a big visitors book and to spread it open before her callers There it is she said pointing to the two last entries That s the short gentleman s name mister John Braden London And that s the tall one s mister Christopher Dellingham also London Tourists of course we ve never seen either of them before Came together you say missus Partingley asked Mitchington When was that now Just before dinner last night answered the landlady They d evidently come in by the London train that gets in at six forty as you know They came here together and they d dinner together and spent the evening together Of course we took them for friends But they didn t go out together this morning though they d breakfast together After breakfast mister Dellingham asked me the way to the old Manor Mill and he went off there so I concluded mister Braden he hung about a bit studying a local directory I d lent him and after a while he asked me if he could hire a trap to take him out to Saxonsteade this afternoon Of course I said he could and he arranged for it to be ready at two thirty Then he went out and across the market towards the Cathedral And that concluded missus Partingley is about all I know gentlemen Saxonsteade eh remarked Mitchington Did he say anything about his reasons for going there Well yes he did replied the landlady For he asked me if I thought he d be likely to find the Duke at home at that time of day I said I knew his Grace was at Saxonsteade just now and that I should think the middle of the afternoon would be a good time He didn t tell you his business with the Duke asked Mitchington Not a word said the landlady Oh no just that and no more But here s mister Dellingham Bryce turned to see a tall broad shouldered bearded man pass the window the door opened and he walked in to glance inquisitively at the inspector He turned at once to missus Partingley I hear there s been an accident to that gentleman I came in with last night he said Is it anything serious Your ostler says These gentlemen have just come about it sir answered the landlady She glanced at Mitchington Perhaps you ll tell she began Was he a friend of yours sir asked Mitchington A personal friend Never saw him in my life before last night replied the tall man We just chanced to meet in the train coming down from London got talking and discovered we were both coming to the same place Wrychester So we came to this house together No no friend of mine not even an acquaintance previous of course to last night Is is it anything serious He s dead sir replied Mitchington And now we want to know who he is God bless my soul Dead You don t say so exclaimed mister Dellingham Dear dear Well I can t help you don t know him from Adam Pleasant well informed man seemed to have travelled a great deal in foreign countries I can tell you this much though he went on as if a sudden recollection had come to him I gathered that he d only just arrived in England in fact now I come to think of it he said as much Made some remark in the train about the pleasantness of the English landscape don t you know I got an idea that he d recently come from some country where trees and hedges and green fields aren t much in evidence But if you want to know who he is officer why don t you search him He s sure to have papers cards and so on about him We have searched him answered Mitchington There isn t a paper a letter or even a visiting card on him mister Dellingham looked at the landlady Bless me he said Remarkable But he d a suit case or something of the sort something light which he carried up from the railway station himself Perhaps in that I should like to see whatever he had said Mitchington We d better examine his room missus Partingley Bryce presently followed the landlady and the inspector upstairs mister Dellingham followed him All four went into a bedroom which looked out on Monday Market And there on a side table lay a small leather suit case one which could easily be carried with its upper half thrown open and back against the wall behind The landlady mister Dellingham and Bryce stood silently by while the inspector examined the contents of this the only piece of luggage in the room There was very little to see what toilet articles the visitor brought were spread out on the dressing table brushes combs a case of razors and the like And Mitchington nodded side wise at them as he began to take the articles out of the suit case There s one thing strikes me at once he said I dare say you gentlemen notice it All these things are new This suit case hasn t been in use very long see the leather s almost unworn and those things on the dressing table are new And what there is here looks new too There s not much you see he evidently had no intention of a long stop An extra pair of trousers some shirts socks collars neckties slippers handkerchiefs that s about all And the first thing to do is to see if the linen s marked with name or initials He deftly examined the various articles as he took them out and in the end shook his head No name no initials he said But look here do you see gentlemen where these collars were bought Half a dozen of them in a box Paris There you are the seller s name inside the collar just as in England Aristide Pujol eighty two Rue des Capucines And judging by the look of em I should say these shirts were bought there too and the handkerchiefs and the neckwear they all have a foreign look There may be a clue in that we might trace him in France if we can t in England Perhaps he is a Frenchman I ll take my oath he isn t exclaimed mister Dellingham However long he d been out of England he hadn t lost a North Country accent He was some sort of a North Countryman Yorkshire or Lancashire I ll go bail No Frenchman officer not he Well there s no papers here anyway said Mitchington who had now emptied the suit case Nothing to show who he was Nothing here you see in the way of paper but this old book what is it History of Barthorpe He showed me that in the train remarked mister Dellingham I m interested in antiquities and archaeology and anybody who s long in my society finds it out We got talking of such things and he pulled out that book and told me with great pride that he d picked it up from a book barrow in the street somewhere in London for one and six I think he added musingly that what attracted him in it was the old calf binding and the steel frontispiece I m sure he d no great knowledge of antiquities Mitchington laid the book down and Bryce picked it up examined the title page and made a mental note of the fact that Barthorpe was a market town in the Midlands And it was on the tip of his tongue to say that if the dead man had no particular interest in antiquities and archaeology it was somewhat strange that he should have bought a book which was mainly antiquarian and that it might be that he had so bought it because of a connection between Barthorpe and himself But he remembered that it was his own policy to keep pertinent facts for his own private consideration so he said nothing And Mitchington presently remarking that there was no more to be done there and ascertaining from mister Dellingham that it was his intention to remain in Wrychester for at any rate a few days they went downstairs again and Bryce and the inspector crossed over to the police station The news had spread through the heart of the city and at the police station doors a crowd had gathered Just inside two or three principal citizens were talking to the Superintendent amongst them was mister Stephen Folliot the stepfather of young Bonham a big heavy faced man who had been a resident in the Close for some years was known to be of great wealth and had a reputation as a grower of rare roses He was telling the Superintendent something and the Superintendent beckoned to Mitchington mister Folliot says he saw this gentleman in the Cathedral he said Can t have been so very long before the accident happened mister Folliot from what you say As near as I can reckon it would be five minutes to ten answered mister Folliot I put it at that because I d gone in for the morning service which is at ten I saw him go up the inside stair to the clerestory gallery he was looking about him Five minutes to ten and it must have happened immediately afterwards Bryce heard this and turned away making a calculation for himself It had been on the stroke of ten when he saw Ransford hurrying out of the west porch There was a stairway from the gallery down to that west porch What then was the inference But for the moment he drew none instead he went home to his rooms in Friary Lane and shutting himself up drew from his pocket the scrap of paper he had taken from the dead man CHAPTER V THE SCRAP OF PAPER When Bryce in his locked room drew that bit of paper from his pocket it was with the conviction that in it he held a clue to the secret of the morning s adventure He had only taken a mere glance at it as he withdrew it from the dead man s purse but he had seen enough of what was written on it to make him certain that it was a document if such a mere fragment could be called a document of no ordinary importance And now he unfolded and laid it flat on his table and looked at it carefully asking himself what was the real meaning of what he saw There was not much to see The scrap of paper itself was evidently a quarter of a leaf of old fashioned stoutish notepaper somewhat yellow with age and bearing evidence of having been folded and kept flat in the dead man s purse for some time the creases were well defined the edges were worn and slightly stained by long rubbing against the leather And in its centre were a few words or rather abbreviations of words in Latin and some figures In Para Wrycestr juxt tumb Ric Jenk ex cap xxiii xv Bryce at first sight took them to be a copy of some inscription but his knowledge of Latin told him a moment later that instead of being an inscription it was a direction And a very plain direction too he read it easily In Paradise at Wrychester next to or near the tomb of Richard Jenkins or possibly Jenkinson from or behind the head twenty three fifteen inches most likely There was no doubt that there was the meaning of the words What now was it that lay behind the tomb of Richard Jenkins or Jenkinson in Wrychester Paradise in all probability twenty three inches from the head stone and fifteen inches beneath the surface That was a question which Bryce immediately resolved to find a satisfactory answer to in the meantime there were other questions which he set down in order on his mental tablets They were these one Who really was the man who had registered at the Mitre under the name of John Braden two Why did he wish to make a personal call on the Duke of Saxonsteade three Was he some man who had known Ransford in time past and whom Ransford had no desire to meet again four Did Ransford meet him in the Cathedral five Was it Ransford who flung him to his death down saint Wrytha s Stair six Was that the real reason of the agitation in which he Bryce had found Ransford a few moments after the discovery of the body There was plenty of time before him for the due solution of these mysteries reflected Bryce and for solving another problem which might possibly have some relationship to them that of the exact connection between Ransford and his two wards Bryce in telling Ransford that morning of what was being said amongst the tea table circles of the old cathedral city had purposely only told him half a tale He knew and had known for months that the society of the Close was greatly exercised over the position of the Ransford menage Ransford a bachelor a well preserved active alert man who was certainly of no more than middle age and did not look his years had come to Wrychester only a few years previously and had never shown any signs of forsaking his single state No one had ever heard him mention his family or relations then suddenly without warning he had brought into his house Mary Bewery a handsome young woman of nineteen who was said to have only just left school and her brother Richard then a boy of sixteen who had certainly been at a public school of repute and was entered at the famous Dean s School of Wrychester as soon as he came to his new home doctor Ransford spoke of these two as his wards without further explanation the society of the Close was beginning to want much more explanation Who were they these two young people Was doctor Ransford their uncle their cousin what was he to them In any case in the opinion of the elderly ladies who set the tone of society in Wrychester Miss Bewery was much too young and far too pretty to be left without a chaperon But up to then no one had dared to say as much to doctor Ransford instead everybody said it freely behind his back Bryce had used eyes and ears in relation to the two young people He had been with Ransford a year when they arrived admitted freely to their company he had soon discovered that whatever relationship existed between them and Ransford they had none with anybody else that they knew of No letters came for them from uncles aunts cousins grandfathers grandmothers They appeared to have no memories or reminiscences of relatives nor of father or mother there was a curious atmosphere of isolation about them They had plenty of talk about what might be called their present their recent schooldays their youthful experiences games pursuits but none of what under any circumstances could have been a very far distant past Bryce s quick and attentive ears discovered things for instance that for many years past Ransford had been in the habit of spending his annual two months holiday with these two Year after year at any rate since the boy s tenth year he had taken them travelling Bryce heard scraps of reminiscences of tours in France and in Switzerland and in Ireland and in Scotland even as far afield as the far north of Norway It was easy to see that both boy and girl had a mighty veneration for Ransford just as easy to see that Ransford took infinite pains to make life something more than happy and comfortable for both And Bryce who was one of those men who firmly believe that no man ever does anything for nothing and that self interest is the mainspring of Life asked himself over and over again the question which agitated the ladies of the Close Who are these two and what is the bond between them and this sort of fairy godfather guardian And now as he put away the scrap of paper in a safely locked desk Bryce asked himself another question Had the events of that morning anything to do with the mystery which hung around doctor Ransford s wards If it had then all the more reason why he should solve it For Bryce had made up his mind that by hook or by crook he would marry Mary Bewery and he was only too eager to lay hands on anything that would help him to achieve that ambition If he could only get Ransford into his power if he could get Mary Bewery herself into his power well and good Once he had got her he would be good enough to her in his way Having nothing to do Bryce went out after a while and strolled round to the Wrychester Club an exclusive institution the members of which were drawn from the leisured the professional the clerical and the military circles of the old city And there as he expected he found small groups discussing the morning s tragedy and he joined one of them in which was Sackville Bonham his presumptive rival who was busily telling three or four other young men what his stepfather mister Folliot had to say about the event My stepfather says and I tell you he saw the man said Sackville who was noted in Wrychester circles as a loquacious and forward youth he says that whatever happened must have happened as soon as ever the old chap got up into that clerestory gallery Look here it s like this My stepfather had gone in there for the morning service strict old church goer he is you know and he saw this stranger going up the stairway He s positive mister Folliot that it was then five minutes to ten Now then I ask you isn t he right my stepfather when he says that it must have happened at once immediately Because that man Varner the mason says he saw the man fall before ten What One of the group nodded at Bryce I should think Bryce knows what time it happened as well as anybody he said You were first on the spot Bryce weren t you After Varner answered Bryce laconically As to the time I could fix it in this way the organist was just beginning a voluntary or something of the sort That means ten o clock to the minute when he was found exclaimed Sackville triumphantly Of course he d fallen a minute or two before that which proves mister Folliot to be right Now what does that prove Why that the old chap s assailant whoever he was dogged him along that gallery as soon as he entered seized him when he got to the open doorway and flung him through Clear as as noonday One of the group a rather older man than the rest who was leaning back in a tilted chair hands in pockets watching Sackville Bonham smilingly shook his head and laughed a little You re taking something for granted Sackie my son he said You re adopting the mason s tale as true But I don t believe the poor man was thrown through that doorway at all not I Bryce turned sharply on this speaker young Archdale a member of a well known firm of architects You don t he exclaimed But Varner says he saw him thrown Very likely answered Archdale But it would all happen so quickly that Varner might easily be mistaken I m speaking of something I know I know every inch of the Cathedral fabric ought to as we re always going over it professionally Just at that doorway at the head of saint Wrytha s Stair the flooring of the clerestory gallery is worn so smooth that it s like a piece of glass and it slopes Slopes at a very steep angle too to the doorway itself A stranger walking along there might easily slip and if the door was open as it was he d be shot out and into space before he knew what was happening This theory produced a moment s silence broken at last by Sackville Bonham Varner says he saw saw a man s hand a gentleman s hand insisted Sackville He saw a white shirt cuff a bit of the sleeve of a coat You re not going to get over that you know He s certain of it Varner may be as certain of it as he likes answered Archdale almost indifferently and still he may be mistaken The probability is that Varner was confused by what he saw He may have had a white shirt cuff and the sleeve of a black coat impressed upon him as in a flash and they were probably those of the man who was killed If as I suggest the man slipped and was shot out of that open doorway he would execute some violent and curious movements in the effort to save himself in which his arms would play an important part For one thing he would certainly throw out an arm to clutch at anything That s what Varner most probably saw There s no evidence whatever that the man was flung down Bryce turned away from the group of talkers to think over Archdale s suggestion If that suggestion had a basis of fact it destroyed his own theory that Ransford was responsible for the stranger s death In that case what was the reason of Ransford s unmistakable agitation on leaving the west porch and of his attack equally unmistakable of nerves in the surgery But what Archdale had said made him inquisitive and after he had treated himself in celebration of his freedom to an unusually good lunch at the Club he went round to the Cathedral to make a personal inspection of the gallery in the clerestory There was a stairway to that gallery in the corner of the south transept and Bryce made straight for it only to find a policeman there who pointed to a placard on the turret door Closed doctor by order of the Dean and Chapter he announced Till further orders The fact was sir he went on confidentially after the news got out so many people came crowding in here and up to that gallery that the Dean ordered all the entrances to be shut up at once nobody s been allowed up since noon I suppose you haven t heard anything of any strange person being seen lurking about up there this morning asked Bryce No sir But I ve had a bit of a talk with some of the vergers replied the policeman and they say it s a most extraordinary thing that none of them ever saw this strange gentleman go up there nor even heard any scuffle They say the vergers that they were all about at the time getting ready for the morning service and they neither saw nor heard Odd sir ain t it The whole thing s odd agreed Bryce and left the Cathedral He walked round to the wicket gate which admitted to that side of Paradise to find another policeman posted there What is this closed too he asked And time sir said the man They d ha broken down all the shrubs in the place if orders hadn t been given They were mad to see where the gentleman fell came in crowds at dinnertime Bryce nodded and was turning away when Dick Bewery came round a corner from the Deanery Walk evidently keenly excited With him was a girl of about his own age a certain characterful young lady whom Bryce knew as Betty Campany daughter of the librarian to the Dean and Chapter and therefore custodian of one of the most famous cathedral libraries in the country She too was apparently brimming with excitement and her pretty and vivacious face puckered itself into a frown as the policeman smiled and shook his head Oh I say what s that for exclaimed Dick Bewery Shut up what a lot of rot I say can t you let us go in just for a minute Not for a pension sir answered the policeman good naturedly Don t you see the notice The Dean ud have me out of the force by tomorrow if I disobeyed orders No admittance nowhere nohow But lor bless yer he added glancing at the two young people There s nothing to see nothing as doctor Bryce there can tell you Dick who knew nothing of the recent passages between his guardian and the dismissed assistant glanced at Bryce with interest You were on the spot first weren t you he asked Do you think it really was murder I don t know what it was answered Bryce And I wasn t first on the spot That was Varner the mason he called me He turned from the lad to glance at the girl who was peeping curiously over the gate into the yews and cypresses Do you think your father s at the Library just now he asked Shall I find him there I should think he is answered Betty Campany He generally goes down about this time She turned and pulled Dick Bewery s sleeve Let s go up in the clerestory she said We can see that anyway Also closed miss said the policeman shaking his head No admittance there neither The public firmly warned off so to speak I won t have the Cathedral turned into a peepshow that s precisely what I heard the Dean say with my own ears So closed The boy and the girl turned away and went off across the Close and the policeman looked after them and laughed Lively young couple that sir he said What they call healthy curiosity I suppose Plenty o that knocking around in the city today Bryce who had half turned in the direction of the Library at the other side of the Close turned round again Do you know if your people are doing anything about identifying the dead man he asked Did you hear anything at noon Nothing but that there ll be inquiries through the newspapers sir replied the policeman That s the surest way of finding something out And I did hear Inspector Mitchington say that they d have to ask the Duke if he knew anything about the poor man I suppose he d let fall something about wanting to go over to Saxonsteade Bryce went off in the direction of the Library thinking The newspapers yes no better channel for spreading the news If mister John Braden had relations and friends they would learn of his sad death through the newspapers and would come forward And in that case But it wouldn t surprise me mused Bryce if the name given at the Mitre is an assumed name I wonder if that theory of Archdale s is a correct one however there ll be more of that at the inquest tomorrow And in the meantime let me find out something about the tomb of Richard Jenkins or Jenkinson whoever he was The famous Library of the Dean and Chapter of Wrychester was housed in an ancient picturesque building in one corner of the Close wherein day in and day out amidst priceless volumes and manuscripts huge folios and weighty quartos old prints and relics of the mediaeval ages Ambrose Campany the librarian was pretty nearly always to be found ready to show his treasures to the visitors and tourists who came from all parts of the world to see a collection well known to bibliophiles And Ambrose Campany a cheery faced middle aged man with booklover and antiquary written all over him shockheaded blue spectacled was there now talking to an old man whom Bryce knew as a neighbour of his in Friary Lane one Simpson Barker a quiet meditative old fellow believed to be a retired tradesman who spent his time in gentle pottering about the city Bryce as he entered caught what Campany was just then saying The most important thing I ve heard about it said Campany is that book they found in the man s suit case at the Mitre I m not a detective but there s a clue CHAPTER VI BY MISADVENTURE 
690-133452-0000	train-other-500	Old Simpson Harker who sat near the librarian s table his hands folded on the crook of his stout walking stick glanced out of a pair of unusually shrewd and bright eyes at Bryce as he crossed the room and approached the pair of gossipers
690-133452-0001	train-other-500	I think the doctor was there when that book you re speaking of was found he remarked So I understood from Mitchington Yes I was there said Bryce who was not unwilling to join in the talk He turned to Campany
690-133452-0002	train-other-500	What makes you think there s a clue in that he asked Why this answered the librarian Here s a man in possession of an old history of Barthorpe Barthorpe is a small market town in the Midlands Leicestershire I believe
690-133452-0003	train-other-500	of no particular importance that I know of but doubtless with a story of its own Why should any one but a Barthorpe man past or present be interested in that story so far as to carry an old account of it with him
690-133452-0004	train-other-500	Therefore I conclude this stranger was a Barthorpe man And it s at Barthorpe that I should make inquiries about him Simpson Harker made no remark and Bryce remembered what mister Dellingham had said when the book was found
690-133452-0005	train-other-500	Oh I don t know he replied carelessly I don t see that that follows I saw the book a curious old binding and queer old copper plates The man may have picked it up for that reason I ve bought old books myself for less
690-133452-0006	train-other-500	All the same retorted Campany I should make inquiry at Barthorpe You ve got to go on probabilities The probabilities in this case are that the man was interested in the book because it dealt with his own town
690-133452-0007	train-other-500	Bryce turned away towards a wall on which hung a number of charts and plans of Wrychester Cathedral and its precincts it was to inspect one of these that he had come to the Library
690-133452-0008	train-other-500	But suddenly remembering that there was a question which he could ask without exciting any suspicion or surmise he faced round again on the librarian Isn t there a register of burials within the Cathedral he inquired Some book in which they re put down
none	none	 I was looking in the Memorials of Wrychester the other day and I saw some names I want to trace 
690-133452-0009	train-other-500	Campany lifted his quill pen and pointed to a case of big leather bound volumes in a far corner of the room Third shelf from the bottom doctor he replied You ll see two books there one s the register of all burials within the Cathedral itself up to date
690-133452-0010	train-other-500	the other s the register of those in Paradise and the cloisters What names are you wanting to trace But Bryce affected not to hear the last question he walked over to the place which Campany had indicated
690-133452-0011	train-other-500	and taking down the second book carried it to an adjacent table Campany called across the room to him You ll find useful indexes at the end he said They re all brought up to the present time from four hundred years ago nearly
690-133452-0012	train-other-500	Bryce turned to the index at the end of his book an index written out in various styles of handwriting And within a minute he found the name he wanted there it was plainly before him
690-133452-0013	train-other-500	Richard Jenkins died March eighth seventeen fifteen buried in Paradise March tenth He nearly laughed aloud at the ease with which he was tracing out what at first had seemed a difficult matter to investigate
690-133452-0014	train-other-500	But lest his task should seem too easy he continued to turn over the leaves of the big folio and in order to have an excuse if the librarian should ask him any further questions he memorized some of the names which he saw And after a while he took the book back to its shelf
690-133452-0015	train-other-500	and turned to the wall on which the charts and maps were hung There was one there of Paradise whereon was marked the site and names of all the tombs and graves in that ancient enclosure
none	none	 from it he hoped to ascertain the exact position and whereabouts of Richard Jenkins s grave 
690-133452-0016	train-other-500	But here Bryce met his first check Down each side of the old chart dated eighteen fifty there was a tabulated list of the tombs in Paradise The names of families and persons were given in this list
690-133452-0017	train-other-500	against each name was a number corresponding with the same number marked on the various divisions of the chart
none	none	 And there was no Richard Jenkins on that list he went over it carefully twice thrice It was not there 
690-133452-0018	train-other-500	Obviously if the tomb of Richard Jenkins who was buried in Paradise in seventeen fifteen
none	none	 was still there amongst the cypresses and yew trees 
690-133452-0019	train-other-500	the name and inscription on it had vanished worn away by time and weather when that chart had been made a hundred and thirty five years later
none	none	 And in that case what did the memorandum mean which Bryce had found in the dead man s purse 
690-133452-0020	train-other-500	He turned away at last from the chart at a loss and Campany glanced at him Found what you wanted he asked Oh yes replied Bryce primed with a ready answer I just wanted to see where the Spelbanks were buried quite a lot of them I see
690-133452-0021	train-other-500	Southeast corner of Paradise said Campany Several tombs I could have spared you the trouble of looking You re a regular encyclopaedia about the place laughed Bryce I suppose you know every spout and gargoyle Ought to answered the librarian
690-133452-0022	train-other-500	I ve been fed on it man and boy for five and forty years Bryce made some fitting remark and went out and home to his rooms there to spend most of the ensuing evening in trying to puzzle out the various mysteries of the day
690-133452-0023	train-other-500	He got no more light on them then and he was still exercising his brains on them when he went to the inquest next morning to find the Coroner s court packed to the doors with an assemblage of townsfolk just as curious as he was
690-133452-0024	train-other-500	And as he sat there listening to the preliminaries and to the evidence of the first witnesses his active and scheming mind figured to itself not without much cynical amusement
none	none	 how a word or two from his lips would go far to solve matters 
690-133452-0025	train-other-500	He thought of what he might tell if he told all the truth He thought of what he might get out of Ransford if he Bryce were Coroner or solicitor and had Ransford in that witness box He would ask him on his oath if he knew that dead man
690-133452-0026	train-other-500	if he had had dealings with him in times past if he had met and spoken to him on that eventful morning he would ask him point blank if it was not his hand that had thrown him to his death But Bryce had no intention of making any revelations just then
690-133452-0027	train-other-500	as for himself he was going to tell just as much as he pleased and no more
none	none	 And so he sat and heard and knew from what he heard that everybody there was in a hopeless fog and that in all that crowd there was but one man who had any real suspicion of the truth 
690-133452-0028	train-other-500	and that that man was himself The evidence given in the first stages of the inquiry was all known to Bryce and to most people in the court already
none	none	 mister Dellingham told how he had met the dead man in the train 
690-133452-0029	train-other-500	journeying from London to Wrychester missus Partingley told how he had arrived at the Mitre registered in her book as mister John Braden and had next morning asked if he could get a conveyance for Saxonsteade in the afternoon as he wished to see the Duke
690-133452-0030	train-other-500	mister Folliot testified to having seen him in the Cathedral going towards one of the stairways leading to the gallery Varner most important witness of all up to that point told of what he had seen
690-133452-0031	train-other-500	Bryce himself followed by Ransford gave medical evidence Mitchington told of his examination of the dead man s clothing and effects in his room at the Mitre And Mitchington added the first information which was new to Bryce
690-133452-0032	train-other-500	In consequence of finding the book about Barthorpe in the suit case said Mitchington we sent a long telegram yesterday to the police there telling them what had happened
690-133452-0033	train-other-500	and asking them to make the most careful inquiries at once about any townsman of theirs of the name of John Braden and to wire us the result of such inquiries this morning This is their reply received by us an hour ago
690-133452-0034	train-other-500	Nothing whatever is known at Barthorpe which is a very small town of any person of that name So much for that thought Bryce He turned with more interest to the next witness the Duke of Saxonsteade the great local magnate
690-133452-0035	train-other-500	a big bluff man who had been present in court since the beginning of the proceedings in which he was manifestly highly interested It was possible that he might be able to tell something of moment he might after all know something of this apparently mysterious stranger
690-133452-0036	train-other-500	who for anything that missus Partingley or anybody else could say to the contrary might have had an appointment and business with him But his Grace knew nothing
none	none	 He had never heard the name of John Braden in his life so far as he remembered 
690-133452-0037	train-other-500	He had just seen the body of the unfortunate man and had looked carefully at the features He was not a man of whom he had any knowledge whatever he could not recollect ever having seen him anywhere at any time He knew literally nothing of him
690-133452-0038	train-other-500	could not think of any reason at all why this mister John Braden should wish to see him
none	none	 Your Grace has no doubt had business dealings with a good many people at one time or another suggested the Coroner 
690-133452-0039	train-other-500	Some of them perhaps with men whom your Grace only saw for a brief space of time a few minutes possibly You don t remember ever seeing this man in that way I m credited with having an unusually good memory for faces answered the Duke
690-133452-0040	train-other-500	And if I may say so rightly But I don t remember this man at all in fact I d go as far as to say that I m positive I ve never knowingly set eyes on him in my life
none	none	 Can your Grace suggest any reason at all why he should wish to call on you asked the Coroner 
690-133452-0041	train-other-500	None But then replied the Duke there might be many reasons unknown to me but at which I can make a guess If he was an antiquary there are lots of old things at Saxonsteade which he might wish to see Or he might be a lover of pictures
690-133452-0042	train-other-500	our collection is a bit famous you know Perhaps he was a bookman we have some rare editions
none	none	 I could go on multiplying reasons but to what purpose 
690-133452-0043	train-other-500	The fact is your Grace doesn t know him and knows nothing about him observed the Coroner
none	none	 Just so nothing agreed the Duke and stepped down again 
690-133452-0044	train-other-500	It was at this stage that the Coroner sent the jurymen away in charge of his officer to make a careful personal inspection of the gallery in the clerestory And while they were gone there was some commotion caused in the court by the entrance of a police official
690-133452-0045	train-other-500	who conducted to the Coroner a middle aged well dressed man whom Bryce at once set down as a London commercial magnate of some quality Between the new arrival and the Coroner an interchange of remarks was at once made
690-133452-0046	train-other-500	shared in presently by some of the officials at the table And when the jury came back the stranger was at once ushered into the witness box and the Coroner turned to the jury and the court
none	none	 We are unexpectedly able to get some evidence of identity gentlemen he observed The gentleman who has just stepped into the witness box is mister Alexander Chilstone manager of the London Colonies Bank in Threadneedle Street 
690-133452-0048	train-other-500	mister Chilstone saw particulars of this matter in the newspapers this morning and he at once set off to Wrychester to tell us what he knows of the dead man We are very much obliged to mister Chilstone
none	none	 and when he has been sworn he will perhaps kindly tell us what he can 
690-133452-0049	train-other-500	In the midst of the murmur of sensation which ran round the court
none	none	 Bryce indulged himself with a covert look at Ransford who was sitting opposite to him 
690-133452-0050	train-other-500	beyond the table in the centre of the room He saw at once that Ransford however strenuously he might be fighting to keep his face under control
none	none	 was most certainly agitated by the Coroner s announcement 
690-133452-0051	train-other-500	His cheeks had paled his eyes were a little dilated
none	none	 his lips parted as he stared at the bank manager 
690-133452-0052	train-other-500	altogether it was more than mere curiosity that was indicated on his features And Bryce satisfied and secretly elated turned to hear what mister Alexander Chilstone had to tell
none	none	 That was not much but it was of considerable importance Only two days before said mister Chilstone that was on the day previous to his death mister John Braden had called at the London Colonies Bank of which he mister Chilstone was manager and introducing himself as having just arrived in England from Australia where he said he had been living for some years had asked to be allowed to open an account He produced some references from agents of the London Colonies Bank in Melbourne which were highly satisfactory 
690-133452-0055	train-other-500	the account being opened he paid into it a sum of ten thousand pounds in a draft at sight drawn by one of those agents He drew nothing against this remarking casually that he had plenty of money in his pocket for the present he did not even take the cheque book which was offered him
690-133452-0056	train-other-500	saying that he would call for it later He did not give us any address in London nor in England continued the witness He told me that he had only arrived at Charing Cross that very morning having travelled from Paris during the night
690-133452-0057	train-other-500	He said that he should settle down for a time at some residential hotel in London and in the meantime he had one or two calls or visits to make in the country when he returned from them he said he would call on me again He gave me very little information about himself
690-133452-0058	train-other-500	it was not necessary for his references from our agents in Australia were quite satisfactory But he did mention that he had been out there for some years and had speculated in landed property he also said that he was now going to settle in England for good
690-133452-0059	train-other-500	That concluded mister Chilstone is all I can tell of my own knowledge But he added drawing a newspaper from his pocket here is an advertisement which I noticed in this morning s Times as I came down You will observe he said as he passed it to the Coroner
none	none	 that it has certainly been inserted by our unfortunate customer The Coroner glanced at a marked passage in the personal column of the Times and read it aloud 
690-133452-0060	train-other-500	The advertisement is as follows he announced If this meets the eye of old friend Marco he will learn that Sticker wishes to see him again Write J Braden
none	none	 c o London Colonies Bank Threadneedle Street London Bryce was keeping a quiet eye on Ransford 
690-133452-0061	train-other-500	Was he mistaken in believing that he saw him start
none	none	 that he saw his cheek flush as he heard the advertisement read out He believed he was not mistaken but if he was right Ransford the next instant regained full control of himself and made no sign 
690-133452-0062	train-other-500	And Bryce turned again to Coroner and witness But the witness had no more to say except to suggest that the bank s Melbourne agents should be cabled to for information since it was unlikely that much more could be got in England
690-133452-0063	train-other-500	And with that the middle stage of the proceedings ended and the last one came watched by Bryce with increasing anxiety For it was soon evident from certain remarks made by the Coroner
690-133452-0064	train-other-500	that the theory which Archdale had put forward at the club in Bryce s hearing the previous day had gained favour with the authorities and that the visit of the jurymen to the scene of the disaster had been intended by the Coroner to predispose them in behalf of it
690-133452-0065	train-other-500	And now Archdale himself as representing the architects who held a retaining fee in connection with the Cathedral was called to give his opinion
none	none	 and he gave it in almost the same words which Bryce had heard him use twenty four hours previously 
690-133452-0066	train-other-500	After him came the master mason expressing the same decided conviction that the real truth was that the pavement of the gallery had at that particular place become so smooth and was inclined towards the open doorway at such a sharp angle
690-133452-0067	train-other-500	that the unfortunate man had lost his footing on it and before he could recover it had been shot out of the arch and over the broken head of saint Wrytha s Stair And though at a juryman s wish Varner was recalled and stuck stoutly to his original story of having seen a hand
690-133452-0068	train-other-500	which he protested was certainly not that of the dead man it soon became plain that the jury shared the Coroner s belief that Varner in his fright and excitement had been mistaken and no one was surprised when the foreman after a very brief consultation with his fellows
690-133452-0069	train-other-500	announced a verdict of death by misadventure
none	none	 So the city s cleared of the stain of murder said a man who sat next to Bryce 
690-133452-0070	train-other-500	That s a good job anyway Nasty thing doctor
none	none	 to think of a murder being committed in a cathedral There d be a question of sacrilege of course and all sorts of complications Bryce made no answer He was watching Ransford who was talking to the Coroner And he was not mistaken now Ransford s face bore all the signs of infinite relief From what Bryce turned to leave the stuffy rapidly emptying court And as he passed the centre table he saw old Simpson Harker who after sitting in attentive silence for three hours had 
476_133471_000007_000006	train-clean-360	come up 
none	none	to it picked up the History of Barthorpe which had been found in Braden s suit case and was inquisitively peering at its title page CHAPTER VII THE DOUBLE TRAIL Pemberton Bryce was not the only person in Wrychester who was watching Ransford with keen attention during these events Mary Bewery a young woman of more than usual powers of observation and penetration had been quick to see that her guardian s distress over the affair in Paradise was something out of the common She knew Ransford for an exceedingly tender hearted man with a considerable spice of sentiment in his composition he was noted for his more than professional interest in the poorer sort of his patients and had gained a deserved reputation in the town for his care of them But it was somewhat surprising even to Mary that he should be so much upset by the death of a total stranger as to lose his appetite and for at any rate a couple of days be so restless that his conduct could not fail to be noticed by herself and her brother His remarks on the tragedy were conventional enough a most distressing affair a sad fate for the poor fellow most unexplainable and mysterious and so on but his concern obviously went beyond that He was ill at ease when she questioned him about the facts almost irritable when Dick Bewery schoolboy like asked him concerning professional details she was sure from the lines about his eyes and a worn look on his face that he had passed a restless night when he came down to breakfast on the morning of the inquest But when he returned from the inquest she noticed a change it was evident to her ready wits that Ransford had experienced a great relief He spoke of relief indeed that night at dinner observing that the verdict which the jury had returned had cleared the air of a foul suspicion it would have been no pleasant matter he said if Wrychester Cathedral had gained an unenviable notoriety as the scene of a murder All the same remarked Dick who knew all the talk of the town Varner persists in sticking to what he s said all along Varner says said this afternoon after the inquest was over that he s absolutely certain of what he saw and that he not only saw a hand in a white cuff and black coat sleeve but that he saw the sun gleam for a second on the links in the cuff as if they were gold or diamonds Pretty stiff evidence that sir isn t it In the state of mind in which Varner was at that moment replied Ransford he wouldn t be very well able to decide definitely on what he really did see His vision would retain confused images Probably he saw the dead man s hand he was wearing a black coat and white linen The verdict was a most sensible one No more was said after that and that evening Ransford was almost himself again But not quite himself Mary caught him looking very grave in evident abstraction more than once more than once she heard him sigh heavily But he said no more of the matter until two days later when at breakfast he announced his intention of attending John Braden s funeral which was to take place that morning I ve ordered the brougham for eleven he said and I ve arranged with doctor Nicholson to attend to any urgent call that comes in between that and noon so if there is any such call you can telephone to him A few of us are going to attend this poor man s funeral it would be too bad to allow a stranger to go to his grave unattended especially after such a fate There ll be somebody representing the Dean and Chapter and three or four principal townsmen so he ll not be quite neglected And here he hesitated and looked a little nervously at Mary to whom he was telling all this Dick having departed for school there s a little matter I wish you d attend to you ll do it better than I should The man seems to have been friendless here at any rate no relations have come forward in spite of the publicity so don t you think it would be rather considerate eh to put a wreath or a cross or something of that sort on his grave just to show you know Very kind of you to think of it said Mary What do you wish me to do If you d go to Gardales the florists and order something fitting you know replied Ransford and afterwards later in the day take it to saint Wigbert s Churchyard he s to be buried there take it if you don t mind yourself you know Certainly answered Mary I ll see that it s done She would do anything that seemed good to Ransford but all the same she wondered at this somewhat unusual show of interest in a total stranger She put it down at last to Ransford s undoubted sentimentality the man s sad fate had impressed him And that afternoon the sexton at saint Wigbert s pointed out the new grave to Miss Bewery and mister Sackville Bonham one carrying a wreath and the other a large bunch of lilies Sackville chancing to encounter Mary at the florist s whither he had repaired to execute a commission for his mother had heard her business and had been so struck by the notion or by a desire to ingratiate himself with Miss Bewery that he had immediately bought flowers himself to be put down to her account and insisted on accompanying Mary to the churchyard Bryce heard of this tribute to John Braden next day from missus Folliot Sackville Bonham s mother a large lady who dominated certain circles of Wrychester society in several senses missus Folliot was one of those women who have been gifted by nature with capacity she was conspicuous in many ways Her voice was masculine she stood nearly six feet in her stoutly soled shoes her breadth corresponded to her height her eyes were piercing her nose Roman there was not a curate in Wrychester who was not under her thumb and if the Dean himself saw her coming he turned hastily into the nearest shop sweating with fear lest she should follow him Endued with riches and fortified by assurance missus Folliot was the presiding spirit in many movements of charity and benevolence there were people in Wrychester who were unkind enough to say behind her back that she was as meddlesome as she was most undoubtedly autocratic but as one of her staunchest clerical defenders once pointed out these grumblers were what might be contemptuously dismissed as five shilling subscribers missus Folliot in her way was undoubtedly a power and for reasons of his own Pemberton Bryce whenever he met her which was fairly often was invariably suave and polite Most mysterious thing this doctor Bryce remarked missus Folliot in her deepest tones encountering Bryce the day after the funeral at the corner of a back street down which she was about to sail on one of her charitable missions to the terror of any of the women who happened to be caught gossiping What now should make doctor Ransford cause flowers to be laid on the grave of a total stranger A sentimental feeling Fiddle de dee There must be some reason I m afraid I don t know what you re talking about missus Folliot answered Bryce whose ears had already lengthened Has doctor Ransford been laying flowers on a grave I didn t know of it My engagement with doctor Ransford terminated two days ago so I ve seen nothing of him My son mister Sackville Bonham said missus Folliot tells me that yesterday Miss Bewery came into Gardales and spent a sovereign actually a sovereign on a wreath which she told Sackville she was about to carry at her guardian s desire to this strange man s grave Sackville who is a warm hearted boy was touched he too bought flowers and accompanied Miss Bewery Most extraordinary A perfect stranger Dear me why nobody knows who the man was Except his bank manager remarked Bryce who says he s holding ten thousand pounds of his That admitted missus Folliot gravely is certainly a consideration But then who knows the money may have been stolen Now really did you ever hear of a quite respectable man who hadn t even a visiting card or a letter upon him And from Australia too where all the people that are wanted run away to I have actually been tempted to wonder doctor Bryce if doctor Ransford knew this man in years gone by He might have you know he might have certainly And that of course would explain the flowers There is a great deal in the matter that requires explanation missus Folliot said Bryce He was wondering if it would be wise to instil some minute drop of poison into the lady s mind there to increase in potency and in due course to spread I of course I may have been mistaken I certainly thought doctor Ransford seemed unusually agitated by this affair it appeared to upset him greatly So I have heard from others who were at the inquest responded missus Folliot In my opinion our Coroner a worthy man otherwise is not sufficiently particular I said to mister Folliot this morning on reading the newspaper that in my view that inquest should have been adjourned for further particulars Now I know of one particular that was never mentioned at the inquest Oh said Bryce And what missus Deramore who lives as you know next to doctor Ransford replied missus Folliot told me this morning that on the morning of the accident happening to look out of one of her upper windows she saw a man whom from the description given in the newspapers was missus Deramore feels assured was the mysterious stranger crossing the Close towards the Cathedral in missus Deramore is positive a dead straight line from doctor Ransford s garden as if he had been there doctor Bryce a direct question should have been asked of doctor Ransford had he ever seen that man before Ah but you see missus Folliot the Coroner didn t know what missus Deramore saw so he couldn t ask such a question nor could any one else remarked Bryce who was wondering how long missus Deramore remained at her upper window and if she saw him follow Braden But there are circumstances no doubt which ought to be inquired into And it s certainly very curious that doctor Ransford should send a wreath to the grave of a stranger He went away convinced that missus Folliot s inquisitiveness had been aroused and that her tongue would not be idle missus Folliot left to herself had the gift of creating an atmosphere and if she once got it into her head that there was some mysterious connection between doctor Ransford and the dead man she would never rest until she had spread her suspicions But as for Bryce himself he wanted more than suspicions he wanted facts particulars data And once more he began to go over the sum of evidence which had accrued The question of the scrap of paper found in Braden s purse and of the exact whereabouts of Richard Jenkins s grave in Paradise he left for the time being What was now interesting him chiefly was the advertisement in the Times to which the bank manager from London had drawn attention He had made haste to buy a copy of the Times and to cut out the advertisement There it was old friend Marco was wanted by presumably old friend Sticker and whoever Sticker might be he could certainly be found under care of J Braden It had never been in doubt a moment in Bryce s mind that Sticker was J Braden himself Who now was Marco Who a million to one on it but Ransford whose Christian name was Mark He reckoned up his chances of getting at the truth of the affair anew that night As things were it seemed unlikely that any relations of Braden would now turn up The Wrychester Paradise case as the reporters had aptly named it had figured largely in the newspapers London and provincial it could scarcely have had more publicity yet no one save this bank manager had come forward If there had been any one to come forward the bank manager s evidence would surely have proved an incentive to speed for there was a sum of ten thousand pounds awaiting John Braden s next of kin In Bryce s opinion the chance of putting in a claim to ten thousand pounds is not left waiting forty eight hours whoever saw such a chance would make instant use of telegraph or telephone But no message from anybody professing relationship with the dead man had so far reached the Wrychester police When everything had been taken into account Bryce saw no better clue for the moment than that suggested by Ambrose Campany Barthorpe Ambrose Campany bookworm though he was was a shrewd sharp fellow said Bryce a man of ideas There was certainly much in his suggestion that a man wasn t likely to buy an old book about a little insignificant town like Barthorpe unless he had some interest in it Barthorpe if Campany s theory were true was probably the place of John Braden s origin Therefore information about Braden leading to knowledge of his association or connection with Ransford might be found at Barthorpe True the Barthorpe police had already reported that they could tell nothing about any Braden but that in Bryce s opinion was neither here nor there he had already come to the conclusion that Braden was an assumed name And if he went to Barthorpe he was not going to trouble the police he knew better methods than that of finding things out Was he going was it worth his while A moment s reflection decided that matter anything was worth his while which would help him to get a strong hold on Mark Ransford And always practical in his doings he walked round to the Free Library obtained a gazeteer and looked up particulars of Barthorpe There he learnt that Barthorpe was an ancient market town of two thousand inhabitants in the north of Leicestershire famous for nothing except that it had been the scene of a battle at the time of the Wars of the Roses and that its trade was mainly in agriculture and stocking making evidently a slow sleepy old place That night Bryce packed a hand bag with small necessaries for a few days excursion and next morning he took an early train to London the end of that afternoon found him in a Midland northern bound express looking out on the undulating green acres of Leicestershire And while his train was making a three minutes stop at Leicester itself the purpose of his journey was suddenly recalled to him by hearing the strident voices of the porters on the platform Barthorpe next stop next stop Barthorpe One of two other men who shared a smoking compartment with Bryce turned to his companion as the train moved off again Barthorpe he remarked That s the place that was mentioned in connection with that very queer affair at Wrychester that s been reported in the papers so much these last few days The mysterious stranger who kept ten thousand in a London bank and of whom nobody seems to know anything had nothing on him but a history of Barthorpe Odd And yet though you d think he d some connection with the place or had known it they say nobody at Barthorpe knows anything about anybody of his name Well I don t know that there is anything so very odd about it after all replied the other man He may have picked up that old book for one of many reasons that could be suggested No I read all that case in the papers and I wasn t so much impressed by the old book feature of it But I ll tell you what there was a thing struck me I know this Barthorpe district we shall be in it in a few minutes I ve been a good deal over it This strange man s name was given in the papers as John Braden Now close to Barthorpe a mile or two outside it there s a village of that name Braden Medworth That s a curious coincidence and taken in conjunction with the man s possession of an old book about Barthorpe why perhaps there s something in it possibly more than I thought for at first Well it s an odd case a very odd case said the first speaker And as there s ten thousand pounds in question more will be heard of it Somebody ll be after that you may be sure Bryce left the train at Barthorpe thanking his good luck the man in the far corner had unwittingly given him a hint He would pay a visit to Braden Medworth the coincidence was too striking to be neglected But first Barthorpe itself a quaint old world little market town in which some of even the principal houses still wore roofs of thatch and wherein the old custom of ringing the curfew bell was kept up He found an old fashioned hotel in the marketplace under the shadow of the parish church and in its oak panelled dining room hung about with portraits of masters of foxhounds and queer old prints of sporting and coaching days he dined comfortably and well It was too late to attempt any investigations that evening and when Bryce had finished his leisurely dinner he strolled into the smoking room an even older and quainter apartment than that which he had just left It was one of those rooms only found in very old houses a room of nooks and corners with a great open fireplace and old furniture and old pictures and curiosities the sort of place to which the old fashioned tradesmen of the small provincial towns still resort of an evening rather than patronize the modern political clubs There were several men of this sort in the room when Bryce entered talking local politics amongst themselves and he found a quiet corner and sat down in it to smoke promising himself some amusement from the conversation around him it was his way to find interest and amusement in anything that offered But he had scarcely settled down in a comfortably cushioned elbow chair when the door opened again and into the room walked old Simpson Harker CHAPTER VIII THE BEST MAN 
1049-133454-0000	train-other-500	Old Harker s shrewd eyes travelling round the room as if to inspect the company in which he found himself fell almost immediately on Bryce but not before Bryce had had time to assume an air and look of innocent and genuine surprise
1049-133454-0001	train-other-500	Harker affected no surprise at all he looked the astonishment he felt as the younger man rose and motioned him to the comfortable easy chair which he himself had just previously taken Dear me he exclaimed nodding his thanks
none	none	 I d no idea that I should meet you in these far off parts doctor Bryce 
1049-133454-0002	train-other-500	This is a long way from Wrychester sir for Wrychester folk to meet in I d no idea of meeting you mister Harker responded Bryce But it s a small world you know and there are a good many coincidences in it
1049-133454-0003	train-other-500	There s nothing very wonderful in my presence here though I ran down to see after a country practice I ve left doctor Ransford He had the lie ready as soon as he set eyes on Harker and whether the old man believed it or not
1049-133454-0004	train-other-500	he showed no sign of either belief or disbelief He took the chair which Bryce drew forward and pulled out an old fashioned cigar case offering it to his companion Will you try one doctor he asked Genuine stuff that sir
none	none	 I ve a friend in Cuba who remembers me now and then 
1049-133454-0005	train-other-500	No he went on as Bryce thanked him and took a cigar I didn t know you d finished with the doctor Quietish place this to practise in I should think much quieter even than our sleepy old city
1049-133454-0006	train-other-500	You know it inquired Bryce
none	none	 I ve a friend lives here 
1049-133454-0007	train-other-500	old friend of mine answered Harker I come down to see him now and then I ve been here since yesterday He does a bit of business for me Stopping long doctor Only just to look round answered Bryce
1049-133454-0008	train-other-500	I m off tomorrow morning eleven o clock said Harker It s a longish journey to Wrychester for old bones like mine Oh you re all right worth half a dozen younger men responded Bryce
none	none	 You ll see a lot of your contemporaries out mister Harker 
1049-133454-0009	train-other-500	Well as you ve treated me to a very fine cigar now you ll let me treat you to a drop of whisky they generally have something of pretty good quality in these old fashioned establishments I believe The two travellers sat talking until bedtime
1049-133454-0010	train-other-500	but neither made any mention of the affair which had recently set all Wrychester agog with excitement But Bryce was wondering all the time if his companion s story of having a friend at Barthorpe was no more than an excuse and when he was alone in his own bedroom and reflecting more seriously
1049-133454-0011	train-other-500	he came to the conclusion that old Harker was up to some game of his own in connection with the Paradise mystery The old chap was in the Library when Ambrose Campany said that there was a clue in that Barthorpe history he mused
none	none	 I saw him myself examining the book after the inquest 
1049-133454-0012	train-other-500	No no mister Harker the facts are too plain the evidences too obvious And yet what interest has a retired old tradesman of Wrychester got in this affair
none	none	 I d give a good deal to know what Harker really is doing here 
1049-133454-0013	train-other-500	and who his Barthorpe friend is
none	none	 If Bryce had risen earlier next morning 
1049-133454-0014	train-other-500	and had taken the trouble to track old Harker s movements he would have learnt something that would have made him still more suspicious But Bryce seeing no reason for hurry lay in bed till well past nine o clock and did not present himself in the coffee room until nearly half past ten
1049-133454-0015	train-other-500	And at that hour Simpson Harker who had breakfasted before nine was in close consultation with his friend that friend being none other than the local superintendent of police who was confidentially closeted with the old man in his private house whither Harker
1049-133454-0016	train-other-500	by previous arrangement had repaired as soon as his breakfast was over Had Bryce been able to see through walls or hear through windows he would have been surprised to find that the Harker of this consultation was not the quiet easy going
1049-133454-0017	train-other-500	gossipy old gentleman of Wrychester but an eminently practical and business like man of affairs And now as regards this young fellow who s staying across there at the Peacock he was saying in conclusion
1049-133454-0018	train-other-500	at the very time that Bryce was leisurely munching his second mutton chop in the Peacock coffee room he s after something or other
none	none	 his talk about coming here to see after a practice is all lies and you ll keep an eye on him while he s in your neighbourhood 
1049-133454-0019	train-other-500	Put your best plainclothes man on to him at once he ll easily know him from the description I gave you and let him shadow him wherever he goes And then let me know of his movement he s certainly on the track of something
1049-133454-0020	train-other-500	and what he does may be useful to me I can link it up with my own work And as regards the other matter keep me informed if you come on anything further Now I ll go out by your garden and down the back of the town to the station
1049-133454-0021	train-other-500	Let me know by the by when this young man at the Peacock leaves here and if possible and you can find out for where
1049-133454-0022	train-other-500	Bryce was all unconscious that any one was interested in his movements when he strolled out into Barthorpe market place just after eleven He had asked a casual question of the waiter and found that the old gentleman had departed he accordingly believed himself free from observation
1049-133454-0023	train-other-500	And forthwith he set about his work of inquiry in his own fashion He was not going to draw any attention to himself by asking questions of present day inhabitants whose curiosity might then be aroused he knew better methods than that
none	none	 Every town said Bryce to himself 
1049-133454-0024	train-other-500	possesses public records parish registers burgess rolls lists of voters even small towns have directories which are more or less complete he could search these for any mention or record of anybody or any family of the name of Braden
1049-133454-0025	train-other-500	And he spent all that day in that search inspecting numerous documents and registers and books and when evening came he had a very complete acquaintance with the family nomenclature of Barthorpe
none	none	 and he was prepared to bet odds against any one of the name of Braden having lived there during the past half century 
1049-133454-0026	train-other-500	In all his searching he had not once come across the name The man who had spent a very lazy day in keeping an eye on Bryce as he visited the various public places whereat he made his researches was also keeping an eye upon him next morning when Bryce breakfasting earlier than usual
none	none	 prepared for a second day s labours 
1049-133454-0027	train-other-500	He followed his quarry away from the little town
none	none	 Bryce was walking out to Braden Medworth 
1049-133454-0028	train-other-500	In Bryce s opinion it was something of a wild goose chase to go there but the similarity in the name of the village and of the dead man at Wrychester might have its significance and it was but a two miles stroll from Barthorpe
none	none	 He found Braden Medworth a very small quiet and picturesque place with an old church on the banks of a river 
1049-133454-0029	train-other-500	which promised good sport to anglers And there he pursued his tactics of the day before and went straight to the vicarage and its vicar
none	none	 with a request to be allowed to inspect the parish registers 
1049-133454-0030	train-other-500	The vicar having no objection to earning the resultant fees hastened to comply with Bryce s request and inquired how far back he wanted to search and for what particular entry No particular entry answered Bryce and as to period
1049-133454-0031	train-other-500	fairly recent The fact is I am interested in names
none	none	 I am thinking here he used one more of his easily found inventions 
1049-133454-0032	train-other-500	of writing a book on English surnames
none	none	 and am just now inspecting parish registers in the Midlands for that purpose 
1049-133454-0033	train-other-500	Then I can considerably simplify your labours said the vicar taking down a book from one of his shelves Our parish registers have been copied and printed and here is the volume everything is in there from fifteen seventy to ten years ago and there is a very full index
none	none	 Are you staying in the neighbourhood or the village 
1049-133454-0034	train-other-500	In the neighbourhood yes in the village
none	none	 no longer than the time I shall spend in getting some lunch at the inn yonder 
1049-133454-0035	train-other-500	answered Bryce nodding through an open window at an ancient tavern which stood in the valley beneath close to an old stone bridge
none	none	 Perhaps you will kindly lend me this book for an hour 
1049-133454-0036	train-other-500	then if I see anything very noteworthy in the index I can look at the actual registers when I bring it back
none	none	 The vicar replied that that was precisely what he had been about to suggest 
1049-133454-0037	train-other-500	and Bryce carried the book away And while he sat in the inn parlour awaiting his lunch he turned to the carefully compiled index
none	none	 glancing it through rapidly 
1049-133454-0038	train-other-500	On the third page he saw the name Bewery If the man who had followed Bryce from Barthorpe to Braden Medworth had been with him in the quiet inn parlour he would have seen his quarry start and heard him let a stifled exclamation escape his lips
1049-133454-0039	train-other-500	But the follower knowing his man was safe for an hour was in the bar outside eating bread and cheese and drinking ale and Bryce s surprise was witnessed by no one Yet he had been so much surprised that if all Wrychester had been there he could not
1049-133454-0040	train-other-500	despite his self training in watchfulness have kept back either start or exclamation
none	none	 Bewery 
1049-133454-0041	train-other-500	A name so uncommon that here here in this out of the way Midland village there must be some connection with the object of his search There the name stood out before him to the exclusion of all others Bewery
none	none	 with just one entry of figures against it 
1049-133454-0042	train-other-500	He turned to page three hundred eighty seven with a sense of sure discovery And there an entry caught his eye at once and he knew that he had discovered more than he had ever hoped for He read it again and again gloating over his wonderful luck
1049-133454-0043	train-other-500	June nineteenth eighteen ninety one John Brake bachelor of the parish of saint Pancras London to Mary Bewery spinster of this parish by the Vicar Witnesses
1049-133454-0044	train-other-500	Charles Claybourne Selina Womersley Mark Ransford Twenty two years ago The Mary Bewery whom Bryce knew in Wrychester was just about twenty this Mary Bewery
none	none	 spinster of Braden Medworth was 
1049-133454-0045	train-other-500	then in all probability her mother But John Brake who married that Mary Bewery who was he Who indeed laughed Bryce
none	none	 but John Braden who had just come by his death in Wrychester Paradise 
1049-133454-0046	train-other-500	And there was the name of Mark Ransford as witness What was the further probability That Mark Ransford had been John Brake s best man
none	none	 that he was the Marco of the recent Times advertisement 
1049-133454-0047	train-other-500	that John Braden or Brake was the Sticker of the same advertisement Clear clear as noonday And what did it all mean and imply
1049-133454-0048	train-other-500	and what bearing had it on Braden or Brake s death Before he ate his cold beef Bryce had copied the entry from the reprinted register and had satisfied himself that Ransford was not a name known to that village
1049-133454-0049	train-other-500	Mark Ransford was the only person of the name mentioned in the register And his lunch done he set off for the vicarage again intent on getting further information and before he reached the vicarage gates noticed by accident
1049-133454-0050	train-other-500	a place whereat he was more likely to get it than from the vicar who was a youngish man At the end of the few houses between the inn and the bridge he saw a little shop with the name Charles Claybourne painted roughly above its open window
1049-133454-0051	train-other-500	In that open window sat an old cheery faced man mending shoes who blinked at the stranger through his big spectacles Bryce saw his chance and turned in to open the book and point out the marriage entry
1049-133454-0052	train-other-500	Are you the Charles Claybourne mentioned there he asked without ceremony That s me sir replied the old shoemaker briskly after a glance Yes right enough How came you to witness that marriage
1049-133454-0053	train-other-500	inquired Bryce The old man nodded at the church across the way I ve been sexton and parish clerk two and thirty years sir he said
none	none	 And I took it on from my father 
1049-133454-0054	train-other-500	and he had the job from his father Do you remember this marriage asked Bryce perching himself on the bench at which the shoemaker was working Twenty two years since I see Aye as if it was yesterday
1049-133454-0055	train-other-500	answered the old man with a smile Miss Bewery s marriage why of course Who was she demanded Bryce Governess at the vicarage replied Claybourne Nice sweet young lady
1049-133454-0056	train-other-500	And the man she married mister Brake continued Bryce Who was he A young gentleman that used to come here for the fishing now and then answered Claybourne pointing at the river Famous for our trout we are here you know sir
none	none	 And Brake had come here for three years before they were married him and his friend mister Ransford 
1049-133454-0057	train-other-500	You remember him too asked Bryce Remember both of em very well indeed said Claybourne though I never set eyes on either after Miss Mary was wed to mister Brake But I saw plenty of em both before that
none	none	 They used to put up at the inn there that I saw you come out of just now 
1049-133454-0058	train-other-500	They came two or three times a year and they were a bit thick with our parson of that time not this one his predecessor
none	none	 and they used to go up to the vicarage and smoke their pipes and cigars with him 
1049-133454-0059	train-other-500	and of course mister Brake and the governess fixed it up Though you know at one time it was considered it was going to be her and the other young gentleman mister Ransford yes But in the end it was Brake and Ransford stood best man for him
1049-133454-0060	train-other-500	Bruce assimilated all this information greedily and asked for more I m interested in that entry he said tapping the open book I know some people of the name of Bewery they may be relatives
1049-133454-0061	train-other-500	The shoemaker shook his head as if doubtful I remember hearing it said he remarked that Miss Mary had no relations
none	none	 She d been with the old vicar some time and I don t remember any relations ever coming to see her 
1049-133454-0062	train-other-500	nor her going away to see any Do you know what Brake was asked Bryce As you say he came here for a good many times before the marriage I suppose you d hear something about his profession or trade
none	none	 or whatever it was 
1049-133454-0063	train-other-500	He was a banker that one replied Claybourne A banker that was his trade sir T other gentleman mister Ransford he was a doctor I mind that well enough because once when him and mister Brake were fishing here
1049-133454-0064	train-other-500	Thomas Joynt s wife fell downstairs and broke her leg and they fetched him to her he d got it set before they d got the reg lar doctor out from Barthorpe yonder Bryce had now got all the information he wanted and he made the old parish clerk a small present and turned to go
1049-133454-0065	train-other-500	But another question presented itself to his mind and he reentered the little shop Your late vicar he said The one in whose family Miss Bewery was governess where is he now Dead
none	none	 Can t say whether he s dead or alive sir 
1049-133454-0066	train-other-500	replied Claybourne He left this parish for another a living in a different part of England some years since
none	none	 and I haven t heard much of him from that time to this 
1049-133454-0067	train-other-500	he never came back here once not even to pay us a friendly visit he was a queerish sort But I ll tell you what sir he added
none	none	 evidently anxious to give his visitor good value for his half crown our present vicar has one of those books with the names of all the clergymen in em 
1049-133454-0068	train-other-500	and he d tell you where his predecessor is now if he s alive name of Reverend Thomas Gilwaters M A an Oxford college man he was and very high learned Bryce went back to the vicarage
1049-133454-0069	train-other-500	returned the borrowed book and asked to look at the registers for the year eighteen ninety one He verified his copy and turned to the vicar
none	none	 I accidentally came across the record of a marriage there in which I m interested 
1049-133454-0070	train-other-500	he said as he paid the search fees Celebrated by your predecessor mister Gilwaters
none	none	 I should be glad to know where mister Gilwaters is to be found 
1049-133454-0071	train-other-500	Do you happen to possess a clerical directory The vicar produced a Crockford and Bryce turned over its pages mister Gilwaters who from the account there given appeared to be an elderly man who had now retired lived in London in Bayswater
1049-133454-0072	train-other-500	and Bryce made a note of his address and prepared to depart Find any names that interested you asked the vicar as his caller left Anything noteworthy I found two or three names which interested me immensely
1049-133454-0073	train-other-500	answered Bryce from the foot of the vicarage steps They were well worth searching for
none	none	 And without further explanation he marched off to Barthorpe duly followed by his shadow who saw him safely into the Peacock an hour later and an hour after that went to the police superintendent with his report Gone sir he said Left by the five thirty express for London CHAPTER IX THE HOUSE OF HIS FRIEND Bryce found himself at eleven o clock next morning in a small book lined parlour in a little house which stood in a quiet street in the neighbourhood of Westbourne Grove Over the mantelpiece amongst other odds and ends of pictures and photographs hung a water colour drawing of Braden Medworth and to him presently entered an old silver haired clergyman whom he at once took to be Braden Medworth s former vicar and who glanced inquisitively at his visitor and then at the card which Bryce had sent in with a request for an interview doctor Bryce he said inquiringly doctor Pemberton Bryce Bryce made his best bow and assumed his suavest and most ingratiating manner I hope I am not intruding on your time mister Gilwaters he said The fact is I was referred to you yesterday by the present vicar of Braden Medworth both he and the sexton there Claybourne whom you of course remember thought you would be able to give me some information on a subject which is of great importance to me I don t know the present vicar remarked mister Gilwaters motioning Bryce to a chair and taking another close by Clayborne of course I remember very well indeed he must be getting an old man now like myself What is it you want to know now I shall have to take you into my confidence replied Bryce who had carefully laid his plans and prepared his story and you I am sure mister Gilwaters will respect mine I have for two years been in practice at Wrychester and have there made the acquaintance of a young lady whom I earnestly desire to marry She is the ward of the man to whom I have been assistant And I think you will begin to see why I have come to you when I say that this young lady s name is Mary Bewery The old clergyman started and looked at his visitor with unusual interest He grasped the arm of his elbow chair and leaned forward Mary Bewery he said in a low whisper What what is the name of the man who is her guardian doctor Mark Ransford answered Bryce promptly The old man sat upright again with a little toss of his head Bless my soul he exclaimed Mark Ransford Then it must have been as I feared and suspected Bryce made no remark He knew at once that he had struck on something and it was his method to let people take their own time mister Gilwaters had already fallen into something closely resembling a reverie Bryce sat silently waiting and expectant And at last the old man leaned forward again almost eagerly What is it you want to know he asked repeating his first question Is is there some some mystery Yes replied Bryce A mystery that I want to solve sir And I dare say that you can help me if you ll be so good I am convinced in fact I know that this young lady is in ignorance of her parentage that Ransford is keeping some fact some truth back from her and I want to find things out By the merest chance accident in fact I discovered yesterday at Braden Medworth that some twenty two years ago you married one Mary Bewery who I learnt there was your governess to a John Brake and that Mark Ransford was John Brake s best man and a witness of the marriage Now mister Gilwaters the similarity in names is too striking to be devoid of significance So it s of the utmost importance to me can or will you tell me who was the Mary Bewery you married to John Brake Who was John Brake And what was Mark Ransford to either or to both He was wondering all the time during which he reeled off these questions if mister Gilwaters was wholly ignorant of the recent affair at Wrychester He might be a glance round his book filled room had suggested to Bryce that he was much more likely to be a bookworm than a newspaper reader and it was quite possible that the events of the day had small interest for him And his first words in reply to Bryce s questions convinced Bryce that his surmise was correct and that the old man had read nothing of the Wrychester Paradise mystery in which Ransford s name had of course figured as a witness at the inquest It is nearly twenty years since I heard any of their names remarked mister Gilwaters Nearly twenty years a long time But of course I can answer you Mary Bewery was our governess at Braden Medworth She came to us when she was nineteen she was married four years later She was a girl who had no friends or relatives she had been educated at a school in the North I engaged her from that school where I understood she had lived since infancy Now then as to Brake and Ransford They were two young men from London who used to come fishing in Leicestershire Ransford was a few years the younger he was either a medical student in his last year or he was an assistant somewhere in London Brake was a bank manager in London of a branch of one of the big banks They were pleasant young fellows and I used to ask them to the vicarage Eventually Mary Bewery and John Brake became engaged to be married My wife and I were a good deal surprised we had believed somehow that the favoured man would be Ransford However it was Brake and Brake she married and as you say Ransford was best man Of course Brake took his wife off to London and from the day of her wedding I never saw her again Did you ever see Brake again asked Bryce The old clergyman shook his head Yes he said sadly I did see Brake again under grievous grievous circumstances You won t mind telling me what circumstances suggested Bryce I will keep your confidence mister Gilwaters There is really no secret in it if it comes to that answered the old man I saw John Brake again just once In a prison cell A prison cell exclaimed Bryce And he a prisoner He had just been sentenced to ten years penal servitude replied mister Gilwaters I had heard the sentence I was present I got leave to see him Ten years penal servitude a terrible punishment He must have been released long ago but I never heard more Bryce reflected in silence for a moment reckoning and calculating When was this the trial he asked It was five years after the marriage seventeen years ago replied mister Gilwaters And what had he been doing inquired Bryce Stealing the bank s money answered the old man I forget what the technical offence was embezzlement or something of that sort There was not much evidence came out for it was impossible to offer any defence and he pleaded guilty But I gathered from what I heard that something of this sort occurred Brake was a branch manager He was as it were pounced upon one morning by an inspector who found that his cash was short by two or three thousand pounds The bank people seemed to have been unusually strict and even severe Brake it was said had some explanation but it was swept aside and he was given in charge And the sentence was as I said just now a very savage one I thought But there had recently been some bad cases of that sort in the banking world and I suppose the judge felt that he must make an example Yes a most trying affair I have a report of the case somewhere which I cut out of a London newspaper at the time mister Gilwaters rose and turned to an old desk in the corner of his room and after some rummaging of papers in a drawer produced a newspaper cutting book and traced an insertion in its pages He handed the book to his visitor There is the account he said You can read it for yourself You will notice that in what Brake s counsel said on his behalf there are one or two curious and mysterious hints as to what might have been said if it had been of any use or advantage to say it A strange case Bryce turned eagerly to the faded scrap of newspaper BANK MANAGER S DEFALCATION At the Central Criminal Court yesterday John Brake thirty three formerly manager of the Upper Tooting branch of the London Home Counties Bank limited pleaded guilty to embezzling certain sums the property of his employers mister Walkinshaw Q C addressing the court on behalf of the prisoner said that while it was impossible for his client to offer any defence there were circumstances in the case which if it had been worth while to put them in evidence would have shown that the prisoner was a wronged and deceived man To use a Scriptural phrase Brake had been wounded in the house of his friend The man who was really guilty in this affair had cleverly escaped all consequences nor would it be of the least use to enter into any details respecting him Not one penny of the money in question had been used by the prisoner for his own purposes It was doubtless a wrong and improper thing that his client had done and he had pleaded guilty and would submit to the consequences But if everything in connection with the case could have been told if it would have served any useful purpose to tell it it would have been seen that what the prisoner really was guilty of was a foolish and serious error of judgment He himself concluded the learned counsel would go so far as to say that knowing what he did knowing what had been told him by his client in strict confidence the prisoner though technically guilty was morally innocent His Lordship merely remarking that no excuse of any sort could be offered in a case of this sort sentenced the prisoner to ten years penal servitude Bryce read this over twice before handing back the book Very strange and mysterious mister Gilwaters he remarked You say that you saw Brake after the case was over Did you learn anything Nothing whatever answered the old clergyman I got permission to see him before he was taken away He did not seem particularly pleased or disposed to see me I begged him to tell me what the real truth was He was I think somewhat dazed by the sentence but he was also sullen and morose I asked him where his wife and two children one a mere infant were For I had already been to his private address and had found that missus Brake had sold all the furniture and disappeared completely No one thereabouts at any rate knew where she was or would tell me anything On my asking this he refused to answer I pressed him he said finally that he was only speaking the truth when he replied that he did not know where his wife was I said I must find her He forbade me to make any attempt Then I begged him to tell me if she was with friends I remember very well what he replied I m not going to say one word more to any man living mister Gilwaters he answered determinedly I shall be dead to the world only because I ve been a trusting fool for ten years or thereabouts but when I come back to it I ll let the world see what revenge means Go away he concluded I won t say one word more And I left him And you made no more inquiries about the wife asked Bryce I did what I could replied mister Gilwaters I made some inquiry in the neighbourhood in which they had lived All I could discover was that missus Brake had disappeared under extraordinarily mysterious circumstances There was no trace whatever of her And I speedily found that things were being said the usual cruel suspicions you know Such as what asked Bryce That the amount of the defalcations was much larger than had been allowed to appear replied mister Gilwaters That Brake was a very clever rogue who had got the money safely planted somewhere abroad and that his wife had gone off somewhere Australia or Canada or some other far off region to await his release Of course I didn t believe one word of all that But there was the fact she had vanished And eventually I thought of Ransford as having been Brake s great friend so I tried to find him And then I found that he too who up to that time had been practising in a London suburb Streatham had also disappeared Just after Brake s arrest Ransford had suddenly sold his practice and gone no one knew where but it was believed abroad I couldn t trace him anyway And soon after that I had a long illness and for two or three years was an invalid and well the thing was over and done with and as I said just now I have never heard anything of any of them for all these years And now now you tell me that there is a Mary Bewery who is a ward of a doctor Mark Ransford at where did you say At Wrychester answered Bryce She is a young woman of twenty and she has a brother Richard who is between seventeen and eighteen Without a doubt those are Brake s children exclaimed the old man The infant I spoke of was a boy Bless me how extraordinary How long have they been at Wrychester Ransford has been in practice there some years a few years replied Bryce These two young people joined him there definitely two years ago But from what I have learnt he has acted as their guardian ever since they were mere children And their mother asked mister Gilwaters Said to be dead long since answered Bryce And their father too They know nothing Ransford won t tell them anything But as you say I ve no doubt of it myself now they must be the children of John Brake And have taken the name of their mother remarked the old man Had it given to them said Bryce They don t know that it isn t their real name Of course Ransford has given it to them But now the mother Ah yes the mother said mister Gilwaters Our old governess Dear me I m going to put a question to you continued Bryce leaning nearer and speaking in a low confidential tone You must have seen much of the world mister Gilwaters men of your profession know the world and human nature too Call to mind all the mysterious circumstances the veiled hints of that trial Do you think have you ever thought that the false friend whom the counsel referred to was Ransford Come now The old clergyman lifted his hands and let them fall on his knees I do not know what to say he exclaimed To tell you the truth I have often wondered if if that was what really did happen There is the fact that Brake s wife disappeared mysteriously that Ransford made a similar mysterious disappearance about the same time that Brake was obviously suffering from intense and bitter hatred when I saw him after the trial hatred of some person on whom he meant to be revenged and that his counsel hinted that he had been deceived and betrayed by a friend Now to my knowledge he and Ransford were the closest of friends in the old days before Brake married our governess And I suppose the friendship continued certainly Ransford acted as best man at the wedding But how account for that strange double disappearance Bryce had already accounted for that in his own secret mind And now having got all that he wanted out of the old clergyman he rose to take his leave You will regard this interview as having been of a strictly private nature mister Gilwaters he said Certainly responded the old man But you mentioned that you wished to marry the daughter Now that you know about her father s past for I am sure she must be John Brake s child you won t allow that to eh Not for a moment answered Bryce with a fair show of magnanimity I am not a man of that complexion sir No I only wished to clear up certain things you understand And since she is apparently from what you say in ignorance of her real father s past what then asked mister Gilwaters anxiously Shall you I shall do nothing whatever in any haste replied Bryce Rely upon me to consider her feelings in everything As you have been so kind I will let you know later how matters go This was one of Pemberton Bryce s ready inventions He had not the least intention of ever seeing or communicating with the late vicar of Braden Medworth again mister Gilwaters had served his purpose for the time being He went away from Bayswater and an hour later from London highly satisfied In his opinion Mark Ransford seventeen years before had taken advantage of his friend s misfortunes to run away with his wife and when Brake alias Braden had unexpectedly turned up at Wrychester he had added to his former wrong by the commission of a far greater one CHAPTER X DIPLOMACY Bryce went back to Wrychester firmly convinced that Mark Ransford had killed John Braden He reckoned things up in his own fashion Some years must have elapsed since Braden or rather Brake s release He had probably heard on his release that Ransford and his Brake s wife had gone abroad in that case he would certainly follow them He might have lost all trace of them he might have lost his original interest in his first schemes of revenge he might have begun a new life for himself in Australia whence he had undoubtedly come to England recently But he had come at last and he had evidently tracked Ransford to Wrychester why otherwise had he presented himself at Ransford s door on that eventful morning which was to witness his death Nothing in Bryce s opinion could be clearer Brake had turned up He and Ransford had met most likely in the precincts of the Cathedral Ransford who knew all the quiet corners of the old place had in all probability induced Brake to walk up into the gallery with him had noticed the open doorway had thrown Brake through it All the facts pointed to that conclusion it was a theory which so far as Bryce could see was perfect It ought to be enough proved to put Ransford in a criminal dock Bryce resolved it in his own mind over and over again as he sped home to Wrychester he pictured the police listening greedily to all that he could tell them if he liked There was only one factor in the whole sum of the affair which seemed against him the advertisement in the Times If Brake desired to find Ransford in order to be revenged on him why did he insert that advertisement as if he were longing to meet a cherished friend again But Bryce gaily surmounted that obstacle full of shifts and subtleties himself he was ever ready to credit others with trading in them and he put the advertisement down as a clever ruse to attract not Ransford but some person who could give information about Ransford Whatever its exact meaning might have been its existence made no difference to Bryce s firm opinion that it was Mark Ransford who flung John Brake down saint Wrytha s Stair and killed him He was as sure of that as he was certain that Braden was Brake And he was not going to tell the police of his discoveries he was not going to tell anybody The one thing that concerned him was how best to make use of his knowledge with a view to bringing about a marriage between himself and Mark Ransford s ward He had set his mind on that for twelve months past and he was not a man to be baulked of his purpose By fair means or foul he himself ignored the last word and would have substituted the term skilful for it Pemberton Bryce meant to have Mary Bewery Mary Bewery herself had no thought of Bryce in her head when the morning after that worthy s return to Wrychester she set out alone for the Wrychester Golf Club It was her habit to go there almost every day and Bryce was well acquainted with her movements and knew precisely where to waylay her And empty of Bryce though her mind was she was not surprised when at a lonely place on Wrychester Common Bryce turned the corner of a spinny and met her face to face Mary would have passed on with no more than a silent recognition she had made up her mind to have no further speech with her guardian s dismissed assistant But she had to pass through a wicket gate at that point and Bryce barred the way with unmistakable purpose It was plain to the girl that he had laid in wait for her She was not without a temper of her own and she suddenly let it out on the offender Do you call this manly conduct doctor Bryce she demanded turning an indignant and flushed face on him To waylay me here when you know that I don t want to have anything more to do with you Let me through please and go away But Bryce kept a hand on the little gate and when he spoke there was that in his voice which made the girl listen in spite of herself I m not here on my own behalf he said quickly I give you my word I won t say a thing that need offend you It s true I waited here for you it s the only place in which I thought I could meet you alone I want to speak to you It s this do you know your guardian is in danger Bryce had the gift of plausibility he could convince people against their instincts even against their wills that he was telling the truth And Mary after a swift glance believed him What danger she asked And if he is and if you know he is why don t you go direct to him The most fatal thing in the world to do exclaimed Bryce You know him he can be nasty That would bring matters to a crisis And that in his interest is just what mustn t happen I don t understand you said Mary Bryce leaned nearer to her across the gate You know what happened last week he said in a low voice The strange death of that man Braden Well she asked with a sudden look of uneasiness What of it It s being rumoured whispered in the town that doctor Ransford had something to do with that affair answered Bryce Unpleasant unfortunate but it s a fact Impossible exclaimed Mary with a heightening colour What could he have to do with it What could give rise to such foolish wicked rumours You know as well as I do how people talk how they will talk said Bryce You can t stop them in a place like Wrychester where everybody knows everybody There s a mystery around Braden s death it s no use denying it Nobody knows who he was where he came from why he came And it s being hinted I m only telling you what I ve gathered that doctor Ransford knows more than he s ever told There are I m afraid grounds What grounds demanded Mary While Bryce had been speaking in his usual slow careful fashion she had been reflecting and remembering Ransford s evident agitation at the time of the Paradise affair and his relief when the inquest was over and his sending her with flowers to the dead man s grave and she began to experience a sense of uneasiness and even of fear What grounds can there be she added doctor Ransford didn t know that man had never seen him That s not certain replied Bryce It s said remember I m only repeating things it s said that just before the body was discovered doctor Ransford was seen seen mind you leaving the west porch of the Cathedral looking as if he had just been very much upset Two persons saw this Who are they asked Mary That I m not allowed to tell you said Bryce who had no intention of informing her that one person was himself and the other imaginary But I can assure you that I am certain absolutely certain that their story is true The fact is I can corroborate it You she exclaimed I replied Bryce I will tell you something that I have never told anybody up to now I shan t ask you to respect my confidence I ve sufficient trust in you to know that you will without any asking Listen on that morning doctor Ransford went out of the surgery in the direction of the Deanery leaving me alone there A few minutes later a tap came at the door I opened it and found a man standing outside Not that man asked Mary fearfully That man Braden replied Bryce He asked for doctor Ransford I said he was out would the caller leave his name He said no he had called because he had once known a doctor Ransford years before He added something about calling again and he went away across the Close towards the Cathedral I saw him again not very long afterwards lying in the corner of Paradise dead Mary Bewery was by this time pale and trembling and Bryce continued to watch her steadily She stole a furtive look at him Why didn t you tell all this at the inquest she asked in a whisper Because I knew how damning it would be to Ransford replied Bryce promptly It would have excited suspicion I was certain that no one but myself knew that Braden had been to the surgery door therefore I thought that if I kept silence his calling there would never be known But I have since found that I was mistaken Braden was seen going away from doctor Ransford s By whom asked Mary missus Deramore at the next house answered Bryce She happened to be looking out of an upstairs window She saw him go away and cross the Close Did she tell you that demanded Mary who knew missus Deramore for a gossip Between ourselves said Bryce she did not She told missus Folliot missus Folliot told me So it is talked about exclaimed Mary I said so assented Bryce You know what missus Folliot s tongue is Then doctor Ransford will get to hear of it said Mary He will be the last person to get to hear of it affirmed Bryce These things are talked of hole and corner fashion a long time before they reach the ears of the person chiefly concerned Mary hesitated a moment before she asked her next question Why have you told me all this she demanded at last Because I didn t want you to be suddenly surprised answered Bryce This whatever it is may come to a sudden head of an unpleasant sort These rumours spread and the police are still keen about finding out things concerning this dead man If they once get it into their heads that doctor Ransford knew him Mary laid her hand on the gate between them and Bryce who had done all he wished to do at that time instantly opened it and she passed through I am much obliged to you she said I don t know what it all means but it is doctor Ransford s affair if there is any affair which I doubt Will you let me go now please Bryce stood aside and lifted his hat and Mary with no more than a nod walked on towards the golf club house across the Common while Bryce turned off to the town highly elated with his morning s work He had sown the seeds of uneasiness and suspicion broadcast some of them he knew would mature Mary Bewery played no golf that morning In fact she only went on to the club house to rid herself of Bryce and presently she returned home thinking And indeed she said to herself she had abundant food for thought Naturally candid and honest she did not at that moment doubt Bryce s good faith much as she disliked him in most ways she knew that he had certain commendable qualities and she was inclined to believe him when he said that he had kept silence in order to ward off consequences which might indirectly be unpleasant for her But of him and his news she thought little what occupied her mind was the possible connection between the stranger who had come so suddenly and disappeared so suddenly and for ever and Mark Ransford Was it possible really possible that there had been some meeting between them in or about the Cathedral precincts that morning She knew after a moment s reflection that it was very possible why not And from that her thoughts followed a natural trend was the mystery surrounding this man connected in any way with the mystery about herself and her brother that mystery of which as it seemed to her Ransford was so shy of speaking And again and for the hundredth time she asked herself why he was so reticent so evidently full of dislike of the subject why he could not tell her and Dick whatever there was to tell once for all She had to pass the Folliots house in the far corner of the Close on her way home a fine old mansion set in well wooded grounds enclosed by a high wall of old red brick A door in that wall stood open and inside it talking to one of his gardeners was mister Folliot the vistas behind him were gay with flowers and rich with the roses which he passed all his days in cultivating He caught sight of Mary as she passed the open doorway and called her back Come in and have a look at some new roses I ve got he said Beauties I ll give you a handful to carry home Mary rather liked mister Folliot He was a big half asleep sort of man who had few words and could talk about little else than his hobby But he was a passionate lover of flowers and plants and had a positive genius for rose culture and was at all times highly delighted to take flower lovers round his garden She turned at once and walked in and Folliot led her away down the scented paths It s an experiment I ve been trying he said leading her up to a cluster of blooms of a colour and size which she had never seen before What do you think of the results Magnificent exclaimed Mary I never saw anything so fine No agreed Folliot with a quiet chuckle Nor anybody else because there s no such rose in England I shall have to go to some of these learned parsons in the Close to invent me a Latin name for this it s the result of careful experiments in grafting took me three years to get at it And see how it blooms scores on one standard He pulled out a knife and began to select a handful of the finest blooms which he presently pressed into Mary s hand By the by he remarked as she thanked him and they turned away along the path I wanted to have a word with you or with Ransford Do you know does he know that that confounded silly woman who lives near to your house missus Deramore has been saying some things or a thing which to put it plainly might make some unpleasantness for him Mary kept a firm hand on her wits and gave him an answer which was true enough so far as she was aware I m sure he knows nothing she said What is it mister Folliot Why you know what happened last week continued Folliot glancing knowingly at her The accident to that stranger This missus Deramore who s nothing but an old chatterer has been saying here and there that it s a very queer thing doctor Ransford doesn t know anything about him and can t say anything for she herself she says saw the very man going away from doctor Ransford s house not so long before the accident I am not aware that he ever called at doctor Ransford s said Mary I never saw him and I was in the garden about that very time with your stepson mister Folliot So Sackville told me remarked Folliot He was present and so was I when missus Deramore was tattling about it in our house yesterday He said then that he d never seen the man go to your house You never heard your servants make any remark about it Never answered Mary I told missus Deramore she d far better hold her tongue continued Folliot Tittle tattle of that sort is apt to lead to unpleasantness And when it came to it it turned out that all she had seen was this stranger strolling across the Close as if he d just left your house If there s always some if But I ll tell you why I mentioned it to you he continued nudging Mary s elbow and glancing covertly first at her and then at his house on the far side of the garden Ladies that are getting on a bit in years you know like my wife are apt to let their tongues wag and between you and me I shouldn t wonder if missus Folliot has repeated what missus Deramore said eh And I don t want the doctor to think that if he hears anything you know which he may and again he might to think that it originated here So if he should ever mention it to you you can say it sprang from his next door neighbour Bah they re a lot of old gossips these Close ladies Thank you said Mary But supposing this man had been to our house what difference would that make He might have been for half a dozen reasons Folliot looked at her out of his half shut eyes Some people would want to know why Ransford didn t tell that at the inquest he answered That s all When there s a bit of mystery you know eh He nodded as if reassuringly and went off to rejoin his gardener and Mary walked home with her roses more thoughtful than ever Mystery a bit of mystery There was a vast and heavy cloud of mystery and she knew she could have no peace until it was lifted CHAPTER XI THE BACK ROOM In the midst of all her perplexity at that moment Mary Bewery was certain of one fact about which she had no perplexity nor any doubt it would not be long before the rumours of which Bryce and mister Folliot had spoken Although she had only lived in Wrychester a comparatively short time she had seen and learned enough of it to know that the place was a hotbed of gossip Once gossip was started there it spread widening in circle after circle And though Bryce was probably right when he said that the person chiefly concerned was usually the last person to hear what was being whispered she knew well enough that sooner or later this talk about Ransford would come to Ransford s own ears But she had no idea that it was to come so soon nor from her own brother Lunch in the Ransford menage was an informal meal At a quarter past one every day it was on the table a cold lunch to which the three members of the household helped themselves as they liked independent of the services of servants Sometimes all three were there at the same moment sometimes Ransford was half an hour late the one member who was always there to the moment was Dick Bewery who fortified himself sedulously after his morning s school labours On this particular day all three met in the dining room at once and sat down together And before Dick had eaten many mouthfuls of a cold pie to which he had just liberally helped himself he bent confidentially across the table towards his guardian There s something I think you ought to be told about sir he remarked with a side glance at Mary Something I heard this morning at school You know we ve a lot of fellows town boys who talk I daresay responded Ransford dryly Following the example of their mothers no doubt Well what is it He too glanced at Mary and the girl had her work set to look unconscious It s this replied Dick lowering his voice in spite of the fact that all three were alone They re saying in the town that you know something which you won t tell about that affair last week It s being talked of Ransford laughed a little cynically Are you quite sure my boy that they aren t saying that I daren t tell he asked Daren t is a much more likely word than won t I think Well about that sir acknowledged Dick Comes to that anyhow And what are their grounds inquired Ransford You ve heard them I ll be bound They say that man Braden had been here here to the house that morning not long before he was found dead answered Dick Of course I said that was all bosh I said that if he d been here and seen you I d have heard of it dead certain That s not quite so dead certain Dick as that I have no knowledge of his ever having been here said Ransford But who says he came here missus Deramore replied Dick promptly She says she saw him go away from the house and across the Close a little before ten So Jim Deramore says anyway and he says his mother s eyes are as good as another s Doubtless assented Ransford He looked at Mary again and saw that she was keeping hers fixed on her plate Well he continued if it will give you any satisfaction Dick you can tell the gossips that doctor Ransford never saw any man Braden or anybody else at his house that morning and that he never exchanged a word with Braden So much for that But he added you needn t expect them to believe you I know these people if they ve got an idea into their heads they ll ride it to death Nevertheless what I say is a fact Dick presently went off and once more Ransford looked at Mary And this time Mary had to meet her guardian s inquiring glance Have you heard anything of this he asked That there was a rumour yes she replied without hesitation But not until just now this morning Who told you of it inquired Ransford Mary hesitated Then she remembered that mister Folliot at any rate had not bound her to secrecy mister Folliot she replied He called me into his garden to give me those roses and he mentioned that missus Deramore had said these things to missus Folliot and as he seemed to think it highly probable that missus Folliot would repeat them he told me because he didn t want you to think that the rumour had originally arisen at his house Very good of him I m sure remarked Ransford dryly They all like to shift the blame from one to another But he added looking searchingly at her you don t know anything about Braden s having come here He saw at once that she did and Mary saw a slight shade of anxiety come over his face Yes I do she replied That morning But it was told to me only today in strict confidence In strict confidence he repeated May I know by whom doctor Bryce she answered I met him this morning And I think you ought to know Only it was in confidence She paused for a moment looking at him and her face grew troubled I hate to suggest it she continued but will you come with me to see him and I ll ask him things being as they are to tell you what he told me I can t without his permission Ransford shook his head and frowned I dislike it he said It s it s putting ourselves in his power as it were But I m not going to be left in the dark Put on your hat then Bryce ever since his coming to Wrychester had occupied rooms in an old house in Friary Lane at the back of the Close He was comfortably lodged Downstairs he had a double sitting room extending from the front to the back of the house his front window looked out on one garden his back window on another He had just finished lunch in the front part of his room and was looking out of his window wondering what to do with himself that afternoon when he saw Ransford and Mary Bewery approaching He guessed the reason of their visit at once and went straight to the front door to meet them and without a word motioned them to follow him into his own quarters It was characteristic of him that he took the first word before either of his visitors could speak I know why you ve come he said as he closed the door and glanced at Mary You either want my permission that you should tell doctor Ransford what I told you this morning or you want me to tell him myself Am I right I should be glad if you would tell him replied Mary The rumour you spoke of has reached him he ought to know what you can tell I have respected your confidence so far The two men looked at each other And this time it was Ransford who spoke first It seems to me he said that there is no great reason for privacy If rumours are flying about in Wrychester there is an end of privacy Dick tells me they are saying at the school that it is known that Braden called on me at my house shortly before he was found dead I know nothing whatever of any such call But I left you in my surgery that morning Do you know if he came there Yes answered Bryce He did come Soon after you d gone out Why did you keep that secret demanded Ransford You could have told it to the police or to the Coroner or to me Why didn t you Before Bryce could answer all three heard a sharp click of the front garden gate and looking round saw Mitchington coming up the walk Here s one of the police now said Bryce calmly Probably come to extract information I would much rather he didn t see you here but I d also like you to hear what I shall say to him Step inside there he continued drawing aside the curtains which shut off the back room Don t stick at trifles you don t know what may be afoot He almost forced them away drew the curtains again and hurrying to the front door returned almost immediately with Mitchington Hope I m not disturbing you doctor said the inspector as Bryce brought him in and again closed the door Not All right then I came round to ask you a question There s a queer rumour getting out in the town about that affair last week Seems to have sprung from some of those old dowagers in the Close Of course said Bryce He was mixing a whisky and soda for his caller and his laugh mingled with the splash of the siphon Of course I ve heard it You ve heard remarked Mitchington Um Good health sir heard of course that That Braden called on doctor Ransford not long before the accident or murder or whatever it was happened said Bryce That s it eh Something of that sort agreed Mitchington It s being said anyway that Braden was at Ransford s house and presumably saw him and that Ransford accordingly knows something about him which he hasn t told Now what do you know Do you know if Ransford and Braden did meet that morning Not at Ransford s house anyway answered Bryce promptly I can prove that But since this rumour has got out I ll tell you what I do know and what the truth is Braden did come to Ransford s not to the house but to the surgery He didn t see Ransford Ransford had gone out across the Close Braden saw me Bless me I didn t know that remarked Mitchington You never mentioned it You ll not wonder that I didn t said Bryce laughing lightly when I tell you what the man wanted What did he want then asked Mitchington Merely to be told where the Cathedral Library was answered Bryce Ransford watching Mary Bewery saw her cheeks flush and knew that Bryce was cheerfully telling lies But Mitchington evidently had no suspicion That all he asked Just a question Just a question that question replied Bryce I pointed out the Library and he walked away I never saw him again until I was fetched to him dead And I thought so little of the matter that well it never even occurred to me to mention it Then though he did call he never saw Ransford asked the inspector I tell you Ransford was already gone out answered Bryce He saw no one but myself Where missus Deramore made her mistake I happen to know Mitchington that she started this rumour was in trying to make two and two into five She saw this man crossing the Close as if from Ransford s house and she at once imagined he d seen and been talking with Ransford Old fool said Mitchington Of course that s how these tales get about However there s more than that in the air The two listeners behind the curtains glanced at each other Ransford s glance showed that he was already chafing at the unpleasantness of his position but Mary s only betokened apprehension And suddenly as if she feared that Ransford would throw the curtains aside and walk into the front room she laid a hand on his arm and motioned him to be patient and silent Oh said Bryce More in the air About that business Just so assented Mitchington To start with that man Varner the mason has never ceased talking They say he s always at it to the effect that the verdict of the jury at the inquest was all wrong and that his evidence was put clean aside He persists that he did see what he swore he saw He ll persist in that to his dying day said Bryce carelessly If that s all there is It isn t interrupted the inspector Not by a long chalk But Varner s is a direct affirmation the other matter s a sort of ugly hint There s a man named
476_133471_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Collishaw 
none	none	a townsman who s been employed as a mason s labourer about the Cathedral of late This Collishaw it seems was at work somewhere up in the galleries ambulatories or whatever they call those upper regions on the very morning of the affair And the other night being somewhat under the influence of drink and talking the matter over with his mates at a tavern he let out some dark hints that he could tell something if he liked Of course he was pressed to tell them and wouldn t Then so my informant tells me he was dared to tell and became surlily silent That of course spread and got to my ears I ve seen Collishaw Well asked Bryce I believe the man does know something answered Mitchington That s the impression I carried away anyhow But he won t speak I charged him straight out with knowing something but it was no good I told him of what I d heard All he would say was that whatever he might have said when he d got a glass of beer or so too much he wasn t going to say anything now neither for me nor for anybody Just so remarked Bryce But he ll be getting a glass too much again some day and then then perhaps he ll add to what he said before And you ll be sure to hear of it I m not certain of that answered Mitchington I made some inquiry and I find that Collishaw is usually a very sober and retiring sort of chap he d been lured on to drink when he let out what he did Besides whether I m right or wrong I got the idea into my head that he d already been squared Squared exclaimed Bryce Why then if that affair was really murder he d be liable to being charged as an accessory after the fact I warned him of that replied Mitchington Yes I warned him solemnly With no effect asked Bryce He s a surly sort of man said Mitchington The sort that takes refuge in silence He made no answer beyond a growl You really think he knows something suggested Bryce Well if there is anything it ll come out in time Oh it ll come out assented Mitchington I m by no means satisfied with that verdict of the coroner s inquiry I believe there was foul play of some sort I m still following things up quietly And I ll tell you something between ourselves I ve made an important discovery It s this On the evening of Braden s arrival at the Mitre he was out somewhere for a whole two hours by himself I thought we learned from missus Partingley that he and the other man Dellingham spent the evening together said Bryce So we did but that was not quite so replied Mitchington Braden went out of the Mitre just before nine o clock and he didn t return until a few minutes after eleven Now then where did he go I suppose you re trying to find that out asked Bryce after a pause during which the listeners heard the caller rise and make for the door Of course replied Mitchington with a confident laugh And I shall Keep it to yourself doctor When Bryce had let the inspector out and returned to his sitting room Ransford and Mary had come from behind the curtains He looked at them and shook his head You heard a good deal you see he observed Look here said Ransford peremptorily You put that man off about the call at my surgery You didn t tell him the truth Quite right assented Bryce I didn t Why should I What did Braden ask you demanded Ransford Come now Merely if doctor Ransford was in answered Bryce remarking that he had once known a doctor Ransford That was literally all I replied that you were not in Ransford stood silently thinking for a moment or two Then he moved towards the door I don t see that any good will come of more talk about this he said We three at any rate know this I never saw Braden when he came to my house Then he motioned Mary to follow him and they went away and Bryce having watched them out of sight smiled at himself in his mirror with full satisfaction CHAPTER XII MURDER OF THE MASON S LABOURER It was towards noon of the very next day that Bryce made a forward step in the matter of solving the problem of Richard Jenkins and his tomb in Paradise Ever since his return from Barthorpe he had been making attempts to get at the true meaning of this mystery He had paid so many visits to the Cathedral Library that Ambrose Campany had asked him jestingly if he was going in for archaeology Bryce had replied that having nothing to do just then he saw no reason why he shouldn t improve his knowledge of the antiquities of Wrychester But he was scrupulously careful not to let the librarian know the real object of his prying and peeping into the old books and documents Campany as Bryce was very well aware was a walking encyclopaedia of information about Wrychester Cathedral he was in fact at that time engaged in completing a history of it And it was through that history that Bryce accidentally got his precious information For on the day following the interview with Mary Bewery and Ransford Bryce being in the library was treated by Campany to an inspection of certain drawings which the librarian had made for illustrating his work drawings most of them of old brasses coats of arms and the like And at the foot of one of these a drawing of a shield on which was sculptured three crows Bryce saw the name Richard Jenkins armiger It was all he could do to repress a start and to check his tongue But Campany knowing nothing quickly gave him the information he wanted All these drawings he said are of old things in and about the Cathedral Some of them like that for instance that Jenkins shield are of ornamentations on tombs which are so old that the inscriptions have completely disappeared tombs in the Cloisters and in Paradise Some of those tombs can only be identified by these sculptures and ornaments How do you know for instance that any particular tomb or monument is we ll say Jenkins s asked Bryce feeling that he was on safe ground Must be a matter of doubt if there s no inscription left isn t it No replied Campany No doubt at all In that particular case there s no doubt that a certain tomb out there in the corner of Paradise near the east wall of the south porch is that of one Richard Jenkins because it bears his coat of arms which as you see bore these birds intended either as crows or ravens The inscription s clean gone from that tomb which is why it isn t particularized in that chart of burials in Paradise the man who prepared that chart didn t know how to trace things as we do nowadays Richard Jenkins was as you may guess a Welshman who settled here in Wrychester in the seventeenth century he left some money to saint Hedwige s Church outside the walls but he was buried here There are more instances look at this now this coat of arms that s the only means there is of identifying another tomb in Paradise that of Gervase Tyrrwhit You see his armorial bearings in this drawing Now those Bryce let the librarian go on talking and explaining and heard all he had to say as a man hears things in a dream what was really active in his own mind was joy at this unexpected stroke of luck he himself might have searched for many a year and never found the last resting place of Richard Jenkins And when soon after the great clock of the Cathedral had struck the hour of noon he left Campany and quitted the Library he walked over to Paradise and plunged in amongst its yews and cypresses intent on seeing the Jenkins tomb for himself No one could suspect anything from merely seeing him there and all he wanted was one glance at the ancient monument But Bryce was not to give even one look at Richard Jenkins s tomb that day nor the next nor for many days death met him in another form before he had taken many steps in the quiet enclosure where so much of Wrychester mortality lay sleeping From over the topmost branches of the old yew trees a great shaft of noontide sunlight fell full on a patch of the grey walls of the high roofed nave At the foot of it his back comfortably planted against the angle of a projecting buttress sat a man evidently fast asleep in the warmth of those powerful rays His head leaned down and forward over his chest his hands were folded across his waist his whole attitude was that of a man who having eaten and drunken in the open air has dropped off to sleep That he had so dropped off while in the very act of smoking was evident from the presence of a short well blackened clay pipe which had fallen from his lips and lay in the grass beside him Near the pipe spread on a coloured handkerchief were the remains of his dinner Bryce s quick eye noticed fragments of bread cheese onions And close by stood one of those tin bottles in which labouring men carry their drink its cork tied to the neck by a piece of string dangled against the side A few yards away a mass of fallen rubbish and a shovel and wheelbarrow showed at what the sleeper had been working when his dinner hour and time for rest had arrived Something unusual something curiously noticeable yet he could not exactly tell what made Bryce go closer to the sleeping man There was a strange stillness about him a rigidity which seemed to suggest something more than sleep And suddenly with a stifled exclamation he bent forward and lifted one of the folded hands It dropped like a leaden weight when Bryce released it and he pushed back the man s face and looked searchingly into it And in that instant he knew that for the second time within a fortnight he had found a dead man in Wrychester Paradise There was no doubt whatever that the man was dead His hands and body were warm enough but there was not a flicker of breath he was as dead as any of the folk who lay six feet beneath the old gravestones around him And Bryce s practised touch and eye knew that he was only just dead and that he had died in his sleep Everything there pointed unmistakably to what had happened The man had eaten his frugal dinner washed it down from his tin bottle lighted his pipe leaned back in the warm sunlight dropped asleep and died as quietly as a child taken from its play to its slumbers After one more careful look Bryce turned and made through the trees to the path which crossed the old graveyard And there going leisurely home to lunch was Dick Bewery who glanced at the young doctor inquisitively Hullo he exclaimed with the freedom of youth towards something not much older You there Anything on Then he looked more clearly seeing Bryce to be pale and excited Bryce laid a hand on the lad s arm Look here he said There s something wrong again in here Run down to the police station get hold of Mitchington quietly you understand bring him here at once If he s not there bring somebody else any of the police But say nothing to anybody but them Dick gave him another swift look turned and ran And Bryce went back to the dead man and picked up the tin bottle and making a cup of his left hand poured out a trickle of the contents Cold tea and as far as he could judge nothing else He put the tip of his little finger into the weak looking stuff and tasted it tasted of nothing but a super abundance of sugar He stood there watching the dead man until the sound of footsteps behind him gave warning of the return of Dick Bewery who in another minute hurried through the bushes followed by Mitchington The boy stared in silence at the still figure but the inspector after a hasty glance turned a horrified face on Bryce Good Lord he gasped It s Collishaw Bryce for the moment failed to comprehend this and Mitchington shook his head Collishaw he repeated Collishaw you know The man I told you about yesterday afternoon The man that said Mitchington suddenly checked himself with a glance at Dick Bewery I remember now said Bryce The mason s labourer So this is the man eh Well Mitchington he s dead I found him dead just now I should say he d been dead five to ten minutes not more You d better get help and I d like another medical man to see him before he s removed Mitchington looked again at Dick Perhaps you d fetch doctor Ransford mister Richard he asked He s nearest doctor Ransford s not at home said Dick He went to Highminster some County Council business or other at ten this morning and he won t be back until four I happen to know that Shall I run for doctor Coates If you wouldn t mind said Mitchington and as it s close by drop in at the station again and tell the sergeant to come here with a couple of men I say he went on when the boy had hurried off this is a queer business doctor Bryce What do you think I think this answered Bryce That man look at him a strong healthy looking fellow in the very prime of life that man has met his death by foul means You take particular care of those dinner things of his the remains of his dinner every scrap and of that tin bottle That especially Take all these things yourself Mitchington and lock them up they ll be wanted for examination Mitchington glanced at the simple matters which Bryce indicated And suddenly he turned a half frightened glance on his companion You don t mean to say that that you suspect he s been poisoned he asked Good Lord if that is so I don t think you ll find that there s much doubt about it answered Bryce But that s a point that will soon be settled You d better tell the Coroner at once Mitchington and he ll issue a formal order to doctor Coates to make a post mortem And he added significantly I shall be surprised if it isn t as I say poison If that s so observed Mitchington with a grim shake of his head if that really is so then I know what I shall think This he went on pointing to the dead man this is a sort of sequel to the other affair There s been something in what the poor chap said he did know something against somebody and that somebody s got to hear of it and silenced him But Lord doctor how can it have been done I can see how it can have been done easy enough said Bryce This man has evidently been at work here by himself all the morning He of course brought his dinner with him He no doubt put his basket and his bottle down somewhere while he did his work What easier than for some one to approach through these trees and shrubs while the man s back was turned or he was busy round one of these corners and put some deadly poison into that bottle Nothing Well remarked Mitchington if that s so it proves something else to my mind What asked Bryce Why that whoever it was who did it was somebody who had a knowledge of poison answered Mitchington And I should say there aren t many people in Wrychester who have such knowledge outside yourselves and the chemists It s a black business this Bryce nodded silently He waited until doctor Coates an elderly man who was the leading practitioner in the town arrived and to him he gave a careful account of his discovery And after the police had taken the body away and he had accompanied Mitchington to the police station and seen the tin bottle and the remains of Collishaw s dinner safely locked up he went home to lunch and to wonder at this strange development The inspector was doubtless right in saying that Collishaw had been done to death by somebody who wanted to silence him but who could that somebody be Bryce s thoughts immediately turned to the fact that Ransford had overheard all that Mitchington had said in that very room in which he Bryce was then lunching Ransford Was it possible that Ransford had realized a danger in Collishaw s knowledge and had He was interrupted at this stage by Mitchington who came hurriedly in with a scared face I say I say he whispered as soon as Bryce s landlady had shut the door on them Here s a fine business I ve heard something something I can hardly credit but it s true I ve been to tell Collishaw s family what s happened And I m fairly dazed by it yet it s there it is so What s so demanded Bryce What is it that s true Mitchington bent closer over the table doctor Ransford was fetched to Collishaw s cottage at six o clock this morning he said It seems that Collishaw s wife has been in a poor way about her health of late and doctor Ransford has attended her off and on She had some sort of a seizure this morning early and Ransford was sent for He was there some little time and I ve heard some queer things What sort of queer things demanded Bryce Don t be afraid of speaking out man there s no one to hear but myself Well things that look suspicious on the face of it continued Mitchington who was obviously much upset As you ll acknowledge when you hear them I got my information from the next door neighbour missus Batts missus Batts says that when Ransford who d been fetched by missus Batts s eldest lad came to Collishaw s house Collishaw was putting up his dinner to take to his work What on earth made missus Batts tell you that interrupted Bryce Oh well to tell you the truth I put a few questions to her as to what went on while Ransford was in the house answered Mitchington When I d once found that he had been there you know I naturally wanted to know all I could Well asked Bryce Collishaw I say was putting up his dinner to take to his work continued Mitchington missus Batts was doing a thing or two about the house Ransford went upstairs to see missus Collishaw After a while he came down and said he would have to remain a little Collishaw went up to speak to his wife before going out And then Ransford asked missus Batts for something I forget what some small matter which the Collishaw s hadn t got and she had and she went next door to fetch it Therefore do you see Ransford was left alone with Collishaw s tin bottle Bryce who had been listening attentively looked steadily at the inspector You re suspecting Ransford already he said Mitchington shook his head What s it look like he answered almost appealingly I put it to you now what does it look like Here s this man been poisoned without a doubt I m certain of it And there were those rumours it s idle to deny that they centred in Ransford And this morning Ransford had the chance That s arguing that Ransford purposely carried a dose of poison to put into Collishaw s tin bottle said Bryce half sneeringly Not very probable you know Mitchington Mitchington spread out his hands Well there it is he said As I say there s no denying the suspicious look of it If I were only certain that those rumours about what Collishaw hinted he could say had got to Ransford s ears why then What s being done about that post mortem asked Bryce doctor Coates and doctor Everest are going to do it this afternoon replied Mitchington The Coroner went to them at once as soon as I told him They ll probably have to call in an expert from London said Bryce However you can t do anything definite you know until the result s known Don t say anything of this to anybody I ll drop in at your place later and hear if Coates can say anything really certain Mitchington went away and Bryce spent the rest of the afternoon wondering speculating and scheming If Ransford had really got rid of this man who knew something why then it was certainly Ransford who killed Braden He went round to the police station at five o clock Mitchington drew him aside Coates says there s no doubt about it he whispered Poisoned Hydrocyanic acid CHAPTER XIII BRYCE IS ASKED A QUESTION Mitchington stepped aside into a private room motioning Bryce to follow him He carefully closed the door and looking significantly at his companion repeated his last words with a shake of the head Poisoned without the very least doubt he whispered Hydrocyanic acid which I understand is the same thing as what s commonly called prussic acid They say then hadn t the least difficulty in finding that out so there you are That s what Coates has told you of course asked Bryce After the autopsy Both of em told me Coates and Everest who helped him replied Mitchington They said it was obvious from the very start And I say Well said Bryce It wasn t in that tin bottle anyway remarked Mitchington who was evidently greatly weighted with mystery No of course it wasn t affirmed Bryce Good Heavens man I know that How do you know asked Mitchington Because I poured a few drops from that bottle into my hand when I first found Collishaw and tasted the stuff answered Bryce readily Cold tea with too much sugar in it There was no H C N in that besides wherever it is there s always a smell stronger or fainter of bitter almonds There was none about that bottle Yet you were very anxious that we should take care of the bottle observed Mitchington Of course because I suspected the use of some much rarer poison than that retorted Bryce Pooh it s a clumsy way of poisoning anybody quick though it is Well there s where it is said Mitchington That ll be the medical evidence at the inquest anyway That s how it was done And the question now is Who did it interrupted Bryce Precisely Well I ll say this much at once Mitchington Whoever did it was either a big bungler or damned clever That s what I say I don t understand you said Mitchington Plain enough my meaning replied Bryce smiling To finish anybody with that stuff is easy enough but no poison is more easily detected It s an amateurish way of poisoning anybody unless you can do it in such a fashion that no suspicion can attach you to And in this case it s here whoever administered that poison to Collishaw must have been certain absolutely certain mind you that it was impossible for any one to find out that he d done so Therefore I say what I said the man must be damned clever Otherwise he d be found out pretty quick And all that puzzles me is how was it administered How much would kill anybody pretty quick asked Mitchington How much One drop would cause instantaneous death answered Bryce Cause paralysis of the heart there and then instantly Mitchington remained silent awhile looking meditatively at Bryce Then he turned to a locked drawer produced a key and took something out of the drawer a small object wrapped in paper I m telling you a good deal doctor he said But as you know so much already I ll tell you a bit more Look at this He opened his hand and showed Bryce a small cardboard pill box across the face of which a few words were written One after meals mister Collishaw Whose handwriting s that demanded Mitchington Bryce looked closer and started Ransford s he muttered Ransford of course That box was in Collishaw s waistcoat pocket said Mitchington There are pills inside it now See He took off the lid of the box and revealed four sugar coated pills It wouldn t hold more than six this he observed Bryce extracted a pill and put his nose to it after scratching a little of the sugar coating away Mere digestive pills he announced Could it have been given in one of these asked Mitchington Possible replied Bryce He stood thinking for a moment Have you shown those things to Coates and Everest he asked at last Not yet replied Mitchington I wanted to find out first if Ransford gave this box to Collishaw and when I m going to Collishaw s house presently I ve certain inquiries to make His widow ll know about these pills You re suspecting Ransford said Bryce That s certain Mitchington carefully put away the pill box and relocked the drawer I ve got some decidedly uncomfortable ideas which I d much rather not have about doctor Ransford he said When one thing seems to fit into another what is one to think If I were certain that that rumour which spread about Collishaw s knowledge of something you know had got to Ransford s ears why I should say it looked very much as if Ransford wanted to stop Collishaw s tongue for good before it could say more and next time perhaps something definite If men once begin to hint that they know something they don t stop at hinting Collishaw might have spoken plainly before long to us Bryce asked a question about the holding of the inquest and went away And after thinking things over he turned in the direction of the Cathedral and made his way through the Cloisters to the Close He was going to make another move in his own game while there was a good chance Everything at this juncture was throwing excellent cards into his hand he would be foolish he thought not to play them to advantage And so he made straight for Ransford s house and before he reached it met Ransford and Mary Bewery who were crossing the Close from another point on their way from the railway station whither Mary had gone especially to meet her guardian They were in such deep conversation that Bryce was close upon them before they observed his presence When Ransford saw his late assistant he scowled unconsciously Bryce and the interview of the previous afternoon had been much in his thoughts all day and he had an uneasy feeling that Bryce was playing some game Bryce was quick to see that scowl and to observe the sudden start which Mary could not repress and he was just as quick to speak I was going to your house doctor Ransford he remarked quietly I don t want to force my presence on you now or at any time but I think you d better give me a few minutes They were at Ransford s garden gate by that time and Ransford flung it open and motioned Bryce to follow He led the way into the dining room closed the door on the three and looked at Bryce Bryce took the glance as a question and put another in words You ve heard of what s happened during the day he said About Collishaw yes answered Ransford Miss Bewery has just told me what her brother told her What of it I have just come from the police station said Bryce Coates and Everest have carried out an autopsy this afternoon Mitchington told me the result Well demanded Ransford with no attempt to conceal his impatience And what then Collishaw was poisoned replied Bryce watching Ransford with a closeness which Mary did not fail to observe H C N No doubt at all about it Well and what then asked Ransford still more impatiently To be explicit what s all this to do with me I came here to do you a service answered Bryce Whether you like to take it or not is your look out You may as well know it you re in danger Collishaw is the man who hinted as you heard yesterday in my rooms that he could say something definite about the Braden affair if he liked Well said Ransford It s known to the police that you were at Collishaw s house early this morning said Bryce Mitchington knows it Ransford laughed Does Mitchington know that I overheard what he said to you yesterday afternoon he inquired No he doesn t answered Bryce He couldn t possibly know unless I told him I haven t told him I m not going to tell him But he s suspicious already Of me of course suggested Ransford with another laugh He took a turn across the room and suddenly faced round on Bryce who had remained standing near the door Do you really mean to tell me that Mitchington is such a fool as to believe that I would poison a poor working man and in that clumsy fashion he burst out Of course you don t I never said I did answered Bryce I m only telling you what Mitchington thinks his grounds for suspecting He confided in me because well it was I who found Collishaw Mitchington is in possession of a box of digestive pills which you evidently gave Collishaw Bah exclaimed Ransford The man s a fool Let him come and talk to me He won t do that yet said Bryce But I m afraid he ll bring all this out at the inquest The fact is he s suspicious what with one thing or another about the former affair He thinks you concealed the truth whatever it may be as regards any knowledge of Braden which you may or mayn t have I ll tell you what it is said Ransford suddenly It just comes to this I m suspected of having had a hand the hand if you like in Braden s death and now of getting rid of Collishaw because Collishaw could prove that I had that hand That s about it A clear way of putting it certainly assented Bryce But there s a very clear way too of dissipating any such ideas What way demanded Ransford If you do know anything about the Braden affair why not reveal it and be done with the whole thing suggested Bryce That would finish matters Ransford took a long silent look at his questioner And Bryce looked steadily back and Mary Bewery anxiously watched both men That s my business said Ransford at last I m neither to be coerced bullied or cajoled I m obliged to you for giving me a hint of my danger I suppose And I don t propose to say any more Neither do I said Bryce I only came to tell you And therewith having successfully done all that he wanted to do he walked out of the room and the house and Ransford standing in the window his hands thrust in his pockets watched him go away across the Close Guardian said Mary softly Ransford turned sharply Wouldn t it be best she continued speaking nervously if if you do know anything about that unfortunate man if you told it Why have this suspicion fastening itself on you You Ransford made an effort to calm himself He was furiously angry angry with Bryce angry with Mitchington angry with the cloud of foolishness and stupidity that seemed to be gathering Why should I supposing that I do know something which I don t admit why should I allow myself to be coerced and frightened by these fools he asked No man can prevent suspicion falling on him it s my bad luck in this instance Why should I rush to the police station and say Here I ll blurt out all I know everything Why Wouldn t that be better than knowing that people are saying things she asked As to that replied Ransford you can t prevent people saying things especially in a town like this If it hadn t been for the unfortunate fact that Braden came to the surgery door nothing would have been said But what of that I have known hundreds of men in my time aye and forgotten them No I am not going to fall a victim to this device it all springs out of curiosity As to this last affair it s all nonsense But if the man was really poisoned suggested Mary Let the police find the poisoner said Ransford with a grim smile That s their job Mary said nothing for a moment and Ransford moved restlessly about the room I don t trust that fellow Bryce he said suddenly He s up to something I don t forget what he said when I bundled him out that morning What she asked That he would be a bad enemy answered Ransford He s posing now as a friend but a man s never to be so much suspected as when he comes doing what you may call unnecessary acts of friendship I d rather that anybody was mixed up in my affairs your affairs than Pemberton Bryce So would I she said But She paused there a moment and then looked appealingly at Ransford I do wish you d tell me what you promised to tell me she said You know what I mean about me and Dick Somehow I don t quite know how or why I ve an uneasy feeling that Bryce knows something and that he s mixing it all up with this Why not tell me please Ransford who was still marching about the room came to a halt and leaning his hands on the table between them looked earnestly at her Don t ask that now he said I can t yet The fact is I m waiting for something some particulars As soon as I get them I ll speak to you and to Dick In the meantime don t ask me again and don t be afraid And as to this affair leave it to me and if you meet Bryce again refuse to discuss any thing with him Look here there s only one reason why he professes friendliness and a desire to save me annoyance He thinks he can ingratiate himself with you Mistaken murmured Mary shaking her head I don t trust him And less than ever because of yesterday Would an honest man have done what he did Let that police inspector talk freely as he did with people concealed behind a curtain And he laughed about it I hated myself for being there yet could we help it I m not going to hate myself on Pemberton Bryce s account said Ransford Let him play his game that he has one I m certain Bryce had gone away to continue his game or another line of it The Collishaw matter had not made him forget the Richard Jenkins tomb and now after leaving Ransford s house he crossed the Close to Paradise with the object of doing a little more investigation But at the archway of the ancient enclosure he met old Simpson Harker pottering about in his usual apparently aimless fashion Harker smiled at sight of Bryce Ah I was wanting to have a word with you doctor he said Something important Have you got a minute or two to spare sir Come round to my little place then we shall be quiet there Bryce had any amount of time to spare for an interesting person like Harker and he followed the old man to his house a tiny place set in a nest of similar old world buildings behind the Close Harker led him into a little parlour comfortable and snug wherein were several shelves of books of a curiously legal and professional looking aspect some old pictures and a cabinet of odds and ends stowed away in of dark corner The old man motioned him to an easy chair and going over to a cupboard produced a decanter of whisky and a box of cigars We can have a peaceful and comfortable talk here doctor he remarked as he sat down near Bryce after fetching glasses and soda water I live all alone like a hermit my bit of work s done by a woman who only looks in of a morning So we re all by ourselves Light your cigar same as that I gave you at Barthorpe Um well now he continued as Bryce settled down to listen There s a question I want to put to you strictly between ourselves strictest of confidence you know It was you who was called to Braden by Varner and you were left alone with Braden s body Well admitted Bryce suddenly growing suspicious What of it Harker edged his chair a little closer to his guest s and leaned towards him What he asked in a whisper what have you done with that scrap of paper that you took out of Braden s purse CHAPTER XIV FROM THE PAST If any remarkably keen and able observer of the odd characteristics of humanity had been present in Harker s little parlour at that moment watching him and his visitor he would have been struck by what happened when the old man put this sudden and point blank question to the young one For Harker put the question though in a whisper in no more than a casual almost friendlily confidential way and Bryce never showed by the start of a finger or the flicker of an eyelash that he felt it to be what he really knew it to be the most surprising and startling question he had ever had put to him Instead he looked his questioner calmly in the eyes and put a question in his turn Who are you mister Harker asked Bryce quietly Harker laughed almost gleefully Yes you ve a right to ask that he said Of course glad you take it that way You ll do I ll qualify it then added Bryce It s not who it s what are you Harker waved his cigar at the book shelves in front of which his visitor sat Take a look at my collection of literature doctor he said What d ye think of it Bryce turned and leisurely inspected one shelf after another Seems to consist of little else but criminal cases and legal handbooks he remarked quietly I begin to suspect you mister Harker They say here in Wrychester that you re a retired tradesman I think you re a retired policeman of the detective branch Harker laughed again No Wrychester man has ever crossed my threshold since I came to settle down here he said You re the first person I ve ever asked in with one notable exception I ve never even had Campany the librarian here I m a hermit But you were a detective suggested Bryce Aye for a good five and twenty years replied Harker And pretty well known too sir But my question doctor All between ourselves I ll ask you one then said Bryce How do you know I took a scrap of paper from Braden s purse Because I know that he had such a paper in his purse the night he came to the Mitre answered Harker and was certain to have it there next morning and because I also know that you were left alone with the body for some minutes after Varner fetched you to it and that when Braden s clothing and effects were searched by Mitchington the paper wasn t there So of course you took it Doesn t matter to me that ye did except that I know from knowing that that you re on a similar game to my own which is why you went down to Leicestershire You knew Braden asked Bryce I knew him answered Harker You saw him spoke with him here in Wrychester suggested Bryce He was here in this room in that chair from five minutes past nine to close on ten o clock the night before his death replied Harker Bryce who was quietly appreciating the Havana cigar which the old man had given him picked up his glass took a drink and settled himself in his easy chair as if he meant to stay there awhile I think we d better talk confidentially mister Harker he said Precisely what we are doing doctor Bryce replied Harker All right my friend said Bryce laconically Now we understand each other So do you know who John Braden really was Yes replied Harker promptly He was in reality John Brake ex bank manager ex convict Do you know if he s any relatives here in Wrychester inquired Bryce Yes said Harker The boy and girl who live with Ransford they re Brake s son and daughter Did Brake know that when he came here continued Bryce No he didn t he hadn t the least idea of it responded Harker Had you then asked Bryce No not until later a little later replied Harker You found it out at Barthorpe suggested Bryce Not a bit of it I worked it out here after Brake was dead said Harker I went to Barthorpe on quite different business Brake s business Ah said Bryce He looked the old detective quietly in the eyes You d better tell me all about it he added If we re both going to tell each other all about it stipulated Harker That s settled assented Bryce Harker smoked thoughtfully for a moment and seemed to be thinking I d better go back to the beginning he said But first what do you know about Brake I know you went down to Barthorpe to find out what you could how far did your searches take you I know that Brake married a girl from Braden Medworth that he took her to London where he was manager of a branch bank that he got into trouble and was sentenced to ten years penal servitude answered Bryce together with some small details into which we needn t go at present Well as long as you know all that there s a common basis and a common starting point remarked Harker so I ll begin at Brake s trial It was I who arrested Brake There was no trouble no bother He d been taken unawares by an inspector of the bank He d a considerable deficiency couldn t make it good couldn t or wouldn t explain except by half sullen hints that he d been cruelly deceived There was no defence couldn t be His counsel said that he could I ve read the account of the trial interrupted Bryce All right then you know as much as I can tell you on that point said Harker He got as you say ten years I saw him just before he was removed and asked him if there was anything I could do for him about his wife and children I d never seen them I arrested him at the bank and of course he was never out of custody after that He answered in a queer curt way that his wife and children were being looked after I heard incidentally that his wife had left home or was from home there was something mysterious about it either as soon as he was arrested or before Anyway he said nothing and from that moment I never set eyes on him again until I met him in the street here in Wrychester the other night when he came to the Mitre I knew him at once and he knew me We met under one of those big standard lamps in the Market Place I was following my usual practice of having an evening walk last thing before going to bed And we stopped and stared at each other Then he came forward with his hand out and we shook hands This is an odd thing he said You re the very man I wanted to find Come somewhere where it s quiet and let me have a word with you So I brought him here Bryce was all attention now for once he was devoting all his faculties to tense and absorbed concentration on what another man could tell leaving reflections and conclusions on what he heard until all had been told I brought him here repeated Harker I told him I d been retired and was living here as he saw alone I asked him no questions about himself I could see he was a well dressed apparently well to do man And presently he began to tell me about himself He said that after he d finished his term he left England and for some time travelled in Canada and the United States and had gone then on to New Zealand and afterwards to Australia where he d settled down and begun speculating in wool I said I hoped he d done well Yes he said he d done very nicely and then he gave me a quiet dig in the ribs I ll tell you one thing I ve done Harker he said You were very polite and considerate to me when I d my trouble so I don t mind telling you I paid the bank every penny of that money they lost through my foolishness at that time every penny four years ago with interest and I ve got their receipt Delighted to hear it mister Is it the same name still I said My name ever since I left England he said giving me a look is Braden John Braden Yes he went on I paid em though I never had one penny of the money I was fool enough to take for the time being not one halfpenny Who had it mister Braden I asked him thinking that he d perhaps tell after all that time Never mind my lad he answered It ll come out yet Never mind that now I ll tell you why I wanted to see you The fact is I ve only been a few hours in England so to speak but I d thought of you and wondered where I could get hold of you you re the only man of your profession I ever met you see he added with a laugh And I want a bit of help in that way Well mister Braden I said I ve retired but if it s an easy job It s one you can do easy enough he said It s just this I met a man in Australia who s extremely anxious to get some news of another man named Falkiner Wraye who hails from Barthorpe in Leicestershire I promised to make inquiries for him Now I have strong reasons why I don t want to go near Barthorpe Barthorpe has unpleasant memories and associations for me and I don t want to be seen there But this thing s got to be personal investigation will you go here for me I ll make it worth your while All you ve got to do he went on is to go there see the police authorities town officials anybody that knows the place and ask them if they can tell you anything of one Falkiner Wraye who was at one time a small estate agent in Barthorpe left the place about seventeen years ago maybe eighteen and is believed to have recently gone back to the neighbourhood That s all Get what information you can and write it to me care of my bankers in London Give me a sheet of paper and I ll put down particulars for you Harker paused at this point and nodded his head at an old bureau which stood in a corner of his room The sheet of paper s there he said It s got on it in his writing a brief memorandum of what he wanted and the address of his bankers When he d given it to me he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a purse in which I could see he was carrying plenty of money He took out some notes Here s five and twenty pounds on account Harker he said You might have to spend a bit Don t be afraid plenty more where that comes from You ll do it soon he asked Yes I ll do it mister Braden I answered It ll be a bit of a holiday for me That s all right he said I m delighted I came across you Well you couldn t be more delighted than I was surprised I said I never thought to see you in Wrychester What brought you here if one may ask sight seeing He laughed at that and he pulled out his purse again I ll show you something a secret he said and he took a bit of folded paper out of his purse What do you make of that he asked Can you read Latin No except a word or two I said but I know a man who can Ah never mind said he I know enough Latin for this and it s a secret However it won t be a secret long and you ll hear all about it And with that he put the bit of paper in his purse again and we began talking about other matters and before long he said he d promised to have a chat with a gentleman at the Mitre whom he d come along with in the train and away he went saying he d see me before be left the town Did he say how long he was going to stop here asked Bryce Two or three days replied Harker Did he mention Ransford inquired Bryce Never said Harker Did he make any reference to his wife and children Not the slightest Nor to the hint that his counsel threw out at the trial Never referred to that time except in the way I told you that he hadn t a penny of the money himself and that he d himself refunded it Bryce meditated awhile He was somewhat puzzled by certain points in the old detective s story and he saw now that there was much more mystery in the Braden affair than he had at first believed Well he asked after a while did you see him again Not alive replied Harker I saw him dead and I held my tongue and have held it But something happened that day After I heard of the accident I went into the Crown and Cushion tavern the fact was I went to get a taste of whisky for the news had upset me And in that long bar of theirs I saw a man whom I knew a man whom I knew for a fact to have been a fellow convict of Brake s Name of Glassdale forgery He got the same sentence that Brake got about the same time was in the same convict prison with Brake and he and Brake would be released about the same date There was no doubt about his identity I never forget a face even after thirty years I d tell one I saw him in that bar before he saw me and I took a careful look at him He too like Brake was very well dressed and very prosperous looking He turned as he set down his glass and caught sight of me and he knew me Mind you he d been through my hands in times past And he instantly moved to a side door and vanished I went out and looked up and down he d gone I found out afterwards by a little quiet inquiry that he d gone straight to the station boarded the first train there was one just giving out to the junction and left the city But I can lay hands on him You ve kept this quiet too asked Bryce Just so I ve my own game to play replied Harker This talk with you is part of it you come in now I ll tell you why presently But first as you know I went to Barthorpe For though Brake was dead I felt I must go for this reason I was certain that he wanted that information for himself the man in Australia was a fiction I went then and learned nothing Except that this Falkiner Wraye had been as Brake said a Barthorpe man years ago He d left the town eighteen years since and nobody knew anything about him So I came home And now then doctor your turn What were you after down there at Barthorpe Bryce meditated his answer for a good five minutes He had always intended to play the game off his own bat but he had heard and seen enough since entering Harker s little room to know that he was in company with an intellect which was keener and more subtle than his and that it would be all to his advantage to go in with the man who had vast and deep experience And so he made a clean breast of all he had done in the way of investigation leaving his motive completely aside You ve got a theory of course observed Harker after listening quietly to all that Bryce could tell Naturally you have You couldn t accumulate all that without getting one Well admitted Bryce honestly I can t say that I have But I can see what theory there might be This that Ransford was the man who deceived Brake that he ran away with Brake s wife that she s dead and that he s brought up the children in ignorance of all that and therefore And therefore interrupted Harker with a smile that when he and Brake met as you seem to think they did Ransford flung Brake through that open doorway that Collishaw witnessed it that Ransford s found out about Collishaw and that Collishaw has been poisoned by Ransford Eh That s a theory that seems to be supported by facts said Bryce It s a theory that would doubtless suit men like Mitchington said the old detective with another smile But not me sir Mind you I don t say there isn t something in it there s doubtless a lot But the mystery s a lot thicker than just that And Brake didn t come here to find Ransford He came because of the secret in that scrap of paper And as you ve got it doctor out with it Bryce saw no reason for concealment and producing the scrap of paper laid it on the table between himself and his host Harker peered inquisitively at it Latin he said You can read it of course What does it say Bryce repeated a literal translation I ve found the place he added I found it this morning Now what do you suppose this means Harker was looking hard at the two lines of writing That s a big question doctor he answered But I ll go so far as to say this when we ve found out what it does mean we shall know a lot more than we know now CHAPTER XV THE DOUBLE OFFER Bryce who was deriving a considerable and peculiar pleasure from his secret interview with the old detective smiled at Harker s last remark That s a bit of a platitude isn t it he suggested Of course we shall know a lot more when we do know a lot more I set store by platitudes sir retorted Harker You can t repeat an established platitude too often it s got the hallmark of good use on it But now till we do know more you ve no doubt been thinking a lot about this matter doctor Bryce hasn t it struck you that there s one feature in connection with Brake or Braden s visit to Wrychester to which nobody s given any particular attention up to now so far as we know at any rate What demanded Bryce This replied Harker Why did he wish to see the Duke of Saxonsteade He certainly did want to see him and as soon as possible You ll remember that his Grace was questioned about that at the inquest and could give no explanation he knew nothing of Brake and couldn t suggest any reason why Brake should wish to have an interview with him But I can You exclaimed Bryce I answered Harker And it s this I spoke just now of that man Glassdale Now you of course have no knowledge of him and as you don t keep yourself posted in criminal history you don t know what his offence was You said forgery replied Bryce Just so forgery assented Harker And the signature that he forged was the Duke of Saxonsteade s As a matter of fact he was the Duke s London estate agent He got wrong somehow and he forged the Duke s name to a cheque Now then considering who Glassdale is and that he was certainly a fellow convict of Brake s and that I myself saw him here in Wrychester on the day of Brake s death what s the conclusion to be drawn That Brake wanted to see the Duke on some business of Glassdale s Without a doubt It may have been that he and Glassdale wanted to visit the Duke together Bryce silently considered this suggestion for awhile You said just now that Glassdale could be traced he remarked at last Traced yes replied Harker So long as he s in England Why not set about it suggested Bryce Not yet said Harker There s things to do before that And the first thing is let s get to know what the mystery of that scrap of paper is You say you ve found Richard Jenkins s tomb Very well then the thing to do is to find out if anything is hidden there Try it tomorrow night Better go by yourself after dark If you find anything let me know And then then we can decide on a next step But between now and then there ll be the inquest on this man Collishaw And about that a word in your ear Say as little as ever you can after all you know nothing beyond what you saw And we mustn t meet and talk in public after you ve done that bit of exploring in Paradise tomorrow night come round here and we ll consider matters There was little that Bryce could say or could be asked to say at the inquest on the mason s labourer next morning Public interest and excitement was as keen about Collishaw s mysterious death as about Braden s for it was already rumoured through the town that if Braden had not met with his death when he came to Wrychester Collishaw would still be alive The Coroner s court was once more packed once more there was the same atmosphere of mystery But the proceedings were of a very different nature to those which had attended the inquest on Braden The foreman under whose orders Collishaw had been working gave particulars of the dead man s work on the morning of his death He had been instructed to clear away an accumulation of rubbish which had gathered at the foot of the south wall of the nave in consequence of some recent repairs to the masonry there was a full day s work before him All day he would be in and out of Paradise with his barrow wheeling away the rubbish he gathered up The foreman had looked in on him once or twice he had seen him just before noon when he appeared to be in his usual health he had made no complaint at any rate Asked if he had happened to notice where Collishaw had set down his dinner basket and his tin bottle while he worked he replied that it so happened that he had he remembered seeing both bottle and basket and the man s jacket deposited on one of the box tombs under a certain yew tree which he could point out if necessary Bryce s account of his finding of Collishaw amounted to no more than a bare recital of facts Nor was much time spent in questioning the two doctors who had conducted the post mortem examination Their evidence terse and particular referred solely to the cause of death The man had been poisoned by a dose of hydrocyanic acid which in their opinion had been taken only a few minutes before his body was discovered by doctor Bryce It had probably been a dose which would cause instantaneous death There were no traces of the poison in the remains of his dinner nor in the liquid in his tin bottle which was old tea But of the cause of his sudden death there was no more doubt than of the effects Ransford had been in the court from the outset of the proceedings and when the medical evidence had been given he was called Bryce watching him narrowly saw that he was suffering from repressed excitement and that that excitement was as much due to anger as to anything else His face was set and stern and he looked at the Coroner with an expression which portended something not precisely clear at that moment Bryce trying to analyse it said to himself that he shouldn t be surprised if a scene followed Ransford looked like a man who is bursting to say something in no unmistakable fashion But at first he answered the questions put to him calmly and decisively When this man s clothing was searched observed the Coroner a box of pills was found doctor Ransford on which your writing appears Had you been attending him professionally Yes replied Ransford Both Collishaw and his wife Or rather to be exact I had been in attendance on the wife for some weeks A day or two before his death Collishaw complained to me of indigestion following on his meals I gave him some digestive pills the pills you speak of no doubt These asked the Coroner passing over the box which Mitchington had found Precisely agreed Ransford That at any rate is the box and I suppose those to be the pills You made them up yourself inquired the Coroner I did I dispense all my own medicines Is it possible that the poison we have beard of just now could get into one of those pills by accident Utterly impossible under my hands at any rate answered Ransford Still I suppose it could have been administered in a pill suggested the Coroner It might agreed Ransford But he added with a significant glance at the medical men who had just given evidence It was not so administered in this case as the previous witnesses very well know The Coroner looked round him and waited a moment You are at liberty to explain that last remark he said at last That is if you wish to do so Certainly answered Ransford with alacrity Those pills are as you will observe coated and the man would swallow them whole immediately after his food Now it would take some little time for a pill to dissolve to disintegrate to be digested If Collishaw took one of my pills as soon as he had eaten his dinner according to instructions and if poison had been in that pill he would not have died at once as he evidently did Death would probably have been delayed some little time until the pill had dissolved But according to the evidence you have had before you he died quite suddenly while eating his dinner or immediately after it I am not legally represented here I don t consider it at all necessary but I ask you to recall doctor Coates and to put this question to him Did he find one of those digestive pills in this man s stomach The Coroner turned somewhat dubiously to the two doctors who had performed the autopsy But before he could speak the superintendent of police rose and began to whisper to him and after a conversation between them he looked round at the jury every member of which had evidently been much struck by Ransford s suggestion At this stage he said it will be necessary to adjourn I shall adjourn the inquiry for a week gentlemen You will Ransford still standing in the witness box suddenly lost control of himself He uttered a sharp exclamation and smote the ledge before him smartly with his open hand I protest against that he said vehemently Emphatically I protest You first of all make a suggestion which tells against me then when I demand that a question shall be put which is of immense importance to my interests you close down the inquiry even if only for the moment That is grossly unfair and unjust You are mistaken said the Coroner At the adjourned inquiry the two medical men can be recalled and you will have the opportunity or your solicitor will have of asking any questions you like for the present For the present you have me under suspicion interrupted Ransford hotly You know it I say this with due respect to your office as well as I do Suspicion is rife in the city against me Rumour is being spread secretly and I am certain from the police who ought to know better And I will not be silenced mister Coroner I take this public opportunity as I am on oath of saying that I know nothing whatever of the causes of the deaths of either Collishaw or of Braden upon my solemn oath The inquest is adjourned to this day week said the Coroner quietly Ransford suddenly stepped down from the witness box and without word or glance at any one there walked with set face and determined look out of the court and the excited spectators gathering into groups immediately began to discuss his vigorous outburst and to take sides for and against him Bryce judging it advisable to keep away from Mitchington just then and for similar reasons keeping away from Harker also went out of the crowded building alone to be joined in the street outside by Sackville Bonham whom he had noticed in court in company with his stepfather mister Folliot Folliot Bryce had observed had stopped behind exchanging some conversation with the Coroner Sackville came up to Bryce with a knowing shake of the hand He was one of those very young men who have a habit of suggesting that their fund of knowledge is extensive and peculiar and Bryce waited for a manifestation Queer business all that Bryce observed Sackville confidentially Of course Ransford is a perfect ass Think so remarked Bryce with an inflection which suggested that Sackville s opinion on anything was as valuable as the Attorney General s That s how it strikes you is it Impossible that it could strike one in any other way you know answered Sackville with fine and lofty superiority Ransford should have taken immediate steps to clear himself of any suspicion It s ridiculous considering his position guardian to to Miss Bewery for instance that he should allow such rumours to circulate By God sir if it had been me I d have stopped em before they left the parish pump Ah said Bryce And how Made an example of somebody replied Sackville with emphasis I believe there s law in this country isn t there law against libel and slander and that sort of thing eh Oh yes Not been much time for that yet remarked Bryce Piles of time retorted Sackville swinging his stick vigorously No sir Ransford is an ass However if a man won t do things for himself well his friends must do something for him Ransford of course must be pulled dragged out of this infernal hole Of course he s suspected But my stepfather he s going to take a hand And my stepfather Bryce is a devilish cute old hand at a game of this sort Nobody doubts mister Folliot s abilities I m sure said Bryce But you don t mind saying how is he going to take a hand Stir things towards a clearing up announced Sackville promptly Have the whole thing gone into thoroughly There are matters that haven t been touched on yet You ll see my boy Glad to hear it said Bryce But why should mister Folliot be so particular about clearing Ransford Sackville swung his stick and pulled up his collar and jerked his nose a trifle higher Oh well he said Of course it s it s a pretty well understood thing don t you know between myself and Miss Bewery you know and of course we couldn t have any suspicions attaching to her guardian could we now Family interest don t you know Caesar s wife and all that sort of thing eh I see answered Bryce quietly sort of family arrangement With Ransford s consent and knowledge of course Ransford won t even be consulted said Sackville airily My stepfather sharp man that Bryce he ll do things in his own fashion You look out for sudden revelations I will replied Bryce By bye He turned off to his rooms wondering how much of truth there was in the fatuous Sackville s remarks And was there some mystery still undreamt of by himself and Harker There might be he was still under the influence of Ransford s indignant and dramatic assertion of his innocence Would Ransford have allowed himself an outburst of that sort if he had not been as he said utterly ignorant of the immediate cause of Braden s death Now Bryce all through was calculating for his own purposes on Ransford s share full or partial in that death if Ransford really knew nothing whatever about it where did his Bryce s theory come in and how would his present machinations result And more if Ransford s assertion were true and if Varner s story of the hand seen for an instant in the archway were also true and Varner was persisting in it then who was the man who flung Braden to his death that morning He realized that instead of straightening out things were becoming more and more complicated But he realized something else On the surface there was a strong case of suspicion against Ransford It had been suggested that very morning before a coroner and his jury it would grow the police were already permeated with suspicion and distrust Would it not pay him Bryce to encourage to help it He had his own score to pay off against Ransford he had his own schemes as regards Mary Bewery Anyway he was not going to share in any attempts to clear the man who had bundled him out of his house unceremoniously he would bide his time And in the meantime there were other things to be done one of them that very night But before Bryce could engage in his secret task of excavating a small portion of Paradise in the rear of Richard Jenkins s tomb another strange development came As the dark fell over the old city that night and he was thinking of setting out on his mission Mitchington came in carrying two sheets of paper obviously damp from the press in his hand He looked at Bryce with an expression of wonder Here s a queer go he said I can t make this out at all Look at these big handbills but perhaps you ve seen em They re being posted all over the city we ve had a bundle of em thrown in on us I haven t been out since lunch remarked Bryce What are they Mitchington spread out the two papers on the table pointing from one to the other You see he said Five Hundred Pounds Reward One Thousand Pounds Reward And both out at the same time from different sources What sources asked Bryce bending over the bills Ah I see One signed by Phipps Maynard the other by Beachcroft Odd certainly Odd exclaimed Mitchington I should think so But do you see doctor that one five hundred reward is offered for information of any nature relative to the deaths of John Braden and James Collishaw both or either That amount will be paid for satisfactory information by Phipps Maynard And Phipps Maynard are Ransford s solicitors That bill sir comes from him And now the other the thousand pound one that offers the reward to any one who can give definite information as to the circumstances attending the death of John Braden to be paid by mister Beachcroft And he s mister Folliot s solicitor So that comes from mister Folliot What has he to do with it And are these two putting their heads together or are these bills quite independent of each other Hang me if I understand it Bryce read and re read the contents of the two bills And then he thought for awhile before speaking Well he said at last there s probably this in it the Folliots are very wealthy people missus Folliot it s pretty well known wants her son to marry Miss Bewery doctor Ransford s ward Probably she doesn t wish any suspicion to hang over the family That s all I can suggest In the other case Ransford wants to clear himself For don t forget this Mitchington somewhere somebody may know something Only something But that something might clear Ransford of the suspicion that s undoubtedly been cast upon him If you re thinking to get a strong case against Ransford you ve got your work set He gave your theory a nasty knock this morning by his few words about that pill Did Coates and Everest find a pill now Not at liberty to say sir answered Mitchington At present anyway Um I dislike these private offers of reward it means that those who make em get hold of information which is kept back from us d you see They re inconvenient Then he went away and Bryce after waiting awhile until night had settled down slipped quietly out of the house and set off for the gloom of Paradise CHAPTER XVI BEFOREHAND In accordance with his undeniable capacity for contriving and scheming Bryce had made due and careful preparations for his visit to the tomb of Richard Jenkins Even in the momentary confusion following upon his discovery of Collishaw s dead body he had been sufficiently alive to his own immediate purposes to notice that the tomb a very ancient and dilapidated structure stood in the midst of a small expanse of stone pavement between the yew trees and the wall of the nave he had noticed also that the pavement consisted of small squares of stone some of which bore initials and dates A sharp glance at the presumed whereabouts of the particular spot which he wanted as indicated in the scrap of paper taken from Braden s purse showed him that he would have to raise one of those small squares possibly two or three of them And so he had furnished himself with a short crowbar of tempered steel specially purchased at the iron monger s and with a small bull s eye lantern Had he been arrested and searched as he made his way towards the cathedral precincts he might reasonably have been suspected of a design to break into the treasury and appropriate the various ornaments for which Wrychester was famous But Bryce feared neither arrest nor observation During his residence in Wrychester he had done a good deal of prowling about the old city at night and he knew that Paradise at any time after dark was a deserted place Folk might cross from the close archway to the wicket gate by the outer path but no one would penetrate within the thick screen of yew and cypress when night had fallen And now in early summer the screen of trees and bushes was so thick in leaf that once within it foliage on one side the great walls of the nave on the other there was little likelihood of any person overlooking his doings while he made his investigation He anticipated a swift and quiet job to be done in a few minutes But there was another individual in Wrychester who knew just as much of the geography of Paradise as Pemberton Bryce knew Dick Bewery and Betty Campany had of late progressed out of the schoolboy and schoolgirl hail fellow well met stage to the first dawnings of love and in spite of their frequent meetings had begun a romantic correspondence between each other the joy and mystery of which was increased a hundredfold by a secret method of exchange of these missives Just within the wicket gate entrance of Paradise there was an old monument wherein was a convenient cavity Dick Bewery s ready wits transformed this into love s post office In it he regularly placed letters for Betty Betty stuffed into it letters for him And on this particular evening Dick had gone to Paradise to collect a possible mail and as Bryce walked leisurely up the narrow path enclosed by trees and old masonry which led from Friary Lane to the ancient enclosure Dick turned a corner and ran full into him In the light of the single lamp which illumined the path the two recovered themselves and looked at each other Hullo said Bryce What s your hurry young Bewery Dick who was panting for breath more from excitement than haste drew back and looked at Bryce Up to then he knew nothing much against Bryce whom he had rather liked in the fashion in which boys sometimes like their seniors and he was not indisposed to confide in him Hullo he replied I say Where are you off to Nowhere strolling round answered Bryce No particular purpose why You weren t going in there asked Dick jerking a thumb towards Paradise In there exclaimed Bryce Good Lord no dreary enough in the daytime What should I be going in there for Dick seized Bryce s coat sleeve and dragged him aside I say he whispered There s something up in there a search of some sort Bryce started in spite of an effort to keep unconcerned A search In there he said What do you mean Dick pointed amongst the trees and Bryce saw the faint glimmer of a light I was in there just now said Dick And some men three or four came along They re in there close up by the nave just where you found that chap Collishaw They re digging or something of that sort Digging muttered Bryce Digging Something like it anyhow replied Dick Listen Bryce heard the ring of metal on stone And an unpleasant conviction stole over him that he was being forestalled that somebody was beforehand with him and he cursed himself for not having done the previous night what he had left undone till this night Who are they he asked Did you see them their faces Not their faces answered Dick Only their figures in the gloom But I heard Mitchington s voice Police then said Bryce What on earth are they after Look here whispered Dick pulling at Bryce s arm again Come on I know how to get in there without their seeing us You follow me Bryce followed readily and Dick stepping through the wicket gate seized his companion s wrist and led him amongst the bushes in the direction of the spot from whence came the metallic sounds He walked with the step of a cat and Bryce took pains to follow his example And presently from behind a screen of cypresses they looked out on the expanse of flagging in the midst of which stood the tomb of Richard Jenkins Round about that tomb were five men whose faces were visible enough in the light thrown by a couple of strong lamps one of which stood on the tomb itself while the other was set on the ground Four out of the five the two watchers recognized at once One kneeling on the flags and busy with a small crowbar similar to that which Bryce carried inside his overcoat was the master mason of the cathedral Another standing near him was Mitchington A third was a clergyman one of the lesser dignitaries of the Chapter A fourth whose presence made Bryce start for the second time that evening was the Duke of Saxonsteade But the fifth was a stranger a tall man who stood between Mitchington and the Duke evidently paying anxious attention to the master mason s proceedings He was no Wrychester man Bryce was convinced of that And a moment later he was convinced of another equally certain fact Whatever these five men were searching for they had no clear or accurate idea of its exact whereabouts The master mason was taking up the small squares of flagstone with his crowbar one by one from the outer edge of the foot of the old box tomb as he removed each he probed the earth beneath it And Bryce who had instinctively realized what was happening and knew that somebody else than himself was in possession of the secret of the scrap of paper saw that it would be some time before they arrived at the precise spot indicated in the Latin directions He quietly drew back and tugged at Dick Bewery Stop here and keep quiet he whispered when they had retreated out of all danger of being overheard Watch em I want to fetch somebody want to know who that stranger is You don t know him Never seen him before replied Dick I say come quietly back don t give it away I want to know what it s all about Bryce squeezed the lad s arm by way of assurance and made his way back through the bushes He wanted to get hold of Harker and at once and he hurried round to the old man s house and without ceremony walked into his parlour Harker evidently expecting him and meanwhile amusing himself with his pipe and book rose from his chair as the younger man entered Found anything he asked We re done answered Bryce I was a fool not to go last night We re forestalled my friend that s about it By whom inquired Harker There are five of them at it now replied Bryce Mitchington a mason one of the cathedral clergy a stranger and the Duke of Saxonsteade What do you think of that Harker suddenly started as if a new light had dawned on him The Duke he exclaimed You don t say so My conscience now I wonder if that can really be Upon my word I d never thought of it Thought of what demanded Bryce Never mind tell you later said Harker At present is there any chance of getting a look at them That s what I came for retorted Bryce I ve been watching them with young Bewery He put me up to it Come on I want to see if you know the man who s a stranger Harker crossed the room to a chest of drawers and after some rummaging pulled something out Here he said handing some articles to Bryce Put those on over your boots Thick felt overshoes you could walk round your own mother s bedroom in those and she d never hear you I ll do the same A stranger you say Well this is a proof that somebody knows the secret of that scrap of paper besides us doctor They don t know the exact spot growled Bryce who was chafing at having been done out of his discovery But they ll find it whatever may be there He led Harker back to Paradise and to the place where he had left Dick Bewery whom they approached so quietly that Bryce was by the lad s side before Dick knew he was there And Harker after one glance at the ring of faces drew Bryce back and put his lips close to his ear and breathed a name in an almost imperceptible yet clear whisper Glassdale Bryce started for the third time Glassdale the man whom Harker had seen in Wrychester within an hour or so of Braden s death the ex convict the forger who had forged the Duke of Saxonsteade s name And there standing apparently quite at his ease by the Duke s side What did it all mean There was no explanation of what it meant to be had from the man whom Bryce and Harker and Dick Bewery secretly watched from behind the screen of cypress trees Four of them watched in silence or with no more than a whispered word now and then while the fifth worked This man worked methodically replacing each stone as he took it up and examined the soil beneath it So far nothing had resulted but he was by that time working at some distance from the tomb and Bryce who had an exceedingly accurate idea of where the spot might be as indicated in the measurements on the scrap of paper nudged Harker as the master mason began to take up the last of the small flags And suddenly there was a movement amongst the watchers and the master mason looked up from his job and motioned Mitchington to pass him a trowel which lay at a little distance Something here he said loudly enough to reach the ears of Bryce and his companions Not so deep down neither gentlemen A few vigorous applications of the trowel a few lumps of earth cast out of the cavity and the master mason put in his hand and drew forth a small parcel which in the light of the lamp held close to it by Mitchington looked to be done up in coarse sacking secured by great blotches of black sealing wax And now it was Harker who nudged Bryce drawing his attention to the fact that the parcel handed by the master mason to Mitchington was at once passed on by Mitchington to the Duke of Saxonsteade who it was very plain to see appeared to be as much delighted as surprised at receiving it Let us go to your office inspector he said We ll examine the contents there Let us all go at once The three figures behind the cypress trees remained immovable and silent until the five searchers had gone away with their lamps and tools and the sound of their retreating footsteps in Friary Lane had died out Then Dick Bewery moved and began to slip off and Bryce reached out a hand and took him by the shoulder I say Bewery he said Going to tell all that Harker got in a word before Dick could answer No matter if he does doctor he remarked quietly Whatever it is the whole town ll know of it by tomorrow They ll not keep it back Bryce let Dick go and the boy immediately darted off in the direction of the close while the two men went towards Harker s house Neither spoke until they were safe in the old detective s little parlour then Harker turning up his lamp looked at Bryce and shook his head It s a good job I ve retired he said almost sadly I m getting too old for my trade doctor Once upon a time I should have been fit to kick myself for not having twigged the meaning of this business sooner than I have done Have you twigged it demanded Bryce almost scornfully You re a good deal cleverer than I am if you have For hang me if I know what it means I do answered Harker He opened a drawer in his desk and drew out a scrap book filled as Bryce saw a moment later with cuttings from newspapers all duly arranged and indexed The old man glanced at the index turned to a certain page and put his finger on an entry There you are he said And that s only one there are several more They ll tell you in detail what I can tell you in a few words and what I ought to have remembered It s fifteen years since the famous robbery at Saxonsteade which has never been accounted for robbery of the Duchess s diamonds one of the cleverest burglaries ever known doctor They were got one night after a grand ball there no arrest was ever made they were never traced And I ll lay all I m worth to a penny piece that the Duke and those men are gladding their eyes with the sight of them just now in Mitchington s office and that the information that they were where they ve just been found was given to the Duke by Glassdale Glassdale That man exclaimed Bryce who was puzzling his brain over possible developments That man sir repeated Harker That s why Glassdale was in Wrychester the day of Braden s death And that s why Braden or Brake came to Wrychester at all He and Glassdale of course had somehow come into possession of the secret and no doubt meant to tell the Duke together and get the reward there was ninety five thousand offered And as Brake s dead Glassdale s spoken but here the old man paused and gave his companion a shrewd look the question still remains How did Brake come to his end CHAPTER XVII TO BE SHADOWED Dick Bewery burst in upon his sister and Ransford with a budget of news such as it rarely fell to the lot of romance loving seventeen to tell Secret and mysterious digging up of grave yards by night discovery of sealed packets the contents of which might only be guessed at the whole thing observed by hidden spectators these were things he had read of in fiction but had never expected to have the luck to see in real life And being gifted with some powers of imagination and of narrative he made the most of his story to a pair of highly attentive listeners each of whom had his and her own reasons for particular attention More mystery remarked Mary when Dick s story had come to an end What a pity they didn t open the parcel She looked at Ransford who was evidently in deep thought I suppose it will all come out she suggested Sure to he answered and turned to Dick You say Bryce fetched old Harker after you and Bryce had watched these operations a bit Did he say why he fetched him Never said anything as to his reasons answered Dick But I rather guessed at the end that Bryce wanted me to keep quiet about it only old Harker said there was no need Ransford made no comment on this and Dick having exhausted his stock of news presently went off to bed Master Bryce observed Ransford after a period of silence is playing a game What it is I don t know but I m certain of it Well we shall see You ve been much upset by all this he went on after another pause and the knowledge that you have has distressed me beyond measure But just have a little a very little more patience and things will be cleared I can t tell all that s in my mind even to you Mary who had been sewing while Ransford as was customary with him in an evening read the Times to her looked down at her work I shouldn t care if only these rumours in the town about you could be crushed she said It s so cruel so vile that such things Ransford snapped his fingers I don t care that about the rumours he answered contemptuously They ll be crushed out just as suddenly as they arose and then perhaps I ll let certain folk in Wrychester know what I think of them And as regards the suspicion against me I know already that the only people in the town for whose opinion I care fully accept what I said before the Coroner As to the others let them talk If the thing comes to a head before its due time You make me think that you know more much more than you ve ever told me interrupted Mary So I do he replied And you ll see in the end why I ve kept silence Of course if people who don t know as much will interfere He was interrupted there by the ringing of the front door bell at the sound of which he and Mary looked at each other Who can that be said Mary It s past ten o clock Ransford offered no suggestion He sat silently waiting until the parlourmaid entered Inspector Mitchington would be much obliged if you could give him a few minutes sir she said Ransford got up from his chair Take Inspector Mitchington into the study he said Is he alone No sir there s a gentleman with him replied the girl All right I ll be with them presently answered Ransford Take them both in there and light the gas Police he went on when the parlourmaid had gone They get hold of the first idea that strikes them and never even look round for another You re not frightened Frightened no Uneasy yes replied Mary What can they want this time of night Probably to tell me something about this romantic tale of Dick s answered Ransford as he left the room It ll be nothing more serious I assure you But he was not so sure of that He was very well aware that the Wrychester police authorities had a definite suspicion of his guilt in the Braden and Collishaw matters and he knew from experience that police suspicion is a difficult matter to dissipate And before he opened the door of the little room which he used as a study he warned himself to be careful and silent The two visitors stood near the hearth Ransford took a good look at them as he closed the door behind him Mitchington he knew well enough he was more interested in the other man a stranger A quiet looking very ordinary individual who might have been half a dozen things but Ransford instantly set him down as a detective He turned from this man to the inspector Well he said a little brusquely What is it Sorry to intrude so late doctor Ransford answered Mitchington but I should be much obliged if you would give us a bit of information badly wanted doctor in view of recent events he added with a smile which was meant to be reassuring I m sure you can if you will Sit down said Ransford pointing to chairs He took one himself and again glanced at the stranger To whom am I speaking in addition to yourself Inspector he asked I m not going to talk to strangers Oh well said Mitchington a little awkwardly Of course doctor we ve had to get a bit of professional help in these unpleasant matters This gentleman s Detective Sergeant Jettison from the Yard What information do you want asked Ransford Mitchington glanced at the door and lowered his voice I may as well tell you doctor he said confidentially there s been a most extraordinary discovery made tonight which has a bearing on the Braden case I dare say you ve heard of the great jewel robbery which took place at the Duke of Saxonsteade s some years ago which has been a mystery to this very day I have heard of it answered Ransford Very well tonight those jewels the whole lot have been discovered in Paradise yonder where they d been buried at the time of the robbery by the thief continued Mitchington They ve just been examined and they re now in the Duke s own hands again after all these years And I may as well tell you we now know that the object of Braden s visit to Wrychester was to tell the Duke where those jewels were hidden Braden and another man had learned the secret from the real thief who s dead in Australia All that I may tell you doctor for it ll be public property tomorrow Well said Ransford Mitchington hesitated a moment as if searching for his next words He glanced at the detective the detective remained immobile he glanced at Ransford Ransford gave him no encouragement Now look here doctor he exclaimed suddenly Why not tell us something We know now who Braden really was That s settled Do you understand Who was he then asked Ransford quietly He was one John Brake some time manager of a branch of a London bank who seventeen years ago got ten years penal servitude for embezzlement answered Mitchington watching Ransford steadily That s dead certain we know it The man who shared this secret with him about the Saxonsteade jewels has told us that much today John Brake What have you come here for asked Ransford To ask you between ourselves if you can tell us anything about Brake s earlier days antecedents that ll help us replied Mitchington It may be Jettison here a man of experience thinks it ll be found to be that Brake or Braden as we call him was murdered because of his possession of that secret about the jewels Our informant tells us that Braden certainly had on him when he came to Wrychester a sort of diagram showing the exact location of the spot where the jewels were hidden that diagram was most assuredly not found on Braden when we examined his clothing and effects It may be that it was wrested from him in the gallery of the clerestory that morning and that his assailant or assailants for there may have been two men at the job afterwards pitched him through that open doorway after half stifling him And if that theory s correct and I personally am now quite inclined to it it ll help a lot if you ll tell us what you know of Braden s Brake s antecedents Come now doctor you know very well that Braden or Brake did come to your surgery that morning and said to your assistant that he d known a doctor Ransford in times past Why not speak Ransford instead of answering Mitchington s evidently genuine appeal looked at the New Scotland Yard man Is that your theory he asked Jettison nodded his head with a movement indicative of conviction Yes sir he replied Having regard to all the circumstances of the case as they ve been put before me since I came here and with special regard to the revelations which have resulted in the discovery of these jewels it is Of course today s events have altered everything If it hadn t been for our informant Who is your informant inquired Ransford The two callers looked at each other the detective nodded at the inspector Oh well said Mitchington No harm in telling you doctor A man named Glassdale once a fellow convict with Brake It seems they left England together after their time was up emigrated together prospered even went so far both of em as to make good the money they d appropriated and eventually came back together in possession of this secret Brake came specially to Wrychester to tell the Duke Glassdale was to join him on the very morning Brake met his death Glassdale did come to the town that morning and as soon as he got here heard of Brake s strange death That upset him and he went away only to come back today go to Saxonsteade and tell everything to the Duke with the result we ve told you of Which result remarked Ransford steadily regarding Mitchington has apparently altered all your ideas about me Mitchington laughed a little awkwardly Oh well come now doctor he said Why yes frankly I m inclined to Jettison s theory in fact I m certain that s the truth And your theory inquired Ransford turning to the detective is put it in a few words My theory and I ll lay anything it s the correct one is this replied Jettison Brake came to Wrychester with his secret That secret wasn t confined to him and Glassdale either he let it out to somebody or it was known to somebody I understand from Inspector Mitchington here that on the evening of his arrival Brake was away from the Mitre Hotel for two hours During that time he was somewhere with whom Probably with somebody who got the secret out of him or to whom he communicated it For think according to Glassdale who we are quite sure has told the exact truth about everything Brake had on him a scrap of paper on which were instructions in Latin for finding the exact spot whereat the missing Saxonsteade jewels had been hidden years before by the actual thief who I may tell you sir never had the opportunity of returning to re possess himself of them Now after Brake s death the police examined his clothes and effects they never found that scrap of paper And I work things out this way Brake was followed into that gallery a lonely quiet place by the man or men who had got possession of the secret he was I m told a slightly built not over strong man he was seized and robbed of that paper and flung to his death And all that fits in with the second mystery of Collishaw who probably knew if not everything then something of the exact circumstances of Brake s death and let his knowledge get to the ears of Brake s assailant who cleverly got rid of him That s my notion concluded the detective And I shall be surprised if it isn t a correct one And as I ve said doctor chimed in Mitchington can t you give us a bit of information now You see the line we re on Now as it s evident you once knew Braden or Brake I have never said so interrupted Ransford sharply Well we infer it from the undoubted fact that he called here remarked Mitchington And if Wait said Ransford He had been listening with absorbed attention to Jettison s theory and he now rose from his chair and began to pace the room hands in pockets as if in deep thought Suddenly he paused and looked at Mitchington This needs some reflection he said Are you pressed for time Not in the least answered Mitchington readily Our time s yours sir Take as long as you like Ransford touched a bell and summoning the parlourmaid told her to fetch whisky soda and cigars He pressed these things on the two men lighted a cigar himself and for a long time continued to walk up and down his end of the room smoking and evidently in very deep thought The visitors left him alone watching him curiously now and then until when quite ten minutes had gone by he suddenly drew a chair close to them and sat down again Now listen to me he said If I give my confidence to you as police officials will you give me your word that you won t make use of my information until I give you leave or until you have consulted me further I shall rely on your word mind I say yes to that doctor answered Mitchington The same here sir said the detective Very well continued Ransford Then this is between ourselves until such time as I say something more about it First of all I am not going to tell you anything whatever about Braden s antecedents at present Secondly I am not sure that your theory mister Jettison is entirely correct though I think it is by way of coming very near to the right one which is sure to be worked out before long But on the understanding of secrecy for the present I can tell you something which I should not have been able to tell you but for the events of tonight which have made me put together certain facts Now attention To begin with I know where Braden was for at any rate some time on the evening of the day on which he came to Wrychester He was with the old man whom we all know as Simpson Harker Mitchington whistled the detective who knew nothing of Simpson Harker glanced at him as if for information But Mitchington nodded at Ransford and Ransford went on I know this for this reason he continued You know where Harker lives I was in attendance for nearly two hours that evening on a patient in a house opposite I spent a good deal of time in looking out of the window I saw Harker take a man into his house I saw the man leave the house nearly an hour later I recognized that man next day as the man who met his death at the Cathedral So much for that Good muttered Mitchington Good Explains a lot But continued Ransford what I have to tell you now is of a much more serious and confidential nature Now do you know but of course you don t that your proceedings tonight were watched Watched exclaimed Mitchington Who watched us Harker for one answered Ransford And for another my late assistant mister Pemberton Bryce Mitchington s jaw dropped God bless my soul he said You don t mean it doctor Why how did you Wait a minute interrupted Ransford He left the room and the two callers looked at each other This chap knows more than you think observed Jettison in a whisper More than he s telling now Let s get all we can then said Mitchington who was obviously much surprised by Ransford s last information Get it while he s in the mood Let him take his own time advised Jettison But you mark me he knows a lot This is only an instalment Ransford came back with Dick Bewery clad in a loud patterned and gaily coloured suit of pyjamas Now Dick said Ransford Tell Inspector Mitchington precisely what happened this evening within your own knowledge Dick was nothing loth to tell his story for the second time especially to a couple of professional listeners And he told it in full detail from the moment of his sudden encounter with Bryce to that in which he parted with Bryce and Harker Ransford watching the official faces saw what it was in the story that caught the official attention and excited the official mind doctor Bryce went off at once to fetch Harker did he asked Mitchington when Dick had made a end At once answered Dick And was jolly quick back with him And Harker said it didn t matter about your telling as it would be public news soon enough continued Mitchington Just that said Dick Mitchington looked at Ransford and Ransford nodded to his ward All right Dick he said That ll do The boy went off again and Mitchington shook his head Queer he said Now what have those two been up to something that s certain Can you tell us more doctor Under the same conditions yes answered Ransford taking his seat again The fact is affairs have got to a stage where I consider it my duty to tell you more Some of what I shall tell you is hearsay but it s hearsay that you can easily verify for yourselves when the right moment comes mister Campany the librarian lately remarked to me that my old assistant mister Bryce seemed to be taking an extraordinary interest in archaeological matters since he left me he was now said Campany always examining documents about the old tombs and monuments of the Cathedral and its precincts Ah just so exclaimed Mitchington To be sure I m beginning to see And continued Ransford Campany further remarked as a matter for humorous comment that Bryce was also spending much time looking round our old tombs Now you made this discovery near an old tomb I understand Close by one yes assented the inspector Then let me draw your attention to one or two strange facts which are undoubted facts continued Ransford Bryce was left alone with the dead body of Braden for some minutes while Varner went to fetch the police That s one That s true muttered Mitchington He was several minutes Bryce it was who discovered Collishaw in Paradise said Ransford That s fact two And fact three Bryce evidently had a motive in fetching Harker tonight to overlook your operations What was his motive And taking things altogether what are or have been these secret affairs which Bryce and Harker have evidently been engaged in Jettison suddenly rose buttoning his light overcoat The action seemed to indicate a newly formed idea a definite conclusion He turned sharply to Mitchington There s one thing certain inspector he said You ll keep an eye on those two from this out From just now I shall assented Mitchington I ll have both of em shadowed wherever they go or are day or night Harker now has always been a bit of a mystery but Bryce hang me if I don t believe he s been having me Double game but never mind There s no more doctor Not yet replied Ransford And I don t know the real meaning or value of what I have told you But in two days from now I can tell you more In the meantime remember your promise He let his visitors out then and went back to Mary You ll not have to wait long for things to clear he said The mystery s nearly over CHAPTER XVIII SURPRISE Mitchington and the man from New Scotland Yard walked away in silence from Ransford s house and kept the silence up until they were in the middle of the Close and accordingly in solitude Then Mitchington turned to his companion What d ye think of that he asked with a half laugh Different complexion it puts on things eh I think just what I said before in there replied the detective That man knows more than he s told even now Why hasn t he spoken sooner then demanded Mitchington He s had two good chances at the inquests From what I saw of him just now said Jettison I should say he s the sort of man who can keep his own counsel till he considers the right time has come for speaking Not the sort of man who ll care twopence whatever s said about him you understand I should say he s known a good lot all along and is just keeping it back till he can put a finishing touch to it Two days didn t he say Aye well a lot can happen in two days But about your theory questioned Mitchington What do you think of it now in relation to what we ve just heard I ll tell you what I can see answered Jettison I can see how one bit of this puzzle fits into another in view of what Ransford has just told us Of course one s got to do a good deal of supposing it s unavoidable in these cases Now supposing Braden let this man Harker into the secret of the hidden jewels that night and supposing that Harker and Bryce are in collusion as they evidently are from what that boy told us and supposing they between them together or separately had to do with Braden s death and supposing that man Collishaw saw some thing that would incriminate one or both eh Well asked Mitchington Bryce is a medical man observed Jettison It would be an easy thing for a medical man to get rid of Collishaw as he undoubtedly was got rid of Do you see my point Aye and I can see that Bryce is a clever hand at throwing dust in anybody s eyes muttered Mitchington I ve had some dealings with him over this affair and I m beginning to think only now that he s been having me for the mug He s evidently a deep un and so s the other man I wanted to ask you that said Jettison Now exactly who are these two tell me about them both Not so much to tell answered Mitchington Harker s a quiet old chap who lives in a little house over there just off that far corner of this Close Said to be a retired tradesman from London Came here a few years ago to settle down Inoffensive pleasant old chap Potters about the town puts in his time as such old chaps do bit of reading at the libraries bit of gossip here and there you know the sort Last man in the world I should have thought would have been mixed up in an affair of this sort And therefore all the more likely to be said Jettison Well the other Bryce was until the very day of Braden s appearance Ransford s assistant continued Mitchington Been with Ransford about two years Clever chap undoubtedly but certainly deep and in a way reserved though he can talk plenty if he s so minded and it s to his own advantage He left Ransford suddenly that very morning I don t know why Since then he s remained in the town I ve heard that he s pretty keen on Ransford s ward sister of that lad we saw tonight I don t know myself if it s true but I ve wondered if that had anything to do with his leaving Ransford so suddenly Very likely said Jettison They had crossed the Close by that time and come to a gas lamp which stood at the entrance and the detective pulled out his watch and glanced at it Ten past eleven he said You say you know this Bryce pretty well Now would it be too late if he s up still to take a look at him If you and he are on good terms you could make an excuse After what I ve heard I d like to get at close quarters with this gentleman Easy enough assented Mitchington I ve been there as late as this he s one of the sort that never goes to bed before midnight Come on it s close by But not a word of where we ve been I ll say I ve dropped in to give him a bit of news We ll tell him about the jewel business and see how he takes it And while we re there size him up Mitchington was right in his description of Bryce s habits Bryce rarely went to bed before one o clock in the morning He liked to sit up reading His favourite mental food was found in the lives of statesmen and diplomatists most of them of the sort famous for trickery and chicanery he not only made a close study of the ways of these gentry but wrote down notes and abstracts of passages which particularly appealed to him His lamp was burning when Mitchington and Jettison came in view of his windows but that night Bryce was doing no thinking about statecraft his mind was fixed on his own affairs He had lighted his fire on going home and for an hour had sat with his legs stretched out on the fender carefully weighing things up The event of the night had convinced him that he was at a critical phase of his present adventure and it behoved him as a good general to review his forces The forestalling of his plans about the hiding place in Paradise had upset Bryce s schemes he had figured on being able to turn that secret whatever it was to his own advantage It struck him now as he meditated that he had never known exactly what he expected to get out of that secret but he had hoped that it would have been something which would make a few more considerable and tightly strung meshes in the net which he was endeavouring to weave around Ransford Now he was faced by the fact that it was not going to yield anything in the way of help it was a secret no longer and it had yielded nothing beyond the mere knowledge that John Braden who was in reality John Brake had carried the secret to Warchester to reveal it in the proper quarter That helped Bryce in no way so far as he could see And therefore it was necessary to re state his case to himself to take stock to see where he stood and more than all to put plainly before his own mind exactly what he wanted And just before Mitchington and the detective came up the path to his door Bryce had put his notions into clear phraseology His aim was definite he wanted to get Ransford completely into his power through suspicion of Ransford s guilt in the affairs of Braden and Collishaw He wanted at the same time to have the means of exonerating him whether by fact or by craft so that as an ultimate method of success for his own projects he would be able to go to Mary Bewery and say Ransford s very life is at my mercy if I keep silence he s lost if I speak he s saved it s now for you to say whether I m to speak or hold my tongue and you re the price I want for my speaking to save him It was in accordance with his views of human nature that Mary Bewery would accede to his terms he had not known her and Ransford for nothing and he was aware that she had a profound gratitude for her guardian which might even be akin to a yet unawakened warmer feeling The probability was that she would willingly sacrifice herself to save Ransford and Bryce cared little by what means he won her fair or foul so long as he was successful So now he said to himself he must make a still more definite move against Ransford He must strengthen and deepen the suspicions which the police already had he must give them chapter and verse and supply them with information and get Ransford into the tightest of corners solely that in order to win Mary Bewery he might have the credit of pulling him out again That he felt certain he could do if he could make a net in which to enclose Ransford he could also invent a two edged sword which would cut every mesh of that net into fragments That would be child s play mere statecraft elementary diplomacy But first to get Ransford fairly bottled up that was the thing He determined to lose no more time and he was thinking of visiting Mitchington immediately after breakfast next morning when Mitchington knocked at his door Bryce was rarely taken back and on seeing Mitchington and a companion he forthwith invited them into his parlour put out his whisky and cigars and pressed both on them as if their late call were a matter of usual occurrence And when he had helped both to a drink he took one himself and tumbler in hand dropped into his easy chair again We saw your light doctor so I took the liberty of dropping into tell you a bit of news observed the inspector But I haven t introduced my friend this is Detective Sergeant Jettison of the Yard we ve got him down about this business must have help you know Bryce gave the detective a half sharp half careless look and nodded mister Jettison will have abundant opportunities for the exercise of his talents he observed in his best cynical manner I dare say he s found that out already Not an easy affair sir to be sure assented Jettison Complicated Highly so agreed Bryce He yawned and glanced at the inspector What s your news Mitchington he asked almost indifferently Oh well answered Mitchington As the Herald s published tomorrow you ll see it in there doctor I ve supplied an account for this week s issue just a short one but I thought you d like to know You ve heard of the famous jewel robbery at the Duke s some years ago Yes well we ve found all the whole bundle tonight buried in Paradise And how do you think the secret came out No good at guessing said Bryce It came out continued Mitchington through a man who with Braden Braden mark you got in possession of it it s a long story and with Braden was going to reveal it to the Duke that very day Braden was killed This man waited until this very morning and then told his Grace his Grace came with him to us this afternoon and tonight we made a search and found everything Buried there in Paradise Dug em up doctor Bryce showed no great interest He took a leisurely sip at his liquor and set down the glass and pulled out his cigarette case The two men watching him narrowly saw that his fingers were steady as rocks as he struck the match Yes he said as he threw the match away I saw you busy In spite of himself Mitchington could not repress a start nor a glance at Jettison But Jettison was as imperturbable as Bryce himself and Mitchington raised a forced laugh You did he said incredulously And we thought we had it all to ourselves How did you come to know doctor Young Bewery told me what was going on replied Bryce so I took a look at you And I fetched old Harker to take a look too We all watched you the boy Harker and I out of sheer curiosity of course We saw you get up the parcel But naturally I didn t know what was in it till now Mitchington thoroughly taken aback by this candid statement was at a loss for words and again he glanced at Jettison But Jettison gave no help and Mitchington fell back on himself So you fetched old Harker he said What what for doctor If one may ask you know Bryce made a careless gesture with his cigarette Oh old Harker s deeply interested in what s going on he answered And as young Bewery drew my attention to your proceedings why I thought I d draw Harker s And Harker was interested Mitchington hesitated before saying more But eventually he risked a leading question Any special reason why he should be doctor he asked Bryce put his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat and looked half lazily at his questioner Do you know who old Harker really is he inquired No answered Mitchington I know nothing about him except that he s said to be a retired tradesman from London who settled down here some time ago Bryce suddenly turned on Jettison Do you he asked I sir exclaimed Jettison I don t know this gentleman at all Bryce laughed with his usual touch of cynical sneering I ll tell you now who old Harker is Mitchington he said You may as well know I thought mister Jettison might recognize the name Harker is no retired London tradesman he s a retired member of your profession mister Jettison He was in his day one of the smartest men in the service of your department Only he s transposed his name ask them at the Yard if they remember Harker Simpson That seems to startle you Mitchington Well as you re here perhaps I d better startle you a bit more CHAPTER XIX THE SUBTLETY OF THE DEVIL There was a sudden determination and alertness in Bryce s last words which contrasted strongly and even strangely with the almost cynical indifference that had characterized him since his visitors came in and the two men recognized it and glanced questioningly at each other There was an alteration too in his manner instead of lounging lazily in his chair as if he had no other thought than of personal ease he was now sitting erect looking sharply from one man to the other his whole attitude bearing speech seemed to indicate that he had suddenly made up his mind to adopt some definite course of action I ll tell you more he repeated And since you re here now Mitchington who felt a curious uneasiness gave Jettison another glance And this time it was Jettison who spoke I should say he remarked quietly knowing what I ve gathered of the matter that we ought to be glad of any information doctor Bryce can give us Oh to be sure assented Mitchington You know more then doctor Bryce motioned his visitors to draw their chairs nearer to his and when he spoke it was in the low concentrated tones of a man who means business and confidential business Now look here Mitchington he said and you too mister Jettison as you re on this job I m going to talk straight to both of you And to begin with I ll make a bold assertion I know more of this Wrychester Paradise mystery involving the deaths of both Braden and Collishaw than any man living because though you don t know it Mitchington I ve gone right into it And I ll tell you in confidence why I went into it I want to marry doctor Ransford s ward Miss Bewery Bryce accompanied this candid admission with a look which seemed to say Here we are three men of the world who know what things are we understand each other And while Jettison merely nodded comprehendingly Mitchington put his thoughts into words To be sure doctor to be sure he said And accordingly what s their affair is yours Of course Something like that assented Bryce Naturally no man wishes to marry unless he knows as much as he can get to know about the woman he wants her family her antecedents and all that Now pretty nearly everybody in Wrychester who knows them knows that there s a mystery about doctor Ransford and his two wards it s been talked of no end amongst the old dowagers and gossips of the Close particularly you know what they are Miss Bewery herself and her brother young Dick in a lesser degree know there s a mystery And if there s one man in the world who knows the secret it s Ransford And up to now Ransford won t tell he won t even tell Miss Bewery I know that she s asked him he keeps up an obstinate silence And so I determined to find things out for myself Aye and when did you start on that little game now doctor asked Mitchington Was it before or since this affair developed In a really serious way since replied Bryce What happened on the day of Braden s death made me go thoroughly into the whole matter Now what did happen I ll tell you frankly now Mitchington that when we talked once before about this affair I didn t tell you all I might have told I d my reasons for reticence But now I ll give you full particulars of what happened that morning within my knowledge pay attention both of you and you ll see how one thing fits into another That morning about half past nine Ransford left his surgery and went across the Close Not long after he d gone this man Braden came to the door and asked me if doctor Ransford was in I said he wasn t he d just gone out and I showed the man in which direction He said he d once known a doctor Ransford and went away A little later I followed Near the entrance of Paradise I saw Ransford leaving the west porch of the Cathedral He was undeniably in a state of agitation pale nervous He didn t see me I went on and met Varner who told me of the accident I went with him to the foot of saint Wrytha s Stair and found the man who had recently called at the surgery He died just as I reached him I sent for you When you came I went back to the surgery I found Ransford there in a state of most unusual agitation he looked like a man who has had a terrible shock So much for these events Put them together Bryce paused awhile as if marshalling his facts Now after that he continued presently I began to investigate matters myself for my own satisfaction And very soon I found out certain things which I ll summarize briefly because some of my facts are doubtless known to you already First of all the man who came here as John Braden was in reality one John Brake He was at one time manager of a branch of a well known London banking company He appropriated money from them under apparently mysterious circumstances of which I as yet knew nothing he was prosecuted convicted and sentenced to ten years penal servitude And those two wards of Ransford s Mary and Richard Bewery as they are called are in reality Mary and Richard Brake his children You ve established that as a fact asked Jettison who was listening with close attention It s not a surmise on your part Bryce hesitated before replying to this question After all he reflected it was a surmise He could not positively prove his assertion Well he answered after a moment s thought I ll qualify that by saying that from the evidence I have and from what I know I believe it to be an indisputable fact What I do know of fact hard positive fact is this John Brake married a Mary Bewery at the parish church of Braden Medworth near Barthorpe in Leicestershire I ve seen the entry in the register with my own eyes His best man who signed the register as a witness was Mark Ransford Brake and Ransford as young men had been in the habit of going to Braden Medworth to fish Mary Bewery was governess at the vicarage there It was always supposed she would marry Ransford instead she married Brake who of course took her off to London Of their married life I know nothing But within a few years Brake was in trouble for the reason I have told you He was arrested and Harker was the man who arrested him Dear me exclaimed Mitchington Now if I d only known You ll know a lot before I m through said Bryce Now Harker of course can tell a lot yet it s unsatisfying Brake could make no defence but his counsel threw out strange hints and suggestions all to the effect that Brake had been cruelly and wickedly deceived in fact as it were trapped into doing what he did And by a man whom he d trusted as a close friend So much came to Harker s ears but no more and on that particular point I ve no light Go on from that to Brake s private affairs At the time of his arrest he had a wife and two very young children Either just before or at or immediately after his arrest they completely disappeared and Brake himself utterly refused to say one single word about them Harker asked if he could do anything Brake s answer was that no one was to concern himself He preserved an obstinate silence on that point The clergyman in whose family missus Brake had been governess saw Brake after his conviction Brake would say nothing to him Of missus Brake nothing more is known to me at any rate What was known at the time is this Brake communicated to all who came in contact with him just then the idea of a man who has been cruelly wronged and deceived who takes refuge in sullen silence and who is already planning and cherishing revenge Aye aye muttered Mitchington Revenge just So Brake then continued Bryce goes off to his term of penal servitude and so disappears until he reappears here in Wrychester Leave him for a moment and go back And it s a going back no doubt to supposition and to theory but there s reason in what I shall advance We know beyond doubt that Brake had been tricked and deceived in some money matter by some man some mysterious man whom he referred to as having been his closest friend We know too that there was extraordinary mystery in the disappearance of his wife and children Now from all that has been found out who was Brake s closest friend Ransford And of Ransford at that time there s no trace He too disappeared that s a fact which I ve established Years later he reappears here at Wrychester where he s bought a practice Eventually he has two young people who are represented as his wards come to live with him Their name is Bewery The name of the young woman whom John Brake married was Bewery What s the inference That their mother s dead that they re known under her maiden name that they without a shadow of doubt are John Brake s children And that leads up to my theory which I ll now tell you in confidence if you wish for it It s what I particularly wish for observed Jettison quietly The very thing Then it s this said Bryce Ransford was the close friend who tricked and deceived Brake He probably tricked him in some money affair and deceived him in his domestic affairs I take it that Ransford ran away with Brake s wife and that Brake sooner than air all his grievance to the world took it silently and began to concoct his ideas of revenge I put the whole thing this way Ransford ran away with missus Brake and the two children mere infants and disappeared Brake when he came out of prison went abroad possibly with the idea of tracking them Meanwhile as is quite evident he engaged in business and did well He came back to England as John Braden and for the reason of which you re aware he paid a visit to Wrychester utterly unaware that any one known to him lived here Now try to reconstruct what happened He looks round the Close that morning He sees the name of doctor Mark Ransford on the brass plate of a surgery door He goes to the surgery asks a question makes a remark goes away What is the probable sequence of events He meets Ransford near the Cathedral where Ransford certainly was They recognize each other most likely they turn aside go up to that gallery as a quiet place to talk there is an altercation blows somehow or other probably from accident Braden is thrown through that open doorway to his death And Collishaw saw what happened Bryce was watching his listeners turning alternately from one to the other But it needed little attention on his part to see that theirs was already closely strained each man was eagerly taking in all that he said and suggested And he went on emphasizing every point as he made it Collishaw saw what happened he repeated That of course is theory supposition But now we pass from theory back to actual fact I ll tell you something now Mitchington which you ve never heard of I m certain I made it in my way after Collishaw s death to get some information secretly from his widow who s a fairly shrewd intelligent woman for her class Now the widow in looking over her husband s effects in a certain drawer in which he kept various personal matters came across the deposit book of a Friendly Society of which Collishaw had been a member for some years It appears that he Collishaw was something of a saving man and every year he managed to put by a bit of money out of his wages and twice or thrice in the year he took these savings never very much merely a pound or two to this Friendly Society which it seems takes deposits in that way from its members Now in this book is an entry I saw it which shows that only two days before his death Collishaw paid fifty pounds fifty pounds mark you into the Friendly Society Where should Collishaw get fifty pounds all of a sudden He was a mason s labourer earning at the very outside twenty six or eight shillings a week According to his wife there was no one to leave him a legacy She never heard of his receipt of this money from any source But there s the fact What explains it My theory that the rumour that Collishaw with a pint too much ale in him had hinted that he could say something about Braden s death if he chose had reached Braden s assailant that he had made it his business to see Collishaw and had paid him that fifty pounds as hush money and later had decided to rid himself of Collishaw altogether as he undoubtedly did by poison Once more Bryce paused and once more the two listeners showed their attention by complete silence Now we come to the question how was Collishaw poisoned continued Bryce For poisoned he was without doubt Here we go back to theory and supposition once more I haven t the least doubt that the hydrocyanic acid which caused his death was taken by him in a pill a pill that was in that box which they found on him Mitchington and showed me But that particular pill though precisely similar in appearance could not be made up of the same ingredients which were in the other pills It was probably a thickly coated pill which contained the poison in solution of course The coating would melt almost as soon as the man had swallowed it and death would result instantaneously Collishaw you may say was condemned to death when he put that box of pills in his waistcoat pocket It was mere chance mere luck as to when the exact moment of death came to him There had been six pills in that box there were five left So Collishaw picked out the poisoned pill first It might have been delayed till the sixth dose you see but he was doomed Mitchington showed a desire to speak and Bryce paused What about what Ransford said before the Coroner asked Mitchington He demanded certain information about the post mortem you know which he said ought to have shown that there was nothing poisonous in those pills Pooh exclaimed Bryce contemptuously Mere bluff Of such a pill as that I ve described there d be no trace but the sugar coating and the poison I tell you I haven t the least doubt that that was how the poison was administered It was easy And who is there that would know how easily it could be administered but a medical man Mitchington and Jettison exchanged glances Then Jettison leaned nearer to Bryce So your theory is that Ransford got rid of both Braden and Collishaw murdered both of them in fact he suggested Do I understand that s what it really comes to in plain words Not quite replied Bryce I don t say that Ransford meant to kill Braden my notion is that they met had an altercation probably a struggle and that Braden lost his life in it But as regards Collishaw Don t forget interrupted Mitchington Varner swore that he saw Braden flung through that doorway Flung out He saw a hand For everything that Varner could prove to the contrary answered Bryce the hand might have been stretched out to pull Braden back No I think there may have been accident in that affair But as regards Collishaw murder without doubt deliberate He lighted another cigarette with the air of a man who had spoken his mind and Mitchington realizing that he had said all he had to say got up from his seat Well it s all very interesting and very clever doctor he said glancing at Jettison And we shall keep it all in mind Of course you ve talked all this over with Harker I should like to know what he has to say Now that you ve told us who he is I suppose we can talk to him You ll have to wait a few days then said Bryce He s gone to town by the last train tonight on this business I ve sent him I had some information today about Ransford s whereabouts during the time of disappearance and I ve commissioned Harker to examine into it When I hear what he s found out I ll let you know You re taking some trouble remarked Mitchington I ve told you the reason answered Bryce Mitchington hesitated a little then with a motion of his head towards the door beckoned Jettison to follow him All right he said There s plenty for us to see into I m thinking Bryce laughed and pointed to a shelf of books near the fireplace Do you know what Napoleon Bonaparte once gave as sound advice to police he asked No Then I ll tell you The art of the police he said is not to see that which it is useless for it to see Good counsel Mitchington The two men went away through the midnight streets and kept silence until they were near the door of Jettison s hotel Then Mitchington spoke Well he said We ve had a couple of tales anyhow What do you think of things now Jettison threw back his head with a dry laugh Never been better puzzled in all my time he said Never But if that young doctor s playing a game then by the Lord Harry inspector it s a damned deep un And my advice is watch the lot CHAPTER XX JETTISON TAKES A HAND By breakfast time next morning the man from New Scotland Yard had accomplished a series of meditations on the confidences made to him and Mitchington the night before and had determined on at least one course of action But before entering upon it he had one or two important letters to write the composition of which required much thought and trouble and by the time he had finished them and deposited them by his own hand in the General Post Office it was drawing near to noon the great bell of the Cathedral indeed was proclaiming noontide to Wrychester as Jettison turned into the police station and sought Mitchington in his office I was just coming round to see if you d overslept yourself said Mitchington good humouredly We were up pretty late last night or rather this morning I ve had letters to write said Jettison He sat down and picked up a newspaper and cast a casual glance over it Got anything fresh Well this much answered Mitchington The two gentlemen who told us so much last night are both out of town I made an excuse to call on them both early this morning just on nine o clock doctor Ransford went up to London by the eight fifteen doctor Bryce says his landlady went out on his bicycle at half past eight where she didn t know but she fancied into the country However I ascertained that Ransford is expected back this evening and Bryce gave orders for his usual dinner to be ready at seven o clock and so Jettison flung away the newspaper and pulled out his pipe Oh I don t think they ll run away either of em he remarked indifferently They re both too cock sure of their own ways of looking at things You looked at em any more asked Mitchington Done a bit of reflecting yes replied the detective Complicated affair my lad More in it than one would think at first sight I m certain of this quite apart from whatever mystery there is about the Braden affair and the Collishaw murder there s a lot of scheming and contriving been going on and is going on somewhere by somebody Underhand work you understand However my particular job is the Collishaw business and there s a bit of information I d like to get hold of at once Where s the office of that Friendly Society we heard about last night That ll be the Wrychester Second Friendly answered Mitchington There are two such societies in the town the first s patronized by small tradesmen and the like the second by workingmen The second does take deposits from its members The office is in Fladgate secretary s name outside mister Stebbing What are you after Tell you later said Jettison Just an idea He went leisurely out and across the market square and into the narrow old world street called Fladgate along which he strolled as if doing no more than looking about him until he came to an ancient shop which had been converted into an office and had a wire blind over the lower half of its front window wherein was woven in conspicuous gilt letters Wrychester Second Friendly Society George Stebbing Secretary Nothing betokened romance or mystery in that essentially humble place but it was in Jettison s mind that when he crossed its threshold he was on his way to discovering something that would possibly clear up the problem on which he was engaged The staff of the Second Friendly was inconsiderable in numbers an outer office harboured a small boy and a tall young man an inner one accommodated mister Stebbing also a young man sandy haired and freckled who having inspected Detective Sergeant Jettison s professional card gave him the best chair in the room and stared at him with a mingling of awe and curiosity which plainly showed that he had never entertained a detective before And as if to show his visitor that he realized the seriousness of the occasion he nodded meaningly at his door All safe here sir he whispered Well fitting doors in these old houses knew how to make em in those days No chance of being overheard here what can I do for you sir Thank you much obliged to you said Jettison No objection to my pipe I suppose Just so Ah well between you and me mister Stebbing I m down here in connection with that Collishaw case you know I know sir poor fellow said the secretary Cruel thing sir if the man was put an end to One of our members was Collishaw sir So I understand remarked Jettison That s what I ve come about Bit of information on the quiet eh Strictly between our two selves for the present Stebbing nodded and winked as if he had been doing business with detectives all his life To be sure sir to be sure he responded with alacrity Just between you and me and the door post all right Anything I can do mister Jettison shall be done But it s more in the way of what I can tell I suppose Something of that sort replied Jettison in his slow easy going fashion I want to know a thing or two Yours is a working man s society I think Aye and I understand you ve a system whereby such a man can put his bits of savings by in your hands A capital system too answered the secretary seizing on a pamphlet and pushing it into his visitor s hand I don t believe there s better in England If you read that I ll take a look at it some time said Jettison putting the pamphlet in his pocket Well now I also understand that Collishaw was in the habit of bringing you a bit of saved money now and then a sort of saving fellow wasn t he Stebbing nodded assent and reached for a ledger which lay on the farther side of his desk Collishaw he answered had been a member of our society ever since it started fourteen years ago And he d been putting in savings for some eight or nine years Not much you ll understand Say as an average two to three pounds every half year never more But just before his death or murder or whatever you like to call it he came in here one day with fifty pounds Fairly astounded me sir Fifty pounds all in a lump It s about that fifty pounds I want to know something said Jettison He didn t tell you how he d come by it Wasn t a legacy for instance He didn t say anything but that he d had a bit of luck answered Stebbing I asked no questions Legacy now no he didn t mention that Here it is he continued turning over the pages of the ledger There fifty pounds You see the date that ud be two days before his death Jettison glanced at the ledger and resumed his seat Now then mister Stebbing I want you to tell me something very definite he said It s not so long since this happened so you ll not have to tag your memory to any great extent In what form did Collishaw pay that fifty pounds to you That s easy answered sir said the secretary It was in gold Fifty sovereigns he had em in a bit of a bag Jettison reflected on this information for a moment or two Then he rose Much obliged to you mister Stebbing he said That s something worth knowing Now there s something else you can tell me as long as I m here though to be sure I could save you the trouble by using my own eyes How many banks are there in this little city of yours Three answered Stebbing promptly Old Bank in Monday Market Popham Hargreaves in the Square Wrychester Bank in Spurriergate That s the lot Much obliged said Jettison And for the present not a word of what we ve talked about You ll be hearing more later He went away memorizing the names of the three banking establishments ten minutes later he was in the private parlour of the first in serious conversation with its manager Here it was necessary to be more secret and to insist on more secrecy than with the secretary of the Second Friendly and to produce all his credentials and give all his reasons But Jettison drew that covert blank and the next too and it was not until he had been closeted for some time with the authorities of the third bank that he got the information he wanted And when he had got it he impressed secrecy and silence on his informants in a fashion which showed them that however easy going his manner might be he knew his business as thoroughly as they knew theirs It was by that time past one o clock and Jettison turned into the small hotel at which he had lodged himself He thought much and gravely while he ate his dinner he thought still more while he smoked his after dinner pipe And his face was still heavy with thought when at three o clock he walked into Mitchington s office and finding the inspector alone shut the door and drew a chair to Mitchington s desk Now then he said I ve had a rare morning s work and made a discovery and you and me my lad have got to have about as serious a bit of talk as we ve had since I came here Mitchington pushed his papers aside and showed his keen attention You remember what that young fellow told us last night about that man Collishaw paying in fifty pounds to the Second Friendly two days before his death said Jettison Well I thought over that business a lot early this morning and I fancied I saw how I could find something out about it So I have on the strict quiet That s why I went to the Friendly Society The fact was I wanted to know in what form Collishaw handed in that fifty pounds I got to know Gold Mitchington whose work hitherto had not led him into the mysteries of detective enterprise nodded delightedly Good he said Rare idea I should never have thought of it And what do you make out of that now Nothing replied Jettison But a good deal out of what I ve learned since that bit of a discovery Now put it to yourself whoever it was that paid Collishaw that fifty pounds in gold did it with a motive More than one motive to be exact but we ll stick to one to begin with The motive for paying in gold was avoidance of discovery A cheque can be readily traced So can banknotes But gold is not easily traced Therefore the man who paid Collishaw fifty pounds took care to provide himself with gold Now then how many men are there in a small place like this who are likely to carry fifty pounds in gold in their pockets or to have it at hand Not many agreed Mitchington Just so and therefore I ve been doing a bit of secret inquiry amongst the bankers as to who supplied himself with gold about that date continued Jettison I d to convince em of the absolute necessity of information too before I got any But I got some at the third attempt On the day previous to that on which Collishaw handed that fifty pounds to Stebbing a certain Wrychester man drew fifty pounds in gold at his bank Who do you think he was Who who demanded Mitchington Jettison leaned half across the desk Bryce he said in a whisper Bryce Mitchington sat up in his chair and opened his mouth in sheer astonishment Good heavens he muttered after a moment s silence You don t mean it Fact answered Jettison Plain incontestable fact my lad doctor Bryce keeps an account at the Wrychester bank On the day I m speaking of he cashed a cheque to self for fifty pounds and took it all in gold The two men looked at each other as if each were asking his companion a question Well said Mitchington at last You re a cut above me Jettison What do you make of it I said last night that the young man was playing a deep game replied Jettison But what game What s he building up For mark you Mitchington if I say if mind if that fifty pounds which he drew in gold is the identical fifty paid to Collishaw Bryce didn t pay it as hush money Think not said Mitchington evidently surprised Now that was my first impression If it wasn t hush money It wasn t hush money for this reason interrupted Jettison We know that whatever else he knew Bryce didn t know of the accident to Braden until Varner fetched him to Braden That s established on what you ve put before me Therefore whatever Collishaw saw before or at the time that accident happened it wasn t Bryce who was mixed up in it Therefore why should Bryce pay Collishaw hush money Mitchington who had evidently been thinking suddenly pulled out a drawer in his desk and took some papers from it which he began to turn over Wait a minute he said I ve an abstract here of what the foreman at the Cathedral mason s yard told me of what he knew as to where Collishaw was working that morning when the accident happened I made a note of it when I questioned him after Collishaw s death Here you are Foreman says that on morning of Braden s accident Collishaw was at work in the north gallery of the clerestory clearing away some timber which the carpenters had left there Collishaw was certainly thus engaged from nine o clock until past eleven that morning Mem Have investigated this myself From the exact spot where C was clearing the timber there is an uninterrupted view of the gallery on the south side of the nave and of the arched doorway at the head of saint Wrytha s Stair Well observed Jettison that proves what I m saying It wasn t hush money For whoever it was that Collishaw saw lay hands on Braden it wasn t Bryce Bryce we know was at that time coming across the Close or crossing that path through the part you call Paradise Varner s evidence proves that So if the fifty pounds wasn t paid for hush money what was it paid for Do you suggest anything asked Mitchington I ve thought of two or three things answered the detective One s this was the fifty pounds paid for information If so and Bryce has that information why doesn t he show his hand more plainly If he bribed Collishaw with fifty pounds to tell him who Braden s assailant was he now knows so why doesn t he let it out and have done with it Part of his game if that theory s right murmured Mitchington It mayn t be right said Jettison But it s one And there s another supposing he paid Collishaw that money on behalf of somebody else I ve thought this business out right and left top side and bottom side and hang me if I don t feel certain there is somebody else What did Ransford tell us about Bryce and this old Harker think of that And yet according to Bryce Harker is one of our old Yard men and therefore ought to be above suspicion Mitchington suddenly started as if an idea had occurred to him I say you know he exclaimed We ve only Bryce s word for it that Harker is an ex detective I never heard that he was if he is he s kept it strangely quiet You d have thought that he d have let us know here of his previous calling I never heard of a policeman of any rank who didn t like to have a bit of talk with his own sort about professional matters Nor me assented Jettison And as you say we ve only Bryce s word And the more I think of it the more I m convinced there s somebody some man of whom you don t seem to have the least idea who s in this And it may be that Bryce is in with him However here s one thing I m going to do at once Bryce gave us that information about the fifty pounds Now I m going to tell Bryce straight out that I ve gone into that matter in my own fashion a fashion he evidently never thought of and ask him to explain why he drew a similar amount in gold Come on round to his rooms But Bryce was not to be found at his rooms had not been back to his rooms said his landlady since he had ridden away early in the morning all she knew was that he had ordered his dinner to be ready at his usual time that evening With that the two men had to be content and they went back to the police station still discussing the situation And they were still discussing it an hour later when a telegram was handed to Mitchington who tore it open glanced over its contents and passed it to his companion who read it aloud Meet me with Jettison Wrychester Station on arrival of five twenty express from London mystery cleared up guilty men known Ransford Jettison handed the telegram back A man of his word he said He mentioned two days he s done it in one And now my lad do you notice he says men not man It s as I said there s been more than one of em in this affair Now then who are they CHAPTER XXI THE SAXONSTEADE ARMS Bryce had ridden away on his bicycle from Wrychester that morning intent on a new piece of diplomacy He had sat up thinking for some time after the two police officials had left him at midnight and it had occurred to him that there was a man from whom information could be had of whose services he had as yet made no use but who must be somewhere in the neighbourhood the man Glassdale Glassdale had been in Wrychester the previous evening he could scarcely be far away now there was certainly one person who would know where he could be found and that person was the Duke of Saxonsteade Bryce knew the Duke to be an extremely approachable man a talkative even a garrulous man given to holding converse with anybody about anything and he speedily made up his mind to ride over to Saxonsteade invent a plausible excuse for his call and get some news out of his Grace Even if Glassdale had left the neighbourhood there might be fragments of evidence to pick up from the Duke for Glassdale he knew had given his former employer the information about the stolen jewels and would no doubt have added more about his acquaintance with Braden And before Bryce came to his dreamed of master stroke in that matter there were one or two things he wanted to clear up to complete his double net and he had an idea that an hour s chat with Glassdale would yield all that he desired The active brain that had stood Bryce in good stead while he spun his meshes and devised his schemes was more active than ever that early summer morning It was a ten mile ride through woods and valleys to Saxonsteade and there were sights and beauties of nature on either side of him which any other man would have lingered to admire and most men would have been influenced by But Bryce had no eyes for the clouds over the copper crowned hills or the mystic shadows in the deep valleys or the new buds in the hedgerows and no thought for the rustic folk whose cottages he passed here and there in a sparsely populated country All his thoughts were fixed on his schemes almost as mechanically as his eyes followed the white road in front of his wheel Ever since he had set out on his campaign he had regularly taken stock of his position he was for ever reckoning it up And now in his opinion everything looked very promising He had so far as he was aware created a definite atmosphere of suspicion around and against Ransford it needed only a little more suggestion perhaps a little more evidence to bring about Ransford s arrest And the only question which at all troubled Bryce was should he let matters go to that length before putting his ultimatum before Mary Bewery or should he show her his hand first For Bryce had so worked matters that a word from him to the police would damn Ransford or save him and now it all depended so far as Bryce himself was concerned on Mary Bewery as to which word should be said Elaborate as the toils were which he had laid out for Ransford to the police he could sweep them up and tear them away with a sentence of added knowledge if Mary Bewery made it worth his while But first before coming to the critical point there was yet certain information which he desired to get and he felt sure of getting it if he could find Glassdale For Glassdale according to all accounts had known Braden intimately of late years and was most likely in possession of facts about him and Bryce had full confidence in himself as an interviewer of other men and a supreme belief that he could wheedle a secret out of anybody with whom he could procure an hour s quiet conversation As luck would have it Bryce had no need to make a call upon the approachable and friendly Duke Outside the little village at Saxonsteade on the edge of the deep woods which fringed the ducal park stood an old wayside inn a relic of the coaching days which bore on its sign the ducal arms Into its old stone hall marched Bryce to refresh himself after his ride and as he stood at the bow windowed bar he glanced into the garden beyond and there saw comfortably smoking his pipe and reading the newspaper the very man he was looking for Bryce had no spice of bashfulness no want of confidence anywhere in his nature he determined to attack Glassdale there and then But he took a good look at his man before going out into the garden to him A plain and ordinary sort of fellow he thought rather over middle age with a tinge of grey in his hair and moustache prosperous looking and well dressed and at that moment of the appearance of what he was probably taken for by the inn people a tourist Whether he was the sort who would be communicative or not Bryce could not tell from outward signs but he was going to try and he presently found his card case took out a card and strolling down the garden to the shady spot in which Glassdale sat assumed his politest and suavest manner and presented himself Allow me sir he said carefully abstaining from any mention of names May I have the pleasure of a few minutes conversation with you Glassdale cast a swift glance of surprise not unmingled with suspicion at the intruder the sort of glance that a man used to watchfulness would throw at anybody thought Bryce But his face cleared as he read the card though it was still doubtful as he lifted it again You ve the advantage of me sir he said doctor Bryce I see But Bryce smiled and dropped into a garden chair at Glassdale s side You needn t be afraid of talking to me he answered I m well known in Wrychester The Duke he went on nodding his head in the direction of the great house which lay behind the woods at the foot of the garden knows me well enough in fact I was on my way to see his Grace now to ask him if he could tell me where you could be found The fact is I m aware of what happened last night the jewel affair you know Mitchington told me and of your friendship with Braden and I want to ask you a question or two about Braden Glassdale who had looked somewhat mystified at the beginning of this address seemed to understand matters better by the end of it Oh well of course doctor he said if that s it but of course a word first these folk here at the inn don t know who I am or that I ve any connection with the Duke on that affair I m mister Gordon here just staying for a bit That s all right answered Bryce with a smile of understanding All this is between ourselves I saw you with the Duke and the rest of them last night and I recognized you just now And all I want is a bit of talk about Braden You knew him pretty well of late years Knew him for a good many years replied Glassdale He looked narrowly at his visitor I suppose you know his story and mine he asked Bygone affairs eh Yes yes answered Bryce reassuringly No need to go into that that s all done with Aye well we both put things right said Glassdale Made restitution both of us you understand So that is done with And you know then of course who Braden really was John Brake ex bank manager answered Bryce promptly I know all about it I ve been deeply interested and concerned in his death And I ll tell you why I want to marry his daughter Glassdale turned and stared at his companion His daughter he exclaimed Brake s daughter God bless my soul I never knew he had a daughter It was Bryce s turn to stare now He looked at Glassdale incredulously Do you mean to tell me that you knew Brake all those years and that he never mentioned his children he exclaimed Never a word of em replied Glassdale Never knew he had any Did he never speak of his past asked Bryce Not in that respect answered Glassdale I d no idea that he was or had been a married man He certainly never mentioned wife nor children to me sir and yet I knew Brake about as intimately as two men can know each other for some years before we came back to England Bryce fell into one of his fits of musing What could be the meaning of this extraordinary silence on Brake s part Was there still some hidden secret some other mystery at which he had not yet guessed Odd he remarked at last after a long pause during which Glassdale had watched him curiously But did he ever speak to you of an old friend of his named Ransford a doctor Never said Glassdale Never mentioned such a man Bryce reflected again and suddenly determined to be explicit John Brake the bank manager he said was married at a place called Braden Medworth in Leicestershire to a girl named Mary Bewery He had two children who would be respectively about four and one years of age when his we ll call it misfortune happened That s a fact First I ever heard of it then said Glassdale And that s a fact too He d also a very close friend named Ransford Mark Ransford continued Bryce This Ransford was best man at Brake s wedding Never heard him speak of Ransford nor of any wedding affirmed Glassdale All news to me doctor This Ransford is now in practice in Wrychester said Bryce And he has two young people living with him as his wards a girl of twenty a boy of seventeen who are without doubt John Brake s children It is the daughter that I want to marry Glassdale shook his head as if in sheer perplexity Well all I can say is you surprise me he remarked I d no idea of any such thing Do you think Brake came to Wrychester because of that asked Bryce How can I answer that sir when I tell you that I never heard him breathe one word of any children exclaimed Glassdale No I know his reason for coming to Wrychester It was wholly and solely as far as I know to tell the Duke here about that jewel business the secret of which had been entrusted to Brake and me by a man on his death bed in Australia Brake came to Wrychester by himself I was to join him next morning we were then to go to see the Duke together When I got to Wrychester I heard of Brake s accident and being upset by it I went away again and waited some days until yesterday when I made up my mind to tell the Duke myself as I did with very fortunate results No that s the only reason I know of why Brake came this way I tell you I knew nothing at all of his family affairs He was a very close man Brake and apart from his business matters he d only one idea in his head and that was lodged there pretty firmly I can assure you What was it asked Bryce He wanted to find a certain man or rather two men who d cruelly deceived and wronged him but one of em in particular answered Glassdale The particular one he believed to be in Australia until near the end when he got an idea that he d left for England as for the other he didn t bother much about him But the man that he did want ah he wanted him badly Who was that man asked Bryce A man of the name of Falkiner Wraye answered Glassdale promptly A man he d known in London This Wraye together with his partner a man called Flood tricked Brake into lending em several thousands pounds bank s money of course for a couple of days no more and then clean disappeared leaving him to pay the piper He was a fool no doubt but he d been mixed up with them he d done it before and they d always kept their promises and he did it once too often He let em have some thousands they disappeared and the bank inspector happened to call at Brake s bank and ask for his balances And there he was And that s why he d Falkiner Wraye on his mind as his one big idea T other man was a lesser consideration Wraye was the chief offender I wish you d tell me all you know about Brake said Bryce after a pause during which he had done some thinking Between ourselves of course Oh I don t know that there s so much secrecy replied Glassdale almost indifferently Of course I knew him first when we were both inmates of you understand where no need for particulars But after we left that place I never saw him again until we met in Australia a few years ago We were both in the same trade speculating in wool We got pretty thick and used to see each other a great deal and of course grew confidential He told me in time about his affair and how he d traced this Wraye to the United States and then I think to New Zealand and afterwards to Australia and as I was knocking about the country a great deal buying up wool he asked me to help him and gave me a description of Wraye of whom he said he d certainly heard something when he first landed at Sydney but had never been able to trace afterwards But it was no good I never either saw or heard of Wraye and Brake came to the conclusion he d left Australia And I know he hoped to get news of him somehow when we returned to England That description now what was it asked Bryce Oh said Glassdale I can t remember it all now big man clean shaven nothing very particular except one thing Wraye according to Brake had a bad scar on his left jaw and had lost the middle finger of his left hand all from a gun accident He what s the matter sir Bryce had suddenly let his pipe fall from his lips He took some time in picking it up When he raised himself again his face was calm if a little flushed from stooping Bit my pipe on a bad tooth he muttered I must have that tooth seen to So you never heard or saw anything of this man Never answered Glassdale But I ve wondered since this Wrychester affair if Brake accidentally came across one or other of those men and if his death arose out of it Now look here doctor I read the accounts of the inquest on Brake I d have gone to it if I d dared but just then I hadn t made up my mind about seeing the Duke I didn t know what to do so I kept away and there s a thing has struck me that I don t believe the police have ever taken the slightest notice of What s that demanded Bryce Why this answered Glassdale That man who called himself Dellingham who came with Brake to the Mitre Hotel at Wrychester who is he Where did Brake meet him Where did he go Seems to me the police have been strangely negligent about that According to the accounts I ve read everybody just accepted this Dellingham s first statement took his word and let him vanish No one as far as I know ever verified his account of himself A stranger Bryce who was already in one of his deep moods of reflection got up from his chair as if to go Yes he said There maybe something in your suggestion They certainly did take his word without inquiry It s true he mightn t be what he said he was Aye and from what I read they never followed his movements that morning observed Glassdale Queer business altogether Isn t there some reward offered doctor I heard of some placards or something but I ve never seen them of course I ve only been here since yesterday morning Bryce silently drew some papers from his pocket From them he extracted the two handbills which Mitchington had given him and handed them over Well I must go he said I shall no doubt see you again in Wrychester over this affair For the present all this is between ourselves of course Oh of course doctor answered Glassdale Quite so Bryce went off and got his bicycle and rode away in the direction of Wrychester Had he remained in that garden he would have seen Glassdale after reading both the handbills go into the house and have heard him ask the landlady at the bar to get him a trap and a good horse in it as soon as possible he too now wanted to go to Wrychester and at once But Bryce was riding down the road muttering certain words to himself over and over again The left jaw and the left hand he repeated Left hand left jaw Unmistakable CHAPTER XXII OTHER PEOPLE S NOTIONS The great towers of Wrychester Cathedral had come within Bryce s view before he had made up his mind as to the next step in this last stage of his campaign He had ridden away from the Saxonsteade Arms feeling that he had got to do something at once but he was not quite clear in his mind as to what that something exactly was But now as he topped a rise in the road and saw Wrychester lying in its hollow beneath him the summer sun shining on its red roofs and grey walls he suddenly came to a decision and instead of riding straight ahead into the old city he turned off at a by road made a line across the northern outskirts and headed for the golf links He was almost certain to find Mary Bewery there at that hour and he wanted to see her at once The time for his great stroke had come But Mary Bewery was not there had not been there that morning said the caddy master There were only a few players out In one of them coming towards the club house Bryce recognized Sackville Bonham And at sight of Sackville Bryce had an inspiration Mary Bewery would not come up to the links now before afternoon he Bryce would lunch there and then go towards Wrychester to meet her by the path across the fields on which he had waylaid her after his visit to Leicestershire And meanwhile he would inveigle Sackville Bonham into conversation Sackville fell readily into Bryce s trap He was the sort of youth who loves to talk especially in a hinting and mysterious fashion And when Bryce after treating him to an appetizer in the bar of the club house had suggested that they should lunch together and got him into a quiet corner of the dining room he launched forth at once on the pertinent matter of the day Heard all about this discovery of those missing Saxonsteade diamonds he asked as he and Bryce picked up their knives and forks Queer business that isn t it Of course it s got to do with those murders Think so asked Bryce Can anybody think anything else said Sackville in his best dogmatic manner Why the thing s plain From what s been let out not much certainly but enough it s quite evident What s your theory inquired Bryce My stepfather knowing old bird he is too sums the whole thing up to a nicety answered Sackville That old chap Braden you know is in possession of that secret He comes to Wrychester about it But somebody else knows That somebody gets rid of Braden Why So that the secret ll be known then only to one the murderer See And why Why Well why repeated Bryce Don t see so far You must be dense then said Sackville with the lofty superiority of youth Because of the reward of course Don t you know that there s been a standing offer never withdrawn of five thousand pounds for news of those jewels No I didn t answered Bryce Fact sir pure fact continued Sackville Now five thousand divided in two is two thousand five hundred each But five thousand undivided is what Five thousand apparently said Bryce Just so And remarked Sackville knowingly a man ll do a lot for five thousand Or according to your argument for half of it said Bryce What you or your stepfather s aiming at comes to this that suspicion rests on Braden s sharer in the secret That it And why not asked Sackville Look at what we know from the account in the paper this morning This other chap Glassdale waits a bit until the first excitement about Braden is over then he comes forward and tells the Duke where the Duchess s diamonds are planted Why So that he can get the five thousand pound reward Plain as a pikestaff Only the police are such fools And what about Collishaw asked Bryce willing to absorb all his companion s ideas Part of the game declared Sackville Same man that got rid of Braden got rid of that chap Probably Collishaw knew a bit and had to be silenced But whether that Glassdale did it all off his own bat or whether he s somebody in with him that s where the guilt ll be fastened in the end my stepfather says And it ll be so Stands to reason Anybody come forward about that reward your stepfather offered asked Bryce I m not permitted to say answered Sackville But he added leaning closer to his companion across the table I can tell you this there s wheels within wheels You understand And things ll be coming out Got to We can t as a family let Ransford lie under that cloud don t you know We must clear him That s precisely why mister Folliot offered his reward Ransford of course you know Bryce is very much to blame he ought to have done more himself And of course as my mother and my stepfather say if Ransford won t do things for himself well we must do em for him We couldn t think of anything else Very good of you all I m sure assented Bryce Very thoughtful and kindly Oh well said Sackville who was incapable of perceiving a sneer or of knowing when older men were laughing at him It s one of those things that one s got to do under the circumstances Of course Miss Bewery isn t doctor Ransford s daughter but she s his ward and we can t allow suspicion to rest on her guardian You leave it to me my boy and you ll see how things will be cleared Doing a bit underground eh asked Bryce Wait a bit answered Sackville with a knowing wink It s the least expected that happens what Bryce replied that Sackville was no doubt right and began to talk of other matters He hung about the club house until past three o clock and then being well acquainted with Mary Bewery s movements from long observation of them set out to walk down towards Wrychester leaving his bicycle behind him If he did not meet Mary on the way he meant to go to the house Ransford would be out on his afternoon round of calls Dick Bewery would be at school he would find Mary alone And it was necessary that he should see her alone and at once for since morning an entirely new view of affairs had come to him based on added knowledge and he now saw a chance which he had never seen before True he said to himself as he walked across the links and over the country which lay between their edge and Wrychester he had not even now the accurate knowledge as to the actual murderer of either Braden or Collishaw that he would have liked but he knew something that would enable him to ask Mary Bewery point blank whether he was to be friend or enemy And he was still considering the best way of putting his case to her when having failed to meet her on the way he at last turned into the Close and as he approached Ransford s house saw missus Folliot leaving it Mary Bewery like Bryce had been having a day of events To begin with Ransford had received a wire from London first thing in the morning which had made him run breakfastless to catch the next express He had left Mary to make arrangements about his day s work for he had not yet replaced Bryce and she had been obliged to seek out another practitioner who could find time from his own duties to attend to Ransford s urgent patients Then she had had to see callers who came to the surgery expecting to find Ransford there and in the middle of a busy morning mister Folliot had dropped in to bring her a bunch of roses and once admitted had shown unmistakable signs of a desire to gossip Ransford out he asked as he sat down in the dining room Suppose he is this time of day He s away replied Mary He went to town by the first express and I have had a lot of bother arranging about his patients Did he hear about this discovery of the Saxonsteade jewels before he went asked Folliot Suppose he wouldn t though wasn t known until the weekly paper came out this morning Queer business You ve heard of course doctor Short told me answered Mary I don t know any details Folliot looked meditatively at her a moment Got something to do with those other matters you know he remarked I say What s Ransford doing about all that About all what mister Folliot asked Mary at once on her guard I don t understand you You know all that suspicion and so on said Folliot Bad position for a professional man you know ought to clear himself Anybody been applying for that reward Ransford offered I don t know anything about it replied Mary doctor Ransford is very well able to take care of himself I think Has anybody applied for yours Folliot rose from his chair again as if he had changed his mind about lingering and shook his head Can t say what my solicitors may or may not have heard or done he answered But queer business you know and ought to be settled Bad for Ransford to have any sort of a cloud over him Sorry to see it Is that why you came forward with a reward asked Mary But to this direct question Folliot made no answer He muttered something about the advisability of somebody doing something and went away to Mary s relief She had no desire to discuss the Paradise mysteries with anybody especially after Ransford s assurance of the previous evening But in the middle of the afternoon in walked missus Folliot a rare caller and before she had been closeted with Mary five minutes brought up the subject again I want to speak to you on a very serious matter my dear Miss Bewery she said You must allow me to speak plainly on account of of several things My my superiority in in age you know and all that What s the matter missus Folliot asked Mary steeling herself against what she felt sure was coming Is it very serious And pardon me is it about what mister Folliot mentioned to me this morning Because if it is I m not going to discuss that with you or with anybody I had no idea that my husband had been here this morning answered missus Folliot in genuine surprise What did he want to talk about In that case what do you want to talk about asked Mary Though that doesn t mean that I m going to talk about it with you missus Folliot made an effort to understand this remark and after inspecting her hostess critically for a moment proceeded in her most judicial manner You must see my dear Miss Bewery that it is highly necessary that some one should use the utmost persuasion on doctor Ransford she said He is placing all of you himself yourself your young brother in most invidious positions by his silence In society such as well such as you get in a cathedral town you know no man of reputation can afford to keep silence when his his character is affected Mary picked up some needlework and began to be much occupied with it Is doctor Ransford s character affected she asked I wasn t aware of it missus Folliot Oh my dear you can t be quite so very so very shall we say ingenuous as all that exclaimed missus Folliot These rumours of course they are very wicked and cruel ones but you know they have spread Dear me why they have been common talk I don t think my guardian cares twopence for common talk missus Folliot answered Mary And I am quite sure I don t None of us especially people in our position can afford to ignore rumours and common talk said missus Folliot in her loftiest manner If we are unfortunately talked about then it is our solemn bounden duty to put ourselves right in the eyes of our friends and of society If I for instance my dear heard anything affecting my let me say moral character I should take steps the most stringent drastic and forceful steps to put matters to the test I would not remain under a stigma no not for one minute I hope you will never have occasion to rehabilitate your moral character missus Folliot remarked Mary bending closely over her work Such a necessity would indeed be dreadful And yet you do not insist yes insist on doctor Ransford s taking strong steps to clear himself exclaimed missus Folliot Now that indeed is a dreadful necessity doctor Ransford answered Mary is quite able to defend and to take care of himself It is not for me to tell him what to do or even to advise him what to do And since you will talk of this matter I tell you frankly missus Folliot that I don t believe any decent person in Wrychester has the least suspicion or doubt of doctor Ransford His denial of any share or complicity in those sad affairs the mere idea of it as ridiculous as it s wicked was quite sufficient You know very well that at that second inquest he said on oath too that he knew nothing of these affairs I repeat there isn t a decent soul in the city doubts that Oh but you re quite wrong said missus Folliot hurriedly Quite wrong I assure you my dear Of course everybody knows what doctor Ransford said very excitedly poor man I m given to understand on the occasion you refer to but then what else could he have said in his own interest What people want is the proof of his innocence I could but I won t tell you of many of the very best people who are well very much exercised over the matter I could indeed Do you count yourself among them asked Mary in a cold fashion which would have been a warning to any one but her visitor Am I to understand that missus Folliot Certainly not my dear answered missus Folliot promptly Otherwise I should not have done what I have done towards establishing the foolish man s innocence Mary dropped her work and turned a pair of astonished eyes on missus Folliot s large countenance You she exclaimed To establish doctor Ransford s innocence Why missus Folliot what have you done missus Folliot toyed a little with the jewelled head of her sunshade Her expression became almost coy Oh well she answered after a brief spell of indecision Perhaps it is as well that you should know Miss Bewery Of course when all this sad trouble was made far worse by that second affair the working man s death you know I said to my husband that really one must do something seeing that doctor Ransford was so very very obdurate and wouldn t speak And as money is nothing at least as things go to me or to mister Folliot I insisted that he should offer a thousand pounds reward to have the thing cleared up He s a generous and open handed man and he agreed with me entirely and put the thing in hand through his solicitors And nothing would please us more my dear than to have that thousand pounds claimed For of course if there is to be as I suppose there is a union between our families it would be utterly impossible that any cloud could rest on doctor Ransford even if he is only your guardian My son s future wife cannot of course Mary laid down her work again and for a full minute stared missus Folliot in the face missus Folliot she said at last Are you under the impression that I m thinking of marrying your son I think I ve every good reason for believing it replied missus Folliot You ve none retorted Mary gathering up her work and moving towards the door I ve no more intention of marrying mister Sackville Bonham than of eloping with the Bishop The idea s too absurd to even be thought of Five minutes later missus Folliot heightened in colour had gone And presently Mary glancing after her across the Close saw Bryce approaching the gate of the garden CHAPTER XXIII THE UNEXPECTED Mary s first instinct on seeing the approach of Pemberton Bryce the one man she least desired to see was to retreat to the back of the house and send the parlourmaid to the door to say her mistress was not at home But she had lately become aware of Bryce s curiously dogged persistence in following up whatever he had in view and she reflected that if he were sent away then he would be sure to come back and come back until he had got whatever it was that he wanted And after a moment s further consideration she walked out of the front door and confronted him resolutely in the garden doctor Ransford is away she said with almost unnecessary brusqueness He s away until evening I don t want him replied Bryce just as brusquely I came to see you Mary hesitated She continued to regard Bryce steadily and Bryce did not like the way in which she was looking at him He made haste to speak before she could either leave or dismiss him You d better give me a few minutes he said with a note of warning I m here in your interests or in Ransford s I may as well tell you straight out Ransford s in serious and imminent danger That s a fact Danger of what she demanded Arrest instant arrest replied Bryce I m telling you the truth He ll probably be arrested tonight on his return There s no imagination in all this I m speaking of what I know I ve curiously enough got mixed up with these affairs through no seeking of my own and I know what s behind the scenes If it were known that I m letting out secrets to you I should get into trouble But I want to warn you Mary stood before him on the path hesitating She knew enough to know that Bryce was telling some sort of truth it was plain that he had been mixed up in the recent mysteries and there was a ring of conviction in his voice which impressed her And suddenly she had visions of Ransford s arrest of his being dragged off to prison to meet a cruel accusation of the shame and disgrace and she hesitated further But if that s so she said at last what s the good of coming to me I can t do anything I can said Bryce significantly I know more much more than the police know more than anybody knows I can save Ransford Understand that What do you want now she asked To talk to you to tell you how things are answered Bryce What harm is there in that To make you see how matters stand and then to show you what I can do to put things right Mary glanced at an open summer house which stood beneath the beech trees on one side of the garden She moved towards it and sat down there and Bryce followed her and seated himself Well she said Bryce realized that his moment had arrived He paused endeavouring to remember the careful preparations he had made for putting his case Somehow he was not so clear as to his line of attack as he had been ten minutes previously he realized that he had to deal with a young woman who was not likely to be taken in nor easily deceived And suddenly he plunged into what he felt to be the thick of things Whether you or whether Ransford whether both or either of you know it or not he said the police have been on to Ransford ever since that Collishaw affair Underground work you know Mitchington has been digging into things ever since then and lately he s had a London detective helping him Mary who had carried her work into the garden had now resumed it and as Bryce began to talk she bent over it steadily stitching Well she said Look here continued Bryce Has it never struck you it must have done that there s considerable mystery about Ransford But whether it has struck you or not it s there and it s struck the police forcibly Mystery connected with him before long before he ever came here And associated in some way with that man Braden Not of late in years past And naturally the police have tried to find out what that was What have they found out asked Mary quietly That I m not at liberty to tell replied Bryce But I can tell you this they know Mitchington and the London man that there were passages between Ransford and Braden years ago How many years ago interrupted Mary Bryce hesitated a moment He had a suspicion that this self possessed young woman who was taking everything more quietly than he had anticipated might possibly know more than he gave her credit for knowing He had been watching her fingers since they sat down in the summer house and his sharp eyes saw that they were as steady as the spire of the cathedral above the trees he knew from that that she was neither frightened nor anxious Oh well seventeen to twenty years ago he answered About that time There were passages I say and they were of a nature which suggests that the re appearance of Braden on Ransford s present stage of life would be extremely unpleasant and unwelcome to Ransford Vague murmured Mary Extremely vague But quite enough retorted Bryce to give the police the suggestion of motive I tell you the police know quite enough to know that Braden was of all men in the world the last man Ransford desired to see cross his path again And on that morning on which the Paradise affair occurred Braden did cross his path Therefore in the conventional police way of thinking and looking at things there s motive Motive for what asked Mary Bryce arrived here at one of his critical stages and he paused a moment in order to choose his words Don t get any false ideas or impressions he said at last I m not accusing Ransford of anything I m only telling you what I know the police think and are on the very edge of accusing him of To put it plainly of murder They say he d a motive for murdering Braden and with them motive is everything It s the first thing they seem to think of they first question they ask themselves Why should this man have murdered that man do you see What motive had he that s the point And they think these chaps like Mitchington and the London man that Ransford certainly had a motive for getting rid of Braden when they met What was the motive asked Mary They ve found out something perhaps a good deal about what happened between Braden and Ransford some years ago replied Bryce And their theory is if you want to know the truth that Ransford ran away with Braden s wife and that Braden had been looking for him ever since Bryce had kept his eyes on Mary s hands and now at last he saw the girl s fingers tremble But her voice was steady enough when she spoke Is that mere conjecture on their part or is it based on any fact she asked I m not in full knowledge of all their secrets answered Bryce but I ve heard enough to know that there s a basis of undeniable fact on which they re going I know for instance beyond doubt that Braden and Ransford were bosom friends years ago that Braden was married to a girl whom Ransford had wanted to marry that Braden s wife suddenly left him mysteriously a few years later and that at the same time Ransford made an equally mysterious disappearance The police know all that What is the inference to be drawn What inference would any one you yourself for example draw None till I ve heard what doctor Ransford had to say replied Mary Bryce disliked that ready retort He was beginning to feel that he was being met by some force stronger than his own That s all very well he remarked I don t say that I wouldn t do the same But I m only explaining the police position and showing you the danger likely to arise from it The police theory is this as far as I can make it out Ransford years ago did Braden a wrong and Braden certainly swore revenge when he could find him Circumstances prevented Braden from seeking him closely for some time at last they met here by accident Here the police aren t decided One theory is that there was an altercation blows a struggle in the course of which Braden met his death the other is that Ransford deliberately took Braden up into the gallery and flung him through that open doorway That observed Mary with something very like a sneer seems so likely that I should think it would never occur to anybody but the sort of people you re telling me of No man of any real sense would believe it for a minute Some people of plain common sense do believe it for all that retorted Bryce For it s quite possible But as I say I m only repeating And of course the rest of it follows on that The police theory is that Collishaw witnessed Braden s death at Ransford s hands that Ransford got to know that Collishaw knew of that and that he therefore quietly removed Collishaw And it is on all that that they re going and will go Don t ask me if I think they re right or wrong I m only telling you what I know so as to show you what danger Ransford is in Mary made no immediate answer and Bryce sat watching her Somehow he was at a loss to explain it to himself things were not going as he had expected He had confidently believed that the girl would be frightened scared upset ready to do anything that he asked or suggested But she was plainly not frightened And the fingers which busied themselves with the fancy work had become steady again and her voice had been steady all along Pray she asked suddenly and with a little satirical inflection of voice which Brice was quick to notice pray how is it that you not a policeman not a detective come to know so much of all this Since when were you taken into the confidence of Mitchington and the mysterious person from London You know as well as I do that I have been dragged into the case against my wishes answered Bryce almost sullenly I was fetched to Braden I saw him die It was I who found Collishaw dead Of course I ve been mixed up whether I would or not and I ve had to see a good deal of the police and naturally I ve learnt things Mary suddenly turned on him with a flash of the eye which might have warned Bryce that he had signally failed in the main feature of his adventure And what have you learnt that makes you come here and tell me all this she exclaimed Do you think I m a simpleton doctor Bryce You set out by saying that doctor Ransford is in danger from the police and that you know more much more than the police what does that mean Shall I tell you It means that you you know that the police are wrong and that if you like you can prove to them that they are wrong Now then isn t that so I am in possession of certain facts began Bryce I Mary stopped him with a look My turn she said You re in possession of certain facts Now isn t it the truth that the facts you are in possession of are proof enough to you that doctor Ransford is as innocent as I am It s no use your trying to deceive me Isn t that so I could certainly turn the police off his track admitted Bryce who was growing highly uncomfortable I could divert Mary gave him another look and dropping her needlework continued to watch him steadily Do you call yourself a gentleman she asked quietly Or we ll leave the term out Do you call yourself even decently honest For if you do how can you have the sheer impudence more insolence to come here and tell me all this when you know that the police are wrong and that you could to use your own term which is your way of putting it turn them off the wrong track Whatever sort of man are you Do you want to know my opinion of you in plain words You seem very anxious to give it anyway retorted Bryce I will give it and it will perhaps put an end to this answered Mary If you are in possession of anything in the way of evidence which would prove doctor Ransford s innocence and you are wilfully suppressing it you are bad wicked base cruel unfit for any decent being s society And she added as she picked up her work and rose you re not going to have any more of mine A moment said Bryce He was conscious that he had somehow played all his cards badly and he wanted another opening You re misunderstanding me altogether I never said never inferred that I wouldn t save Ransford Then if there s need which I don t admit you acknowledge that you could save him she exclaimed sharply Just as I thought Then if you re an honest man a man with any pretensions to honour why don t you at once Any man who had such feelings as those I ve just mentioned wouldn t hesitate one second But you you you come and talk about it As if it were a game doctor Bryce you make me feel sick mentally morally sick Bryce had risen to his feet when Mary rose and he now stood staring at her Ever since his boyhood he had laughed and sneered at the mere idea of the finer feelings he believed that every man has his price and that honesty and honour are things useful as terms but of no real existence And now he was wondering really wondering if this girl meant the things she said if she really felt a mental loathing of such minds and purposes as he knew his own were or if it were merely acting on her part Before he could speak she turned on him again more fiercely than before Shall I tell you something else in plain language she asked You evidently possess a very small and limited knowledge if you have any at all of women and you apparently don t rate their mental qualities at any high standard Let me tell you that I am not quite such a fool as you seem to think me You came here this afternoon to bargain with me You happen to know how much I respect my guardian and what I owe him for the care he has taken of me and my brother You thought to trade on that You thought you could make a bargain with me you were to save doctor Ransford and for reward you were to have me You daren t deny it doctor Bryce I can see through you I never said it at any rate answered Bryce Once more I say I m not a fool exclaimed Mary I saw through you all along And you ve failed I m not in the least frightened by what you ve said If the police arrest doctor Ransford doctor Ransford knows how to defend himself And you re not afraid for him You know you aren t It wouldn t matter twopence to you if he were hanged tomorrow for you hate him But look to yourself Men who cheat and scheme and plot and plan as you do come to bad ends Mind yours Mind the wheel doesn t come full circle And now if you please go away and don t dare to come near me again Bryce made no answer He had listened with an attempt at a smile to all this fiery indignation but as Mary spoke the last words he was suddenly aware of something that drew his attention from her and them Through an opening in Ransford s garden hedge he could see the garden door of the Folliots house across the Close And at that moment out of it emerge Folliot himself in conversation with Glassdale Without a word Bryce snatched up his hat from the table of the summer house and went swiftly away a new scheme a new idea in his mind CHAPTER XXIV FINESSE Glassdale journeying into Wrychester half an hour after Bryce had left him at the Saxonsteade Arms occupied himself during his ride across country in considering the merits of the two handbills which Bryce had given him One announced an offer of five hundred pounds reward for information in the Braden Collishaw matter the other of a thousand pounds It struck him as a curious thing that two offers should be made it suggested at once that more than one person was deeply interested in this affair But who were they no answer to that question appeared on the handbills which were in each case signed by Wrychester solicitors To one of these Glassdale on arriving in the old city promptly proceeded selecting the offerer of the larger reward He presently found himself in the presence of an astute looking man who having had his visitor s name sent in to him regarded Glassdale with very obvious curiosity mister Glassdale he said inquiringly as the caller took an offered chair Are you by any chance the mister Glassdale whose name is mentioned in connection with last night s remarkable affair He pointed to a copy of the weekly newspaper lying on his desk and to a formal account of the discovery of the Saxonsteade jewels which had been furnished to the press at the Duke s request by Mitchington Glassdale glanced at it unconcernedly The same he answered But I didn t call here on that matter though what I did call about is certainly relative to it You ve offered a reward for any information that would lead to the solution of that mystery about Braden and the other man Collishaw Of a thousand pounds yes replied the solicitor looking at his visitor with still more curiosity mingled with expectancy Can you give any Glassdale pulled out the two handbills which he had obtained from Bryce There are two rewards offered he remarked Are they entirely independent of each other We know nothing of the other answered the solicitor Except of course that it exists They re quite independent Who s offering the five hundred pound one asked Glassdale The solicitor paused looking his man over He saw at once that Glassdale had or believed he had something to tell and was disposed to be unusually cautious about telling it Well he replied after a pause I believe in fact it s an open secret that the offer of five hundred pounds is made by doctor Ransford And yours inquired Glassdale Who s at the back of yours a thousand The solicitor smiled You haven t answered my question mister Glassdale he observed Can you give any information Glassdale threw his questioner a significant glance Whatever information I might give he said I d only give to a principal the principal From what I ve seen and known of all this there s more in it than is on the surface I can tell something I knew John Braden who of course was John Brake very well for some years Naturally I was in his confidence About more than the Saxonsteade jewels you mean asked the solicitor About more than that assented Glassdale Private matters I ve no doubt I can throw some light some on this Wrychester Paradise affair But as I said just now I ll only deal with the principal I wouldn t tell you for instance as your principal s solicitor The solicitor smiled again Your ideas mister Glassdale appear to fit in with our principal s he remarked His instructions strict instructions to us are that if anybody turns up who can give any information it s not to be given to us but to himself Wise man observed Glassdale That s just what I feel about it It s a mistake to share secrets with more than one person There is a secret then asked the solicitor half slyly Might be replied Glassdale Who s your client The solicitor pulled a scrap of paper towards him and wrote a few words on it He pushed it towards his caller and Glassdale picked it up and read what had been written mister Stephen Folliot The Close You d better go and see him said the solicitor suggestively You ll find him reserved enough Glassdale read and re read the name as if he were endeavouring to recollect it or connect it with something What particular reason has this man for wishing to find this out he inquired Can t say my good sir replied the solicitor with a smile Perhaps he ll tell you He hasn t told me Glassdale rose to take his leave But with his hand on the door he turned Is this gentleman a resident in the place he asked A well known townsman replied the solicitor You ll easily find his house in the Close everybody knows it Glassdale went away then and walked slowly towards the Cathedral precincts On his way he passed two places at which he was half inclined to call one was the police station the other the office of the solicitors who were acting on behalf of the offerer of five hundred pounds He half glanced at the solicitor s door but on reflection went forward A man who was walking across the Close pointed out the Folliot residence Glassdale entered by the garden door and in another minute came face to face with Folliot himself busied as usual amongst his rose trees Glassdale saw Folliot and took stock of him before Folliot knew that a stranger was within his gates Folliot in an old jacket which he kept for his horticultural labours was taking slips from a standard he looked as harmless and peaceful as his occupation A quiet inoffensive somewhat benevolent elderly man engaged in work which suggested leisure and peace But Glassdale after a first quick searching glance took another and longer one and went nearer with a discreet laugh Folliot turned quietly and seeing the stranger showed no surprise He had a habit of looking over the top rims of his spectacles at people and he looked in this way at Glassdale glancing him up and down calmly Glassdale lifted his slouch hat and advanced mister Folliot I believe sir he said mister Stephen Folliot Aye just so responded Folliot But I don t know you Who may you be now My name sir is Glassdale answered the other I ve just come from your solicitor s I called to see him this afternoon and he told me that the business I called about could only be dealt with or discussed with you So I came here Folliot who had been cutting slips off a rose tree closed his knife and put it away in his old jacket He turned and quietly inspected his visitor once more Aye he said quietly So you re after that thousand pound reward eh I should have no objection to it mister Folliot replied Glassdale I dare say not remarked Folliot dryly I dare say not And which are you now one of those who think they can tell something or one that really can tell Eh You ll know that better when we ve had a bit of talk mister Folliot answered Glassdale accompanying his reply with a direct glance Oh well now then I ve no objection to a bit of talk none whatever said Folliot Here we ll sit down on that bench amongst the roses Quite private here nobody about And now he continued as Glassdale accompanied him to a rustic bench set beneath a pergola of rambler roses who are you like I read a queer account in this morning s local paper of what happened in the Cathedral grounds yonder last night and there was a person of your name mentioned Are you that Glassdale The same mister Folliot answered the visitor promptly Then you knew Braden the man who lost his life here asked Folliot Very well indeed replied Glassdale For how long demanded Folliot Some years as a mere acquaintance seen now and then said Glassdale A few years recently as what you might call a close friend Tell you any of his secrets asked Folliot Yes he did answered Glassdale Anything that seems to relate to his death and the mystery about it inquired Folliot I think so said Glassdale Upon consideration I think so Ah and what might it be now continued Folliot He gave Glassdale a look which seemed to denote and imply several things It might be to your advantage to explain a bit you know he added One has to be a little vague eh There was a certain man that Braden was very anxious to find said Glassdale He d been looking for him for a good many years A man asked Folliot One Well as a matter of fact there were two admitted Glassdale but there was one in particular The other the second so Braden said didn t matter he was or had been only a sort of cat s paw of the man he especially wanted I see said Folliot He pulled out a cigar case and offered a cigar to his visitor afterwards lighting one himself And what did Braden want that man for he asked Glassdale waited until his cigar was in full going order before he answered this question Then he replied in one word Revenge Folliot put his thumbs in the armholes of his buff waistcoat and leaning back seemed to be admiring his roses Ah he said at last Revenge now A sort of vindictive man was he Wanted to get his knife into somebody eh He wanted to get something of his own back from a man who d done him answered Glassdale with a short laugh That s about it For a minute or two both men smoked in silence Then Folliot still regarding his roses put a leading question Give you any details he asked Enough said Glassdale Braden had been done over a money transaction by these men one especially as head and front of the affair and it had cost him more than anybody would think Naturally he wanted if he ever got the chance his revenge Who wouldn t And he d tracked em down eh asked Folliot There are questions I can answer and there are questions I can t answer responded Glassdale That s one of the questions I ve no reply to For I don t know But I can say this He hadn t tracked em down the day before he came to Wrychester You re sure of that asked Folliot He didn t come here on that account No I m sure he didn t answered Glassdale readily If he had I should have known I was with him till noon the day he came here in London and when he took his ticket at Victoria for Wrychester he d no more idea than the man in the moon as to where those men had got to He mentioned it as we were having a bit of lunch together before he got into the train No he didn t come to Wrychester for any such purpose as that But He paused and gave Folliot a meaning glance out of the corner of his eyes Aye what asked Folliot I think he met at least one of em here said Glassdale quietly And perhaps both Leading to misfortune for him suggested Folliot If you like to put it that way yes assented Glassdale Folliot smoked a while in more reflective silence Aye well he said at last I suppose you haven t put these ideas of yours before anybody now Present ideas asked Glassdale sharply Not to a soul I ve not had em very long You re the sort of man that another man can do a deal with I suppose suggested Folliot That is if it s made worth your while of course I shouldn t wonder replied Glassdale And if it is made worth my while Folliot mused a little Then he tapped Glassdale s elbow You see he said confidentially it might be you know that I had a little purpose of my own in offering that reward It might be that it was a very particular friend of mine that had the misfortune to have incurred this man Braden s hatred And I might want to save him d ye see from well from the consequence of what s happened and to hear about it first if anybody came forward eh As I ve done said Glassdale As you ve done assented Folliot Now perhaps it would be in the interest of this particular friend of mine if he made it worth your while to say no more to anybody eh Very much worth his while mister Folliot declared Glassdale Aye well continued Folliot This very particular friend would just want to know you know how much you really truly know Now for instance about these two men and one in particular that Braden was after Did did he name em Glassdale leaned a little nearer to his companion on the rose screened bench He named them to me he said in a whisper One was a man called Falkiner Wraye and the other man was a man named Flood Is that enough I think you d better come and see me this evening answered Folliot Come just about dusk to that door I ll meet you there Fine roses these of mine aren t they he continued as they rose I occupy myself entirely with em He walked with Glassdale to the garden door and stood there watching his visitor go away up the side of the high wall until he turned into the path across Paradise And then as Folliot was retreating to his roses he saw Bryce coming over the Close and Bryce beckoned to him CHAPTER XXV THE OLD WELL HOUSE When Bryce came hurrying up to him Folliot was standing at his garden door with his hands thrust under his coat tails the very picture of a benevolent leisured gentleman who has nothing to do and is disposed to give his time to anybody He glanced at Bryce as he had glanced at Glassdale over the tops of his spectacles and the glance had no more than mild inquiry in it But if Bryce had been less excited he would have seen that Folliot as he beckoned him inside the garden swept a sharp look over the Close and ascertained that there was no one about that Bryce s entrance was unobserved Save for a child or two playing under the tall elms near one of the gates and for a clerical figure that stalked a path in the far distance the Close was empty of life And there was no one about either in that part of Folliot s big garden I want a bit of talk with you said Bryce as Folliot closed the door and turned down a side path to a still more retired region

476_133471_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Let s go where it s quiet 
none	none	Without replying in words to this suggestion Folliot led the way through his rose trees to a far corner of his grounds where an old building of grey stone covered with ivy stood amongst high trees He turned the key of a doorway and motioned Bryce to enter Quiet enough in here doctor he observed You ve never seen this place bit of a fancy of mine Bryce absorbed as he was in the thoughts of the moment glanced cursorily at the place into which Folliot had led him It was a square building of old stone its walls unlined unplastered its floor paved with much worn flags of limestone evidently set down in a long dead age and now polished to marble like smoothness In its midst set flush with the floor was what was evidently a trap door furnished with a heavy iron ring To this Folliot pointed with a glance of significant interest

none	none	Come up He led the way to a flight of steps in one corner of the lower room pushed open a door at their head and showed his companion into a small apartment arranged and furnished in something closely approaching to luxury The walls were hung with thick fabrics the carpeting was equally thick there were pictures books and curiosities the two or three chairs were deep and big enough to lie down in the two windows commanded pleasant views of the Cathedral towers on one side and of the Close on the other Nice little place to be alone in d ye see said Folliot Cool in summer warm in winter modern fire grate you notice Come here when I want to do a bit of quiet thinking what Good place for that certainly agreed Bryce Folliot pointed his visitor to one of the big chairs and turning to a cabinet brought out some glasses a syphon of soda water and a heavy cut glass decanter He nodded at a box of cigars which lay open on a table at Bryce s elbow as he began to mix a couple of drinks Help yourself he said
476_133471_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 Good stuff those 
none	none	Not until he had given Bryce a drink and had carried his own glass to another easy chair did Folliot refer to any reason for Bryce s visit But once settled down he looked at him speculatively What did you want to see me about he asked Bryce who had lighted a cigar looked across its smoke at the imperturbable face opposite You ve just had Glassdale here he observed quietly I saw him leave you Folliot nodded without any change of expression
476_133471_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Aye doctor he said 
none	none	And what do you know about Glassdale now Bryce who would have cheerfully hobnobbed with a man whom he was about to conduct to the scaffold lifted his glass and drank A good deal he answered as he set the glass down
476_133471_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 The fact is I came here to tell you so I know a good deal about everything 
none	none	A wide term remarked Folliot
476_133471_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 You ve got some limitation to it I should think 
none	none	What do you mean by everything I mean about recent matters replied Bryce I ve interested myself in them for reasons of my own 
476_133471_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Ever since Braden was found at the foot of those stairs in Paradise and I was fetched to him I ve interested myself 
none	none	And I ve discovered a great deal more much more than s known to anybody Folliot threw one leg over the other and began to jog his foot
476_133471_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh he said after a pause 
none	none	Dear me And what might you know now doctor Aught you can tell me eh
476_133471_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Lots answered Bryce 
476_133471_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 I came to tell you on seeing that Glassdale had been with you 
476_133471_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Because I was with Glassdale this morning 
none	none	Folliot made no answer 
476_133471_000026_000001	train-clean-360	But Bryce saw that his cool almost indifferent manner was changing he was beginning under the surface to get anxious 
476_133471_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 When I left Glassdale at noon continued Bryce I d no idea and I don t think he had that he was coming to see you 
none	none	But I know what put the notion into his head I gave him copies of those two reward bills He no doubt thought he might make a bit and so he came in to town and to you Well asked Folliot I shouldn t wonder remarked Bryce reflectively and almost as if speaking to himself I shouldn t at all wonder if Glassdale s the sort of man who can be bought He no doubt has his price 
476_133471_000029_000002	train-clean-360	But all that Glassdale knows is nothing to what I know 
none	none	Folliot had allowed his cigar to go out 
476_133471_000030_000001	train-clean-360	He threw it away took a fresh one from the box and slowly struck a match and lighted it 
476_133471_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 What might you know now he asked after another pause 
none	none	I ve a bit of a faculty for finding things out answered Bryce boldly And I ve developed it I wanted to know all about Braden and about who killed him and why There s only one way of doing all that sort of thing you know You ve got to go back a long way back to the very beginnings 
476_133471_000032_000004	train-clean-360	I went back to the time when Braden was married 
none	none	Not as Braden of course but as who he really was John Brake That was at a place called Braden Medworth near Barthorpe in Leicestershire He paused there watching Folliot But Folliot showed no more than close attention and Bryce went on Not much in that for the really important part of the story he continued But Brake had other associations with Barthorpe a bit later 
476_133471_000034_000002	train-clean-360	He got to know got into close touch with a Barthorpe man who about the time of Brake s marriage left Barthorpe end settled in London 
none	none	Brake and this man began to have some secret dealings together There was another man in with them too a man who was a sort of partner of the Barthorpe man s Brake had evidently a belief in these men and he trusted them unfortunately for himself he sometimes trusted the bank s money to them 
476_133471_000034_000005	train-clean-360	I know what happened he used to let them have money for short financial transactions to be refunded within a very brief space 
none	none	But he went to the fire too often and got his fingers burned in the end The two men did him one of them in particular and cleared out 
476_133471_000034_000008	train-clean-360	He had to stand the racket 
476_133471_000034_000009	train-clean-360	He stood it to the tune of ten years penal servitude 
none	none	And naturally when he d finished his time he wanted to find those two men and began a long search for them Like to know the names of the men mister Folliot You might mention em if you know em answered Folliot
476_133471_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 The name of the particular one was Wraye Falkiner Wraye replied Bryce promptly 
476_133471_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 Of the other the man of lesser importance Flood 
none	none	The two men looked quietly at each other for a full moment s silence And it was Bryce who first spoke with a ring of confidence in his tone which showed that he knew he had the whip hand Shall I tell you something about Falkiner Wraye he asked
476_133471_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 I will it s deeply interesting 
476_133471_000038_000002	train-clean-360	mister Falkiner Wraye after cheating and deceiving Brake and leaving him to pay the penalty of his over trustfulness cleared out of England and carried his money making talents to foreign parts 
none	none	He succeeded in doing well he would and eventually he came back and married a rich widow and settled himself down in an out of the world English town to grow roses You re Falkiner Wraye you know mister Folliot Bryce laughed as he made this direct accusation and sitting forward in his chair pointed first to Folliot s face and then to his left hand Falkiner Wraye he said had an unfortunate gun accident in his youth which marked him for life He lost the middle finger of his left hand and he got a bad scar on his left jaw There they are those marks Fortunate for you mister Folliot that the police don t know all that I know for if they did those marks would have done for you days ago For a minute or two Folliot sat joggling his leg a bad sign in him of rising temper if Bryce had but known it While he remained silent he watched Bryce narrowly and when he spoke his voice was calm as ever And what use do you intend to put your knowledge to if one may ask he inquired half sneeringly You said just now that you d no doubt that man Glassdale could be bought and I m inclining to think that you re one of those men that have their price What is it
476_133471_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 We ve not come to that retorted Bryce 
476_133471_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 You re a bit mistaken 
none	none	If I have my price it s not in the same commodity that Glassdale would want But before we do any talking about that sort of thing I want to add to my stock of knowledge Look here We ll be candid I don t care a snap of my fingers that Brake or Braden s dead or that Collishaw s dead nor if one had his neck broken and the other was poisoned but whose hand was that which the mason Varner saw that morning when Brake was flung out of that doorway 
476_133471_000042_000006	train-clean-360	Come now whose 
none	none	Not mine my lad answered Folliot confidently That s a fact Bryce hesitated giving Folliot a searching look And Folliot nodded solemnly I tell you not mine he repeated I d naught to do with it
476_133471_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Then who had demanded Bryce 
none	none	Was it the other man Flood And if so who is Flood Folliot got up from his chair and cigar between his lips and hands under the tails of his old coat walked silently about the quiet room for awhile 
476_133471_000046_000001	train-clean-360	He was evidently thinking deeply and Bryce made no attempt to disturb him 
476_133471_000046_000002	train-clean-360	Some minutes went by before Folliot took the cigar from his lips and leaning against the chimneypiece looked fixedly at his visitor 
none	none	Look here my lad he said earnestly You re no doubt as you say a good hand at finding things out and you ve doubtless done a good bit of ferreting and done it well enough in your own opinion But there s one thing you can t find out and the police can t find out either and that s the precise truth about Braden s death I d no hand in it it couldn t be fastened on to me anyhow Bryce looked up and interjected one word Collishaw Nor that neither answered Folliot hastily Maybe I know something about both but neither you nor the police nor anybody could fasten me to either matter Granting all you say to be true where s the positive truth What about circumstantial evidence asked Bryce You d have a job to get it retorted Folliot
476_133471_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 Supposing that all you say is true about about past matters 
none	none	Nothing can prove nothing that I ever met Braden that morning On the other hand I can prove easily that I never did meet him I can account for every minute of my time that day As to the other affair not an ounce of direct evidence Then it was the other man exclaimed Bryce Now then who is he Folliot replied with a shrewd glance A man who by giving away another man gave himself away would be a damned fool he answered If there is another man
476_133471_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 As if there must be interrupted Bryce 
none	none	Then he s safe concluded Folliot You ll get nothing from me about him And nobody can get at you except through him asked Bryce
476_133471_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 That s about it assented Folliot laconically 
476_133471_000060_000000	train-clean-360	Bryce laughed cynically 
none	none	A pretty coil he said with a sneer Here You talked about my price I m quite content to hold my tongue if you d tell me something about what happened seventeen years ago What asked Folliot You knew Brake you must have known his family affairs said Bryce What became of Brake s wife and children when he went to prison Folliot shook his head and it was plain to Bryce that his gesture of dissent was genuine You re wrong he answered I never at any time knew anything of Brake s family affairs So little indeed that I never even knew he was married Bryce rose to his feet and stood staring
476_133471_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 What he exclaimed 
none	none	You mean to tell me that even now you don t know that Brake had two children and that that oh it s incredible What s incredible asked Folliot What are you talking about Bryce in his eagerness and surprise grasped Folliot s arm and shook it Good heavens man he said Those two wards of Ransford s are Brake s girl and boy Didn t you know that didn t you Never answered Folliot Never And who s Ransford then I never heard Brake speak of any Ransford What game is all this What Before Bryce could reply Folliot suddenly started thrust his companion aside and went to one of the windows 
476_133471_000072_000001	train-clean-360	A sharp exclamation from him took Bryce to his side 
none	none	Folliot lifted a shaking hand and pointed into the garden There he whispered
476_133471_000073_000001	train-clean-360	 Hell and What s this mean 
476_133471_000074_000000	train-clean-360	Bryce looked in the direction pointed out 
none	none	Behind the pergola of rambler roses the figures of men were coming towards the old well house led by one of Folliot s gardeners Suddenly they emerged into full view and in front of the rest was Mitchington and close behind him the detective and behind him Glassdale CHAPTER XXVI THE OTHER MAN It was close on five o clock when Glassdale leaving Folliot at his garden door turned the corner into the quietness of the Precincts He walked about there a while staring at the queer old houses with eyes which saw neither fantastic gables nor twisted chimneys Glassdale was thinking And the result of his reflections was that he suddenly exchanged his idle sauntering for brisker steps and walked sharply round to the police station where he asked to see Mitchington Mitchington and the detective were just about to walk down to the railway station to meet Ransford in accordance with his telegram At sight of Glassdale they went back into the inspector s office Glassdale closed the door and favoured them with a knowing smile Something else for you inspector he said Mixed up a bit with last night s affair too About these mysteries Braden and Collishaw I can tell you one man who s in them Who then demanded Mitchington Glassdale went a step nearer to the two officials and lowered his voice The man who s known here as Stephen Folliot he answered That s a fact Nonsense exclaimed Mitchington Then he laughed incredulously Can t believe it he continued mister Folliot Must be some mistake No mistake replied Glassdale Besides Folliot s only an assumed name That man is really one Falkiner Wraye the man Braden or Brake was seeking for many a year the man who cheated Brake and got him into trouble I tell you it s a fact He s admitted it or as good as done so to me just now To you And let you come away and spread it exclaimed Mitchington That s incredible more astonishing than the other Glassdale laughed Ah but I let him think I could be squared do you see he said Hush money you know He s under the impression that I m to go back to him this evening to settle matters I knew so much identified him as a matter of fact that he d no option I tell you he s been in at both these affairs certain But there s another man Who s he demanded Mitchington Can t say for I don t know though I ve an idea he ll be a fellow that Brake was also wanting to find replied Glassdale But anyhow I know what I m talking about when I tell you of Folliot You d better do something before he suspects me Mitchington glanced at the clock Come with us down to the station he said doctor Ransford s coming in on this express from town he s got news for us We d better hear that first Folliot good Lord who d have believed or even dreamed it You ll see said Glassdale as they went out Maybe doctor Ransford s got the same information Ransford was out of the train as soon as it ran in and hurried to where Mitchington and his companions were standing And behind him to Mitchington s surprise came old Simpson Harker who had evidently travelled with him With a silent gesture Mitchington beckoned the whole party into an empty waiting room and closed its door on them Now then inspector said Ransford without preface or ceremony you ve got to act quickly You got my wire a few words will explain it I went up to town this morning in answer to a message from the bank where Braden lodged his money when he returned to England To tell you the truth the managers there and myself have since Braden s death been carrying to a conclusion an investigation which I began on Braden s behalf though he never knew of it years ago At the bank I met mister Harker here who had called to find something out for himself Now I ll sum things up in a nutshell for years Braden or Brake had been wanting to find two men who cheated him The name of one is Wraye of the other Flood I ve been trying to trace them too At last we ve got them They re in this town and without doubt the deaths of both Braden and Collishaw are at their door You know both well enough Wraye is mister Folliot interrupted Mitchington pointing to Glassdale So he s just told us he s identified him as Wraye But the other who s he doctor Ransford glanced at Glassdale as if he wished to question him but instead he answered Mitchington s question The other man he said the man Flood is also a well known man to you Fladgate Mitchington started evidently more astonished than by the first news What he exclaimed The verger You don t say Do you remember continued Ransford that Folliot got Fladgate his appointment as verger not so very long after he himself came here He did anyway and Fladgate is Flood We ve traced everything through Flood Wraye has been a difficult man to trace because of his residence abroad for a long time and his change of name and so on and it was only recently that my agents struck on a line through Flood But there s the fact And the probability is that when Braden came here he recognized and was recognized by these two and that one or other of them is responsible for his death and for Collishaw s too Circumstantial evidence all of it no doubt but irresistible Now what do you propose to do Mitchington considered matters for a moment Fladgate first certainly he said He lives close by here we ll go round to his cottage If he sees he s in a tight place he may let things out Let s go there at once He led the whole party out of the station and down the High Street until they came to a narrow lane of little houses which ran towards the Close At its entrance a policeman was walking his beat Mitchington stopped to exchange a few words with him This man Fladgate he said rejoining the others lives alone fifth cottage down here He ll be about having his tea we shall take him by surprise Presently the group stood around a door at which Mitchington knocked gently and it was on their grave and watchful faces that a tall clean shaven very solemn looking man gazed in astonishment as he opened the door and started back He went white to the lips and his hand fell trembling from the latch as Mitchington strode in and the rest crowded behind Now then Fladgate said Mitchington going straight to the point and watching his man narrowly while the detective approached him closely on the other side I want you and a word with you at once Your real name is Flood What have you to say to that And it s no use beating about the bush what have you to say about this Braden affair and your share with Folliot in it whose real name is Wraye It s all come out about the two of you If you ve anything to say you d better say it The verger whose black gown lay thrown across the back of a chair looked from one face to another with frightened eyes It was very evident that the suddenness of the descent had completely unnerved him Ransford s practised eyes saw that he was on the verge of a collapse Give him time Mitchington he said Pull yourself together he added turning to the man Don t be frightened answer these questions For God s sake gentlemen grasped the verger What what is it What am I to answer Before God I m as innocent as as any of you about mister Brake s death Upon my soul and honour I am You know all about it insisted Mitchington Come now isn t it true that you re Flood and that Folliot s Wraye the two men whose trick on him got Brake convicted years ago Answer that Flood looked from one side to the other He was leaning against his tea table set in the middle of his tidy living room From the hearth his kettle sent out a pleasant singing that sounded strangely in contrast with the grim situation Yes that s true he said at last But in that affair I I wasn t the principal I was only only Wraye s agent as it were I wasn t responsible And when mister Brake came here when I met him that morning He paused still looking from one to another of his audience as if entreating their belief As sure as I m a living man gentlemen he suddenly burst out I d no willing hand in mister Brake s death I ll tell you the exact truth I ll take my oath of it whenever you like I d have been thankful to tell many a time but for for Wraye He wouldn t let me at first and afterwards it got complicated It was this way That morning when mister Brake was found dead I had occasion to go up into that gallery under the clerestory I suddenly came on him face to face He recognized me And I m telling you the solemn absolute truth gentlemen he d no sooner recognized me than he attacked me seizing me by the arm I hadn t recognized him at first I did when he laid hold of me I tried to shake him off tried to quiet him he struggled I don t know what he wanted to do he began to cry out it was a wonder he wasn t heard in the church below and he would have been only the organ was being played rather loudly And in the struggle he slipped it was just by that open doorway and before I could do more than grasp at him he shot through the opening and fell It was sheer pure accident gentlemen Upon my soul I hadn t the least intention of harming him And after that asked Mitchington at the end of a brief silence I saw mister Folliot Wraye continued Flood Just afterwards that was I told him he bade me keep silence until we saw how things went Later he forced me to be silent What could I do As things were Wraye could have disclaimed me I shouldn t have had a chance So I held my tongue Now then Collishaw demanded Mitchington Give us the truth about that Whatever the other was that was murder Flood lifted his hand and wiped away the perspiration that had gathered on his face Before God gentlemen he answered I know no more at least little more about that than you do I ll tell you all I do know Wraye and I of course met now and then and talked about this It got to our ears at last that Collishaw knew something My own impression is that he saw what occurred between me and mister Brake he was working somewhere up there I wanted to speak to Collishaw Wraye wouldn t let me he bade me leave it to him A bit later he told me he d squared Collishaw with fifty pounds Mitchington and the detective exchanged looks Wraye that s Folliot paid Collishaw fifty pounds did he asked the detective He told me so replied Flood To hold his tongue But I d scarcely heard that when I heard of Collishaw s sudden death And as to how that happened or who who brought it about upon my soul gentlemen I know nothing Whatever I may have thought I never mentioned it to Wraye never I I daren t You don t know what a man Wraye is I ve been under his thumb most of my life and and what are you going to do with me gentlemen Mitchington exchanged a word or two with the detective and then putting his head out of the door beckoned to the policeman to whom he had spoken at the end of the lane and who now appeared in company with a fellow constable He brought both into the cottage Get your tea he said sharply to the verger These men will stop with you you re not to leave this room He gave some instructions to the two policemen in an undertone and motioned Ransford and the others to follow him It strikes me he said when they were outside in the narrow lane that what we ve just heard is somewhere about the truth And now we ll go on to Folliot s there s a way to his house round here missus Folliot was out Sackville Bonham was still where Bryce had left him at the golf links when the pursuers reached Folliot s A parlourmaid directed them to the garden a gardener volunteered the suggestion that his master might be in the old well house and showed the way And Folliot and Bryce saw them coming and looked at each other Glassdale exclaimed Bryce By heaven man he s told on you Folliot was still staring through the window He saw Ransford and Harker following the leading figures And suddenly he turned to Bryce You ve no hand in this he demanded I exclaimed Bryce I never knew till just now Folliot pointed to the door Go down he said Let em in bid em come up I ll I ll settle with em Go Bryce hurried down to the lower apartment He was filled with excitement an unusual thing for him but in the midst of it as he made for the outer door it suddenly struck him that all his schemings and plottings were going for nothing The truth was at hand and it was not going to benefit him in the slightest degree He was beaten But that was no time for philosophic reflection already those outside were beating at the door He flung it open and the foremost men started in surprise at the sight of him But Bryce bent forward to Mitchington anxious to play a part to the last He s upstairs he whispered Up there He ll bluff it out if he can but he s just admitted to me Mitchington thrust Bryce aside almost roughly We know all about that he said I shall have a word or two for you later Come on now The men crowded up the stairway into Folliot s snuggery Bryce wondering at the inspector s words and manner following closely behind him and the detective and Glassdale who led the way Folliot was standing in the middle of the room one hand behind his back the other in his pocket And as the leading three entered the place he brought his concealed hand sharply round and presenting a revolver at Glassdale fired point blank at him But it was not Glassdale who fell He wary and watching started aside as he saw Folliot s movement and the bullet passing between his arm and body found its billet in Bryce who fell with little more than a groan shot through the heart And as he fell Folliot scarcely looking at what he had done drew his other hand from his pocket slipped something into his mouth and sat down in the big chair behind him and within a moment the other men in the room were looking with horrified faces from one dead face to another CHAPTER XXVII THE GUARDED SECRET When Bryce had left her Mary Bewery had gone into the house to await Ransford s return from town She meant to tell him of all that Bryce had said and to beg him to take immediate steps to set matters right not only that he himself might be cleared of suspicion but that Bryce s intrigues might be brought to an end She had some hope that Ransford would bring back satisfactory news she knew that his hurried visit to London had some connection with these affairs and she also remembered what he had said on the previous night And so controlling her anger at Bryce and her impatience of the whole situation she waited as patiently as she could until the time drew near when Ransford might be expected to be seen coming across the Close She knew from which direction he would come and she remained near the dining room window looking out for him But six o clock came and she had seen no sign of him then as she was beginning to think that he had missed the afternoon train she saw him at the opposite side of the Close talking earnestly to Dick who presently came towards the house while Ransford turned back into Folliot s garden Dick Bewery came hurriedly in His sister saw at once that he had just heard news which had had a sobering effect on his usually effervescent spirits He looked at her as if he wondered exactly how to give her his message I saw you with the doctor just now she said using the term by which she and her brother always spoke of their guardian Why hasn t he come home Dick came close to her touching her arm I say he said almost whispering Don t be frightened the doctor s all right but there s something awful just happened At Folliot s What she demanded Speak out Dick I m not frightened What is it Dick shook his head as if he still scarcely realized the full significance of his news It s all a licker to me yet he answered I don t understand it I only know what the doctor told me to come and tell you Look here it s pretty bad Folliot and Bryce are both dead In spite of herself Mary started back as from a great shock and clutched at the table by which they were standing Dead she exclaimed Why Bryce was here speaking to me not an hour ago Maybe said Dick But he s dead now The fact is Folliot shot him with a revolver killed him on the spot And then Folliot poisoned himself took the same stuff the doctor said that finished that chap Collishaw and died instantly It was in Folliot s old well house The doctor was there and the police What does it all mean asked Mary Don t know Except this added Dick they ve found out about those other affairs the Braden and the Collishaw affairs Folliot was concerned in them and who do you think the other was You d never guess That man Fladgate the verger Only that isn t his proper name at all He and Folliot finished Braden and Collishaw anyway The police have got Fladgate and Folliot shot Bryce and killed himself just when they were going to take him The doctor told you all this asked Mary Yes replied Dick Just that and no more He called me in as I was passing Folliot s door He s coming over as soon as he can Whew I say won t there be some fine talk in the town Anyway things ll be cleared up now What did Bryce want here Never mind I can t talk of it now answered Mary She was already thinking of how Bryce had stood before her active and alive only an hour earlier she was thinking too of her warning to him It s all too dreadful too awful to understand Here s the doctor coming now said Dick turning to the window He ll tell more Mary looked anxiously at Ransford as he came hastening in He looked like a man who has just gone through a crisis and yet she was somehow conscious that there was a certain atmosphere of relief about him as though some great weight had suddenly been lifted He closed the door and looked straight at her Dick has told you he asked All that you told me said Dick Ransford pulled off his gloves and flung them on the table with something of a gesture of weariness And at that Mary hastened to speak Don t tell any more don t say anything until you feel able she said You re tired No answered Ransford I d rather say what I have to say now just now I ve wanted to tell both of you what all this was what it meant everything about it and until today until within the last few hours it was impossible because I didn t know everything Now I do I even know more than I did an hour ago Let me tell you now and have done with it Sit down there both of you and listen He pointed to a sofa near the hearth and the brother and sister sat down looking at him wonderingly Instead of sitting down himself he leaned against the edge of the table looking down at them I shall have to tell you some sad things he said diffidently The only consolation is that it s all over now and certain matters are or can be cleared and you ll have no more secrets Nor shall I I ve had to keep this one jealously guarded for seventeen years And I never thought it could be released as it has been in this miserable and terrible fashion But that s done now and nothing can help it And now to make everything plain just prepare yourselves to hear something that at first sounds very trying The man whom you ve heard of as John Braden who came to his death by accident as I now firmly believe there in Paradise was in reality John Brake your father Ransford looked at his two listeners anxiously as he told this But he met no sign of undue surprise or emotion Dick looked down at his toes with a little frown as if he were trying to puzzle something out Mary continued to watch Ransford with steady eyes Your father John Brake repeated Ransford breathing more freely now that he had got the worst news out I must go back to the beginning to make things clear to you about him and your mother He was a close friend of mine when we were young men in London he a bank manager I just beginning my work We used to spend our holidays together in Leicestershire There we met your mother whose name was Mary Bewery He married her I was his best man They went to live in London and from that time I did not see so much of them only now and then During those first years of his married life Brake made the acquaintance of a man who came from the same part of Leicestershire that we had met your mother in a man named Falkiner Wraye I may as well tell you that Falkiner Wraye and Stephen Folliot were one and the same person Ransford paused observing that Mary wished to ask a question How long have you known that she asked Not until today replied Ransford promptly Never had the ghost of a notion of it If I only had known but I hadn t However to go back this man Wraye who appears always to have been a perfect master of plausibility able to twist people round his little finger somehow got into close touch with your father about financial matters Wraye was at that time a sort of financial agent in London engaging in various doings which I should imagine were in the nature of gambles He was assisted in these by a man who was either a partner with him or a very confidential clerk or agent one Flood who is identical with the man you have known lately as Fladgate the verger Between them these two appear to have cajoled or persuaded your father at times to do very foolish and injudicious things which were to put it briefly and plainly the lendings of various sums of money as short loans for their transactions For some time they invariably kept their word to him and the advances were always repaid promptly But eventually when they had borrowed from him a considerable sum some thousands of pounds for a deal which was to be carried through within a couple of days they decamped with the money and completely disappeared leaving your father to bear the consequences You may easily understand what followed The money which Brake had lent them was the bank s money The bank unexpectedly came down on him for his balance the whole thing was found out and he was prosecuted He had no defence he was of course technically guilty and he was sent to penal servitude Ransford had dreaded the telling of this but Mary made no sign and Dick only rapped out a sharp question He hadn t meant to rob the bank for himself anyway had he he asked No no not at all replied Ransford hastily It was a bad error of judgment on his part Dick but he he d relied on these men more particularly on Wraye who d been the leading spirit Well that was your father s sad fate Now we come to what happened to your mother and yourselves Just before your father s arrest when he knew that all was lost and that he was helpless he sent hurriedly for me and told me everything in your mother s presence He begged me to get her and you two children right away at once She was against it he insisted I took you all to a quiet place in the country where your mother assumed her maiden name There within a year she died She wasn t a strong woman at any time After that well you both know pretty well what has been the run of things since you began to know anything We ll leave that it s nothing to do with the story I want to go back to your father I saw him after his conviction When I had satisfied him that you and your mother were safe he begged me to do my best to find the two men who had ruined him I began that search at once But there was not a trace of them they had disappeared as completely as if they were dead I used all sorts of means to trace them without effect And when at last your father s term of imprisonment was over and I went to see him on his release I had to tell him that up to that point all my efforts had been useless I urged him to let the thing drop and to start life afresh But he was determined Find both men but particularly Wraye he would He refused point blank to even see his children until he had found these men and had forced them to acknowledge their misdeeds as regards him for that of course would have cleared him to a certain extent And in spite of everything I could say he there and then went off abroad in search of them he had got some clue faint and indefinite but still there as to Wraye s presence in America and he went after him From that time until the morning of his death here in Wrychester I never saw him again You did see him that morning asked Mary I saw him of course unexpectedly answered Ransford I had been across the Close I came back through the south aisle of the Cathedral Just before I left the west porch I saw Brake going up the stairs to the galleries I knew him at once He did not see me and I hurried home much upset Unfortunately I think Bryce came in upon me in that state of agitation I have reason to believe that he began to suspect and to plot from that moment And immediately on hearing of Brake s death and its circumstances I was placed in a terrible dilemma For I had made up my mind never to tell you two of your father s history until I had been able to trace these two men and wring out of them a confession which would have cleared him of all but the technical commission of the crime of which he was convicted Now I had not the least idea that the two men were close at hand nor that they had had any hand in his death and so I kept silence and let him be buried under the name he had taken John Braden Ransford paused and looked at his two listeners as if inviting question or comment But neither spoke and he went on You know what happened after that he continued It soon became evident to me that sinister and secret things were going on There was the death of the labourer Collishaw There were other matters But even then I had no suspicion of the real truth the fact is I began to have some strange suspicions about Bryce and that old man Harker based upon certain evidence which I got by chance But all this time I had never ceased my investigations about Wraye and Flood and when the bank manager on whom Brake had called in London was here at the inquest I privately told him the whole story and invited his company operation in a certain line which I was then following That line suddenly ran up against the man Flood otherwise Fladgate It was not until this very week however that my agents definitely discovered Fladgate to be Flood and that through the investigations about Flood Folliot was found to be Wraye Today in London where I met old Harker at the bank at which Brake had lodged the money he had brought from Australia the whole thing was made clear by the last agent of mine who has had the searching in hand And it shows how men may easily disappear from a certain round of life and turn up in another years after When those two men cheated your father out of that money they disappeared and separated each no doubt with his share Flood went off to some obscure place in the North of England Wraye went over to America He evidently made a fortune there knocked about the world for awhile changed his name to Folliot and under that name married a wealthy widow and settled down here in Wrychester to grow roses How and where he came across Flood again is not exactly clear but we knew that a few years ago Flood was in London in very poor circumstances and the probability is that it was then when the two men met again What we do know is that Folliot as an influential man here got Flood the post which he has held and that things have resulted as they have And that s all all that I need tell you at present There are details but they re of no importance Mary remained silent but Dick got up with his hands in his pockets There s one thing I want to know he said Which of those two chaps killed my father You said it was accident but was it I want to know about that Are you saying it was accident just to let things down a bit Don t I want to know the truth I believe it was accident answered Ransford I listened most carefully just now to Fladgate s account of what happened I firmly believe the man was telling the truth But I haven t the least doubt that Folliot poisoned Collishaw not the least Folliot knew that if the least thing came out about Fladgate everything would come out about himself Dick turned away to leave the room Well Folliot s done for he remarked I don t care about him but I wanted to know for certain about the other When Dick had gone and Ransford and Mary were left alone a deep silence fell on the room Mary was apparently deep in thought and Ransford after a glance at her turned away and looked out of the window at the sunlit Close thinking of the tragedy he had just witnessed And he had become so absorbed in his thoughts of it that he started at feeling a touch on his arm and looking round saw Mary standing at his side I don t want to say anything now she said about what you have just told us Some of it I had half guessed some of it I had conjectured But why didn t you tell me Before It wasn t that you hadn t confidence Confidence he exclaimed There was only one reason I wanted to get your father s memory cleared as far as possible before ever telling you anything I ve been wanting to tell you Hadn t you seen that I hated to keep silent Hadn t you seen that I wanted to share all your trouble about it she asked That was what hurt me because I couldn t Ransford drew a long breath and looked at her Then he put his hands on her shoulders Mary he said You you don t mean to say be plain you don t mean that you can care for an old fellow like me He was holding her away from him but she suddenly smiled and came closer to him You must have been very blind not to have seen that for a long time she answered End of the
