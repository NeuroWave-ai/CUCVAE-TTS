FEW WORDS ABOUT LOVE Courtship is one of the oldest of social customs even antedating in some countries such long established usages as marriage or the wearing of white neckties with full evening dress The beginnings of the etiquette of courtship were apparently connected in some way with the custom of love between the sexes and many of the old amatory forms still survive in the modern courtship It is generally agreed among students of the history of etiquette that when love first began to become popular among the better class of younger people they took to it with such avidity that it was necessary to devise some sort of rules for the conduct of formal or informal love making These rules together with various amendments now constitute the etiquette of courtship Suppose for example that you are a young gentleman named Richard Roe desirous of entering upon a formal courtship with some refined young girl of fashion You are also being a college graduate engaged in the bond business One morning there comes into your financial institution a young lady named Dorothy Doe who at once attracts your attention by her genteel manners as exemplified by the fact that she calls the president of your company father So many young people seem to think it smart to refer to their parents as dad or my old man you are certain as soon as you hear her say Hello father to your employer that she is undoubtedly a worthy object of courtship CORRECT INTRODUCTIONS HOW TO MAKE THEM Your first step should be of course the securing of an introduction Introductions still play an important part in social intercourse and many errors are often perpetrated by those ignorant of savoir faire correct form When introducing a young lady to a stranger for example it is not au fait correct form to simply say mister Roe I want you to shake hands with my friend Dorothy Under the rules of the beau monde correct form this would probably be done as follows Dorothy or Miss Doe shake hands with mister Roe Always give the name of the lady first unless you are introducing some one to the President of the United States the Archbishop of Canterbury a member of the nobility above a baron or a customer The person who is being introduced then extends his or her right ungloved hand and says Shake You shake saying at the same time It s warm cool for November May to which the other replies I ll say it is This brings up the interesting question of introducing two people to each other neither of whose names you can remember This is generally done by saying very quickly to one of the parties Of course you know Miss Unkunkunk Say the last unk very quickly so that it sounds like any name from Ab to Zinc You might even sneeze violently Of course in nine cases out of ten one of the two people will at once say I didn t get the name at which you laugh Ha Ha Ha in a carefree manner several times saying at the same time Well well so you didn t get the name you didn t get the name well well If the man still persists in wishing to know who it is to whom he is being introduced the best procedure consists in simply braining him on the spot with a club or convenient slab of paving stone The introduction in cases where you have no mutual friend to do the introducing is somewhat more difficult but can generally be arranged as follows Procure a few feet of stout manila rope or clothes line from any of the better class hardware stores Ascertain from the Social Register preferably the location of the young lady s residence and go there on some dark evening about nine o clock Fasten the rope across the sidewalk in front of the residence about six inches or a foot from the ground Then with the aid of a match and some kerosene set fire to the young lady s house in several places and retire behind a convenient tree After some time if she is at home she will probably be forced to run out of her house to avoid being burned to death In her excitement she will fail to notice the rope which you have stretched across the sidewalk and will fall This is your opportunity to obtain an introduction Stepping up to her and touching your hat politely you say in a well modulated voice I beg your pardon Miss Doe but I cannot help noticing that you are lying prone on the sidewalk If she is well bred she will not at first speak to you as you are a perfect stranger This silence however should be your cue to once more tip your hat and remark I realize Miss Doe that I have not had the honor of an introduction but you will admit that you are lying prone on the sidewalk Here is my card and here is one for missus Doe your mother At that you should hand her two plain engraved calling cards each containing your name and address If there are any other ladies in her family aunts grandmothers et cetera it is correct to leave cards for them also Be sure that the cards are clean as the name on the calling card is generally sufficient for identification purposes without the addition of the thumbprint When she has accepted your cards she will give you one of hers after which it will be perfectly correct for you to assist her to rise from the sidewalk Do not however press your attentions further upon her at this time but after expressing the proper regret over her misfortune it would be well to bow and retire CARDS AND FLOWERS The next day however you should send flowers enclosing another of your cards It might be well to write some message on the card recalling the events of the preceding evening nothing intimate but simply a reminder of your first meeting and a suggestion that you might possibly desire to continue the acquaintanceship Quotations from poetry of the better sort are always appropriate thus on this occasion it might be nice to write on the card accompanying the flowers This is the forest primeval H W Longfellow or Take oh take those lips away W Shakespeare You will find there are hundreds of lines equally appropriate for this and other occasions and in this connection it might be well to display a little originality at times by substituting pertinent verses of your own in place of the conventional quotations For example This is the forest primeval I regret your last evening s upheaval shows the young lady in question that not only are you well read in classic poetry but also you have no mean talent of your own Too much originality however is dangerous especially in polite social intercourse and I need hardly remind you that the floors of the social ocean are watered with the tears of those who seek to walk on their own hook Within a week after you have sent the young lady the flowers you should receive a polite note of thanks somewhat as follows My dear mister Roe Those lovely flowers came quite as a surprise They are lovely and I cannot thank you enough for your thoughtfulness Their lovely fragrance fills my room as I write and I wish to thank you again It was lovely of you FLOWERS AND THEIR MESSAGE IN COURTSHIP It is now time to settle down to the more serious business of courtship Her letter shows beyond the shadow of a figurative doubt that she is interested and the next move is up to you Probably she will soon come into the office to see her father in which case you should have ready at hand some appropriate gift such as for example a nice potted geranium Great care should be taken however that it is a plant of the correct species for in the etiquette of courtship all flowers have different meanings and many a promising affair has been ruined because a suitor sent his lady a buttercup meaning That s the last dance I ll ever take you to you big cow instead of a plant with a more tender significance Some of the commoner flowers and their meaning in courtship are as follows Fringed Gentian I am going out to get a shave Back at three thirty Poppy I would be proud to be the father of your children Golden rod I hear that you have hay fever Tuberose Meet me Saturday at the Fourteenth Street subway station Blood root Aunt Kitty murdered Uncle Fred Thursday Dutchman s Breeches That case of Holland gin and Old Tailor has arrived Come on over Iris Could you learn to love an optician Aster Who was that stout Jewish looking party I saw you with in the hotel lobby Friday Deadly Nightshade Pull down those blinds quick Passion Flower Phone Main twelve forty nine ask for Eddie Raspberry I am announcing my engagement to Charlie O Keefe Tuesday Wild Thyme I have seats for the Hippodrome Saturday afternoon The above flowers can also be combined to make different meanings as for example a bouquet composed of three tuberoses and some Virginia creeper generally signifies the following The reason I didn t call for you yesterday was that I had three inner tube punctures besides a lot of engine trouble in that old car I bought in Virginia last year Gosh I m sorry But to return to the etiquette of our present courtship As Miss Doe leaves the office you follow her holding the potted plant in your left hand After she has gone a few paces you step up to her remove your hat or cap with your right hand and offer her the geranium remarking I beg your pardon miss but didn t you drop this A great deal depends upon the manner in which you offer the plant and the way she receives it If you hand it to her with the flower pointing upward it means Dare I hope Reversed it signifies Your petticoat shows about an inch or an inch and a half If she receives the plant in her right hand it means I am left hand You are both hands He she or it is If however she takes the pot firmly in both hands and breaks it with great force on your head the meaning is usually negative and your only correct course of procedure is a hasty bow and a brief apology RECEIVING AN INVITATION TO CALL Let us suppose however that she accepts the geranium in such a manner that you are encouraged to continue the acquaintance Your next move should be a request for an invitation to call upon her at her home This should above all things not be done crudely It is better merely to suggest your wish by some indirect method such as Oh so you live on William Street Well well I often walk on William Street in the evening but I have never called on any girl there YET The yet may be accompanied by a slight raising of your eyebrows a wink or a friendly nudge with your elbow Unless she is unusually dense she will probably take the hint and invite you to come and see her some evening At once you should say WHAT evening How about TO NIGHT If she says that she is already engaged for that evening take a calendar out of your pocket and remark Tomorrow Wednesday Thursday Friday I really have no engagements between now and October Saturday Sunday This will show her that you are really desirous of calling upon her and she will probably say Well I think I am free Thursday night but you had better telephone me first THE ETIQUETTE OF TELEPHONING On Thursday morning therefore you should go to a public telephone booth in order to call the young lady s house The etiquette of telephoning is quite important and many otherwise perfectly well bred people often make themselves conspicuous because they do not know the correct procedure in using this modern but almost indispensable invention Upon entering the telephone booth which is located say in some drug store you remove the receiver from the hook and deposit the requisite coin in the coin box After an interval of some minutes a young lady referred to as Central will ask for your Number please Suppose for example that you wish to get Bryant four thousand three hundred ten Remove your hat politely and speak that number into the mouthpiece Central will then say Rhinelander four thousand three hundred ten To which you reply NO Central BRYANT four thousand three hundred ten Central then says I beg your pardon Bryant four thousand three hundred ten to which you reply Yes please In a few minutes a voice at the other end of the line says Hello to which you answer Is Miss Doe at home The voice then says Who You say Miss Doe please Miss Dorothy Doe You then hear the following Wait a minute Say Charlie is they anybody works around here by the name of Doe There s a guy wants to talk to a Miss Doe Here you answer it Another voice then says Hello You reply Hello He says What do you want You reply I wish to speak to Miss Dorothy Doe He says What department does she work in You reply Is this the residence of J Franklin Doe President of the First National Bank He says Wait a minute You wait a minute You wait several Another voice a new voice says Hello You reply Hello He says Give me Stuyvesant eight thousand eight hundred sixty four You say But I m trying to get Miss Doe Miss Dorothy Doe He says Who You say Is this the residence of He says Naw this is Goebel Brothers Wholesale Grocers what number do you want You say Bryant four thousand three hundred ten He says Well this is Rhinelander four thousand three hundred ten You then hang up the receiver and count twenty The telephone bell then rings and inasmuch as you are the only person near the phone you take up the receiver and say Hello A female voice says Hello dearie don t you know who this is You say politely but firmly No She says Guess You guess missus Warren G Harding She says No This is Ethel Is Walter there You reply Walter She says Ask him to come to the phone will you He lives up stairs over the drug store Just yell Walter at the third door down the hall Tell him Ethyl wants to speak to him no wait tell him it s Madge Being a gentleman you comply with the lady s request After bringing Walter to the phone you obligingly wait for some twenty minutes while he converses with Ethel no Madge When he has finished you once more enter the booth and tell Central you want Bryant four thousand three hundred ten After a few minutes Central says What number did you call You say patiently Bryant four thousand three hundred ten She replies Bryant four thousand three hundred ten has been changed to Schuyler six thousand three hundred seventy two You ask for Schuyler six thousand three hundred seventy two Finally a woman s voice says Yass You say Is Miss Doe in She replies Yass You say May I speak to her She says Who You reply You said Miss Doe was at home didn t you She replies Yass You say Well may I speak to her The voice says Who You shout Miss Doe The voice says She ban out You shriek Oh go to hell and assuming a graceful easy position in the booth you proceed to tear the telephone from the wall Later on in the day when you have two or three hours of spare time you can telephone Miss Doe again and arrange for the evening s visit MAKING THE FIRST CALL The custom of social calls between young men and young women is one of the prettiest of etiquette s older conventions and one around which clusters a romantic group of delightful traditions In this day and generation what with horseless carriages electric telephones and telegraphs and dirigible gas bags a great many of the older forms have been allowed to die out greatly I believe to our discredit Speed not manners seems to be the motto of this century I hope that there still exist a few young men who care enough about good form to study carefully to perfect themselves in the art of calling Come Tom Dick and Harry drop your bicycles for an afternoon and fill your minds with something besides steam engines and pneumatic tires The first call at the home of any young lady of fashion is an extremely important social function and too great care can not be taken that you prepare yourself thoroughly in advance It would be well to leave your work an hour or two earlier in the afternoon so that you can go home and practice such necessary things as entering or leaving a room correctly Most young men are extremely careless in this particular and unless you rehearse yourself thoroughly in the proper procedure you are apt to find later on to your dismay that you have made your exit through a window onto the fire escape instead of through the proper door CONVERSATION AND SOME OF ITS USES Your conversation should also be planned more or less in advance Select some topic in which you think your lady friend will be interested such as for example the removal of tonsils and adenoids and read up on the subject so that you can discuss it in an intelligent manner Find out for example how many people had tonsils removed in February March April Contrast this with the same figures for eighteen eighty eighteen ninety nineteen hundred Learn two or three amusing anecdotes about adenoids Consult Bartlett s Familiar Quotations for appropriate verses dealing with tonsils and throat troubles Finally and above all take time to glance through four or five volumes of doctor Eliot s Five Foot Shelf for nothing so completely marks the cultivated man as the ability to refer familiarly to the various volumes of the Harvard classics A PROPER CALL Promptly at the time appointed you should arrive at the house where the young lady is staying In answer to your ring a German police dog will begin to bark furiously inside the house and a maid will finally come to the door Removing your hat and one glove you say Is Miss Doe home The maid replies Yass ay tank so You give her your card and the dog rushes out and bites you on either the right or left leg You are then ushered into a room in which is seated an old man with a long white beard He is fast asleep Dot s grampaw says the maid to which you reply Oh She retires leaving you alone with grampaw After a while he opens his eyes and stares at you for a few minutes He then says Did the dog bite you You answer Yes sir Grampaw then says He bites everybody and goes back to sleep Reassured you light a cigaret A little boy and girl then come to the door and after examining you carefully for several minutes they burst into giggling laughter and run away You feel to see if you have forgotten to put on a necktie A severe looking old lady then enters the room You rise and bow I am Miss Doe s grandmother Some one has been smoking in here she says and sits down opposite you Her remark is not however a hint for a cigaret and you should not make the mistake of saying I ve only got Fatimas but if you care to try one It should be your aim to seek to impress yourself favorably upon every member of the young lady s family Try to engage the grandmother in conversation taking care to select subjects in which you feel she would be interested Conversation is largely the art of playing up to the other person s favorite subject In this particular case for example it would be a mistake to say to Miss Doe s grandmother Have you ever tried making synthetic gin or Do you think any one will EVER lick Dempsey A more experienced person and some one who had studied the hobbies of old people would probably begin by remarking Well I see that Jeremiah Smith died of cancer Thursday or That was a lovely burial they gave missus Watts wasn t it If you are tactful you should soon win the old lady s favor completely so that before long she will tell you all about her rheumatism and what grampaw can and can t eat Finally Miss Doe arrives Her first words are Have you been waiting long Hilda didn t tell me you were here to which you reply No I just arrived She then says Shall we go in the drawing room The answer to this is For God s sake yes In a few minutes you find yourself alone in the drawing room with the lady of your choice and the courtship proper can then begin The best way to proceed is gradually to bring the conversation around to the subject of the modern girl After your preliminary remarks about tonsils and adenoids have been thoroughly exhausted you should suddenly say Well I don t think girls nice girls are really that way She replies of course WHAT way You answer Oh the way they are in these modern novels This petting for instance She says WHAT petting You walk over and sit down on the sofa beside her Oh you say these novelists make me sick they seem to think that in our generation every time a young man and woman are left alone on a lounge together they haven t a thing better to do than put out the light and pet It s disgusting isn t it Isn t it she agrees and reaching over she accidentally pulls the lamp cord which puts out the light On your first visit you should not stay after twelve thirty THE PROPOSAL PROPER About the second or third month of a formal courtship it is customary for the man to propose matrimony and if the girl has been out for three or four years and has several younger sisters coming along it is customary for her to accept him They then become engaged and the courtship is concluded CHAPTER TWO THE ETIQUETTE OF ENGAGEMENTS AND WEDDINGS THE HISTORIC ASPECT Matrimony sings Homer the poet is a holy estate and not lightly to be entered into The old Roman is right A modern wedding is one of the most intricate and exhausting of social customs Young men and women of our better classes are now forced to devote a large part of their lives to acting as brides grooms ushers and bridesmaids at various elaborate nuptials Weeks are generally required in preparation for an up to date wedding months are necessary in recovering from such an affair Indeed some of the participants notably the bride and groom never quite get over the effects of a marriage It was not always thus Time was when the wedding was a comparatively simple affair In the Paleolithic Age for example as mister H G Wells of England points out in his able Outline of History there is no evidence of any particular ceremony conjunctive with the marriage of a male and a female Even with the advent of Neolithic man a wedding seems to have been consummated by the rather simple process of having the bridegroom crack the bride over the head with a plain unornamented stone ax There were no ushers no bridesmaids But shortly after that c ten thousand three hundred twenty nine thirty B C to be exact two young Neoliths named Haig living in what is now supposed to be Scotland discovered that the prolonged distillation of common barley resulted in the creation of an amber colored liquid which when taken internally produced a curious and not unpleasant effect This discovery had and still has a remarkable effect upon the celebration of the marriage rite Gradually there grew up around the wedding a number of customs With the Haig brothers discovery of Scotch whiskey began as a matter of course the institution of the bachelor dinner Necessity is the mother of invention and exactly twelve years after the first bachelor dinner came the discovery of bicarbonate of soda From that time down to the present day the history of the etiquette of weddings has been that of an increasing number of intricate forms and ceremonies each age having added its particular bit of ritual The modern wedding may be said to be therefore almost an Outline of History itself ANNOUNCING THE ENGAGEMENT LET us begin first of all with the duties of one of the minor characters at a wedding the Groom Suppose that you are an eligible young man named Richard Roe who has just become engaged to a young lady named Dorothy Doe If you really intend to marry the girl it is customary that some formal announcement of the engagement be made for which you must have the permission of Miss Dorothy and her father It is not generally difficult to become engaged to most girls but it will surprise you to discover how hard it is to get the young lady whom you believe to be your fiancee to consent to a public announcement of the fact The reason for this probably is that an engagement which has been announced often leads to matrimony and matrimony in polite society often lasts for several years After you have secured the girl s permission it is next necessary that you notify her father of the engagement In this particular case as he happens to be your employer the notification can take place in his office First of all however it would be advisable to prepare some sort of speech in advance Aim to put him as far as possible at his ease lead up to the subject gradually and tactfully Abruptness is never good form The following is suggested as a possible model Good morning mister Doe say I heard a good story from a traveling salesman last night It seems that there was a young married couple here insert a good story about a young married couple Wasn t that RICH Yes sir marriage is a great thing a great institution Every young man ought to get married don t you think You do Well mister Doe I ve got a surprise for you here move toward the door I m going to here open the door marry step out of the room your daughter close the door quickly THE BRIDE TO BE Before the public announcement of the engagement it is customary for the bride to be to write personal letters to all other young men to whom she happens to be engaged at the time These notes should be kindly sympathetic and tactful The same note can be written to all provided there is no chance of their comparing notes The following is suggested Dear Bob Bob I want you to be the very first to know that I am engaged to Richard Roe I want you to like him Bob because he is a fine fellow and I would rather have you like him than any one I know I feel that he and I shall be very happy together and I want you to be the first to know about it Your friendship will always remain one of the brightest things in my life Bob but of course I probably won t be able to go to the Aiken dance with you now Please don t tell anybody about it yet I shall never forget the happy times you and I had together Bob and will you please return those silly letters of mine I am sending you yours THE ENGAGEMENT LUNCHEON THE engagement is generally announced at a luncheon given by the parents of the prospective bride This is usually a small affair only fifteen or twenty of the most intimate friends of the engaged couple being invited It is one of the customs of engagement luncheons that all the guests shall be tremendously surprised at the news and great care should be taken to aid them in carrying out this tradition On the invitations for example should be written some misleading phrase such as To meet General Pershing or Not to Announce the Engagement of our Daughter The announcement itself which should be made soon after the guests are seated offers a splendid opportunity for the display of originality and should aim to afford the guest a surprise and perhaps a laugh for laughter of a certain quiet kind is often welcome at social functions One of the most favored methods of announcing an engagement is by the use of symbolic figures embodying the names of the affianced pair Thus for example in the case of the present engagement of Richard Roe to Dorothy Doe it would be unique to have the first course at luncheon consist of a diminutive candy or paper mache doe seated amorously upon a heart shaped order of a shad roe The guests will at first be mystified but soon cries of Oh how sweet will arise and congratulations are then in order Great care should be taken however that the symbolic figures are not misunderstood it would be extremely embarrassing for example if in the above instance a young man named Shad or Aquarium were to receive the congratulations instead of the proper person Other suggestions for symbolistic announcements of some of the more common names are as follows Cohan O Brien ice cream cones on a plate of O Brien potatoes Ames Green green ice cream in the shape of a man aiming at something Thorne Hoyt figure of a man from Brooklyn pulling a thorn from foot with expression on his face signifying This hoits Bullitt Bartlett bartlett pears full of small twenty two or thirty three calibre bullets Tweed Ellis frosted cake in the shape of Ellis Island with a solitary figure of a man in a nice fitting tweed suit Gordon Fuller two paper mache figures one representing a young man full of Gordon gin the other representing a young man fuller Hatch Gillette figure of a chicken surprised at having hatched a safety razor Graves Colgate figure of a man brushing his teeth in a cemetery Heinz Fish fifty seven assorted small fish tastily arranged on one plate SELECTING THE BRIDAL PARTY AS soon as the engagement has been announced it is the duty of the prospective bride to select a maid of honor and eight or ten bridesmaids while the groom must choose his best man and ushers In making these selections it should be carefully borne in mind that no wedding party is complete without the following one bridesmaid who danced twice with the Prince of Wales two Bridesmaids who never danced more than once with anybody one bridesmaid who doesn t Pet one bridesmaid who was expelled from Miss Spence s one bridesmaid who talks Southern one bridesmaid who met Douglas Fairbanks once one bridesmaid who rowed on the crew at Wellesley one usher who doesn t drink anything nine ushers who drink anything In some localities following the announcement it is customary for the bride s friends to give for her a number of showers These are for the purpose of providing her with various necessities for her wedded household life These affairs should be informal and only her dearest or wealthiest friends should be invited A clever bride will generally arrange secretly for several of these showers by promising a certain percentage usually fifteen of the gross up to five hundred dollars and twenty five bonus on all over that amount to the friend who gives the party Some of the more customary showers of common household articles for the new bride are toothpaste milk of magnesia screen doors copies of Service s poems Cape Cod lighters pictures of Age of Innocence and back numbers of the Atlantic Monthly INVITATIONS AND WEDDING PRESENTS The proper time to send out invitations to a wedding is between two and three weeks before the day set for the ceremony although the out of town invitations should be mailed in plenty of time to allow the recipient to purchase and forward a suitable present As the gifts are received a check mark should be placed after the name of the donor together with a short description of the present and an estimate as to its probable cost This list is to be used later at the wedding reception in determining the manner in which the bride is to greet the various guests It has been found helpful by many brides to devise some sort of memory system whereby certain names immediately suggest certain responses thus mister Snodgrass copy of Highways and Byways in Old France c six dollars fifty cents how do you do mister Snodgrass have you met my mother mister Brackett Solid silver candlesticks sixty eight dollars fifty cents hello Bob you old peach How about a kiss The real festivities of a wedding start about three days before the ceremony with the arrival of the wedding party in which party the most responsible position is that of best man Let us suppose that you are to be the best man at the Roe Doe nuptials What are your duties In the first place you must prepare yourself for the wedding by a course of training extending for over a month or more prior to the actual event It should be your aim to work yourself into such a condition that you can go for three nights without sleep talk for hours to the most impossibly stupid of young women and consume an unending amount of alcohol You are then prepared for the bachelor dinner the bridal dinner the bridesmaids the wedding and the wedding reception DUTIES OF THE BEST MAN Upon your arrival in the city where the wedding is to take place you will be met by the bridegroom who will take you to the home of the bride where you are to stay There you are met by the bride s father This is my best man says the groom The best man replies her father Well may the best man win At once you reply Ha Ha Ha He then says Is this your first visit to Chicago to which the correct answer is Yes sir but I hope it isn t my last The bride s mother then appears This is my best man says the groom Well says she remember the best man doesn t always win Ha Ha Ha you at once reply Is this your first visit to Chicago says she to which you answer Yes but I hope it isn t my last You are then conducted to your room where you are left alone to unpack In a few minutes the door will open and a small boy enter This is the brother of the bride You smile at him pleasantly and remark Is this your first visit to Chicago What are you doing is his answer Unpacking you reply What s that says he A cutaway you reply What s that says he A collar bag What s that A dress shirt What s that says he Another dress shirt What s that says he Say listen you reply don t I hear some one calling you No says he what s that That you reply with a sigh of relief is a razor Here take it and play with it In three minutes if you have any luck at all the bride s brother will have cut himself severely in several places which will cause him to run crying from the room You can then finish unpacking THE BRIDE S TEA The first function of the pre nuptial festivities is generally a tea at the bride s home where the ushers and bridesmaids meet to become acquainted It is your duty as best man to go to the hotel where the ushers are stopping and bring them to this tea Just as you will leave on this mission the groom will whisper in your ear For God s sake remember to tell them that her father and mother are terribly opposed to drinking in any form This is an awfully good joke on her father and mother As you step out of the hotel elevator you hear at the end of the hall a chorus shouting Mademoiselle from Armentieres parlez vous Those are your ushers Opening the door of the room you step forward and announce Fellows we have got to go to a tea right away Come on let s go At this ten young men in cutaways will stand up and shout Yeaaa the best man give the best man a drink From then on at twelve minute intervals it is your duty to say Fellows we have got to go to a tea right away Come on let s go Each time you will be handed another drink which you may take with either your right or left hand After an hour the telephone will ring It will be the groom He will say Everybody is waiting for you and the ushers to which you reply We are just leaving He then says And don t forget to tell them what I told you about her father and mother You then hang up the receiver take a drink in one hand and say Fellows I have a very solemn message for you It s a message which is of deep importance to each one of us Fellows her father and mother object to the use of alcohol in any form This statement will be greeted with applause and cheers You will all then take one more drink put on your silk hats and gray gloves and leave the room singing Her father and mother object to drink parlez vous The tea given by the bride s parents is generally a small affair to which only the members of the wedding party are invited When you and the ushers arrive you will find the bride the maid of honor and the bridesmaids waiting for you As you enter the room make a polite bow to the bride s father and mother and be sure to apologize for your lateness Nothing so betrays the social oil can as a failure to make a plausible excuse for tardiness Whenever you are late for a party you must always have ready some good reason for your fault such as Excuse me missus Doe I m afraid I am a little late but you see just as I was dressing this filling dropped out of my tooth and I had to have it put back in If the host and hostess seem to doubt your statement it would be well to show them the recalcitrant filling in question although if they are well bred they will probably in most cases take you at your word THE MAID OF HONOR You and the ushers will then be introduced to the bridesmaids and the maid of honor As you meet this latter young lady who is the bride s older sister and of course your partner for the remainder of the wedding festivities she will say The best man Well they say that the best man wins Ha Ha Ha This puts her in class G six without further examination and your only hope of prolonging your life throughout the next two days lies in the frequent and periodic administration of stimulants THE BACHELOR DINNER AND AFTER That evening the groom gives for the best man and the ushers what is known as a bachelor dinner It is his farewell to his men friends as he passes out of the state of bachelorhood The formal passing out generally occurs toward the end of the dinner and is a quaint ceremony participated in by most of those present It is customary for the best man to wake up about noon of the following day You will not have the slightest idea as to where you are or how you got there You will be wearing your dress trousers your stiff or pleated bosom dress shirt black socks and pumps and the coat of your pajamas In one hand you will be clutching a chrysanthemum After a few minutes there will come a low moan from the next bed That is usually the groom also in evening dress with the exception that he has tried to put on the trousers of your pajamas over his dress trousers You then say What happened to which he replies Oh Judas You wait several minutes In the next room you hear the sound of a shower bath and some one whistling The bath stops the whistling continues The door then opens and there enters one of the ushers He is the usher who always feels great the next day after the bachelor dinner He says to you Well boys you look all in You do not reply He continues Gosh I feel fine You make no response He then begins to chuckle I don t suppose you remember he says what you said to the bride s mother when I brought you home last night You sit quickly up in bed What did I say you ask Was I tight Were you tight he replies still chuckling Don t you remember what you said And don t you remember trying to get the bride s father to slide down the banisters with you Were you tight Oh my gosh He then exits chuckling Statistics of several important life insurance companies show that that type of man generally dies a violent death before the age of thirty THE REHEARSAL The rehearsal for the wedding is usually held in the church on the afternoon preceding the day of the nuptials The ushers of course are an hour late which gives the bridegroom Bap an opportunity to meet the minister Epis and have a nice long chat about religion while the best man Atheist talks to the eighty three year old sexton who buried the bride s grandpa and grandma and has knowed little Miss Dorothy come twenty years next Michaelmas The best man s offer of twenty five dollars if the sexton will at once bury the maid of honor is generally refused as a matter of courtesy THE BRIDAL DINNER In the evening the parents of the bride give the bridal dinner to which all the relatives and close friends of the family are invited Toasts are drunk in orange juice and rare old Virginia Dare wine and much good natured fun is indulged in by all Speeches are usually made by the bride and groom their parents the best man the maid of honor the minister and Aunt Harriet Just a word about the speeches at a bridal dinner

none	none	A CHURCH WEDDING On the day of the wedding the ushers should arrange to be at the church an hour or so in advance of the time set for the ceremony They should be dressed in cutaways with ties gloves and gardenias provided by the groom It is the duty of the best man to dress the bridegroom for the wedding As you enter his room you see lying half dressed on the bed a pale wan emaciated creature who is staring fixedly at the ceiling It is the happy bridegroom His lips open He speaks feebly What time is it he says You reply Two thirty old man Time to start getting dressed Oh my God says the groom Ten minutes pass What time is it says the groom Twenty of three you reply Here s your shirt Oh my God says the groom He takes the shirt and tries to put it on You help him Better have a little Scotch old man you say What time is it he replies Five of three you say Oh my God says the groom At three thirty you and he are dressed in cutaways and promptly at three forty two you arrive at the church You are ushered into a little side room where it is your duty to sit with the corpse for the few brief hours which elapse between three forty five and four o clock Occasionally he stirs and a faint spark of life seems to struggle in his sunken eyes His lips move feebly You bend over to catch his dying words Have you got the ring he whispers Yes you reply Everything s fine You look great too old man The sound of the organ reaches your ears The groom groans Have you got the ring he says Meanwhile the ushers have been performing their duty of showing the invited guests to the various pews A correctly trained usher will always have ready some cheery word or sprightly bit of conversation to make the guests feel perfectly at home as he conducts them to their seats It s a nice day isn t it is suggested as a perfectly safe and yet not too unusual topic of conversation This can be varied by remarking Isn t it a nice day or in some cases where you do not wish to appear too forward Is it a nice day or isn t it An usher should also remember that although he has on a cutaway he is neither a floor walker nor a bond salesman and remarks such as Something in a dotted Swiss or Third aisle over second pew next the ribbon goods are decidedly non au fait The first two pews on each side of the center aisle are always reserved for members of the immediate family but it is a firmly established custom that the ushers shall seat in these family pews at least three people with whom the family are barely on speaking terms This slight error always causes Aunt Nellie and Uncle Fred to sit up in the gallery with the family cook With the arrival of the bride the signal is given to the organist to start the wedding march usually either Mendelssohn s or Wagner s About this time the mother of the bride generally discovers that the third candle from the left on the rear altar has not been lighted which causes a delay of some fifteen minutes during which time the organist improvises one hundred and seventy three variations on the opening strains of the march Finally all is adjusted and the procession starts down the aisle led by the ushers swaying slowly side by side It is always customary for three or four of the eight ushers to have absolutely no conception of time or rhythm which adds a quaint touch of uncertainty and often a little humor to the performance After the Scotch mist left by the passing ushers has cleared there come the bridesmaids the maid of honor and then leaning on her father s arm unless of course her father is dead the bride In the meantime the bridegroom has been carried in by the best man and awaits the procession at the foot of the aisle which is usually four hundred and forty yards long The ushers and bridesmaids step awkwardly to one side the groom advances and a hush falls over the congregation which is the signal for the bride s little niece to ask loudly What s that funny looking man going to do Aunt Dotty Then follows the religious ceremony Immediately after the church service a reception is held at the bride s home where refreshments are served and two hundred and forty two invited guests make the same joke about kissing the bride At the reception it is customary for the ushers and the best man to crawl off in separate corners and die The wedding festivities are generally concluded with the disappearance of the bride the bridegroom one of the uninvited guests and four of the most valuable presents CHAPTER THREE THE ETIQUETTE OF TRAVEL The etiquette of travel like that of courtship and marriage has undergone several important changes with the advent of democracy and the mechanical age Time was when travel was indulged in only by the better classes of society and the rules of travellers etiquette were well defined and acknowledged by all But Yankee ingenuity has indeed brought the mountain to Mahomet the iron horse and the Pullman coach have I believe come to stay bringing with them many new customs and manners for the well bred gentleman or lady who would travel correctly Truly the old order changeth and it is perhaps only proper that one should keep if you will pardon the use of the word abreast of the times HINTS FOR THE CORRECT PEDESTRIAN Let us suppose for example that you are a young gentleman of established social position in one of the many cities of our great middle west and it is your desire to travel from your home to New York City for the purpose of viewing the many attractions of that metropolis of which I need perhaps only mention the Aquarium or 
5189_37999_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Grant s Tomb 
none	none	or the Eden Musee Now there are many ways of getting to New York such as a on foot b via rail it should be your first duty to select one of these methods of transportation Walking to New York a above is often rejected because of the time and effort involved and it is undoubtedly true that if one attempted to journey afoot from the middle west one would probably be quite fatigued at the end of one s journey The etiquette of walking however is the same for short as for long distances and I shall at this point give a few of the many rules for correct behavior among pedestrians In the first place it is always customary in a city for a young lady either accompanied or unaccompanied to walk on the sidewalk A young miss who persists in walking in the gutters is more apt to lose than to make friends among the socially worth while Gentlemen either with or without ladies are never seen walking after dark in the sewers or along the elevated tracks It is not au fait for gentlemen or ladies wearing evening dress to catch on behind passing ice wagons trucks et cetera the time and energy saved are doubtfully repaid should one happen to be driven thus past other members of one s particular social set Ladies walking alone on the street after dark do not speak to gentlemen unless they have been previously introduced or are out of work with winter coming on A gentleman walking alone at night when accosted by a young woman whom he has not met socially removes his hat politely bows and passes on unless she looks awfully good Debutantes meeting traffic policemen always bow first in America in the Continental countries with their age old flavor of aristocratic court life this custom is reversed A bachelor accompanied by a young unmarried woman when stepping accidentally into an open coal or sewer hole in the sidewalk removes his hat and gloves as inconspicuously as possible It is never correct for young people of either sex to push older ladies in front of swiftly approaching motor vehicles or street cars A young man if run over by an automobile driven by a strange lady should lie perfectly still unless dead until an introduction can be arranged the person driving the car usually speaks first An unmarried woman if run into and knocked down by a taxicab driven by someone in her own set usually says Why the hell don t you look where you re going to which the taxi driver removing his hat replies Why the hell don t YOU A correct costume for gentlemen walking in the parks or streets of a city either before or after dark consists of shoes two socks two undergarments trousers shirt necktie collar vest coat and hat For pedestrians of the opposite sex the costume is practically the same with the exception of the socks trousers shirt necktie collar vest and coat However many women now affect knickerbockers and vice versa A young lady of good breeding when walking alone should not talk or laugh in a loud boisterous manner Capers e g climbing trees et cetera while good exercise and undoubtedly fashionable in certain speedy circles are of questionable taste for ladies especially if indulged in to excess or while walking with young gentlemen on the Sabbath Sport is sport and no one loves a stiff game of fives or rounders more than I but the spectacle of a young unmarried lady and her escort hanging by their limbs on the Lord s Day from the second or third cross arm of an electric telegraph pole is certainly carrying things a bit too far in my opinion even in this age of golf and lawn tennis A young gentleman escorting a young lady on foot to a formal ball or the opera should walk on the outside especially if they are both in evening dress and have a long distance to go It is never incorrect to suggest the use of a street car or as one gets near the Opera House a carriage or a taxicab A young man walking with a young lady when accosted by a beggar always gives the beggar something unless the young lady is his wife or his sister So much for pedestrians I can not of course pretend to give here all the rules for those who go afoot and I can only say that the safest principle for correct behavior in this as in many social matters is the now famous reply Thomas Edison once made to the stranger who asked him with what he mixed his paints in order to get such marvellous effects One part inspiration replied the great inventor and NINE parts perspiration In other words etiquette is not so much a matter of genius as of steady application to small details TRAVELLING BY RAIL In America much of the travelling is done by rail The etiquette of railroad behavior is extremely complicated especially if one is forced to spend the night en route on the way and many and ludicrous are the mistakes made by those whose social training has apparently fitted them more for a freight car than for an up to date parlor or Pullman coach GOOD FORM ON A STREET CAR Let us first of all however take up some of the simpler forms of rail transportation such as for example the electric street or tram car now to be seen on the main highways and byways of all our larger cities The rules governing behavior on these vehicles often appear at first quite complicated but when one has learned the ropes as they say in the Navy one should have no difficulty An elderly lady with a closed umbrella for example desiring to take a street car should always stand directly under a large sign marked Street Cars Do Not Stop On This Corner As the car approaches she should run quickly out to the car tracks and signal violently to the motorman with the umbrella As the car whizzes past without stopping she should cease signalling remark Well I ll be God damned and return to the curbstone After this performance has been repeated with three successive cars she should then walk slowly out and lie down in a dignified manner across the car tracks In nine cases out of ten the motorman of the next tram will see her lying there and will be gentleman enough to stop his car When this happens the elderly lady should get quietly up from the street and stand outside the door marked Exit Only until the motorman opens it for her She should then enter with the remark I signalled to three cars and not one of them stopped to which the motorman will reply But lady that sign there says they don t stop on this corner The lady should then say What s your number I m going to report you After taking his number she should enter the car At the opposite end of the vehicle there will undoubtedly be three or four vacant seats instead of taking one of these she should stand up in front of some young man and glare at him until he gets up and gives her his place It is not customary in American cities for ladies to thank gentlemen who provide them with seats After a few minutes she should turn to the man at her right and ask Does this car go to Madison Heights He will answer No She should then turn to the man on her left and ask Does this car go to Madison Heights He will answer No Her next question Does this car go to Madison Heights should be addressed to a man across the aisle and the answer will be No She should then listen attentively while the conductor calls out the names of the streets and as he shouts Blawmnoo she should ask the man at her right Did he say Madison Heights He will reply No At the next street the conductor will shout Blawmnoo at which she should ask Did he say Madison Heights Once more the answer will be in the negative The car will proceed the conductor will now call Blawmnoo and as the elderly lady once more says Did he say Madison Heights the man at her left the man at her right the man across the aisle and eight other male passengers will shout YES It is then correct for her to pickup her umbrella and carefully waiting until the conductor has pulled the go ahead signal she should cry Wait a minute conductor I want to get off here The car will then be stopped and she should say Is this Madison Heights to which the conductor will reply This ain t the Madison Heights car lady She should then say But you called out Madison Heights to which he will answer No lady that s eight miles in the opposite direction She should then leave the street car not forgetting however to take the conductor s number again The above hints for tram car etiquette apply of course only to elderly ladies For young men and women the procedure would be in many cases quite different A young married woman for example on entering a street car should always have her ticket or small change so securely buried in the fourth inside pocketbook of her handbag that she cannot possibly find it inside of twelve minutes Three or more middle aged ladies riding together should never decide as to who is to pay the fare until the conductor has gone stark raving mad LISTENING TO A SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA The first thing to do on arriving at a symphony concert is to express the wish that the orchestra will play Beethoven s Fifth If your companion then says Fifth what you are safe with him for the rest of the evening no metal can touch you If however he says So do I this is a danger signal and he may require careful handling The next step is a glance at the program If your escort is quite good looking and worth cultivating the obvious remark is Oh dear not a very interesting program to night But George LOOK at what they are playing next Thursday My I wish If George shies at this it can be tried again later say during an appassionato passage for the violins and cellos As soon as the music starts all your attention should be directed toward discovering someone who is making a noise whispering or coughing having once located such a creature you should immediately sh sh him Should he continue the offence a severe frown must accompany the next sh sh a lorgnette if available adding great effectiveness to the rebuke This will win you the gratitude of your neighbors and serve to establish your position socially as well as musically for perfect sh shers do not come from the lower classes At the conclusion of the first number the proper remark is hmmm accompanied by a slow shake of the head After this you may use any one of a number of remarks as for example Well I suppose Mendelssohn appeals to a great many people or That was meaningless enough to have been written by a Russian This latter is to be preferred for it leads your companion to say But don t you like TschaiKOWsky pronouncing the second syllable as if the composer were a female bull You can then reply Why yes TschaiKOFFsky DID write some rather good music although it s all neurotic and obviously Teutonic Don t fail to stress the v The next number on the program will probably be the soloist say a coloratura soprano Your first remark should be that you don t really care for the human voice the reason being of course that symphonic Music ABSOLUTE music has spoiled you for things like vocal gymnastics This leads your bewildered friend to ask you what sort of soloist you prefer Ans Why a piano concerto of course Ques And who is your favorite pianist Ans Rachmaninoff And then before the boy has time to breathe SHOOT Did you knoow that he has a daughter at Vassar Although not necessary it might be well to finish off the poor fellow at the end of the concert with one or two well placed depth bombs My own particular favorite for this is the following accompanied by a low sigh After all Beethoven IS Beethoven CORRECT BEHAVIOR AT A PIANO RECITAL The same procedure is recommended for the piano or violin recital with the possible addition of certain phrases such as Yes of course she has technique but my dear so has an electric piano This remark gives you a splendid opportunity for sarcasm at the expense of mister Duo Art and other manufacturers of mere mechanical perfection the word soul pronounced with deep feeling as when repeating a fish order to a stupid waiter may be introduced effectively several times The program at these recitals is likely to be more complex than that at a symphony concert This is a distinct advantage for it gives you a splendid opportunity to catch some wretch applauding before the music is really finished Nothing is quite comparable to the satisfaction of smiling knowingly at your neighbors when this faux pas is committed unless it be the joy of being the first to applaud at the REAL conclusion This latter course however is fraught with danger for the beginner the chances for errors in judgment are many and the only sure way to avoid anachronistic applause is to play the safe game and refrain altogether from any expression of approval a procedure which is heartily recommended for the musically ignorant it being also the practise among the majority of the critics IN A BOX AT THE OPERA The opera differs from the symphony concert or piano recital in the same way that the army drill command of At Ease differs from Rest When one of these orders I never could remember which is given to a battalion in formation it signifies that talking is permitted opera of course corresponds to that command Before the invention of the phonograph it was often necessary for the opera goer to pay some attention to the performance at least while certain favorite arias were being sung this handicap to the enjoyment of opera has now fortunately been overcome and one can devote one s entire attention to other more important things safe in one s knowledge that one has Galli Curci at home on the Vic In order really to get the most out of an opera a great deal of study and preparation is required in advance I have not space at this time to cover these preliminaries thoroughly but would recommend to the earnest student such supplemental information as can be obtained from Lady Duff Gordon or Messrs Tiffany Tecla and Pinaud Upon entering one s box the true opera lover at once assumes a musical attitude this should be practised at home by my lady before a mirror until she is absolutely sure that the shoulders and back can be seen from any part of the house Then with the aid of a pair of strong opera glasses she may proceed to scrutinize carefully the occupants of the boxes noting carefully any irregular features Technical phraseology useful in this connection includes unearthly creature stray leopard or simply that person Your two magical formulas the Russian w and the sad story about Rachmaninoff s daughter may of course be held in reserve but the chances are that you will be unable to use them for during an evening at the opera there will probably be no mention of music CHAPTER FIVE ETIQUETTE FOR DRY AGENTS SOME BROADER ASPECTS OF PROHIBITION In spite of the great pride and joy which we Americans feel over the success of National Prohibition in spite of the universal popularity of the act and the method of its enforcement in spite of the fact that it is now almost impossible to obtain in any of our ex saloons anything in the least resembling whiskey or gin there still remains the distressing suspicion that quite possibly at some of the dinner parties and dances of our more socially prominent people liquor or its equivalent is openly being served Dry agents have of course tried on several occasions to verify this suspicion their praiseworthy efforts have met for the most part with scant success The main difficulty has been I believe that the average dry agent is too little versed in the customs and manners of polite society It is lamentably true that too often has a carefully planned society dry raid been spoiled because the host noticed that one of his guests was wearing white socks with a black tie or that the intruder was using his dessert spoon on the hors d oeuvres The solution of this difficulty lies of course in the gradual procuring of a better class of dry agent There are signs though unfortunately in the wrong direction that some of our younger college generation are already casting envious eyes toward the rich rewards the social opportunities and the exciting life of the professional bootlegger It might be well to interest some of these promising youngsters in the no less exciting occupation of National Prohibition Enforcement Officer At present the chief difficulty seems to lie in the fact that in our preparatory schools and colleges a young man acquires a certain code of honor which causes him to look with distaste on what he calls pussyfooting and sneaking People too often forget that in order to make effective such a universally beneficent law any means are justified It will be I hope only a matter of years before this distrust of the sneak will have died out and the Dry Agent will come to be regarded with the reverence and respect due to one who devotes his life to the altruistic investigation of his neighbor s affairs THE COLLEGE GRADUATE AS DRY AGENT Then too many young college men are deterred from becoming Dry Agents by thinking of the comparative scantiness of the monetary rewards This difficulty is only an imaginary one for luckily as soon as a man s code of honor has been elevated to the extent that it permits him to take up a career of pussy footing there is generally eliminated at the same time any objection he might have to what is often called bribery Thus by a fortunate combination of circumstances a Dry Agent is enabled to serve mankind and at the same time greatly increase his own personal fortune But we cannot wait until our college graduates come to regard pussyfooting as a career We must do what we can with the material at our disposal We must in some way educate our present Dry Agents so that they can go to any function in polite society and remain as inconspicuous and as completely disregarded as the host As a first step in such a social training I offer the following suggestions in the hope that before long no function will be complete without the presence of four or five correctly dressed National Prohibition Enforcement Officers ready and eager to arrest the host and hostess and all the guests on the slightest provocation PLANNING A DRY RAID ON A MASQUERADE BALL Let us suppose for example that you are a Dry Agent and that your name is Isador Eisenberg and one day you and your chief are sitting around the Dry Agent s Club and he says to you Izzy I see by the paper that there s a swell society masquerade ball to be given by the younger married set tomorrow night at the Glen Cove Country Club Take your squad to cover it At this point you doubtless say Chief I m afraid I can t use my squad My men have been disguised as trained seals all this week and tomorrow night they are to raid all the actresses dressing rooms at the Hippodrome and then the Chief says Well Izzy you ll have to rent a costume and pull off the raid all by yourself A WORD ABOUT CORRECT COSTUMES Your first concern should be of course your costume If you have a high voice although really there is no reason for supposing that all Dry Agents have high voices you might well attend the masquerade disguised as a lady One of the neatest and on the whole most satisfactory of ladies disguises is that of Cleopatra Cleopatra as you know was once Queen of Egypt and the costume is quite simple and attractive It may be however that you would prefer to appear as a modern rather than an ancient queen A modern Queen if one may judge from the illustrated foreign periodicals always wears a plain suit and carries a tightly rolled umbrella Should you care to attend the masquerade as an allegorical figure say two thousand Years of Progress you might wear the Cleopatra costume and carry the umbrella Or you might go attired as some other less prominent member of the nobility for instance Lady Dartmouth whose delightful costume is more or less featured in the advertising on our better class subways and street cars and can be obtained at a comparatively small cost at any reliable dry goods store Should you however feel that you would be more at ease in a male costume there are several suggestions which might cleverly conceal your real identity You might for example attend the ball as Jurgen a costume which would assure you a pleasurable evening and many pleasing acquaintances You might with equal satisfaction go as an Indian It occurs to me that it might even be a clever move to attend the party dressed as a Dry Agent All suspicion would be instantly lost in the uproar of laughter which would greet your announcement of your disguise many men would probably so far enter into the spirit of the joke as to offer you drinks from their flasks and much valuable evidence could be obtained in this way And the costume is quite easy simply wear a pleated soft bosom dress shirt with your evening dress and tuck the ends of your black tie under your collar GOOD FORM FOR DRY AGENTS DURING A RAID After the costume you should arrange to obtain a mask and a breath The former is of course for the purpose of hiding your identity the latter is essential at any party where you wish to remain inconspicuous A good whisky breath can usually be obtained from a bottle of any of the better known brands of Scotch or Rye whisky by holding a small quantity of the liquor in the mouth for a short period of time It is not of course necessary to swallow the liquor and in this connection I would suggest that you use only the best grade whisky for there are at present being manufactured for domestic consumption several brands which if held in the mouth for a longer interval than say three seconds are apt to eat away the tongue or dissolve several of your more important teeth On the night of the party therefore having donned your Dry Agent costume having put on your mask having secured a good breath you jump into a taxicab and drive to the Glen Cove Country Club And as you enter the door of the club some girl dressed probably as Martha Washington will run up and kiss you This is not because she thinks you are George Washington it is because she drank that eighth Bronx cocktail at dinner And right at this point is where most Dry Agents have displayed their ignorance of the usages of polite society for most of them are wofully ignorant of the correct way to handle such a situation Your average Dry Agent not being accustomed to the ways of Younger Marrieds is often confused upon being unexpectedly kissed and in his confusion betrays his unfortunate lack of social training The correct way to meet the above situation is based on the fundamental rule of all social etiquette common sense Return the lady s kiss in an easy natural manner and pass on If she follows you lead her at once to a quiet unoccupied corner of the club and knock her over the head with a chair or some other convenient implement It has been found that this is the only effective way to deal with this type of woman and it is really only a kindness to her and her husband to keep her from embarrassing you with her attentions during the rest of the evening After you have removed your coat you should go to the ball room where you will find the dance in full swing full being of course used in its common or alcoholic sense Take your place in the stag line and don t under any circumstances allow anyone to induce you to cut in on any of the dancers In the first place you won t be able to dance because Dry Agents like Englishmen never can secondly if you TRY to dance you are taking the enormous chance especially at a masquerade that the man who introduced you to your partner will disappear for the rest of the evening leaving you with Somebody s Albatross hanging around your neck And of all Albatrosses the married one is perhaps farthest South especially if she happens to be a little tight and wants to talk about her husband and children Your policy therefore should be one of complete non partisanship If you do not dance do not let yourself be drawn into conversation and do not above all things show any consideration for the host or hostess By closely observing the actions of the men and women about you by wandering down into the club bar by peeking into the automobiles parked outside the club you will probably be able to obtain sufficient evidence of the presence of alcohol to justify a raid And then when you have raided the Glen Cove Country Club you can turn your attention to the twelve million six hundred thirty five thousand four hundred thirty nine other clubs and private houses where the same thing is going on And if mister Volstead has a dress suit you might take him with you and show him just how beautifully Prohibition is working and how enthusiastic the better classes of American society are about it CHAPTER SIX A CHAPTER FOR SCHOOLGIRLS Every Fall a larger number of young girls leave home to come East to the various Finishing Schools in this section of the country For the benefit of those who are making this trip for the first time we outline a few of the more important points in connection with the preliminaries to the trip East together with minute instructions as to the journey itself SELECTING A PROPER SCHOOL 
5189_37999_000003_000000	train-clean-360	This is of course mainly a parent s problem and is best solved by resorting to the following formula Let A and B represent two young girls finishing schools in the East

none	none	Eheu fugaces CHAPTER SEVEN THE ETIQUETTE OF GAMES AND SPORTS GOLF AS A PASTIME Golf from an old Scottish word meaning golf is becoming increasingly popular in the United States and almost every city now has at least one private club devoted to the pursuit of this stylish pastime Indeed in many of our larger metropolises the popular enthusiasm has reached such heights that free public courses have been provided for the citizens with I may say somewhat laughable results as witness the fact that I myself have often seen persons playing on these public courses in ordinary shirts and trousers tennis shoes and SUSPENDERS The influence of this democratization on the etiquette of what was once an exclusive sport has been in many instances deplorable and I am sure that our golf playing forefathers would turn over in their graves were they to play around today on one of the public courses In no pastime are the customs and unwritten laws more clearly defined and it is essential that the young lady or gentleman of fashion who contemplates an afternoon on the links devote considerable time and attention to the various niceties of the etiquette of this ancient and honorable game A young man for example when playing with his employer should always take pains to let his employer win This is sometimes extremely difficult but with practice even the most stubborn of obstacles can be overcome On the first tee for instance after the employer having swung and missed the ball completely one or two times has managed to drive a distance of some forty nine yards to the extreme right the young man should take care to miss the ball completely THREE times and then drive forty eight yards to the extreme left This is generally done by closing the eyes tightly and rising up sharply on both toes just before hitting the ball On the greens it is customary for a young man to concede his employer every putt which is within twenty feet of the hole If the employer insists on putting Ed note He won t and misses the young man should take care to miss his own putt After both have holed out the young man should ask how many strokes sir The employer will reply Let me see I think I took seven for this hole didn t I A well bred young man will not under any circumstances remind his employer that he saw him use at least three strokes for the drive three strokes for his second shot four strokes in the rough seven strokes in the bunker and three putts on the green but will at once reply No sir I think you only took six altogether The employer will then say Well well call it six I generally get five on this hole What did you take The young man should then laugh cheerily and reply Oh I took my customary seven To which the employer will sympathetically say Too bad After the employer has thus won his first three holes he will begin to offer the young man advice on how to improve his game This is perhaps the most trying part of the afternoon s sport but a young man of correct breeding and good taste will always remember the respect due an older man and will not make the vulgar error of telling his employer for God s sake shut up before he gets a brassie in his ear A wife playing with her husband should do everything in her power to make the game enjoyable for the latter She should encourage him when possible with little cheering proverbs such as If at first you don t succeed try try again and she should aid him with her advice when she thinks he is in need of it Thus when he drives into the sycamore tree on number eleven she should say Don t you think dear that if you aimed a little bit more to the right et cetera When they come to number fourteen and his second shot lands in the middle of the lake she should remark Perhaps you didn t hit it hard enough dear And when on the eighteenth his approach goes through the second story window of the club house she should say Dear I wonder if you didn t hit that too hard Such a wife is a true helpmate and not merely a pretty ornament on which a silly husband can hang expensive clothes and if he is the right sort of man he will appreciate this and refrain from striking her with a niblick after this last remark A young wife who does not play the game herself can nevertheless be of great help to her husband by listening patiently night after night while he tells her how he drove the green on number three and took a four on number eight Par five and came up to the fourteenth one under fours Caddies should be treated at all times with the respect and pity due one s fellow creatures who are unfortunate The sins of the fathers are visited upon the children and one should always remember that it is not after all the poor caddy s fault that he was born blind AN AFTERNOON AT THE OLD FARM WITH THE DICE Craps is a game played with dice which is often popular in the men s coat and smoking rooms before and during formal receptions balls recitals etcetera It should not be imagined however that craps is a sport for men only on the contrary smart women are enthusiastically taking up this sport in numerous localities and many an affair which started as a dinner party or a musicale has ended in a crap game with all the guests seated in an excited circle on the floor contributing to the host s efforts to make expenses for the evening It is in connection with these mixed games however that most of the more serious questions of craps etiquette arise If for example you are a young man desirous of shooting craps with your grandmother the correct way of indicating your desire when you meet the old lady in a public place is for you to remove your hat deferentially and say Shoot a nickel Grandmother If she wishes to play she will reply Shoot boy and you should then select some spot suitable for the game and assist her if she wishes your aid to kneel on the ground It might be an added mark of gentility to offer her your handkerchief or coat upon which to rest her knees You should then take out the dice and shoot Your grandmother will look at your throw and say Oh boy He fives he fives a three and a two never make a five come on you baby seven You should then take up the dice again and shake them in your right hand while your grandmother chants A four and a three a four and a two dicety dice and an old black joe come on you SEVEN You should then again shoot This time as you have thrown a six and a one your grandmother will then exclaim He sevens the boy sevens come on to grandmother dice talk to the nice old lady Phoebe for grandma dice for grandpa needs a new pair of shoes shoot a dime She will then throw and so the game will go on until the old lady evidences a desire to stop or possibly until either you or she are cleaned out In this latter case however it would be a customary act of courtesy towards an older person for you to offer to shoot your grandmother for her shawl or her side combs thus giving her several more chances to win back the money she has lost It should be recommended that young men never make a mistake in going a little out of their way on occasion to make life more pleasant and agreeable for the aged CORRECT BEHAVIOR ON A PICNIC There often comes a time in the life of the members of society when they grow a little weary of the ceaseless round of teas balls and dinners and for such I would not hesitate to recommend a picnic A day spent in the open with the blue sky over one s head is indeed a splendid tonic for jaded nerves But one should not make the mistake of thinking that because he or she is roughing it for a day he or she can therefore leave behind his or her manners for such is not the case There is a distinct etiquette for picnics and any one who disregards this fact is apt to find to his or her sorrow that the shoe in this case is decidedly on the other foot A young man for example is often asked by a young lady to accompany her on a family picnic To this invitation he should after some consideration reply either Yes or No and if the former he should present himself at the young lady s house promptly on the day set for the affair usually Sunday A family picnic generally consists of a Buick a father a mother a daughter a small son beef loaf lettuce sandwiches a young man you two blow outs one spare tire and Aunt Florence The father drives with his small boy beside him in the rear are the mother the daughter Aunt Florence the thermos bottles the lunch baskets and you As you take your seat you must remember that it is a distinct evidence of bad breeding to show in any way that you are conscious of the fact that the car has been standing for the last hour and forty four minutes in the hot July sun We re off cries father pressing his foot on the self starting pedal Thirty minutes later you roll away from the curb and the picnic has begun The intervening time has of course been profitably spent by you in walking to the nearest garage for two new sparkplugs It should be your duty as guest to see that the conversation in the rear seat is not allowed to lag It s a great day you remark as the car speeds along I think it s going to rain replies Aunt Florence Not too fast Will says mother Mother says the daughter Ten minutes later you should again remark My what a wonderful day Those clouds are gathering in the west says Aunt Florence I think we had better put the top up I think this is the wrong road says mother Dear I know what I m doing replies father The secret of good conversation lies in discovering the hobby of the person with whom one is conversing and a good talker always throws out several feelers in order to find out the things in which his partner is most interested You should therefore next say to mother Don t you think this is a glorious day for a picnic to which she will reply Well I m sure this is the wrong road Hadn t you better ask The husband will answer nothing but Aunt Florence will murmur I think I felt a drop of rain Will If you don t put the top up now we ll all be drenched The husband will then stop the car and you and he will proceed to put up the top In doing this it is customary for the guest to get the second and third fingers of his right hand so severely pinched that he can not use the hand for several days As soon as the top is up and the rain curtains are in place the sun will come out and you can at once get out and put the top down taking care this time to ruin two fingers of the LEFT hand No good conversationalist confines himself exclusively to one subject and when you are once more under way you should remark to the mother I think that motoring is great fun don t you missus Caldwell Her answer will be I wish you wouldn t drive so fast You should then smile and say to Aunt Florence Don t YOU think that motoring is great fun missus Lockwood As she is about to reply the left rear tire will blow out with a loud noise and the car will come to a bumping stop The etiquette of changing a tire is fairly simple As soon as the puncture occurs one should at once remark Is there anything I can do This request should be repeated from time to time always taking care however that no one takes it at all seriously The real duty of a young man who is a guest on a motor trip on which a blow out occurs is of course to keep the ladies of the party amused during the delay This can be accomplished by any of the conventional methods such as card tricks handsprings and other feats of athletic agility or making funny jokes about the host who is at work on the tire When the damage has been repaired and the car is once more speeding along leaving behind it mile after mile of dusty road as well as father s best jack and set of tire tools the small boy will suddenly remark I m hungry His father will then reply We ll be at a fine place to eat in ten minutes Thirty minutes later mother will remark Will that looks like a good place for a picnic over there The father will reply No we re coming to a wonderful place just trust me Mary Twenty minutes later Aunt Florence will say Will I think that grove over there would be fine for our lunch to which the husband will reply We re almost at the place I know about it s ideal for a picnic Forty minutes after this father will stop the car and point to a clump of trees There he will say what do you think of that Oh we can t eat THERE will be the answer of mother daughter and Aunt Florence Drive on a bit further I think I know a place Three hours and thirty minutes later i e four hours past your normal lunch hour there will be another puncture and as the car stops beside a wheat field it will begin to rain and the daughter will sigh Well we might as well eat here The picnic will then be held in the car and nothing really quite carries one back to nature and primeval man as does warm lemonade and a lettuce sandwich in a Buick with the top up and side curtains on After lunch it will be time to return home and after you and father have ruined your clothes in repairing the punctures the merry party will proceed on its way The next morning if you have not caught pneumonia you will be able to go to your work greatly refreshed by your day s outing in the lap of old Mother Nature BOXING IN AMERICAN SOCIETY Although many of America s foremost boxers have been persons whom one would not care to know socially yet much fun and pleasure can be had out of the manly art if practised in a gentlemanly manner Boxing parties are generally held in the evening The ballroom of one s home can be pleasantly decorated for the occasion with a square ring roped off in the centre surrounded by seats for the ladies and gentlemen who come as invited guests Evening dress is usually worn The contests should be between various members of one s social set who are fond of the sport and can be counted on to remember at all times that they are gentlemen The matches should be arranged in tournament form so that the winner of one bout meets the winner of the next bout et cetera until all but two have been eliminated The boxer who wins this final contest shall be proclaimed the champion Great fun can then be had by announcing that the champion will be permitted to box three rounds with a masked marvel The identity of this unknown who is usually Jack Dempsey or some other noted professional pugilist should be kept carefully secret so that all the guests are in a glow of mystified excitement when the contest begins and you can imagine their delight and happy enthusiasm when the masked marvel cleverly knocks the champion for a double loop through the ropes into the lap of some tittering dowager Refreshments should then be served and the champion can be carried home in a car or ambulance provided by the thoughtful host BRIDGE WHIST Bridge whist or Bridge as it is often called by the younger generation is rapidly replacing whist as the favorite card game of good society and bridge parties are much en vogue for both afternoon and evening entertainments In order to become an expert bridge player one must of course spend many months and even years in a study of the game but any gentleman or lady of average intelligence can I believe pick up the fundamentals of bridge in a short while Let us suppose for example that you as a young man about town are invited to play bridge on the evening of Friday November seventeenth at the home of missus Franklin Gregory Now although you may have played the game only once or twice in your life it would never do to admit the fact for in good society one is supposed to play bridge just as one is supposed to hate newspaper publicity and on the evening of Friday November seventeenth you should present yourself in suitable attire at missus Gregory s home There you will find fifteen or twenty other guests and after a few minutes of light social banter a bell will ring and the players will take their places At your table will be missus F Jamison Dollings your partner and mister and missus Theodore Watts missus Dollings Sept six eighteen eighty is considered one of the most expert bridge players in the city while mister Watts has one of the largest retail clothing stores in the central part of the State missus Watts was one of the Van Cortlandt girls the plain one As you are probably next to mister and missus Watts the worst bridge player in the room it should be your duty to make up for this deficiency by keeping the other three players conversationally stimulated for nothing so enlivens a game of bridge as a young man or woman with a pleasing personality and a gift for small talk Thus at the very beginning after you have finished dealing the cards you should fill in what seems to you an embarrassing pause by telling one of your cleverest stories at the conclusion of which missus Dollings will remark We are waiting for your bid mister S The etiquette of bidding as far as you are concerned should resolve itself into a consistent effort on your part to become dummy for each and every game The minute your partner missus Dollings bids anything it should be your duty as a gentleman to see that she gets it no matter what the cost Thus on the first hand you pass mister Watts then says Wait a minute till I get these cards fixed to which missus Watts replies Theodore for Heaven s sake how long do you want mister Watts then says Which is higher clubs or hearts to which missus Watts replies Clubs missus Dollings then says I beg your pardon but hearts have always been considered higher than clubs missus Watts says Oh yes of course and gives mister Watts a mean look mister Watts then says I bid let s see I bid two spades no two diamonds missus Dollings quickly says Two lilies mister Watts says What s a lily to which missus Watts replies Theodore and then bids Two spades at which missus Dollings says I beg your pardon but I have just bid two spades mister Watts then chuckles and missus Watts says but not to mister Watts I beg your pardon missus Watts then bids Three spades at which you quickly say Four spades This bid is not raised missus Dollings then says to you I am counting on your spades to help me out at which you look at the only spade in your hand the three and answer Ha Ha Ha There is then a wait of four minutes at the end of which missus Dollings wearily says It is your first lead is it not missus Watts missus Watts then blushes says Oh I beg your pardon and leads the four of hearts You then lay down your dummy hand Before missus Dollings has had time to discover just what you have done to her you should rise quickly and say Excuse me but I want to use the telephone a minute You should then go into the next room and wait ten or fifteen minutes When you return missus Dollings will have disappeared missus Watts will be looking fixedly at mister Watts and mister Watts will be saying Well it s a silly game anyway You and mister and missus Watts can then have a nice game of twenty five cent limit stud poker for the rest of the evening and it would certainly be considered a thoughtful and gracious gesture if during the next two or three weeks you should call occasionally at the hospital to see how missus Dollings is getting on or you might even send some flowers or a nice potted plant FORMAL AND INFORMAL DRINKING Drinking has of course always been a popular sport among the members of the better classes of society but never has the enthusiasm for this pastime been so great in America as since the advent of prohibition Gentlemen and ladies who never before cared much for drinking have now given up almost all other amusements in favor of this fascinating sport young men and debutantes have become in the last few years fully as expert in the game as their parents In many cities drinking has become more popular than bridge or dancing and it is predicted that with a few more years of prohibition drinking will supersede golf and baseball as the great American pastime The effect of this has been to change radically many of the fundamental rules of the sport and the influence on the etiquette of the game has been no less marked What was considered good form in this pastime among our forefathers now decidedly demode and the correct drinker of nineteen ten is as obsolete and out of date in the present decade as the frock coat The game today is divided into a formal and b informal drinking Formal drinking is usually played after dinner and is more and more coming to take the place of charades sleight of hand performances magic lantern shows dumb crambo et cetera as the parlor amusement par excellence Formal drinking can be played by from one to fifteen people in a house of ordinary dimensions for a larger number it is generally better to provide a garage a large yard and special police fire and plate glass insurance The game is played with glasses ice and a dozen bottles of either whisky or gin The sport is begun by the host s wife who says How would you all like to play a little bridge This is followed by silence Another wife then says I think it would be awfully nice to play a little bridge One of the men players then steps forward and says I think it would be awfully nice to have a little drink An It is then selected always by courtesy the host The It then says How would you all like to have a little drink The men players then answer in the affirmative and the It s wife says Now Henry dear please remember what happened last time The It replies Yes dear and goes into the cellar while the It s wife after providing each guest with a glass puts away the Dresden china clock the porcelain parrot and the gold fish globe Sides are chosen usually with the husbands on one team and the wives on the other The purpose of the game is for the husbands team to try to drink up all the It s liquor before the wives team can get them to go home When the It returns with the liquor he pours out a portion for each player and at a given signal all drink steadily for several minutes The It s wife then says Now how about a few rubbers of bridge She is immediately elected team captain for the rest of the evening It is the duty of the team captain to provide cracked ice and water to get ready the two spare bedrooms to hold Wallie Spencer s hand to keep Eddie Armstrong from putting his lighted cigaret ends on the piano and to break up the party as soon as possible The game generally ends when one the liquor is all gone two the It or three guests have passed out three Wallie Spencer starts telling about his war experiences Informal drinking needs of course no such elaborate preparations and can be played anywhere and any time there is anything to drink The person who is caught with the liquor is It and the object of the game is to take all the liquor away from the It as soon as possible In order to avoid being It many players sometimes resort to various low subterfuges such as sneaking down alone to the club locker room during a dance but this practise is generally looked upon with great disfavor especially by that increasingly large group of citizens who are unselfishly devoting their lives to the cause of a dry America by consuming all of the present rapidly diminishing visible supply A JOLLY HALLOWE EN PARTY The problem of providing suitable entertainment for one s informal parties is something which has perplexed many a host and hostess in recent years How often has it happened that just when you had gotten your guests nicely seated around the parlor listening to the Caruso record some ill mannered fellow would remark Oh Lord let s go over to the Tom Phillips and get something to drink How many times in the past have you prepared original little get together games such as Carol Kennicott did in Main Street only to find that when you again turned the lights on half the company had disappeared for the evening Of course we cannot all be as startlingly clever as Carol but Hallowe en which comes this year on October thirty first offers a splendid opportunity for originality and peppy fun The following suggestions are presented to ambitious hostesses with the absolute guaranty that no matter what other reactions her guests may have they will certainly not be bored INVITATIONS The whole spirit of Hallowe en is of course one of spooky gayety and light hearted ghastliness Witches and ghosts run riot corpses dance and black cats howl More work for the undertaker should be the leitmotif of the evening s fun The moribund spirit can be delightfully observed first of all in the preparation of the invitations I know of one hostess for instance who gained a great reputation for originality by enclosing a dead fish with each bidding to the evening s gayeties It is of course not at all necessary to follow her example to the letter the enclosure of anything dead will suffice providing of course that it is not TOO dead There is such a thing as carrying a joke beyond the limits of propriety and the canons of good taste should always be respectfully observed Another amusing way of preparing invitations is to cut out colored paper in the shape of cats witches et cetera upon which appropriate verses are inscribed Such as Next Monday night is Hallowe en You big stiff or On Monday next comes All Hallows Even My grandmother s maiden name was Stephens or On Hallowe en you may see a witch If you don t look out you funny fellow or Harry and I are giving a Hallowe en party Harry says you owe him four dollars please be prompt or Monday night the ghosts do dance Why didn t you enlist and go to France You slacker Another novel invitation is made by cutting a piece of yellow paper thirteen inches long and four inches wide and writing on each inch one of the lines given below Then begin at the bottom and fold the paper up inch by inch Fasten the last turn down with a spooky gummed sticker and slip into a small envelope When the recipient unfolds the invitation he will be surprised to read the following Now what on earth do you suppose is in this little folder keep turning ha ha ha further ha ha ha further ha ha ha further ha ha ha further It would perhaps be best to telephone the next day to those guests whom you really want and give them further details as to the date and time of the party Additional fun can be gotten out of this invitation by failing to put postage stamps on the envelopes when you mail them the two cents which each guest will have to pay for postage due can be returned in a novel manner on the night of the party by inserting them in sandwiches or stuffed tomatoes For those who may wish to send out more elaborate invitations the following distinctly original plan is suggested Procure a number of small alarm clocks and a quantity of nitroglycerine or other high explosive Insert in each clock a small amount of the nitroglycerine being careful not to put too much a quantity sufficient to wreck a room twenty X thirty Will generally suffice Then arrange the alarm mechanism so that the explosion will occur at twelve midnight Attach to the clock a card neatly decorated with witches goblins et cetera on which is written Midnight is the mystic hour Of yawning graves and coffins dour Beneath your bed this clock please hide And when it strikes you ll be surprised These clocks should then be delivered in the afternoon to those of the guests whom you are merely inviting because they are your husband s business associates or because they were nice to your mother when she did her own work Later on in order to avoid hard feelings on the part of relatives and friends of the deceased it might be well to explain to them that you sent the clocks only in the spirit of Hallowe en fun it might even help to invite them to one of your next parties RECEIVING THE GUESTS On Hallowe en night great care should be taken in the preparations for receiving the guests in a mystic manner no pains should be spared in the effort to start the evening off with a bang Several novel ideas are offered for starting the guests off on the right informal spirit Before they arrive it is a good plan to take the street number off your house and fasten it to the porch of your next door neighbors who will of course be at home because they are perfectly impossible people whom no one would invite anywhere Extinguish all the lights in your own house your neighbor as he comes downstairs twenty five or thirty times in the next hour will obligingly tell your bewildered friends specifically where to go When the guest finally learns from the neighborhood policeman which house on the block is really yours he will discover on your door a sign reading If you would be my Valentine Follow please the bright green line Leading from the door is a green cord which the mystified guest proceeds to follow according to directions This cord should guide the way to the coal cellar of your other neighbor who has recently purchased an automatic revolver under the delusion that burglars are operating in the neighborhood As your bewildered guest gropes his way about the cellar it is quite likely that he will be shot at several times and by the time he emerges if he does emerge he will be quite delightfully full of the informal spirit of Hallowe en and ready for anything HOW TO MYSTIFY At this point your wife dressed as a witch should unexpectedly rush out at him there is always the delightful possibility that he will pick up a convenient rock and brain her on the spot an event which often adds an unexpected touch of gayety to the evening s fun If however no such event occurs the guest should be blindfolded and led into the house Once inside he is conducted upstairs to the attic where he will find three or four earlier arrivals also blindfolded The hands and feet of these four are then securely tied and they are told that they are to be left there all evening This is really a great joke because they do not of course at the time believe what you say and when you come up to untie them the next morning their shame faced discomposure is truly laughable The green cord into neighbor s coal cellar joke can be cleverly varied by taking the lid off your cistern and making the green line lead in that direction Great care should be taken however to keep an exact account of the number of guests who succumb to this trick for although an unexpected ducking is excruciatingly humorous drowning often results fatally Great fun can be added to the evening s entertainment by dressing several of the guests as ghosts witches corpses et cetera these costumes can be quite simply and economically made in the home or can be procured from some reliable department store An old fashioned witch s costume consists of a union suit Munsing or any other standard brand corset brassiere chemise underpetticoat overpetticoat long black skirt long black stockings shoes black waist and shawl with a pointed witch s hat and a broomstick The modern witch s costume is much simpler and inexpensive in many details A particularly novel and hair raising effect may be produced by painting the entire body of one of the male guests with phosphorus As this glowing nude stalks uncannily through the darkened rooms you may easily imagine the ghastly effect especially upon his wife GAMES After the guests have sufficiently amused themselves with the ghosts and witches it will be time to commence some of the many games which are always associated with Hallowe en Bobbing for apples is of course the most common of these games and great sport it is too to watch the awkward efforts of the guests as they try to pick up with their teeth the apples floating in a large tub I know of one hostess who added greatly to the evening s fun by pouring twelve quarts of gin into the tub the effect on the bobbers was of course extremely comical except for the unfortunate conduct of two gentlemen one of whom went to sleep in the tub the other so far forgetting himself as playfully to throw all the floating fruit at the hostess pet Pomeranian Most Hallowe en games concern themselves with delving into the future in the hopes that one may there discover one s husband or bride to be In one of these games the men stand at one end of the room facing the girls with their hands behind their backs and eyes tightly closed The girls are blindfolded and one by one they are led to within six feet of the expectant men and given a soft pin cushion which they hurl forward The tradition is that whichever man the girl hits him will she marry Great fun can be added to the game by occasionally substituting a rock or iron dumb bell in place of the romantic pin cushion Another game based on a delightful old Hallowe en tradition is as follows A girl is given a lighted candle and told to walk upstairs into the room at the end of the hall where by looking in a mirror she will see her future husband Have it arranged so that you are concealed alone in the room When the girl arrives look over her shoulder into the mirror She had better go downstairs after ten minutes though so that another girl can come up This tradition dates from before William the Conqueror No Hallowe en is complete of course without fortune telling Dress yourself as a wizard and have the guests led in one by one to hear their fortune told Hanging in front of you should be a caldron from which you extract the slip of paper containing the particular fortune These slips of paper should be prepared beforehand The following are suggested You will meet a well dressed good looking man who understands you better than your husband How about Thursday at the Plaza You are about to receive a shipment of Scotch whisky that you ordered last month And it s about time you kicked across with some of your own You will have much trouble in your life if you lie about your golf score as you did last Sunday on Number twelve Still another pleasing Hallowe en game based on the revelation of one s matrimonial future is played as follows Seven lighted candles are placed in a row on a table The men are then blindfolded whirled around three times and commanded to blow out the candles The number extinguished at a blow tells the number of years before they meet their bride This game only grows interesting of course when some old goat with long whiskers can be induced to take a blind shot at blowing out the candles Have Pyrene convenient but not too convenient to spoil the fun For the older members of the party the host should provide various games of cards and dice In keeping with the ghastly spirit of the occasion it would be well to have the dice carefully loaded Many hosts have thus been able to make all expenses and often a handsome profit out of the evening s entertainment If the crap game goes particularly well many hosts do not hesitate to provide elaborate refreshments for the guests Here too the spirit of fun and jollity should prevail and great merriment is always provoked by the ludicrous expression of the guest who has broken two teeth on the cast iron olive Other delightful surprises should be arranged and a little Sloan s liniment in the punch or ground glass in the ice cream will go a long way toward making the supper amusing And finally when the guests are ready to depart and just before they discover that you have cut cute little black cats and witches out of the backs of their evening wraps and over coats it would perhaps be well to run up stairs and lock yourself securely in your room CHAPTER EIGHT CORRESPONDENCE AND INVITATIONS CORRESPONDENCE It is narrated of a well known English lady who is noted on the other side of the Atlantic for the sharpness of her wit that on one occasion when a vainglorious American was boasting of his country s prowess in digging the Panama Canal she calmly waited until he had finished and then replied with an indescribable smile Ah but you Americans do not know how to write letters Needless to say the discomfited young man took himself off at the earliest opportunity There is much truth alas in the English lady s clever retort for the automatic typewriter the telegraph and the penny postal card have done much to cause a gradual decline in the gentle art of correspondence As one American woman recently remarked to a visitor with more wit however than good taste Yes we do have correspondents here but they are all in the divorce courts CORRESPONDENCE FOR YOUNG LADIES There are certain rules in regard to correct letter writing which must be followed by all who would take their pen in hand Young people are the most apt to offend in this respect against the accepted canons of good taste and it is to these that I would first address the contents of this chapter A young girl often lets her high spirits run away with her amour propre with the result that her letters especially those addressed to strangers are often lacking in that dignity which is the sine qua non of correct correspondence Consider for example the following two letters composed by Miss Florence a debutante of New York City who is writing to a taxidermist thanking him for his neat work in having recently stuffed her deceased pet Alice The first of these letters illustrates the evil to which I have just referred viz the complete absence of proper dignity The second written with the aid of her mama whose experience in social affairs has been considerable shows the correct method of corresponding with comparative strangers An Incorrect Letter from a Debutante to a Taxidermist Thanking Him for Having Stuffed Her Pet Alice DEAR mister Epps Aren t you an old PEACH to have gone and stuffed Alice so prettily Really mister Epps I never saw such a knockout piece of taxidermy even in Europe and I simply adore it Mother gave a dinner party last night and EVERYBODY was just wild about it and wanted to know who had done it How on EARTH did you manage to get the wings to stay like that And the eyes are just too priceless for words Honestly every time I look at it it s so DARNED natural that I can t believe Alice is really dead I guess you must be pretty dog goned crazy about birds yourself to have done such a lovely job on Alice and I guess you know how perfectly sick I was over her death Honestly mister Epps she was such a PEACH of an owl But I suppose it had to be and anyway thanks just heaps for having done such a really perfectly gorgeous bit of taxidermy Gratefully FLORENCE CHASE five hundred ninety three Fifth Avenue New York City The above is you observe quite lacking in that reserve with which young ladies should always treat strange gentlemen and especially those who are not in their own social set Slang may be excusable in shop girls or baseball players but never in the mouth of a young lady with any pretensions to breeding And the use of darned and dog goned is simply unpardonable Notice now the way in which Miss Florence writes the letter after her mama has given her the proper instruction A Correct Letter from a Debutante to a Taxidermist Thanking Him for Having Stuffed Her Pet Alice mister Lloyd Epps Taxidermist New York City DEAR SIR It is with sincere pleasure that I take my pen in hand to compliment you upon the successful manner in which you have rendered your services as taxidermist upon my late owl Alice Death in the animal kingdom is all too often regarded with an unbecoming levity or at least a careless lack of sympathetic appreciation and it is with genuine feelings of gratitude that I pen these lines upon the occasion of the receipt of the sample of the excellent manner in which you have performed your task Of the same opinion is my father a vice president of the Guaranty Trust company and himself a taxidermist of no inconsiderable merit who joins me in expressing to you our most grateful appreciation Sincerely yours FLORENCE ELIOT CHASE December eleven nineteen twenty two COLLEGE BOYS It is the tendency of the age to excuse many social errors in young people and especially is this true of the mischievous pranks of college boys If Harvard football heroes and their rooters for example wish to let their hair grow long and wear high turtle necked red sweaters corduroy trousers and huge frat pins I for one can see no grave objection for boys will be boys and I am I hope no old fogy in such matters But I also see no reason why these same young fellows should not be interested in the graces of the salon and the arts of the drawing room Consider for example the following two letters illustrating the correct and incorrect method in which two young college men should correspond and tell me if there is not some place in our college curriculum for a Professor of Deportment An Incorrect Letter from a Princeton Student to a Yale Student Congratulating the Latter on His Football Victory DEAR MIKE Here s your damn money I was a fool to give you odds ED P S What happened at the Nass I woke up Sunday with a terrific welt on my forehead and somebody s hat with the initials L G T also a Brooks coat Do you know whose they are P P S Please for God s sake don t cash this check until the fifteenth or I m ruined And here is the way in which I would suggest that this same letter be indited A Correct Letter from a Princeton Student to a Yale Student Congratulating the Latter on His Football Victory MY DEAR FRIENDLY ENEMY Well well it was a jolly game wasn t it and it was so good to see you in Old Nassau I am sorry that you could not have come earlier in the fall when the trees were still bronze and gold I also regret exceedingly that you did not stay over until Sunday for it would have been such a treat to have taken you to see the Graduate School buildings and the Cleveland Memorial Tower However better luck next time The enclosed check is as you may well guess in payment of our wager on the result of the gridiron contest Truly I am almost glad that I lost for I can not but think that gambling in any form is at best an unprofitable diversion and this has taught me I hope a lesson from which I may well benefit Do not think me a prig dear Harry I beg of you for I am sure that you will agree with me that even a seemingly innocent wager on a football match may lead in later life to a taste for gambling with dice and cards or even worse Shall we not agree to make this our last wager or at least next time let us not lend it the appearance of professional gambling by giving odds such as I gave you this year You must have thought it frightfully rude of me not to have seen you to the train after that enjoyable evening at the Nassau Inn but to tell you the truth Harry the nervous excitement of the day proved too much for me and I was forced to retire My indisposition was further accentuated by a slight mishap which befell me outside the Inn but which need cause you no alarm as a scalp wound was the only result and a few days rest in my cozy dormitory room will soon set matters to rights I trust however that you will explain to your friends the cause of my sudden departure and my seeming inhospitality Such jolly fellows they were and I am only too glad to find that the bulldogs are as thoroughly nice as the chaps we have down here Incidentally I discovered somewhat to my dismay as you may well imagine that in taking my departure I inadvertently walked off with the hat and overcoat of one of your friends whose initials are L G T I am mortified beyond words and shall send the garments to you by the next post with my deepest apologies to the unlucky owner Rest assured Harry my friend that I am looking forward to visiting you some time in the near future for I have always been curious to observe the many interesting sights of Eli land Particularly anxious am I to see the beautiful trees which have given New Haven its name of the City of Elms and the collection of primitive paintings for which your college is justly celebrated And in closing may I make the slight request that you postpone the cashing of my enclosed check until the fifteenth of this month as due to some slight misunderstanding I find that my account is in the unfortunate condition of being overdrawn Believe me Harry with kindest regards to your nice friends and yourself and with congratulations on the well deserved victory of your eleven Your devoted friend and well wisher EDWARD ELLIS COCHRAN LETTERS TO PARENTS Of course when young people write to the members of their immediate family it is not necessary that they employ such reserve as in correspondence with friends The following letter well illustrates the change in tone which is permissible in such intimate correspondence A Correct Letter from a Young Lady in Boarding School to Her Parents DEAR MOTHER Of course I am terribly glad that you and father are thinking of coming to visit me here at school next week but don t you think it would be better if instead of your coming all the way up here I should come down and stay with you in New York The railroad trip up here will be very hard on you as the trains are usually late and the porters and conductors are notorious for their gruffness and it is awfully hard to get parlor car seats and you know what sitting in a day coach means I should love to have you come only I wouldn t want you or father to get some terrible sickness on the train and last month there were at least three wrecks on that road with many fatalities and when you get here the accommodations aren t very good for outsiders many of the guests having been severely poisoned only last year by eating ripe olives and the beds they say are extremely hard Don t you really think it would be ever so much nicer if you and father stayed in some comfortable hotel in New York with all the conveniences in the world and there are some wonderful things at the theaters which you really ought to see I could probably get permission from Miss Spencer to come and visit you over Saturday and Sunday if you are stopping at one of the five hotels on her permitted list However if you do decide to come here perhaps it would be better to leave father in New York because I know he wouldn t like it at all with nothing but women and girls around and I am sure that he couldn t get his glass of hot water in the morning before breakfast and he would have a much better time in New York But if he does come please mother don t let him wear that old gray hat or that brown suit and mother couldn t you get him to get some gloves and a cane in New York before he comes And please mother dear make him put those stogies of his in an inside pocket and would you mind mother not wearing that brooch father s employees gave you last Christmas I shall be awfully glad to see you both but as I say it would be better if you let me come to New York where you and father will be ever so much more comfortable Your loving daughter JEANNETTE LETTERS FROM PARENTS THE same familiarity may be observed by parents when corresponding with their children with of course the addition of a certain amount of dignity commensurate with the fact that they are as it were in loco parentis The following example will no doubt be of aid to parents in correctly corresponding with their children A Correct Letter from a Mother to Her Son Congratulating Him on His Election to the Presidency of the United States DEAR FREDERICK I am very glad that you have been elected President of the United States Frederick and I hope that now you will have sense enough to see doctor Kincaid about your teeth It would be well to have him give you a thorough looking over at this time And missus Peasely has given me the name of a splendid throat specialist in New York whom I wish you would see as soon as possible for it has been almost a year since you went to doctor Ryan Are you getting good wholesome food missus Dennison stopped in this morning and she told me that Washington is very damp in the spring and I think you had better get a new overcoat a heavy warm one She also told me the name of a place where you can buy real woolen socks and pajamas I hope that you aren t going to be so foolish as to wear those short B V D s all winter because now that you are president you must take care of yourself Edward dear Are you keeping up those exercises in the morning I found those dumb bells of yours in the attic yesterday and will send them on to you if you wish And dear please keep your throat covered when you go out missus Kennedy says that the subways are always cold and full of draughts I saw a picture of you at the movies the other evening and you were making a speech in the rain without a hat or rubbers Your uncle Frederick was just such a fool as you are about wearing rubbers and he almost died of pneumonia the winter we moved to Jefferson Avenue Be sure and let me know what doctor Kincaid says and tell him EVERYTHING Your LOVING mother P S What direction does your window face LETTERS TO PROSPECTIVE FATHERS IN LAW A young man desiring to marry a young girl does not in polite society pop the question to her by mail unless she happens at the time to be out of the city or otherwise unable to receive It is often advisable however after she has said yes to write a letter to her father instead of calling on him to ask for his permission to the match as a personal interview is often apt to result unsatisfactorily In writing these letters to prospective fathers in law the cardinal point is of course the creation by the young man of a good impression in the mind of the father and for this purpose he should study to make his letter one which will appeal irresistibly to the older gentleman s habits and tastes Thus in writing to a father who is above everything else a business man the following form is suggested A Correct Letter to a Prospective Father in Law Who Is a Business Man My letter ten six twenty two Your letter In reply please refer to File Love personal N Y nineteen twenty two No G sixteen nineteen mister Harrison Williams Vice Pres Kinnear Williams Mfg company Buffalo N Y DEAR SIR

favorable impression especially if printed on a blotter or other useful article A Correct Letter to a Prospective Father in Law Who Is in the Advertising Business JUST A MOMENT Have you ever stopped to consider the problem of grandchildren Do you know for example that ONLY fifty eight of the fathers in America are GRANDFATHERS Did it ever occur to you that only thirty nine of the grandfathers in

business or possibly it might even be better to call off the engagement None but the brave deserve the fair but there is also a line in one of Byron s poems which goes I believe Here sleep the brave LOVE LETTERS A young man corresponding with his fiancee is never of course as formal as in his letters to other people This does not mean however that his correspondence should be full of silly meaningless nothings On the contrary he should aim to instruct and benefit his future spouse as well as convey to her his tokens of affection The following letter well illustrates the manner in which a young man may write his fiancee a letter which while it is replete with proper expressions of amatory good will yet manages to embody a fund of sensible and useful information A Correct Letter from a Young Man Traveling in Europe to His Fiancee MY DEAREST EDITH How I long to see you to hold tight your hand to look into your eyes But alas you are in Toledo and I am in Paris which as you know is situated on the Seine River near the middle of the so called Paris basin at a height above sea level varying from eighty five feet to four hundred nineteen feet and extending seven one two miles from W to E and five one two miles from N to S But dearest I carry your image with me in my heart wherever I go in this vast city with its population nineteen twenty one of two million eight hundred fifty six thousand nine hundred eighty six and its average mean rainfall Of two point six inches and I wish oh how I wish that you might be here with me Yesterday for example I went to the Pere Lachaise cemetery which is the largest one hundred six acres and most fashionable cemetery in Paris its ninety thousand one hundred forty eight est tombs forming a veritable open air sculpture gallery And what do you think I found there which made me think of you more than ever Not the tombs of La Fontaine d sixteen ninety five and Moliere d sixteen seventy three whose remains transferred to this cemetery in eighteen oh four constituted the first interments not the last resting place of Rosa Bonheur d eighteen ninety nine or the victims of the Op ra Comique fire eighteen eighty seven no dearest it was the tomb of Abelard and Heloise those late eleventh early twelfth century lovers and you may well imagine what thoughts centering upon a young lady whose first name begins with E filled my heart as I gazed at this impressive tomb the canopy of which is composed of sculptured fragments collected by Lenoir from the Abbey of Nogent sur Seine Aube Edith dearest I am sitting in my room gazing first at your dear picture and then out of my window at the Eiffel Tower which is the tallest structure in the world being nine hundred eighty four feet high Woolworth Building seven hundred fifty feet Washington Obelisk five hundred fifty five feet Great Pyramid four hundred fifty feet And although it may sound too romantic yet it seems to me dearest that our love is as strong and as sturdy as this masterpiece of engineering construction which weighs seven thousand tons being composed of twelve thousand pieces of metal fastened by two million five hundred thousand iron rivets Farewell my dearest one I must go now to visit the Catacombs a huge charnelhouse which is said to contain the remains of nearly three million persons consisting of a labyrinth of galleries lined with bones and rows of skulls through which visitors are escorted on the first and third Saturday of each month at two P M I long to hold you in my arms Devotedly PAUL CORRESPONDENCE OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS Congressmen and other public officials are as a rule more careful correspondents than are men whose letters are never to be seen by the public at large There is a certain well defined form for a letter meant for public consumption which distinguishes it from correspondence of a more private nature Thus a Congressman writing a public letter would cast it in the following form A Correct Public Letter from a Congressman mister Ellison Lothrop Vice Pres Washington company Better Citizenship League MY DEAR mister LOTHROP You have requested that I give to the Washington County Better Citizenship League of which you are an active vice president some expression of my views upon the question of Prohibition Sir can there be any doubt as to the belief of every right thinking American citizen in this matter The Eighteenth Amendment is here and here thank God to stay The great benefit which Prohibition has done to the poor and the working classes is reason enough for its continued existence It is for the manufacturers the professional class the capitalists to give up gladly whatever small pleasure they may have derived from the use of alcohol in order that John Jones workingman may have money in the bank and a happy home instead of his Saturday night debauch In every democracy the few sacrifice for the many the greatest good of the greatest number is the slogan And I for one am proud to have been a member of that legislative body which passed so truly God bidden and democratic an act as the Eighteenth Amendment I beg to remain with best wishes to your great organization Sincerely yours WALTER

and not a cent more W G T LETTERS TO NEWSPAPERS MAGAZINES et cetera Another type of public correspondence is the letter which is intended for publication in some periodical This is usually written by elderly gentlemen with whiskers and should be cast in the following form A Correct Letter from an Elderly Gentleman to the Editor of a Newspaper or Magazine To the Editor SIR On February next Deo volente I shall have been a constant reader of your worthy publication for forty one years I feel sir that that record gives me the right ipso facto to offer my humble criticism of a statement made in your November number by that worthy critic of the drama mister Heywood Broun Humanum est errare and I am sure that mister Broun with whom I have unfortunately not the honour of an acquaintance will forgive me for calling his attention to what is indeed a serious and I might say unbelievable misstatement In my younger days now long past it was not considered infra dig for a critic to reply to such letters as this and I hope that mister Broun will deem this epistle worthy of consideration and recognize the justice of my complaint I remember well a controversy that raged between critic and public for many weeks in the days when Joe Jefferson was playing Rip Van Winkle Ah sir do you remember but of course you don t that entrance of Joe in the first act with his dog Schneider That was not my first play by many years but I believe that it is still my favorite I think the first time I ever attended a dramatic performance was in the winter of sixty eight when I was a student at Harvard College Five of us freshmen went into the old Boston Museum to see Our American Cousin Joe Chappell was with us that night and the two Dawes boys and I think Elmer Mitchell One of the Dawes twins was I believe afterwards prominent in the Hayes administration There were many men besides Will Dawes in that Harvard class who were heard from in later years Ed Twitchell for one and Sam Caldwell who was one of the nominees for vice president in ninety two I sat next to Sam in Bull Warren s Greek class THERE was one of the finest scholars this country has ever produced a stern taskmaster and a thorough gentleman It would be well for this younger generation if they could spend a few hours in that old classroom with Bull pacing up and down the aisle and all of us trembling in our shoes But Delenda est Carthago fuit Ilium Requiescat in pace I last saw Bull at our fifteenth reunion and we were all just as afraid of him as in the old days at Hollis But I digress Tempus fugit which reminds me of a story Billy Hallowell once told at a meeting of the American Bar Association in Minneapolis in nineteen oh six Hallowell was perhaps the most brilliant after dinner speaker I have ever heard with the possible exception of W D Evarts I shall never forget the speech that Evarts made during the second Blaine campaign But I digress Your critic mister Heywood Broun says on page thirty three of the November issue of your worthy magazine that The Easiest Way is the father of all modern American tragedy Sir does mister Broun forget that there once lived a man named William Shakespeare Is it possible to overlook such immortal tragedies as Hamlet and Othello I think not Fiat justitia ruat colum Sincerely SHERWIN G COLLINS A Correct Letter from an Indignant Father to an Editor of Low Ideals To the Editor Sir I have a son a little fourteen year old boy who proudly bears my name This lad I have brought up with the greatest care I have spared no pains to make him an upright moral God fearing youth I had succeeded I thought in inculcating in him all those worthy principles for which our Puritan fathers fought and aye died I do not believe that there existed in our neighborhood a more virtuous more righteous boy From his earliest childhood until now missus Pringle and I have kept him carefully free from any suggestion of evil We have put in his hands only the best and purest of books we have not allowed him to attend any motion picture performances other than the yearly visit of the Burton Holmes travelogues and last year a film called Snow White and Rose Red we have forbidden him to enter a theater Roland for that is his name has never in his life exhibited any interest in what is known as sex Sir you may imagine my chagrin when my Roland my boy who for fourteen years I have carefully shielded from sin rushed in last night to where missus Pringle and I were enjoying our evening game of Bezique bearing in his hand a copy of your magazine which I presume he had picked up at some so called friend s house Papa look said my boy to me pointing to the cover of the magazine What are these Sir I looked missus Pringle gave a shriek and well may she have My boy was pointing to a cover on which was what is called in barroom parlance a nude And not ONE nude but TWELVE Sir you have destroyed the parental labors of fourteen years I trust you are satisfied Yours et

better things To the Editor Dear Sir I am a motorman on the Third Ave South Ferry local and the other day one of the passengers left a copy of your magazine on my car and I want to ask you something

probably take prompt and vigorous action Literary Editors Dear Sirs I have been very much interested in the clever work of Nancy and Ernest Boyd which has been appearing in your magazine and I wonder if you could take the time to give me a little piece of information about them You see there was a Nancy Boyd her mother was Nancy Kroomen of Beaver Dam and her bro Ernest who was neighbors to us for several years and when they moved I sort of lost track of them You know how those things are But it s a small world after all isn t it and I shouldn t be at all surprised if this was the same party and if it is will you say hello to Nancy for me and tell Ernest that Ed Gold still comes down from Akron to see E W every Saturday He ll know who I mean Ever sincerely MAY WINTERS LETTERS TO STRANGERS In writing to a person with whom you have only a slight acquaintance it is a sign of proper breeding to attempt to show the stranger that you are interested in the things in which he is interested Thus for example if you were to write a letter to a Frenchman who was visiting your city for the first time you would endeavor as in the following example to speak to him in his own idiom and put him at his ease by referring to the things with which he is undoubtedly familiar It is only a boor who seeks to impose his own hobbies and interests upon a stranger disregarding entirely the presumable likes and dislikes of the latter A CORRECT LETTER TO A FRENCH VISITOR Monsieur Jules La Chaise Hotel Enterprise City MONSIEUR I hope that you have had a bon voyage on your trip from la belle France and my wife and I are looking forward to welcoming you to our city Although I cannot say as your great king Louis XV so justly remarked L etat c est moi yet I believe that I can entertain you comme il faut during your stay here But all bon mots aside would you care to join us this afternoon in a ride around the city If you say the word voila we shall be at your hotel in our automobile and I think that you will find here much that is interesting to a native of Lafayette s great country and especially to a citizen of Paris Did you know for example that this city manufactures thirty eight of the toilet soap and perfumery je ne sais quoi which are used in this state Of course our sewers are not to be compared to yours mon Dieu but we have recently completed a pumping station on the outskirts of the city which I think might almost be denominated an objet d art I am enclosing a visitor s card to the City Club here which I wish you would use during your stay I am sure that you will find there several bon vivants who will be glad to join you in a game of vingt et un and in the large room on the second floor is a victrola with splendid instrumental and vocal records of La Marseillaise Au revoir until I see you this afternoon Robert C Crocker And above all in writing to strangers or comparative strangers seek to avoid the mention of subjects which might be distasteful to the recipient of the letter Many a friendship has been utterly ruined because one of the parties in her correspondence or conversation carelessly referred to some matter perhaps some physical peculiarity upon which the other was extremely sensitive The following letter well illustrates how the use of a little tact may go a long way A CORRECT LETTER TO A BEARDED LADY My dear missus Lenox I wonder if you would care to go with us to the opera Wednesday evening The Cromwells have offered us their box for that night which accounts for our selection of that particular evening Beggars cannot be choosers and while personally we would all rather go on some other night yet it is perhaps best that we do not refuse the Cromwells generous offer Then too Wednesday is really the only evening that my husband and I are free to go for the children take so much of our time on other nights I do hope therefore that you can go with us Wednesday to hear The Barber of Seville Sincerely Esther G missus Thomas D Franklin INVITATIONS The form of the invitation depends a great deal upon the character of the function to which one wishes to invite the guests to whom one issues the invitation Or to put it more simply invitations differ according to the nature of the party to which one invites the guests In other words when issuing invitations to invited guests one must have due regard for the fact that these invitations vary with the various types of entertainments for which one issues the invitations That is to say one would obviously not send out the same form of invitation to a wedding as to a dinner party and vice versa This is an iron clad rule in polite society For example a gentleman and lady named mister and missus Weems respectively living at ten sixty three Railroad Ave wishing to invite a gentleman named mister Cleek to dinner would send him the following engraved invitation mister AND missus LIONEL THONG WEEMS request the pleasure of mister WALLACE TILFORD CLEEK S company at dinner on Tuesday January the tenth at half after seven o clock ten sixty three Railroad Avenue This invitation would of course be worded differently for different circumstances such as for example if the name of the people giving the party wasn t Weems or if they didn t live at ten sixty three Railroad Ave or if they didn t have any intention of giving a dinner party on that particular evening Many prospective hostesses prefer to send written notes instead of the engraved invitation especially if the dinner is to be fairly informal This sort of invitation should however be extremely simple I think that most well informed hostesses would agree that the following is too verbose DEAR mister BURPEE It would give us great pleasure if you would dine with us on Monday next at seven thirty By the way did you know that mister Sheldon died yesterday of pneumonia Cordially ESTELLE G BESSERABO For receptions in honor of noted guests word the invitation in this manner mister AND missus CORNELIUS VANDERBILT request the pleasure of your company on Friday evening February sixth from nine to twelve AT DELMONICO S to meet Asst Fire Chief CHARLEY SCHMIDT and missus SCHMIDT Invitations to graduating exercises are worded thus THE SENIOR CLASS of the SOUTH ROCHESTER FEMALE DENTAL INSTITUTE requests the honor of your presence at the Commencement Exercises on Tuesday evening June the fifth at eight o clock MASONIC OPERA HOUSE That Six Orchestra ACCEPTANCES AND REGRETS Responses to invitations usually take the form of acceptances or regrets It is never correct for example to write the following sort of note DEAR missus CRONICK Your invitation for the twelfth inst received and in reply would advise that I am not at the present time in a position to signify whether or not I can accept Could you at your convenience furnish me with additional particulars re the proposed affair number of guests character of refreshments size of orchestra et cetera Awaiting an early reply I am Yours truly ALFRED CASS NAPE If one wishes to attend the party one accepts on a clean sheet of note paper with black ink from a fountain pen or inkwell A hostess should not however make the mistake of thinking that a large number of acceptances implies that anybody really wishes to attend her party The following is a standard form of acceptance doctor Tanner accepts with pleasure the kind invitation of missus Frederick Cummings Bussey for Thursday evening December twelfth at half after eight This note need not be signed The following acceptance is decidedly demode DEAR missus ASTOR Will I be at your ball Say can a duck swim Count on me sure FRED It is also incorrect and somewhat boorish to write accepted across the face of the invitation and return it signed to the hostess If one does not care to attend the party one often sends one s regrets although one just as often sends one s acceptances depending largely upon the social position of one s hostess The proper form of regret is generally as follows Alice Ben Bolt regrets that she will be unable to accept the kind invitation of Major General and missus Hannafield for Wednesday evening at half after eight Sometimes it is better to explain in some manner the cause of the regret as for example Alice Ben Bolt regrets that owing to an ulcerated tooth in the left side of her mouth and severe neuralgic pains all up and down her left side she will be unable to accept the kind invitation of Major General and missus Hannafield for Wednesday evening at half after eight at The Bananas This is not however always necessary CHAPTER NINE THE ETIQUETTE OF DINNERS AND BALLS FORMAL DINNERS IN AMERICA Eating is an extremely old custom and has been practiced by the better classes of society almost without interruption from earliest times And society like the potentate of the parable whose touch transformed every object into gold has embellished and adorned the all too common habit of eating until there has been evolved throughout the ages that most charming and exquisite product of human culture the formal dinner party The gentleman of today who delightedly dons his dress suit and escorts into a ten course dinner some lady mountain climber or other celebrity is probably little aware of what he owes to his forefathers for having so painstakingly devised for him such a pleasant method of spending his time But before one runs one must learn to walk and the joys of the dinner party are not to be partaken of without a long preliminary course of training as many a young man has learned to his sorrow when he discovered that his inelegant use of knife and fork was causing humorous comment up and down the board and was drawing upon himself the haughty glances of an outraged hostess The first requisite of success in dining out is the possession of a complete set of correct table manners and these like anything worth while can be achieved only by patient study and daily practise TABLE MANNERS FOR CHILDREN AS a matter of fact it is never too early to begin to acquire the technique of correct eating and the nursery is the best possible place for the first lessons in dining room behavior Children should be taught at an early age the fundamentals of table manners in such a way that by the time they have reached the years of manhood the correct use of knife fork spoon and fingerbowl is to them almost second nature But the parents should remember above everything else to instruct their children in such a way that the pupil takes pleasure in his lessons This is the method which is employed today in every successful school or kindergarten this is the method which really produces satisfactory results Thus for example if you are a father and your boy Edward persists in bringing his pet tadpole to the table in a glass jar you should not punish or scold him a much more effective and graphic method of correcting this habit would be for you to suddenly pick up the tadpole one day at luncheon and swallow it No whipping or scolding would so impress upon the growing boy the importance of the fact that the dinner table is not the place for pets Another effective way of teaching table manners to children consists in making up attractive games about the various lessons to be learned Thus whenever you have guests for dinner the children can play Boner which consists in watching the visitor closely all during the meal in order to catch him in any irregularity in table etiquette As soon as the guest has committed a mistake the first Child to discover it points his finger at him and shouts Pulled a Boner Pulled a Boner and the boy or girl who discovers the greatest number of Boners during the evening is rewarded with a prize based on the following table of points If the guest has dirty hands five points If the guest uses wrong fork or spoon five points If the guest chokes on bone eight points If the guest blows on soup five points If the guest drops fork or spoon three points If the guest spills soup on table ten points If the guest spills soup on self one point Of course it is often well to tell the guests about the game in advance in order that they may not feel embarrassed but will enter thoroughly into the spirit of this helpful sport A CHILD S GARDEN OF ETIQUETTE Children can also acquire knowledge more easily if it is imparted to them in the form of verse or easy rhymes and many valuable facts about the dinner table can be embodied in children s verses A few of these which I can remember from my own happy childhood are as follows Oh wouldn t it be jolly To be a nice hors d oeuvre And just bring joy to people Whom fondest you were of Soup is eaten with a spoon But not to any haunting tune Oysters live down in the sea In zones both temp and torrid And when they are good they are very good indeed And when they are bad they are horrid My papa makes a lovely Bronx With gin so rare and old And two of them will set you right But four will knock you cold The boys with Polly will not frolic Because she s eaten too much garlic Mama said the other day A little goes a long long way A wind came up out of the sea And said Those dams are not for me Uncle Frank choked on a bone From eating shad au gratin Aunt Ethel said it served him right And went back to her flat in NEWARK spoken Poor Uncle Frank chanted I love my little finger bowl So full of late filet of sole Cousin George at lunch one day Remarked That apple looks quite tasty Now George a dentist s bill must pay Because he was so very hasty The proverb s teachings we must hold All that glitters is not gold And mama said to George Oh shoot You ve gone and ruined my glass fruit Jim broke bread into his soup Jim knocked missus Vanderbilt for a loop Kate drank from her finger bowl Kate knocked missus Vanderbilt for a goal Children who perform such tricks Are socially in Class G six ETIQUETTE IN THE SCHOOL OF course as the children become older the instruction should gradually come to embrace all forms of correct behaviour and the youthful games and rhymes should give way to the more complex and intricate problems of mature social etiquette It is suggested that the teachings during this period may be successfully combined with the young gentleman s or lady s other schoolroom studies in the case of mathematics for example the instruction might be handled in somewhat the following manner A Problem in Mathematics seventh grade A swimmer starts across a stream which is four hundred fifty yards wide He swims for five minutes at the rate of three miles per hour and for three minutes at the rate of four miles per hour He then reaches the other bank where he sees a young lady five feet ten inches tall walking around a tree in a circle the circumference of which is forty two yards A What is the diameter of the circle B How fast is the current flowing in the stream C At what point would the swimmer land if there were no current in the stream D At what point does the swimmer actually land E But suppose that he has no bathing suit on And so when the young person has reached the age for his first formal dinner party he will undoubtedly be able to handle the fundamentals of correct etiquette in a satisfactory manner But as in every sport or profession there are certain refinements certain niceties which come only after long experience and it is with a view of helping the ambitious diner out to master these more complex details that I suggest that he study carefully the following unwritten laws which govern every dinner party In the first place a guest is supposed tacitly to consent to the menu which the hostess has arranged and the diner out who makes a habit of saying Squab you know never agrees with me I wonder if I might have a couple of poached eggs is apt to find that such squeamishness does not pay in the long run Practical jokes are never countenanced at a formal affair of this sort I do not mean that a certain amount of good natured fun is out of place but such stunts as pulling the hostess chair out from under her or gleefully kicking the shins of your neighbor under the table and shouting Guess who are decidedly among the non ests of correct modern dinner table behaviour Then too it is now distinctly bad form to practise legerdemain or feats of sleight of hand at a dinner party Time was when it was considered correct for a young man who could do card or other tricks to add to the gayety of the party by displaying his skill but that time is past and the guest of today who thinks to make a hit by pulling a live rabbit or a potted plant from the back of the mystified hostess or one of the butlers is in reality only making a fool of himself if he only knew it The same taboo also holds good as concerns feats of juggling and no hostess of today will I am sure ever issue a second invitation to a young man who has attempted to enliven her evening by balancing on his nose a knife a radish a plate of soup and a lighted candle Cleverness is a valuable asset but only up to a certain point and I know of one unfortunately clever young chap who almost completely ruined a promising social career by the unexpected failure of one of his pet juggling tricks and the consequent dumping of a large dish of mashed potatoes on the head of a vice president of the Equitable Trust Company Besides people almost always distrust clever persons It does not do either to ride your hobby at a dinner party and the real truth as to the cause of the sudden social ostracism of young Freddie H a New York clubman of some years ago now happily deceased is that on one occasion this young fellow who had developed a craze for marksmanship amounting almost to a mania very nearly ruined a dinner party given by a prominent Boston society matron by attempting to shoot the whiskers off a certain elderly gentleman who happened to be a direct descendant of John Smith and Priscilla Alden It might also be remarked that the possession of certain physical gifts such as the ability to wriggle one s ears or do the splits is in itself no open sesame to lasting social success Slow and sure is a good rule for the young man to follow and although he may somewhat enviously watch his more brilliant colleagues as they gain momentary applause by their ability to throw their thumbs out of joint or squirt water through a hole in their front teeth yet he may console himself with the thought that the race is not always to the swift and that Rome was not built in a day The gifts of this world have been distributed fairly equally and you may be sure that the young girl who has been born a ventriloquist very likely is totally unable to spell difficult words correctly or carry even a simple tune Ventriloquism by the way is also passing out as a form of dinner party diversion and it is no longer considered a priceless accomplishment to be able to make a dog bark or a baby cry under the hostess s chair CONVERSATION AT DINNER Gradually however conversation real conversation is coming into its own as the favorite pastime of dinner guests and the young man or lady who can keep the conversational ball rolling is coming more and more into demand Good conversationalists are I fear born and not made but by study and practise any ambitious young man can probably acquire the technique and with time mould himself into the kind of person upon whom hostesses depend for the success of their party As an aid in this direction I have prepared the following chart which I would advise all my readers to cut out and paste in some convenient place so that at their next dinner party it can be readily consulted STEWART S LIGHTNING CALCULATOR OF DINNER TABLE CONVERSATION This chart divides the dinner into its various courses and under each course is given what I call an opening sentence together with your partner s probable reply and the topic which is then introduced for discussion And most valuable of all under each such topic I have listed certain helpful facts which will enable you to prolong the conversation along those lines until the arrival of the next course and the consequent opening of another field for discussion The chart follows I Cocktails You say to the partner on your right What terrible gin She he replies Perfectly ghastly This leads to a discussion of Some Aspects of Alcohol Helpful Facts one An oyster soaked in alcohol becomes quite rigid in eleven minutes two Senator Volstead was born Sept four eighteen sixty nine three Alcohol if taken in too great quantities often produces internal disorders II Oysters You say to the partner on your right Think of being an oyster She he replies How perfectly ghastly This leads to a discussion of Home Life of Oysters Helpful Facts one The average life of an oyster is thirty eight days eleven hours two Polygamy is practised among certain classes of oysters three The first oyster was eaten by Ossip Gatch a Pole d seventeen eighty three III Fish You say to the partner at your right Do you enjoy fish She he replies I simply adore fish This leads to a discussion of Fish Then and Now Helpful Facts one Fish make notoriously bad pets whereas seals can be taught to do many novel tricks two Gloucester Mass smells badly in summer three Gloucester Mass smells badly in winter IV Meat You say to the partner at your right Have you ever been through the Stock Yards She he replies No Yes This leads to a discussion of The Meat Industry in America Helpful Facts one Every time a street car goes over the Brooklyn Bridge a steer is killed in Chicago and oftener two Raw beefsteak in quantities is harmful to children under two years of age three A man died recently in Topeka Kansas weighing three hundred twelve pounds four Many prominent people live on the North Side of Chicago V Salad You say to the partner at your right What is your favorite salad She he replies I don t know what s yours This leads to a discussion of Favorite Things Helpful Facts one Richard Barthelmess is married two B V D stands for Best Value Delivered three Amy Lowell is fond of cigars VI Dessert You say to the partner at your right I love ice cream She he replies So do I This leads to a discussion of Love Helpful Facts one New York is the hardest state in which to get a divorce in America two doctor Sigmund Freud is now living in Vienna Austria three D H Lawrence has a black beard BALLS AND DANCES In order to succeed in the modern ballroom and especially in the ballrooms of our exclusive country clubs a young gentleman or lady of fashion must today be possessed of the following two requisites i A Line two A closed car The latter of these sine qua nons is now owned as a matter of course by most families and is no longer regarded as a mark of distinction The former requisite however is not so common but it is nevertheless true that any young person with ambition and a good memory can eventually acquire a quite effective Line It is a great aid in this direction if one happens to have spent a year or more at one of our leading eastern universities or finishing schools These vary of course in degree of excellence but it does not pay to be dogmatic on this subject and to those who would insist that the Princeton Line is more effective than the Harvard ditto or that the Westover Line flows more smoothly than that of Farmington or Spence one can only say De gustibus non disputandum est Lines vary also in accordance with the different types of girls who happen to be using them and to misquote a rather vulgar proverb What is one girl s food may be another girl s poison Thus it happens that the Line which is most universally and interminably employed by the beautiful type of girl consisting in its entirety of the three words How perfectly priceless would never in the world do for the young miss whose chief asset is a kind heart or a love for really good books MIXED DANCING Another quality which is often helpful on the dance floor especially to girls is the ability to dance This seems to have become largely a trick of keeping abreast of the latest mode and while personally I greatly regret the passing of the stately lancers and other dignified round dances yet if mixed dancing has come to stay it is the duty of every young person to learn to dance as well as possible in the generally accepted manner even though this often involves some compromising of one s amour propre But in addition to all these necessary qualifications the really great person the true super man or woman of the ballroom must be possessed of that certain divine something that je ne sais quoi ability to rise superior to all occasions to overcome the most difficult situations which has distinguished the great men and women of all ages Joan of Arc had it George Washington had it Napoleon had it and I venture to say that any of these three had they lived today Would have been a social success But perhaps this fact can best be illustrated by taking a typical instance in the ballroom in which When duty whispered low Thou must the youth replied I can HINTS FOR STAGS Let us suppose for example that you are a young man who has been invited to a dance to be given at the East Shore Country Club It is your original intention let us say to attend as a stag but on the afternoon of the party you receive a note from a young lady of your acquaintance asking if you would be so kind as to accompany to the ball a guest of hers a sweet girl from South Orange who was in her class at college The correct costume for a dance of this sort is usually a dinner coat with a black or white vest and when you have robed yourself correctly you should drive in your car to the young lady s home There you are presented to the sweet girl from South Orange who is six feet tall and has protruding teeth After the customary words of greeting and a few brief bits of pleasantry you set off with your partner for the dance Arrived at the East Shore Club you find the party in full swing and after shaking hands with your host and hostess you should ask your partner if she would care to dance The first three times that she steps on your left foot you should politely murmur My fault But when she begins to sing in your ear it is proper to steer her over toward the stag line in order to petition for an injunction or a temporary restraining order The stag line consists of a group of the wisest shrewdest and most hard hearted young men ever gathered together under one roof The original purpose of a stag line was to provide a place where unattached young men might stand while searching for a partner but the institution has now come to be a form of Supreme Court passing life or death sentence upon the various debutantes who pass before it After you have piloted your partner five times along the length of this line you have a pretty fair idea as to her merits or demerits and in this particular case you have a pretty fair idea as to just what the evening holds out for you When the music stops you should therefore lead the girl over to a chair and ask to be allowed to bring her a glass of punch Instead of going directly to the punch bowl you should turn your steps toward the stag line There you will find several young men whom only as late as that afternoon you counted among your very best friends but who do not at the present seem to remember ever having met you before Seizing the arm of one of these you say Tom I want you to meet That is as far as you will get for Tom will suddenly interrupt you by remarking Excuse me a minute Ed I see a girl over there I ve simply got to speak to I ll come right back He will not come right back He will not come back at all And after you have met with the same response from four other so called friends you should return to the South Orange visitor and carry on At the end of the second hour however your mind should begin to clear and if you are at all possessed of the qualifications for future ballroom leadership you should gradually throw off the slough of despond and determine to make a fight for life liberty and the pursuit of happiness And when the music has once more ceased you should ask your partner if she would not care to take a jaunt in the open air I know a lovely walk you should say across a quaint old bridge The rest is of course easy Arrived in the middle of the quaint old bridge which leads across a cavern some three hundred feet deep you should quickly seize the tall college graduate and push her not too roughly or ungentlemanly off the bridge And if you are really a genius and not merely one of the crowd you will return to the ballroom and going up to the young lady who was responsible for your having met the sweet girl from South Orange you will offer her your arm and smile invitingly I know a lovely walk you will say across a quaint old bridge End of Project Gutenberg s Perfect
