Kegg and PG Distributed Proofreaders Illustration JUST AS I THOUGHT ASHTON KIRK INVESTIGATOR By John T McIntyre Author of In the Dead of Night c ILLUSTRATIONS BY RALPH L BOYER PHILADELPHIA nineteen ten To my Friend GRANT GIBNEY INTRODUCTION Ashton Kirk who has solved so many mysteries is himself something of a problem even to those who know him best Although young wealthy and of high social position he is nevertheless an indefatigable worker in his chosen field He smiles when men call him a detective No only an investigator he says He has never courted notoriety indeed his life has been more or less secluded However let a man do remarkable work in any line and as Emerson has observed the world will make a beaten path to his door Those who have found their way to Ashton Kirk s door have been of many races and interests Men of science have often been surprised to find him in touch with the latest discoveries scholars searching among strange tongues and dialects and others deep in tattered scrolls ancient tablets and forgotten books have been his frequent visitors But among them come many who seek his help in solving problems in crime I m more curious than some other fellows that s all is the way he accounts for himself If a puzzle is put in front of me I can t rest till I know the answer At any rate his natural bent has always been to make plain the mysterious each well hidden step in the perpetration of a crime has always been for him an exciting lure and to follow a thread snarled by circumstances or by another intelligence has been he admits his chief delight There are many strange things to be written of this remarkable man but this the case of the numismatist Hume has been selected as the first because it is one of the simplest and yet clearly illustrates Ashton Kirk s peculiar talents It will also throw some light on the question often asked as to how his cases come to him A second volume that shows the investigator deep in another mystery even more intricate and puzzling than this is entitled Ashton Kirk and the Scarlet Scapular CONTENTS CHAPTER I PENDLETON CALLS UPON ASHTON KIRK II MISS EDYTH VALE STATES HER CASE III THE PORTRAITS OF

HAVE STARTLED HER Ashton Kirk Investigator CHAPTER I PENDLETON CALLS UPON ASHTON KIRK Young Pendleton s car crept carefully around the corner and wound in and out among the push cart men and dirty children About midway in the block was a square built house with tall small paned windows and checkered with black headed brick It stood slightly back from the street with ancient dignity upon the shining door plate deeply bitten in angular text was the name Ashton Kirk Here the car stopped Pendleton got out ascended the white marble steps and tugged at the polished old fashioned bell handle A grave faced German in dark livery opened the door mister Ashton Kirk will see you sir said he I gave him your telephone message as soon as he came down Thank you Stumph said Pendleton And with the manner of one perfectly acquainted with the house he ascended a massively balustraded staircase The walls were darkly paneled from the shadowy recesses pictured faces of men and women looked down at him Coming in from the littered street with its high smells and crowding gesticulating people the house impressed one by its quiet its spaciousness and the evident means and culture of its owner Pendleton turned off at the first landing proceeded along a passage and finally knocked at a door Without waiting for a reply he walked in At the far end of a long high ceilinged apartment a young man was lounging in an easy chair At his elbow was a jar of tobacco a sheaf of brown cigarette papers and a scattering of books He lifted a keen dark face lit up by singularly brilliant eyes Hello Pen greeted he You ve come just in time to smoke up some of this Greek tobacco Throw those books off that chair and make yourself easy One by one Pendleton lifted the books and glanced at the titles Your morning s reading if this is such commented he is strikingly catholic Plutarch Snarleyow the Opium Eater Martin Chuzzlewit Then came a host of tattered pamphlets bound in shrieking paper covers which the speaker handled gingerly The Crimes of Anton Probst he continued to read The Deeds of the Harper Family The Murder of here he paused tossed the pamphlets aside with contempt sat down and drew the tobacco jar toward him Some of the results of your forays into the basements of old booksellers I suppose he added rolling a cigarette with delicate ease But what value you see in such things is beyond me Ashton Kirk smiled good humoredly He took up some of the pamphlets and fluttered their illy printed pages They are not beautiful he admitted the paper could not be worse and the wood cuts are horrors But they are records of actual things striking things as a matter of fact for a murder which so lifts itself above the thousands of homicides that are yearly occurring as to gain a place outside the court records and newspapers must have been one of exceptional execution There is a public which delights in being horrified said Pendleton with a grimace The things are put out to get their nickels and dimes No doubt agreed the other And the fact that they are willing to pay their nickels and dimes is to my way of thinking a proof of the extraordinary nature of the crime chronicled The speaker dropped the prints upon the floor and lounged back in his big chair There is Plutarch he continued the account of the assassination of Caesar is not the least interesting thing in his biography of that statesman Indeed I have no doubt but that the chronicler thought Caesar s taking off the most striking incident in his career that the Roman public thought so is a matter of history Countless writers have dwelt upon the taking of human life some of them were rather commercial gentlemen who always gave an ear to the demands of their public and their screeds were written for the money that they would put in their pockets but others and by long odds the greatest were fascinated by their subjects Both Stevenson and Henley were powerfully drawn by deeds of blood Did you know they planned a great book which was to contain a complete account of the world s most remarkable homicides I m sorry they never carried the thing out for I cannot conceive of two minds more fitted to the task They would have dressed every event in the grimmest and most subtle horror why the soul would have shuddered at each enormity as shaped and presented by such masters Pendleton regarded his friend with candid distaste You are appalling to day said he If you think it s the Greek tobacco let me know For I have to mingle with other human beings and I d scarcely care to get into your state of mind The strong white teeth of Ashton Kirk showed in a quick smile The tobacco was recommended by old Hosko he said and you ll find nothing violent in it no matter what you find in my conversation What put you into such a frame of mind anyway Something happened But Ashton Kirk shook his head I don t know said he In fact I have been strangely idle for the last fortnight The most exciting things that have appeared above my personal horizon have been a queer little edition of Albertus Magnus struck off in an obscure printing shop in Florence in the early part of the sixteenth century and a splendid large paper Poe to which I fortunately happened to be a subscriber A volume of the Poe and the Albertus Magnus were lying at hand Pendleton ignored the dumpy stained little Latin volume its strong smelling leather binding and faded text had no attractions for him But he took up the Poe and began idly turning its leaves It is a mistake to suppose that some specific thing must be the cause of an action or a train of thought resumed the other from the comfortable depths of his chair Sometimes thousands of things go to the making of a single thought countless others to the doing of a single deed And yet again a thing entirely unassociated with a result may be the beginning of the result so to speak For example a volume of Henry James which I was reading last night might be the cause of my turning to the literature of assassination this morning your friendly visit may result in my coming in contact with a murder that will make any of these with a nod toward the scattered volumes seem tame Pendleton threw away his cigarette and proceeded to roll another It is my earnest desire to remain upon friendly terms with you Kirk stated he with a smile Therefore I will make no comment except to say that your last reflection was entirely uncalled for Lighting the cigarette he turned the tall leaves of the beautiful volume upon his knee This edition is quite perfection he remarked admiringly And I m sorry that I was not asked to subscribe However and Pendleton glanced humorously at his friend I don t suppose its beauty is what attracts you to day It is because certain pages are spread with the records of crime I notice that this volume holds both The Murders in the Rue Morgue and the Mystery of Marie Roget Right smiled Ashton Kirk I admit I was browsing among the details of those two masterpieces when you came in A great fellow Poe His peculiar imagination gave him a marvelous grasp of criminal possibilities Ashton Kirk took up the Confessions of an English Opium Eater and turned the leaves until he came to Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts In some things I have detected an odd similarity in the work of De Quincey and Poe Mind you I say in some things As to what entered into the structure of an admirably conceived murder they were as far apart as the poles The ideals of the Society of Connoisseurs in Murder must have excited in Poe nothing but contempt A coarse butchery a wholesale slaughter was received by this association with raptures a pale eyed orange haired blunderer with a ship carpenter s mallet hidden under his coat was hailed as an artist You don t find Poe wasting time on uncouth monsters who roar like tigers bang doors and smear whole rooms with blood His assassins had a joy in planning their exploits as well as in the execution of them They were intelligent secret sure And in every case they accomplished their work and escaped detection You must not forget however complained Pendleton that De Quincey s assassin John Williams was a real person and his killings actual occurrences Poe s workmen were creatures of his imagination their crimes with the possible exception of Marie Roget were purely fanciful The creator of the doer and the deed had a clear field and in that perhaps lies the superiority of Poe Ashton Kirk sighed humorously Perhaps said he At any rate the select crimes are usually the conceptions of men who have no idea of putting them into execution And that upon consideration is a fortunate thing for society But at the same time it is most irritating to a man of a speculative turn of mind Fiction teems with most splendid murders Captain Marryat in Snarleyow created an almost perfect horror in the attempted slaughter of the boy Smallbones by the hag mother of Vanslyperken the lad s reversal of the situation and his plunging a bayonet into the wrinkled throat makes the chapter an accomplishment difficult to displace Remember it Pendleton arose and opened one of the windows Even the noise and smell of this street of yours are grateful after what I have been listening to said he Then after a moment spent in examining the adjacent outdoors he added in a tone of wonderment I say Kirk this is really a hole of a place to live Why don t you move The other arose and joined him at the window Old fashioned streets alter wonderfully after the generations of the elect have passed but when Eastern Europe takes to dumping its furtive hordes into one the change is marked indeed In this one peddler s wagons replaced the shining carriages of a former day wagons drawn by large jointed horses and driven by bearded men who cried their wares in strange throaty voices Everything exhaled a thick semi oriental smell Dully painted fire escapes clung hideously to the fronts of the buildings stagnant looking men wearing their hats leaned from bedroom windows The once decent hallways were smutted with grimy hands the wide marble steps were huddled with alien unclean people A splendidly spired church stood almost shoulder to shoulder with the Ashton Kirk house Once it had been a place of dignified Episcopal worship but years of neglect had made it unwholesome and cavern like and finally it was given over to a tribe of stolid Lithuanians who stuck a cheaply gilded Greek cross over the door and thronged the street with their wedding and christening processions Perhaps said Ashton Kirk after a moment s study of the prospect yes perhaps it is a hole of a place in which to live But you see we ve had this house since shortly after the Revolution four generations have been born here As I have no fashionable wife and I live alone I am content to stay Then the house suits me everything is arranged to my taste The environment may not be the most desirable but my visitors are seldom of the sort that object to externals Well you have one just now who is not what you might call partial to such neighborhoods said Pendleton And looking at his watch you will shortly have another who will be perhaps still less favorably impressed Ah said Ashton Kirk He curled himself up upon the deep window sill while Pendleton went back to his chair and the tobacco It s a lady resumed Pendleton the brown paper crackling between his fingers a lady of condition quality and beauty It sounds pleasant enough smiled the other But why is she coming To consult you ah I suppose we might call it professionally No I don t know what it is about but judging from her manner it is something of no little consequence She sent you to prepare the way for her then Yes It is Miss Edyth Vale daughter of James Vale the Structural Steel King you remember they used to call him before he died a few years ago She was an only child and except for the four millions which he left to found a technical school she inherited everything And when you say everything in a case like this it means considerable Ashton Kirk nodded She is a distant relative of mine resumed Pendleton her mother was connected in some vague way with my mother and because of this indefinite link we ve always been here he hesitated for an instant well rather friendly Last night we happened to meet at Upton s and I took her in to dinner Edyth is a nice girl but I ve noticed of late that she s not had a great deal to say Sort of quiet and big eyed and all that you know Seems healthy enough but does a great deal of thinking and looking away at nothing I ve talked to her for ten minutes straight only to find that she hadn t heard a word I d said So as you will understand I did not expect a great deal of her at dinner But directly across from us was young Cartwright Employed in the Treasury Department That s the man Well he began to talk departmental affairs with some one well down the table you know how some of these serious kids are and as there seemed to be nothing else to do I gave my whole attention to the interesting performance of missus Upton s cook I must have been falling into a dreamy rapture but at any rate I suddenly awoke so to speak To my surprise Edyth was talking quite animatedly with Cartwright and about you Ah said Ashton Kirk That s very pleasant It is not given to every man that the mention of him should stir a melancholy young lady into animation Have you done anything in your line for the Treasury Department lately asked Pendleton Oh a small matter of some duplicate plates said Ashton Kirk It had some interest but there was nothing extraordinary in it Well Cartwright didn t think that I did not come to in time to catch the nature of your feat but he seemed lost in admiration of your cleverness He was quite delighted too at securing Edyth s attention You see it was a thing he had scarcely hoped for So he proceeded to relate all he had ever heard about you That queer little matter of the Lincoln death mask you know and the case of the Belgian Consul and the spurious Van Dyke And he had even heard some of the things you did in the university during your senior year His recital of your recovery of the silver figure of the Greek runner which went as the Marathon prize in nineteen oh two made a great hit I assure you But when he answered No to Edyth s earnest question as to whether he were acquainted with you she lost interest and when I promptly furnished the information that I was he was forgotten During the remainder of the dinner I had time for little else but Edyth s questions When she learned that you had taken up investigation as a sort of profession she was quite delighted and before we parted I was asked to arrange a consultation She will be here this morning then asked Ashton Kirk Pendleton once more looked at his watch Within a very few minutes said he CHAPTER II MISS EDYTH VALE STATES HER CASE It was exactly three minutes later when the continuous tooting of a horn told of the approach of another motor car along the crowded street Then the door bell rang Ashton Kirk arose and touched one of a series of buttons in the wall Almost instantly a buzzer made sharp reply He lifted a tube If it is Miss Edyth Vale spoke he show her up A little later a knock came upon the door The grave faced German opened it ushering in an astonishingly lovely girl tall most fashionably attired and with a manner of eager anxiety Both men arose Considering that you are under twenty five said Pendleton you are remarkably prompt in keeping your engagements Edyth But the girl did not answer his smile There was a troubled look in her brown eyes she tugged nervously at her gloves to get them off This is mister Ashton Kirk she asked It is answered Pendleton Kirk this is my cousin Edyth Vale Ashton Kirk gave the girl a chair she sat down regarding him all the time with much interest The gloves were removed by now but she continued plucking at the empty fingers and drawing them through her hands I have heard of you quite frequently said she to Ashton Kirk but did not dream that I would ever be forced to benefit by your talents mister Pendleton has been kind enough to arrange this interview at my request and I desire to consult you upon a most important matter a very private matter Pendleton caught the hesitating glance which she threw at him and reached for his hat Edyth said he after all I have done for you this is very distressing I had not expected to be bundled out in this manner She smiled faintly and nodded Thank you Jimmie she said You are a nice boy After Pendleton had gone Miss Vale sat for some moments in silence and all the time her eyes went from one part of the room to another curiously she seemed to be trying to estimate the man whom she came to consult by his surroundings At one side rank on rank of books ran from floor to ceiling others were scattered about in chairs on stands and on the floor At one spot the wall was racked with glittering and to her strange looking instruments An open door gave a glimpse of a second apartment with bare plastered wall fitted with tables covered with sheet lead and cluttered with tanks grotesquely swelling retorts burners jars and other things that make up a complete laboratory But these told her nothing except that the man was a student and this she had heard before So she gave her attention to Ashton Kirk himself He stood by the open window the morning light beating strongly upon his dark keen face apparently watching the uncouth surging in the street below He s very handsome and very wealthy her friend Connie Bayless had informed her only that morning Comes of a very old family has the entree into the most exclusive houses but practically ignores society Oh yes I know him her uncle an eminent attorney had told her A very unusual young man I might call him acutely intellectual and he is an adept in many out of the way branches of knowledge He would make a wonderful lawyer but has too much imagination Thinks more of visionary probabilities than of tangible facts As an amateur actor Pendleton had confided to her Kirk is without an equal If he adopted the stage he d make a sensation At college he was a most tremendous athlete too football cross country running wrestling boxing And I m told that he still keeps in training Clever chap I never saw a more splendid natural equipment for languages said Professor Hutchinson The most sprawling dialect seemed a simple matter to him Greek and the oriental tongues were no more trouble in his case than the first reader is to an intelligent child She had spoken with missus Stokes Corbin over the telephone missus Stokes Corbin was related to Ashton Kirk and her information was kindly but emphatic My dear said the lady I do hope you haven t fallen in love with him No Well that s fortunate He s one of the dearest fellows in the world but one of the most extraordinary I can t fancy his marrying at all His ways and moods and really preposterous habits would drive a wife mad You can t imagine the extent of them He spends days and nights in positively uncanny chemical experiments Without a word to anyone he plunges off on some mysterious errand to be gone for weeks They do tell me that he is to all intents and purposes a policeman But I really can t quite credit that you know He loves to do things that others have tried and failed Even as a boy he was that way It was quite discouraging to have a child straighten out little happenings that we had all given up in despair Sometimes it was quite convenient but I m not sure that I ever liked it A charming talker my dear he knows so much to talk about But he s eccentric and an eccentric young man is a frightful burden to those connected with him All these things passed through the mind of Edyth Vale as she sat regarding the young man at the window Finally he lifted his eyes and turned them upon her beautiful eyes remarkable full of perception compelling As he caught her intent inquiring look he smiled she colored slightly but met his glance bravely Last night I heard you spoken of she said and it occurred to me that you could aid me I should be glad to said he It sometimes happens that I can be of service to persons extraordinarily circumstanced If you will let me hear your story for with a smile all who come to see me as you have done have a story I shall be able to definitely say whether your case comes within my province She hesitated a moment her hands nervously engaged with the gloves Then she said frankly I suppose it is only sensible to speak quite candidly with you mister Ashton Kirk as one does with a lawyer or a physician He nodded Of course said he For another moment she seemed to be turning her thoughts over and seeking the best means of making a beginning It is very silly of me I know she said but I feel quite like the working girl who writes to the correspondence editor of an evening paper for advice in smoothing out her love affairs She bent toward him the laugh vanishing from her face a troubled look taking its place and continued I am to be married some day and it is about that that I wish to speak to you I realize the difficulties of the subject spoke Ashton Kirk quietly What I am going to tell you I have never mentioned to anyone before It has been three years ago four years at Christmas time since I first met Allan Morris she said Our engagement so quickly followed that my friends said it was a very clear case of love at first sight Perhaps it was However that might be we were very happy for a time But trouble was in store for us I had always disbelieved in long engagements had always been very outspoken against them in fact This is perhaps what made me so quickly notice an absence of haste on mister Morris part as to the wedding When the subject came up as it naturally would he seemed to avoid it At first I was surprised but finally I grew annoyed and spoke my mind very frankly You see he is not at all well off and I am well I have a great deal I thought this might have something to do with his apparent reluctance But no it was something else As I just said I spoke frankly and he was equally candid after a fashion He said it was quite impossible for us to be married for some time There was a something he did not say what which must first be settled Naturally I grew curious I desired to know what it was that so stood in the way of our happiness He replied that it was something that must not be spoken of and was so very earnest in the matter that I did not mention it again for a long time You may think mister Ashton Kirk that my fiance was no very ardent lover But I was assured and I do not lack perception that he was passionately fond of me And I still think so But as time went by things did not alter our wedding was a vague expectation even more than before mister Morris avoided mention of anything definite I am not naturally patient and my rearing as the only child of an enormously rich man has perhaps added to my impetuousness In a burst of temper one day I broke the engagement gave him back his ring and did a number of other rather silly things But he was so tragic in his despair so utterly broken hearted and white that I immediately relented and we patched the matter up once more That he loved me was plain but that he could not marry me for some mysterious reason was even plainer After this I began to notice a change in him He was rather silent and given to reverie he seldom laughed Sometimes he was haggard and so wrought up apparently that he could scarcely contain himself He would pace the floor evidently with little realization as to what he was doing Once he was really dreadfully agitated I calmed him as well as I could and he sat for a long time thinking deeply As I watched him he sprang to his feet and dashing his fist upon a table cried out passionately The black hearted rascal He s mocking me Then like a flash he realized the strangeness of his conduct and with anxious alarmed face asked my pardon I felt that this was an opportunity to put an end to a situation that was growing intolerable My persistent questioning gained me something but on the whole not a great deal The thing that was troubling him was a business matter In some way he was in the hands of some one these are the indefinite threads that I gathered a mocking jeering smiling someone whom he hated but from whom he could not free himself I began to tell him that there could be nothing strong enough in itself to prevent our happiness but he stopped me in such a way that I did not feel inclined to continue In an outburst filled with denunciations of his enemy and protestations of devotion to myself I caught the name of Hume He had dropped this inadvertently I knew it instantly because of the swift look that he gave me But I allowed no hint of what I thought to show in my face He was more subdued during the remainder of his stay the mentioning of the name had startled him and he was doubtless afraid that his state of mind would lead him into further indiscretions As you may suppose the name the first tangible thing that I had learned was of much interest to me If I could but find out who this person was I could probably get to the bottom of the matter At this point Miss Vale paused and Ashton Kirk noted her head lift proudly Perhaps she continued it might be thought that I had no right to make such an effort in a matter which mister Morris saw fit to keep from me Were you thinking that But I am not a silent sufferer I usually make an end of annoying things without delay And I would have done so in this case long before but I was in love and I could not bear to see Allan suffer by my insistence However here was an opportunity to perhaps aid him and I set to work In a few hours next day I had located every person of the name of Hume in the city mister Morris is a consulting engineer Anyone named Hume who from his occupation would be likely to have dealings with him especially attracted my attention There were only a few and long before the day was over I had satisfied myself by personal visits at their places of business that they did not even know him Ashton Kirk smiled One of his well kept hands patted applause upon the arm of his chair You are strong said he I recognized your type when you came in It is a pleasure to have one s judgment so thoroughly and satisfactorily proven Miss Vale looked pleased I am glad that you approve of what I did she said I confess I had some hesitancy but not enough to prevent my carrying out the design But when the first effort proved without result I set about making a study of all the Humes in the directory I had my secretary make me a typed list of them with their addresses and occupations and I pored over this for hours at a time There was one that caught my eye after a while probably this was because of the unusualness of his business The directory gave him as a numismatist but I drove by his shop in my car and the sign over the window said that he was also a dealer in curiosities of art This gave me an idea mister Morris is an ardent collector his hobby is engraved gems and for a man of his means his possessions in this line are quite remarkable It was easily within the range of possibility that he had had transactions with this particular Hume at least that he was acquainted with him The more I thought of this the more curious I grew and one afternoon I paid the place a visit It is on the second floor the entrance is through a side door and up a narrow dusty stairway Then I had to make my way along a dark windowless passage to the office or shop in the front This shop was well lighted and literally stuffed with what were well termed curiosities of art I never before saw such queer carvings such freakish pottery such weird and utterly impossible bric a brac At a table sat a flabby looking man with a short sandy beard One glance told me that he was an habitual drunkard for he had the sodden look that is unmistakable But when he arose and bid me good evening his manner struck me like a blow in the face Allan Morris had spoken of a mocking person who jeered and smiled And that described this man exactly There was mockery in every glance of his dull eyes every twitch of his mouth was a fleer with each gesture he seemed making game of one sneering incredulity was stamped all over him Ashton Kirk leaned forward with keen interest My manner must have betrayed me the girl went on for I saw an inquiring crease come into his forehead When he asked the nature of my business his voice was sharp and insolent I had not thought as to what I should say what excuse I should give in this case But almost instantly my mind was made up About the most conspicuous thing in the room was a squat Japanese idol a fat grinning hideous thing which sat upon a sort of pedestal near the door So I laid my hand in it I was told of this said I examining the idol minutely and came in to see it Ah yes said he But it was plain enough that he did not believe me I inquired the price of the figure He named a high one and I believe I astonished him by purchasing it without another word The idol was delivered late that afternoon I had it unpacked at once and placed where mister Morris could not fail to see it when he called A clever plan commented Ashton Kirk admiringly He saw it when he entered the room and greeted me He was smiling and the smile froze on his lips his face went pale and he turned a look upon me that filled me with fear it was so wan and startled I had intended telling him the full truth if my ruse succeeded But after that look I could not I convinced him by a nonchalant manner and story that I had come by the idol accidentally At least I think I convinced him though I noticed his watching me steadily from under very level brows more than once during the evening But if he had any suspicions that I was deceiving him he did not put them into words Here Miss Vale paused for a moment Then she resumed I tried in various ways to gain a knowledge of the relationship between my fiance and this sneering shopkeeper but they were all ineffectual mister Ashton Kirk this occurred fully three months ago and the situation remains the same as it was upon that night Then with a suddenness that startled the young man she lifted two trembling hands to her face and began to sob gaspingly When she took the hands away there were no signs of tears but her beautiful face was drawn with pain and her voice shook as she said I don t think I can stand it much longer I beg of you not to think lightly of my story for the thing that stands between Allan Morris and myself is deadly As I watch him I can see that his heart is breaking his health is failing there is a look of fear in his eyes She reached forward and her hand rested upon the sleeve of Ashton Kirk He is at the mercy of this mocking monster that I have described to you It is killing him and through him it is killing me Help me please Ashton Kirk smiled reassuringly As far as I can see said he the case is a simple one However it may turn out the reverse But in either event I can promise you a swift and energetic attempt to set the matter right Thank you She stood up And you will begin to day At once You are kind She held out her hand he took it Thank you again Stumph appeared in answer to the bell She turned to go There is nothing more that you can tell me he inquired Nothing I had supposed that Your recital sounded pretty complete When the door closed upon her he stood for a few moments in the middle of the floor his head bent forward his hands behind him Then he turned and touched another of the system of bells Immediately a brisk boyish looking young man presented himself Fuller spoke Ashton Kirk I want instant and complete information upon one Hume a local numismatist and Allan Morris consulting engineer Very well sir And Fuller turned at once and left the room CHAPTER III THE PORTRAITS OF GENERAL WAYNE When Ashton Kirk returned that evening from the theatre where he had gone to witness a much heralded new drama he sat with a cigar in his library and stretching out his length in great comfort he smoked and smiled and thought of what he had seen and heard The drama as a medium of expression is necessarily limited the young man was saying to himself and of course in fitting human action to its narrow bounds the dramatist is sometimes tempted to ignore certain human elements In spots the people of the play acted like puppets upon seven different occasions by actual count the entire matter would have been cleared up if someone had sharply spoken his mind But he did not and the thing was allowed to become hopelessly involved because of it He knocked the ashes from his cigar and a smile came to his lips It would not have served the purpose of the dramatist I suppose his play would have ended abruptly and far short of the prescribed time He tried to tell a human story and chose an unhuman method There was another pause the smile now disappeared and a thoughtful look came into his face And yet he mused is the playwright really so far wrong Is his stage story very far removed from actuality after all In Miss Edyth Vale we have a girl of most unusual character of splendid education apparently And yet in the building of her own drama she has outstripped the inventor of stage plays in the matter of hesitancy Her natural inclination urged her to make a firm stand but other feelings proved the stronger and she held her tongue much after the fashion of the girl in the play He was puffing at a second cigar when there came a knock on the door and Fuller entered Well said Ashton Kirk I thought you d perhaps like to look over this data before morning said the young man as he laid a number of typed sheets and a photograph at Ashton Kirk s elbow As you required instant action I got Burgess on the Hume end of it before noon after luncheon I took up Morris myself Thank you said the other Morris with a nod toward the photograph is rather uneventful personally And it was no very difficult matter to get the facts concerning him But Burgess had a much more interesting time Hume seems to have lots of color as a character Not that there was a great deal shown the time was too short But the indications are promising When Fuller had gone Ashton Kirk took up the sheets and began to read them carefully They were brief pointed and evidently the work of men who were familiar enough with their business to eliminate all non essentials The first one ran Allan Barnett Morris Consulting Engineer Specialty Marine Construction Lives at the Crompton Apartments Born October fifteen eighteen seventy nine Graduate of Cornell class of nineteen hundred Special honors Brilliant student Was at once engaged by the New England Ship Building Company Soon became their right hand man Resigned in nineteen oh five took offices in the Blake Building Is much employed by the Government Has the reputation of a growing man in his line and is admitted by competent persons to be an expert He is unmarried and has no relatives The last of these to die was his father a trifle more than three years ago The father had a reputation for great brilliancy and hard drinking He was an inventor of some note See the Morris Smoke Consumer the Morris Propeller the Morris Automatic Brake But he never made much out of any of these The appetite for liquor forced him to surrender for very little interests that made fortunes for other men Young Morris is clear of the drink habit and is a hard and persistent worker He is a member of the University and the Brookdale Field Clubs goes into society and is reported to be the accepted suitor of Miss Edyth Vale daughter of the late James Vale manufacturer of structural steel A clean bill of health as far as it goes commented Ashton Kirk However surface inquiries tell very little sometimes He turned to the remaining pages David Purtell Hume Numismatist philatelist dealer in objects of art and curiosities Resides at his place of business second floor of four hundred seventy eight Christie Place Hume located in this city in eighteen ninety nine Where he came from is not definitely known but there is some slight cause for supposing that he is an American who had been living abroad However an examination of the steamship passenger lists for eighteen ninety eight ninety nine fail to show his name Is well known in his line and is reputed to be wealthy Is much disliked by his neighbors and others in the same trade Even those who patronize him have an aversion to him but as he is an authority and his stock always contains rarities they do not take their custom elsewhere Hume has been under suspicion upon several occasions But the police could gather no positive evidence against him at any time The robbery of the Hailesbury gallery at London when the famous Whistler portrait of the Duchess of Winterton was cut from its frame was traced almost to his door But the scent died out before they could clinch the matter and he escaped It was believed that the thing was planned by him and executed by a confederate Several other occurrences of like nature but of less importance have been laid against him But if he was concerned in them he was always cunning enough to hide his tracks He is an habitual drinker of violent temper and is reputed to have a positive genius for discovering raw spots in an acquaintance and goading him for the sheer joy of seeing him writhe It is this trait that causes the general dislike for him in the Christie Place section He is a free liver spends much money and has a passion for music Ashton Kirk laid down the sheets and threw away his cigar As Fuller remarked mister Hume seems to be a colorful character And apparently one that would be likely to lead mister Allan Morris a very lively dance if he had a hold of any sort upon him He arose to his feet a pleased light in his eye and began walking up and down the floor It is more than likely that it will prove some trifle that Morris fears have lifted to the plane of a tragedy But somehow the parts of the case seem to fall in a promising manner I get a sort of pleasure in anticipating a possible grapple with mister David Purtell Hume For a full hour Ashton Kirk moved up and down the library his eyes half closed varying expressions appearing and disappearing upon his face At length there came a smile of satisfaction and he paused in his pacing That is probably it said he At any rate it is a very favorable coincidence However I must have more information than the hurried reports of Burgess and Fuller to be certain Yes this promises to be interesting With that he went to his room and to bed The dull gray of a damp spring morning was peering in at his window when he awoke By the light he knew that it was hours before his usual time Something had aroused him but he could not say what He sat up in bed and as he did so there came the long continued and smothered ringing of a bell The telephone said he R r r r ring g it persisted And then again R r r r ring ing ing R r r ring Ashton Kirk heard a door open and close softly on the floor above then slippered feet came pat patting down the stairs The wild rattle of the bell suddenly stopped a muffled voice could be heard protesting dismally against the din But suddenly the vague complaint gave way to a higher note Alarm said Ashton Kirk Something has happened He reached up and turned on the electric bulb that hung above his head then he drew his feet up under him after the fashion of a Turk and waited calmly The padded steps swiftly approached his door a sharp knock sounded on the panels Well demanded the young man There is an urgent call sir came the voice of Stumph on the telephone It s the lady who called yesterday Miss Vale Ashton Kirk slipped from the bed a step brought him to the door which he threw open Very well Stumph said he quietly You may go back to bed The grave faced German went stolidly down the hall the young man pulled on a pair of felt slippers in the library he put the detached receiver to his ear and spoke evenly Well Miss Vale There was a small gasping exclamation from the wire a sort of breath catching flutter of sound such as a person might utter who had been running hard Then Edyth Vale her voice shaking and filled with fear said Oh Is that you I m glad glad Get a firm grip on yourself advised Ashton Kirk If anything has happened we can no doubt remedy it There came a series of moaning sobs across the wire the girl had evidently broken down and was crying Ashton Kirk said nothing he waited patiently Finally she spoke once more What has happened can never be remedied Then her voice sank so low that he could scarcely catch the breathless words There has been murder done The investigator felt the blood prickle beneath his skin However his voice was steady as he replied his calmly working mind shook off the fear which she so strongly suggested Who has been murdered he asked The man whom I told you about yesterday the numismatist Hume Ah Ashton Kirk drew in a long breath and his eyes began to glow There was an instant s pause then he said The hour is rather unconventional but if you will receive me I ll have you tell me about this matter privately and at once By all means she answered eagerly I was about to beg of you to come In a half hour said he briefly Good by He hung up the receiver and touched one of the buttons When Stumph came he said Turn the cold water into my bath Then order the car in haste Yes sir Afterwards you can lay out a rough suit heavy shoes and a soft hat Instantly sir Within twenty minutes Ashton Kirk ran down the steps and sprang into the powerful looking car that awaited him and well within the half hour he rang the bell at the marble palace built by the steel magnate during the last years of his life A heavy eyed man servant admitted him with astonished resentment Miss Vale looking very tall and very pale met him in the hall But for all her pallor she seemed quite collected even smiling Oh I m so sorry to have brought you out so early and on such a dismal morning she said lightly leading him into a room at one side I m sure it is very damp She sat down and motioned him to a chair he studied her with some surprise the transition from wild terror to her present calm was most notable There has been a recovery of poise evidently Ashton Kirk told himself She is still frightened but for some reason is anxious to hide it This morning said Miss Vale with a laugh that rang perfectly I found that I was only a woman after all This this dreadful thing so startled me that for a time I did not know what to do My first impulse was to call you and I acted upon it But with a pretty gesture of apology when I had recovered myself somewhat I saw that I had disturbed you unnecessarily You don t mean that after all Hume is not She held up her hand for him to stop A strong shudder seemed to run through her she bent her head so that the light would not fall too strongly upon her face In a moment however she recovered Yes yes she said her voice perfectly under control He is dead shockingly murdered What I mean is that while the event is very dreadful still it does not really concern me more than any other crime of the same nature which we see staring at us from the columns of the newspapers every day This man s being in my mind so much of late caused me to become unnerved when I heard the news When did it occur Sometime since midnight There was a silence Miss Vale arose and began to pace the room The long white cloak that had draped her fell away she wore a ball dress and her arms and shoulders shone splendidly under the lights How did you hear of it asked Ashton Kirk There was a scarcely perceptible hesitancy then she answered Through the newspapers We were returning from missus Barron s about three o clock The papers had just come out and I felt a curiosity to see them wet from the press When I reached home the first thing that caught my eye was the account of Hume s death Did you call me up at once Yes As I have said it was the first thing that occurred to me And again I beg your pardon for having disturbed you uselessly Ashton Kirk gestured this aside It may be that the affair will turn out to have some interesting features said he And with that possibility in view I am rather pleased than not in having an opportunity of getting so early upon the ground She paused in her pacing and turned upon him a startled look You do not mean to go there to Christie Place she said Illustration YOU DO NOT MEAN TO GO THERE I may as well I may be of use He looked at her for a moment steadily then asked Do you know of any reason why I should not go Instantly the startled look vanished a smile lit up the pale face wanly Of course not she cried You are interested in dreadful happenings I had forgotten that I suppose you are really quite delighted and instead of my craving pardon I should be expecting praise for putting you in the way of this one She laughed lightly a smile flitted across his keen face as he rose and said What has happened may make a change in the affairs of Allan Morris She came to him and laid a hand upon his arm Her coolness won his admiration I beg of you to forget all that I told you yesterday she said I had been brooding so long that I had begun to fancy all sorts of impossible things I see very clearly now that this man Hume could have had nothing of any consequence to do with mister Morris It was a romance a rather foolish fancy and a very wild one There was sweet seriousness in her manner and the lurking smile still hovered about her lips It was as though a return to reason had driven away the fears of the day before the alarmed girl had given place to a sensible woman But behind all this Ashton Kirk could detect something else The almost swooning terror of the girl who had spoken to him over the telephone was still there held rigidly in check to be sure but unquestionably there While her lips smiled the eyes sometimes betrayed her and there was a tenseness about her that almost screamed Her good by was soft and kindly spoken she held out her hand frankly and thanked him for his interest There was nothing hurried in her manner it was all smoothly and leisurely done And yet he felt that if she had followed the impulse that filled her she would have taken him by the shoulder and bundled him from the room in order that she might be alone Alone to think he said as he got into his car at the curb But to think about what Aloud he said to the driver Christie Place By this time the early workers were beginning to thicken in the street street cars were more frequent the dull night hum of the city was growing in volume The spark had set the car s engine throbbing heavily and the driver was about to start when a second vehicle drew up and Ashton Kirk found himself looking into the alarmed face of young Pendleton Heavens Kirk cried the newcomer as he leaped out has anything serious happened To whom asked the investigator quietly his eyes fixed upon the young man s face To Edyth of course Has any thing been seen of her I have just left her she seemed a bit agitated but perfectly well A look of relief crossed Pendleton s face Oh said he All right I was beginning to think that something was up You see and here he lowered his voice I danced with her about midnight at missus Barron s about two o clock her aunt missus Page came to me in great distress and said she was strangely missing She had slipped away somewhere without a word Ashton Kirk looked at him keenly Of course it was up to me to find her said Pendleton but my efforts were without result Her car was gone and the man said Miss Vale had called it about one o clock also that she had driven away in it alone At this news missus Page grew quite ill and I brought her home here in my car Then I departed upon a vague sort of search As the matter was to be kept perfectly quiet and I was to ask no questions of anybody you can imagine how much chance I had of doing anything But if she s at home it s all right At sight of you I thought it had proved to be something alarming and that they had sent for you I was sent for said Ashton Kirk dryly but not to hunt for Miss Vale Now jump in here and come along I ve got a little matter that may be of interest I haven t had breakfast said Pendleton but there s always something piquant to your little affairs I ll go you He dismissed his own car and climbed into that of his friend As they whirled up the street Ashton Kirk suddenly directed his driver to stop Then he called to a man with a great bundle of newspapers who stood calling them monotonously upon a corner Again the car started with the investigator deep in the sheaf of papers which he had purchased Page after page failed to reveal anything to his practised glance at length he swept them to the floor of the car A smile was upon his lips the smile of a man who had received a nod of approval from Circumstances The first edition of the morning dailies lacks interest he said A crime of some moment can be committed between midnight and dawn and not a line appear in type concerning it until the later issues Pendleton looked at him with mock disapproval One would suppose said he that you had expected to find some such criminal narrative in those and he indicated the discarded newspapers There were reasons why I should answered Ashton Kirk And very good reasons too But and he laughed a little for all that I had an indefinite sort of feeling that I should not find it This may sound a trifle queer but nevertheless it is true The account was to have been of a murder accused Pendleton I can see it in your face so don t take the trouble to deny it I had hoped that your plunge into what you styled the literature of assassination would not last that a good night s rest would turn your thoughts into another groove Perhaps it would have been so said Ashton Kirk But things have happened in the meantime And you don t appear at all put out that they have done so That is possibly the most distressing feature of the business If anything you seem rather pleased Of course an odd murder or so is to be expected in the ordinary course of events but one hardly counts upon one s intimates being concerned in them It is disconcerting He crossed his legs and pursed up his lips If you don t mind added he now that I have expressed myself I ll listen to the details of whatever you have in view There is not a great deal to tell said Ashton Kirk A man has been murdered in Christie Place It happens that I have an interest in the matter otherwise I would not think of dipping into it Pendleton looked at him reproachfully After all then exclaimed he you are but a dilettante Assassination in the abstract is well enough but you have a disposition to shirk practical examples I have been deceived Christie Place was some distance west and ran off from a much frequented street It was notable for the wilderness of sign boards that flared from each side The buildings were apparently let out in floors and each lessee endeavored to outdo his neighbor in proclaiming his business to the passing public The lower floors were for the most part occupied by small grocers dealers in notions barbers confectioners and such like What a crowded narrow little place commented Pendleton as the car turned into the street The air in the street seemed to him heavy About midway in the block a small group stood about a doorway from a window above swung a sign bearing the name of Hume The car stopped here Ashton Kirk and his friend got out the group at the doorway parted and a big man stepped forward Why hello said he cordially You re the last person I was looking for How did you hear about this Good morning Osborne said Ashton Kirk shaking the big man s hand I m glad to find you in charge I got it in an unusual sort of way and came down to have a look Osborne though in plain clothes was emphatically a policeman His square face his big frame his dogged expression somehow conveyed the impression as plainly as words It must have been unusual said he because even the reporters haven t got it yet headquarters is keeping it quiet until the chief gets in Ashton Kirk looked vastly pleased Excellent said he to Pendleton We ll have a look at the place before it has lost the atmosphere of the crime Then to Osborne May we go up Sure answered the other readily Only don t pull things around any That young fellow that they ve elected coroner is awful touchy about such things He wants to be first always Nothing of importance shall be disturbed promised Ashton Kirk Then motioning Pendleton to follow he ascended the flight that led to the second floor It was narrow and dusty as Miss Vale had said The walls were smutted the hand rail felt greasy the air was stale A passage dim and windowless ran the depth of the building from the front there came a patch of daylight through a ground glass door Upon this latter could be easily read the words DAVID P HUME NUMISMATIST PHILATELIST ART CURIOSITIES A policeman stood at the head of the stairs smoking a cigar in an informal way All right said he if Osborne let you come up I ve got nothing to say He s the boss Have you looked over the place Just a glance The floor has been fitted up as an apartment Hume occupied all the rooms The body pointing to the front room is in there Thanks Ashton Kirk turned the knob of the door nearest the one with the lettering upon it The room was without windows the investigator closed the door and lighted the gas Just a moment said he The door leading to the front room stood wide He disappeared through this for a moment when he returned his face wore a tightened expression his eyes were swift and eager This is a sort of store room I should say spoke Pendleton Pictures hung about upon the walls and stood packed in corners statues of bronze marble and plaster were on every side brass bas reliefs rugs of Eastern design and great price antique armor coin cabinets ponderous stamp albums Japanese paintings and carvings and a host of queer and valuable objects fairly crammed every inch of space I had heard that Hume was wealthy commented Ashton Kirk And this seems to prove it This room contains value enough to satisfy a fairly reasonable person The two young men passed through into what appeared to be a kitchen There was an ill kept range upon one side cluttered with cooking things A bare oaken table of the Jacobean period held the remains of a meal A massive Dutch side board covered with beautiful carving stood facing them every inch of available space upon it was crowded with bottles decanters and glasses The gentleman was not averse to an occasional nip at any rate said Pendleton And his taste was rather educated too examining the sideboard s contents carefully The best was none too good for him Beyond this again was a bedroom The bed was a huge Flemish affair and also elaborately carved over it was a spreading Genoese canopy which through lack of care had grown dusty and tattered Rich old rugs were spread upon the neglected floor a beautiful Louis Quinze table had its top covered with discolored rings made by the bottoms of glasses and the lighted ends of cigars had burned spots on it The bed of a prince and the floor coverings of a duke said Pendleton with indignation And used much as a coal heaver would use them Now this table is really a scandal If its owner has been murdered I don t wonder at it Some outraged lover of such things has probably taken the law into his own hands But Ashton Kirk was paying little attention to the things that appalled Pendleton Look said he He indicated the walls Here and there the plaster was broken as though some fastened object had been violently torn away At one place an empty picture frame its glass smashed hung askew from a hook As Pendleton caught sight of other empty frames littered about the room the glass of each broken their pictures torn out he exclaimed in astonishment Hello Someone has torn them down and smashed them What an extraordinary thing to do The pictures mostly engravings but with here and there a painting were strewn about Ashton Kirk carefully gathered them up and spread them upon the table They were by various hands but unquestionably represented the same person a handsome resolute looking man in the uniform of an officer in the army of Washington General Anthony Wayne said Ashton Kirk softly There was something in the tone that made Pendleton look at him swiftly The splendid head was bent over the portraits eagerness blazed in the dark eyes the keen face was rigid with interest Some drunken freak do you think asked Pendleton more to hear his friend s view than anything else But Ashton Kirk shook his head On the contrary the thing seems full of a vague meaning said he There were seventeen pictures upon the walls of this room fourteen have been torn down and destroyed the other three are undisturbed Pendleton gazed at the pictures that remained upon the walls Two were of fine looking houses of the colonial type the third was the portrait of a man a man of repulsive sneering face heavy with evil lines and with unusually small eyes If they had destroyed that one it would have had some meaning to me commented Pendleton But as it is I hardly think I follow you The meaning that I find replied Ashton Kirk lies in the fact that the pictures violently used were those of General Wayne only Mark that fact That they were deliberately selected for destruction is beyond question How do you make that out It is simple If this were a mere random stripping of the room of its pictures all would have suffered Look indicating a spot in the wall here is a place where the plaster is broken A hook had been driven here to hold one of the portraits and the breaking of the plaster shows that some determination was required to tear the picture down Yet next this is an engraving of an old mansion which remains untouched The next four again were portraits of the General and all have been demolished Pendleton nodded That s true said he Whoever did this was after the Revolutionary hero alone But why Ashton Kirk smiled We ll look into matters a little further said he Perhaps there are facts to be gathered that will shed some light upon the things that we have already seen They repassed through the other rooms with his hand upon the frame of the door leading to the show room Ashton Kirk paused Better brace yourself for rather a shocking sight said he to his friend Go on said Pendleton quietly CHAPTER IV STILLMAN S THEORY There were four good sized windows in the show room all overlooking the street It was a large square place and as Miss Vale had said literally stuffed with odd carvings pottery of a most freakish sort and weird bric a brac Two large modern safes stood at one side behind a long show case spread with ancient coins At the end of this case was a carpeted space railed in and furnished with a great flat topped desk Upon the floor at the foot of the desk and with three separate streams of blood creeping away from it lay the huddled ghastly figure of a man Pendleton though he had been warned felt his breath catch and his skin grow cold and damp Heavens said he under his breath It s the man whose picture we saw inside there on the wall Even the shock of death could not so it seemed drive the sneer from the thick lips mockery was frozen in the dead eyes What a beast he must have been went on Pendleton Like a satyr I don t think I ever saw just that type of face before Ashton Kirk was bending over the body suddenly he raised himself There is a heavy bruise on the forehead said he He was felled first then bayoneted Bayoneted Pendleton peered at the body There it is sticking from his chest Ashton Kirk drew aside the breast of the dead man s coat and his companion caught sight of a bronze hilt The broad sword like blade had been driven completely home If we attempted to move the body said the investigator I should not be surprised if we found it pinned to the floor It took brawn to give that stroke the man who dealt it made sure of the job With soft quick steps he crossed the room The doors of the safes were locked If the purpose was robbery said Ashton Kirk the criminal evidently knew where to look for the most portable and valuable articles There seems to be no indication of anything having been tampered He stopped short his eyes upon a huge vellum covered tome which lay open upon the floor He whistled softly between his teeth General Wayne once more he said The volume as far as Pendleton could see was a sort of scrap book in which had been fastened a great number of prints Upon the two pages that they could see six prints had been affixed by the corners Of these four had been torn out and lay upon the floor Gambetta and John Bright have been spared said Ashton Kirk pointing at the book but and he gathered up the fragments of the mishandled prints upon Mad Anthony they laid violent hands four separate times Pendleton wrinkled his brow Now what the deuce can it mean he asked vexedly Not only what did the fellow mean who did this but what did he mean pointing at the dead man by having so many portraits of General Wayne I think something might be found to point the way if we could only look for it said Ashton Kirk his face alight with eagerness But we ll have to await the coroner s people When will they come The investigator shrugged his shoulders Probably not for hours he answered However as the coroner himself appears to be new in the office he may be more anxious to get his work over with than the usual official In the mean time we d better go down and have a talk with Osborne If I remain here I ll succumb to temptation go rummaging about and so get myself into trouble He turned the knob of the door with the ground glass panel but it was fast They passed into the store room and so out into the hall Any signs of the people from the coroner s office asked Ashton Kirk of the policeman who stood there Someone just drove up a minute ago answered the man I hear him down there talking to Osborne now Ashton Kirk was about to go down when there came a tramping on the stairs The big figure of the headquarters detective was first after him came a nervous important looking young man and a stolid faced old one With a large gesture Osborne laid his hand upon Ashton Kirk s shoulder mister Stillman said he to the nervous looking young man this is mister Ashton Kirk I guess you ve heard of him The important manner of the young coroner visibly increased as he held out his hand I have heard of you frequently sir he stated firmly and I am quite delighted to meet you More especially sir at a time like this A very nasty looking affair returned the investigator Osborne has been good enough to let me glance about in explanation I trust said Stillman that you have disturbed nothing Except for gathering up a few scattered pictures in the bedroom we have done nothing but look assured Ashton Kirk I find that the exact conditions must remain if we are to secure even a fairly good idea of the crime s environments stated Stillman nervously It is a thing that I insist upon from the police in every instance Sure sure said Osborne Headquarters does its best never to make trouble for you mister Stillman The nervous young coroner seemed to be relieved to hear this He waved his hand in a gesture that might have meant anything and turned to the stolid looking elderly man who accompanied them They conversed for a few moments the stolid man seemed to be explaining something carefully to which Stillman listened with the utmost attention Osborne bent his head toward Ashton Kirk The old party is a left over in the coroner s office of many years standing said the detective He knows the ropes and puts the newly elected ones on to the points of the game Stillman finally turned there was an added importance in his manner and his nervousness had also increased mister Osborne said he please let us have what facts the police have gathered That won t take long said Osborne Just before daylight three o clock I think she said the woman whom Hume employed to scrub the passage way and stairs got here She has almost a dozen such jobs in the neighborhood and as she must have them all done before business begins she s compelled to get at it early She has a key to the street door so she let herself in came up these stairs and started for the far end of the hall where there is a water tap She didn t notice anything unusual until she returned with her pail filled then she saw this door pointing to that of the store room standing open I see said mister Stillman and he gazed very hard at the door Hume according to the scrub woman s story resumed the big man was a queer kind of a chap You didn t always know just how to take him He s lapped up a good bit of booze first and last and sometimes he s come home pretty well settled So when the woman sees the door open this is the first thing that enters her mind But to make sure she goes into the room and calls him by name The room s dark and there s just a touch of daylight coming in through the open door leading into the front room So as there was no answer she takes a peep in there and sees him on the floor And is that all she can tell Yes except that she bolted down the stairs in a hurry met Paulson here with a nod to the policeman who had now discarded his cigar and told him what she had seen What is her name and address Osborne consulted a note book missus Dwyer seventy one Cormant Street read he Please make a note of that said Stillman to his clerk And send for her later in the day Then turning once more to Osborne he continued Before doing anything else we will endeavor to find out how the criminal gained an entrance That s the way with these Johnnie Newcomers grumbled Osborne as Stillman turned once more to his aide They want to do it all Why don t he go in look at the body and leave the police business to the police Too much earnestness may have its drawbacks said Ashton Kirk but it is to be preferred to the perfunctory methods of the accustomed official for all From your angle maybe so said Osborne with a frown but not from ours Stillman began rubbing his palms together with what was intended to be business like briskness he stepped up and down the dark hall peering right and left But for all his assumption of confidence his nervousness was very apparent You say said he to Osborne that the scrubwoman unlocked the street door Very good That shows that it was fast at all events Now what other means are there of entering the building None except by the fire escapes and windows But the windows on this floor are all secured except for those at the front Except for those at the front The young coroner paused in his hand rubbing Would it not have been possible for the person or persons who did this murder to enter by one of those It would have been possible returned the big headquarters man but no sane person would do it They d have to swarm up the face of the building in full view of anyone that might be passing at the time Exactly said Stillman stiffening under what he was half inclined to consider a rebuff Well that eliminates that possibility Now to the next one Who occupied the building besides the murdered man A man named Berg keeps a delicatessen store on the first floor His place in no way communicates with the rest of the building The third and fourth floors are used for storage purposes by a furrier Except in the spring and fall so missus Dwyer tells me he seldom visits the building Is there any way of getting in from the top of the house the roof asked the coroner A look of something like respect came into Osborne s face Clearly the question was one which he considered worth while There is a scuttle he replied The bolt is rusted and broken it has probably not been fastened for months perhaps years Now we are beginning to come at something cried Stillman well pleased In all probability the assassin entered by way of the scuttle He turned as though for the approval of the stolid faced man Eh Curran What do you think of that It looks very like it mister Stillman At all events spoke the coroner we will now examine the rooms He advanced and tried the door of the show room Ah locked said he He turned and entered the store room the others following The gas was still burning the coroner stuck a pair of big lensed eyeglasses upon his rather high nose and gazed about him intently There seems to be nothing of an informing nature here said he after a time Where is the body Osborne led the way into the front room After a glance at the ghastly huddled figure upon the carpet near the desk the coroner took a careful survey of the apartment Did mister Hume employ any person to assist him he asked The scrub woman told me that there was a young man here always when she came during the business day for her wages A sort of clerk she thought He will be able to tell us if anything has been disturbed no doubt remarked Stillman Then he examined the body minutely In the pockets were found a wallet containing a large sum of money a massive old fashioned gold watch with a chain running from pocket to pocket of the waist coat Upon the little finger of Hume s left hand was a magnificent diamond Worth two thousand if it s worth a cent appraised Osborne If the criminal had meant robbery these things would unquestionably have been taken commented the young coroner Eh Curran That is a very safe rule to go by mister Stillman replied his assistant with the utmost stolidity Through his big lenses the coroner gazed curiously at the bronze haft protruding from the dead man s chest A bayonet said he Not a common weapon in a crime like this In fact I should say it was rather in the nature of an innovation It probably belonged in Hume s stock suggested Osborne There seems to be about everything here But Stillman shook his head We have already about concluded that the intention of the criminal was not robbery stated he And now if we make up our minds that the bayonet belonged to Hume that the assassin in point of fact came here without a weapon it must be that he did not intend murder either Maybe he didn t ventured Osborne There might have been a sudden quarrel The person who struck that blow may have grabbed up the first competent looking thing that came to his hand Stillman turned to Ashton Kirk That sounds reasonable enough eh Very much so replied Ashton Kirk A bayonet is a most unusual weapon said the coroner thoughtfully readjusting his glasses And I think it would be a most awkward thing to carry around with one Therefore it would be a most unlikely choice for an intending assassin I am of the opinion nervously that we may safely say that it was a sudden quarrel which ended in this and he gestured with both hands toward the body The safe doors were tried and found locked a cash register was opened and found to contain what had been apparently the receipts of the day before An examination of the cabinets and cases disclosed hundreds of ancient coins and other articles the value of which must have been heavy But their orderly array had not been disturbed A long curtain of faded green material hung from the wall at one side as though to screen something from the sunlight and dust What have we here said the coroner He stepped across the store and whisked the curtain aside A large gilt frame was disclosed and from it hung the slashed remains of a canvas Hello exclaimed Osborne with interest This begins to look like one of the old affairs that they say Hume s been mixed up in Somebody s tried to cut that picture from the frame They examined it carefully A keen knife had been run around the top and both sides close to the frame The painting hung down its gray back displayed forlornly Stillman regarded it with great satisfaction Here said he we at least have a possible motive Ashton Kirk took a twisted walking stick from a rack and with the end of it raised the slashed canvas so that its subject could be seen It was a heroic equestrian figure of an officer of the American Revolution His sword was drawn his face shone with the light of battle Pendleton was just about to cry out General Wayne when the stick fell from his friend s hand the canvas dropping to its former position While the others were trying to get it into place once more Ashton Kirk whispered to Pendleton Say nothing This is their turn let them work in their own way I will begin where they have finished After a little time spent in a gratified inspection of the painting Stillman said But gentlemen let us have a look at the other rooms There may be something more They re passed through the store room and into the living room Nothing here took the coroner s attention and they entered the bedroom Both these last had doors leading into the hall upon their being tried they were found to be locked The smashed pictures upon the bedroom floor at once took the eye of Stillman He regarded the broken places in the plaster and prodded the slivers of wood and glass with the toe of his shoe with much complacency This completes the story declared he It is now plain from end to end The criminal entered the building from the roof made his way down stairs and gained admittance through the door which the scrub woman found unlocked His purpose was to steal the painting in the front room In a struggle with Hume who unexpectedly came upon him the intruder killed him Not knowing the exact location of the picture he wanted he first looked for it here The light probably being bad he tore down every picture he could reach in order to get a better view of it When at last he had found the desired work he set about cutting it from its frame But before he had finished something alarmed him and he fled without the prize The stolid man listened to this with marked approval Even Osborne reluctantly whispered to Pendleton He s doped it out I didn t think it was in him After a little more the coroner said to his clerk I think that is about all Curran see to it that the post mortem is not delayed Put a couple of our men on the case have them make extensive inquiries in the neighborhood Any persons who appear to possess information may be brought to my office at three o clock Especially I desire to see this missus Dwyer Berg who keeps the store on the ground floor and the young man who was employed by Hume I ll empanel a jury later He took off his eye glasses placed them in a case and in turn carefully slipped this into his pocket At three o clock he repeated If I should not be intruding said Ashton Kirk I should like to be present Stillman smiled with the air of a man triumphant but who still desired to show charity I shall be pleased to see you sir he said then or at any other time CHAPTER V STILLMAN ASKS QUESTIONS It wanted a few minutes of three o clock when Ashton Kirk still accompanied by the curious Pendleton walked into the outer room of the coroner s suite mister Stillman will be here at any moment now said Curran Then lowering his voice and making a short little gesture from the elbow he added These people are the ones he wanted to see As he and Pendleton sat down Ashton Kirk looked at the persons referred to The first was a thin wiry little woman unmistakably Irish cleanly dressed and with sharp inquisitive eyes Engaged in a low pitched conversation with her was a thick necked German heavy of paunch and with a fat red face The third was a spectacled young Jew poring over a huge volume which he seemed to have brought with him He had a tremendous head of curling black hair his clothing was shabby There was a rapt expression upon his face plainly nothing existed for him at that moment outside the pages of his book After a brief space the coroner came in Ah how do you do gentlemen greeted he He was good natured and strove to be easy but his natural nervousness clung to him I am glad to see you He looked at Curran and nodded at the three inquiringly Yes sir replied the clerk these are the parties Then we will get down to business He opened a door and entered an inner room Will you come in he asked of Ashton Kirk and Pendleton They followed him at once and Curran addressing the little Irishwoman said Now missus Dwyer this way please She arose briskly and also entered the inner room Stillman seated himself at a desk and carefully perched his glasses upon his nose I perhaps take more trouble than is customary in these cases he said to Ashton Kirk It is usual to hear statements I believe only when they are proffered as testimony at the inquest But it seems to me that the office should be carried on in a more thorough way Preparation I think is necessary to get at the facts Then he faced the woman who had taken a chair beside the desk Your full name please said he Honora Dwyer I m a widow with four children I live at seventy one Cormant Street an me husban has been dead these three years declared she in a breath Stillman smiled You don t believe in keeping anything back missus Dwyer I can see that said he And a very good trait it is He leaned back in his swivel chair and looked at her through the glasses You are the person who discovered the body of mister Hume are you not Yes sir I were replied missus Dwyer and God spare me such another sight Tell us about it said the coroner I work as scrub woman for a good many in Christie Place an the immejeat neighborhood said missus Dwyer genteelly But I always gets to mister Hume s first You are quite sure you found the street door locked Yes sir And you noticed nothing unusual about the place Only the open door to the store room sir mister Hume was always particular about closing up sir For a man who was in the habit of taking a sup of drink sir I ll say he was very particular When you noticed the door being open you went in at once I suppose No sir I did not After I got me water I set down on the top step to get me breath When I saw the door stan nin open thinks I to meself thinks I mister Hume is up early this mornin But everything was quiet as the grave in a hushed dramatic tone Sorra the sound did I hear So I gets up and goes in And in the front room I sees him lyin mister Hume was never a handsome man sir and he d gained nothing in looks by the end he d met with God save us how I ever got out into the street I ll never know She rocked to and fro and fanned herself with her apron It must have been a very severe shock missus Dwyer agreed the coroner Now after a pause do you know anything however slight mind you that would seem to point to who did this thing missus Dwyer shook her head Me acquaintance with mister Hume was a business one only sir she said I never set foot into his place further than the hall except on the days when I went to get me pay and this morning save us from harm You know nothing of his friends then of his habits There is the Jew boy outside there that worked for him He s a nice good mannered little felly and is the only person I ever see in the office when I went there barrin the boss himself As for mister Hume s habits I can say only what everybody knows He were drunk when he engaged me and he were drunk the last time I seen him alive That will be all missus Dwyer said Stillman Thank you Curran I ll see the young man next As Curran and missus Dwyer went out the young coroner turned to his two visitors I am still assured that we have the motive for the crime in the attempt to steal the painting he said But it will do no harm to get all the light we can upon every side of the matter The smallest clue importantly may prove of the utmost value at the inquest Ashton Kirk smilingly nodded his entire assent to this Then Curran showed in the clerk The young man still carried the thick volume and when he sat down laid it upon a corner of Stillman s desk Its back was turned toward Ashton Kirk and he noted that it was a work on anatomy such as first year medical students use What is your name please asked the coroner Isidore Brolatsky replied the young man You are or were employed by mister Hume As a clerk yes sir I ve been with him for some years Brolatsky spoke with scarcely a trace of accent He didn t pay much but then there wasn t much to do and I had plenty of time to study Ah said Stillman encouragingly To study eh Yes I ve taken up medicine There s a college up town that has night classes I have been attending the lectures there and reading during the day There s a big chance for physicians who can speak Yiddish Not only to make money but to do good I see The coroner regarded him reflectively for a moment Now mister Brolatsky having worked for Hume for some years you must have picked up some details as to his business and himself Suppose you tell us all you know about both The dark face of Brolatsky became thoughtful mister Hume was a hard man to get along with he said He seemed ready to quarrel at any time with anybody I don t recall a customer ever coming into the store that he didn t have some kind of trouble with before they went out But he had a great knowledge of the things he dealt in People came from far and near to get his opinion on items in their collections His fees with appreciation were large But there is one thing that I noticed about him While he knew all about objects of art he did not seem to care for them He had no love for his trade no sympathy I may say for the collectors who came to him I wouldn t be going far from the truth if I said that he thought them all fools for paying their money for such things And I know that he mocked them Humph Stillman looked at Ashton Kirk with surprise upon his face That seems odd Men usually go into Hume s business through love of it He turned once more to Brolatsky And he had no hobby of his own no collection that he fancied more than another Brolatsky nodded amusedly Yes he replied I was just coming to that He did have a collection that he called his own And he never sold an item from it as long as I was with him Indeed I think if anybody had offered to buy he would have come to blows with him Ashton Kirk bent forward For the first time since entering the room he spoke And what was the nature of that collection he inquired eagerly Portraits answered Isidore Brolatsky Prints lithographs mezzo tints engravings paintings it made no difference And all of the same person He had hundreds I guess and every one of them was of General Wayne Ashton Kirk leaned back in his chair with a faint breath of triumph When a portrait of General Wayne was offered him continued Brolatsky he never haggled over it He paid the price asked and seemed quite delighted to get it It was a standing joke in the trade that if you wanted to get even with mister Hume for driving a hard bargain with you all you had to do was to offer him a portrait of General Wayne I never saw him refuse one Even if he had dozens of duplicates which often happened still he d buy A look of great acuteness had settled upon the face of the young coroner There is a painting at one side of the show room said he It is under a large green curtain Is that of General Wayne It is replied the clerk And I believe that he valued it more than anything else that he owned Stillman laughed with pleasure Now said he to his visitors we are getting at it indeed Someone probably knew of the value he attached to this painting and planned to steal it perhaps for a ransom Hume has been suspected of doing this sort of thing himself before now He was supposed to have engaged someone to do the actual work I believe as in the case of the Whistler portrait of the Duchess of Winterton Suppose this someone and Stillman rapped his knuckles upon the edge of the desk excitedly took the notion to go into the picture stealing business of his own account Hume himself with his much prized portrait of General Wayne was ready at hand and so with a sweeping gesture what has happened has happened Pendleton much impressed looked at Ashton Kirk But the latter s thoughts seemed far away his eyes were fixed upon the wall his expression was of delighted anticipation Stillman also noticed this non attention to his reasoning and a little wrinkle of discontent appeared between his brows So he turned his gaze upon Brolatsky and spoke rather sharply Now as to mister Hume s intimates What do you know of them Isidore Brolatsky shifted in his chair his long fingers began to drum upon his knees I have known of the matter of the Whistler portrait said he but I never knew anything more about it than what I read in the newspapers It happened before my time I m not accusing you said Stillman I m asking you about Hume s friends The clerk considered There was no one that I ever saw or heard of that you could call his friend exactly said he at length He made game of people too much to have any I guess Had he no associates no one with whom he spent his time Brolatsky shook his head Perhaps so but then I was only in Christie Place during business hours I have heard that he frequently went out at night but where I do not know Was there no one who came to visit him while you were there during the day No one whom he spoke of in an intimate way Again the clerk shook his head Stillman began to appear nonplussed He looked at the other pondering and frowning through his glasses Who came most frequently to the store he inquired finally Why I think Antonio Spatola said Brolatsky Was he a customer The clerk smiled Oh no He s a street musician You may have seen him often about the city He plays the violin and carries some trained cockatoos upon a perch What was the nature of his business at Hume s If there was anything that mister Hume liked better than strong drink said the clerk it was music Antonio Spatola would come and play to him for hours at a time A lover of music who could stand the playing of a street musician for hours cried Stillman That s astonishing But protested Brolatsky Spatola is a splendid musician He s studied his instrument under the greatest masters in Paris Rome and other European cities He has played in the finest orchestras But he never could keep a position because of his temper He s told me himself that when aroused he doesn t know what he is doing I understand said the coroner What sort of relations existed between Hume and Spatola outside the music Were they friendly No sir I might say just the reverse For hours sometimes mister Hume would lie back in his chair with his eyes closed listening to the violin Then perhaps he d get up suddenly throw Antonio a dollar or so and tell him to get out Or maybe he d begin to jeer at him Antonio had an ambition to become a concert violinist Ole Bull and Kubelik had made great successes he said and so why not he This was usually the point mister Hume would take up in mocking him He d call him a curbstone fiddler and say that he ought to be playing at barn dances and Italian christenings instead of aspiring to the platform Spatola would get frantic with rage and fairly scream his resentment at these times Often mister Hume would have him bring his trained cockatoos And while he was making them go through their tricks mister Hume would call him a mountebank a side show fakir and other things and tell him that he ought to stick to that as a business for he could make a living at it where he would starve as a violinist I ve often seen Antonio go out trembling and white at the lips with rage Several times he s tried to injure mister Hume once he took out a knife Hah said the coroner That was the time mister Hume called him Mad Anthony I also remember that mister Hume pulled aside the curtain and showed him the large painting of General Wayne laughing and telling him that that was another Mad Anthony He was so successful that day in arousing Spatola that always after that when he was drunk he d call the Italian Mad Anthony and it never failed to infuriate him Do you know where this man Spatola lives In Christie Place sir just about half a dozen doors from the store I believe he rents a garret there or something Stillman seemed struck by this In view of the fact that the building was entered by way of the scuttle said he to Ashton Kirk I consider that a most interesting piece of information It may indeed prove so was the non committal reply Once more the discontented crease showed itself upon the coroner s forehead and again as he turned to Brolatsky his voice rose sharply Next to Antonio Spatola who came most to Hume s place while you were there The next most frequent caller returned the clerk was mister Allan Morris Ashton Kirk glancing at Pendleton saw him start And who queried the coroner is mister Allan Morris At first I took him to be a customer replied Brolatsky And perhaps he was He talked a great deal at times about engraved gems and would look at lists and works upon the subject But somehow I got the notion that that was not just what he came for What caused you to think that asked the coroner His manner partly and then the fact that there seemed something between mister Hume and him something that I never understood mister Morris was another one that the boss used to make game of Not so much as he would Spatola but still a good bit mister Morris always took it with a show of good temper but underneath I could see that he too was sometimes furious About what did Hume deride him That s what I never could quite make out It always seemed as though it was something that mister Morris wanted At first I got the notion that it was something that he wanted to buy and which mister Hume refused to sell but later I changed my mind There seemed to be more to it than appeared on the top Both were very secretive about it I understand Stillman s face wore a puzzled expression it was as though this latter development worried him But in a few moments he went on Do you know where this man Morris is to be found Oh yes He s quite well known Has an office in the Blake Building and is employed just now so I ve heard by the Navy Department You have visited Christie Place to day Yes sir Did the police have you look about Yes sir And so far as I can see nothing has been taken The weapon that Hume was killed with now Do you know anything about it did it belong to the store The bayonet No sir Are you sure of that earnestly Positive It was my duty to keep a complete list of everything we had in stock We had other sorts of arms but no such thing as a bayonet There were a few more questions but as they drew out nothing of interest Stillman signified to Brolatsky that the interview was at an end Now you will go with mister Curran to police headquarters on the next floor said he and tell them what you have told me about this Antonio Spatola Then he opened the door and stepped out Curran they heard him say importantly I want you to then the door closed cutting the sentence short Pendleton gazed fixedly at Ashton Kirk I say said he I m not up in this sort of thing at all I ve been putting two and two together and it s led me into a deuce of a state Ashton Kirk looked at him inquiringly there was expectancy in the investigator s eyes but he said nothing Perhaps you ll think that I m all kinds of a fool continued Pendleton and maybe I am But here are the things that I m trying to marshall in order I ll take them just as they happened He held up one hand and with the other began to check off the counts upon his fingers Yesterday you have a visit a visit of a professional nature from Edyth Vale Last night she strangely disappears for a time At a most unconventional hour this morning I find you at her door Then I learn that you are on your way to look into the details of a murder that you had just heard of somehow Now I hear that Allan Morris Edyth s fiance has been in rather an odd way upon familiar terms with the murdered man He paused as he checked this last count still regarding his friend fixedly I don t claim he went on after a moment that these things have anything to do with each other But somehow they ve got together in my mind and I can t Here the door re opened and Stillman entered followed by the big German Just take a chair mister Berg said the coroner seating himself at the desk and affixing his eyeglasses The German lowered his form into the chair indicated and folded his fat hands across his monstrous paunch Your name in full is what asked Stillman with formality Franz Berg I sell me delicatessen at four hundred seventy eight Christie Place I haf been there for fifteen years You were acquainted with the murdered man The delicatessen dealer unfolded his hands and waved them significantly I was aguainted with him yes But I was not friendly with him no He is dead ain t it Und it s not right to say someding about the dead But he was no friend of mine I understand But tell me mister Berg how late do you keep your place open In the summertime seven o clock But after dose theaters open I stays me on the chob till twelve or later somedimes There is one two three what you call burlesque places right by me and no sooner do they close up than right away those actor peoples come to buy I do a goot business so I keep open Then you were there until midnight last night More later than that yet Was there any movement of any sort about Hume s place Did you see or hear anything The great red face of Berg took on a solemn look It is maybe not ride that I should say somedings complained he But if the law will not excuse me I will say it if it makes some more trouble or not It is vitally necessary stated the young coroner firmly that you tell me everything you know about this matter Well said the delicatessen dealer reluctantly last night as I stood by my window looking oudside on the street I see me that Italian feller go by und turn in at the side door a second lader I hear him go up the steps to Hume s place What Italian fellow do you refer to He lifs close by me a few doors away His name is Spatola und he plays the violin the gurb stones beside What time was it that you saw him Maybe elefen o clock I am not sure But it was just a little while before I got me the rush of customers from the theaters Did you notice his manner Was there anything unusual in his looks I had me only a glimbs of him He looked about the same as effer He was in a hurry for it rained a liddle und under his coat yet he carried his fiddle If it was under his coat how do you know it was his fiddle The German scratched his head in a reflective way I don t know it said he at last But he somedimes takes his instrument inside there und I just get the notion that it was so Yes When did he come out The man shook his head I don d know he said Do you mean that you saw no one come out No I did see someone come out But first I see me someone else go in Ah And who was that I don t know his name but I had seen him often before He is a kind of svell feller He had a cane und plendy of style And later you saw someone come out Now your use of the word someone leads me to think that you do not know whether it was Spatola or the stranger I don d said Berg I was busy then I just heard me someone rush down the stairs making plendy noise und I heard that drunken Hume lift up a window stick out his head and call some names after him My customers laugh und think it s a joke but I am ashamed such a disgracefulness to have around my business yet If Hume called after the person who left said Stillman acutely to Ashton Kirk that eliminates one of the callers It proves that Hume was still alive after the man had gone That is undoubtedly a fact replied the investigator Stillman turned upon Berg with dignity Surely you must have noticed the man if all that uproar attended his exit You must have detected enough to mark a difference between an exceptionally well dressed man and an Italian street musician Berg shook his big head It was aboud twelve o clock in the night dime und my customers besides I had to pay some attention to stated he The coroner was baffled by the man s positiveness Well said he resignedly What else did you see Berg shook his head once more Nothing else Putty soon I closed up and went home Then a flash of recollection came into his dull face As I went down the street I saw some lights in Hume s windows One of them windows was open maybe the one he sticked his head out of to call the man names und I could hear him laughing like he used to do when he was trying to make a jackass of some peoples The coroner pondered At length he said This object that Spatola carried under his coat now Could it have been a bayonet No no said Berg with conviction It vos too big It vos bigger as a half dozen bayonets already This seemed the limit of Berg s knowledge of the night s happenings a few more questions and then Stillman dismissed him The door had hardly closed when the telephone rang After a few words the coroner hung up the receiver and turned to his visitors I think said he with a smile of satisfaction that I ve made the police department sit up a little They talked to all three of these people before I had them and didn t seem to get enough to make a beginning But just now and the smile grew wider I ve heard that Osborne is on his way to arrest Antonio Spatola CHAPTER VI ASHTON KIRK LOOKS ABOUT Berg was standing in the corridor waiting for the elevator when Ashton Kirk and Pendleton came out The big German mopped his face with a handkerchief and said apologetically A man can only tell what he knows ain t it Ashton Kirk looked at him questioningly but said nothing To begin dot guess work business when you are talking to the law already it is dangerous stated Berg in an explanatory tone Well said Ashton Kirk sometimes a good pointed guess is of great service mister Berg And with a laugh as I am not the law and not the least dangerous suppose you make the one that I can see you turning over in your mind Oh said Berg you are not the coroner s office in No merely interested in this case that s all The delicatessen dealer looked relieved I don t want to get people in trouble said he guardedly But this is what I guess Late every night about the time I shut up my place there is a cab comes und by the curbstone stands across the street I will not say what is der place it stands in front of that is not my business McCausland s gambling house perhaps suggested Ashton Kirk The big German looked more relieved than ever Ach so you know about dot place eh All ride Now I can speak out and not be afraid to do some harm to nobody He lowered his voice still further Dot cab came last night as I was locking my door up und stands the curbstone by in front of McCausland s waiting for a chob Maybe when I goes away home der driver he sees what happened at Hume s afterwards eh Excellent said Ashton Kirk his eyes alight Thanks for the hint mister Berg The delicatessen dealer lumbered into the elevator which had stopped Pendleton was about to follow but his friend detained him and the car dropped downward without them That cab said Ashton Kirk is sure to be a night hawk and more than likely it is put up at Partridge s Pardon me a moment There was a telephone booth at one side of the corridor the speaker went in and closed the door After a few moments he came out Just as I thought he said well pleased Partridge knew the cab in a moment The driver s name is Sams and he lives at the place they call the Beehive He looked at his watch It wants but a few minutes of four he added and a night hawk cabby will be just about stirring The Beehive is only three blocks away suppose we go around and look him up Pendleton agreed instantly and after a brisk walk and a breathless climb they found themselves on the fourth floor of a huge brick building where they had been directed by a meek looking woman in a dust cap A long hall with a great many doors upon each side all looking alike stretched away before them It s very plain that the only way to find mister Sams is to make a noise said Ashton Kirk And with that he stalked down the hall his heels clattering on the bare boards Hello he cried loudly Sams is wanted Hello Sams A door opened and a face covered with thick soap suds and surmounted by a tangle of sandy hair looked out Hello growled this person huskily Who wants him Very glad to see you mister Sams said Ashton Kirk We have a small matter of business with you that will require a few moments of your time May we come in Sure said Sams They entered the room which contained a bed a trunk a wash stand and a chair One of you can take the chair the other can sit on the trunk said the hack driver nodding toward these articles Then he proceeded to strop a razor at one of the windows Excuse me if I go on with this reaping I must go out and feed the horse and then get breakfast You breakfast rather late commented Ashton Kirk I m lucky to get it at any time in this business grumbled Sams Out all night sleep all day and get blamed little for it at that He posed before a small mirror stuck up beside the window and gave the blade an experimental sweep across his face Then he turned and asked inquiringly Did youse gents want anything particular We d like to ask a question or two regarding what happened last night in Christie Place The cab driver s forehead corrugated he closed his razor laid it down and shoved his soapy face toward the speaker Say spoke he roughly I drives people wherever they wants to go but I don t ask no questions It s all right mister Sams said Ashton Kirk The affair that I m looking up happened across the street at Hume s second floor of four hundred seventy eight Oh Sams stared for a moment then he took up his razor turned his back and went on with his shaving But there was expectancy in his attitude and Ashton Kirk smiled confidently While you were drawn up in Christie Place waiting for a fare he asked did you hear or see anything at four hundred seventy eight I saw a light on the second floor something I never saw before at that hour And I saw the Dutchman that keeps the store underneath shutting up And I heard somebody laughing upstairs as a second thought I think that s what made me notice the light Nothing else Sams shaved and considered He wiped his razor at last poured some water in a bowl and doused his face Then he took up a towel and began applying it briskly The investigator watching him closely saw that he was not trying to recall anything It was plain that the man was merely calculating the possibilities of harm to himself and patrons if he told what he knew There has been a murder said Ashton Kirk quietly thinking to jog him along Sams threw the towel from him and sat down upon the bed A murder said he his eyes and mouth wide open Well what do you know about that He sat looking from one to the other of them dazedly for a space then he resumed Say I thought there was something queer about that stunt of hers Tell us about it suggested Ashton Kirk crossing his legs and clasping one knee with his hands The cabby considered once more There s lots of things that a guy like me sees that look off color he said at length but we can t always pass any remarks about them It would be bad for business you see But this murder thing s a different proposition and here s where I tell it all Last night while I was waiting in front of McCausland s I hears an automobile turn into the street It was some time after I got there I wouldn t have paid much attention to it but you see there s a fellow been trying to get my work with a taxicab and I thought it was him And it wasn t No it was a private car a Maillard and there was a woman driving it The chair upon which Pendleton sat was an infirm one it creaked sharply as he made a sudden movement She was going at a low speed proceeded Sams and as she passed Hume s I noticed her look up at the windows After she disappeared there wasn t a sound for a while You see nobody hardly ever passes through Christie Place after one o clock Then I hears her coming back This time she stopped the car got out and went to the door that leads into Hume s place There she stopped a little as though she didn t know whether to go in or not But at last she went in Pendleton coughed huskily at this point and his friend glancing at him saw that his face was white And up to that time said Ashton Kirk are you sure that there was no movement no sound in the front room at Hume s As far as I noticed there wasn t But a few minutes after I heard the woman go in I did hear some sounds The man stroked his shaven jaws in the deliberate manner of a person about to precipitate a crisis Pendleton leaned toward him anxiously What sort of sounds he asked There were two replied the cab driver The first was a revolver shot the second came right after and was a kind of a scream like that of a parrot And what then asked Ashton Kirk easily There wasn t anything for a few minutes anyway But the revolver shot had kind of got my attention so I was taking notice of the windows Then suddenly I caught sight of the woman You see the gas light was near the window and she kind of leaned over and turned it out It was only for a time as long as that and the man snapped his fingers But I saw her plain Then I heard her coming down the stairs to the street almost at a run She banged the street door shut after her jumped into her car and went tearing away as if she was crazy I stayed fifteen minutes before I got a fare but nothing else happened Pendleton s hand closed hard on the edge of the chair he sat in There was a moment s silence then Ashton Kirk asked Just where was your cab standing at this time Right in front of McCausland s door And you were on the box Yes The investigator put a piece of money in the man s hand as he and Pendleton arose and prepared to go Say said Sam curiously I ve been in bed all day and ain t heard a word of anything Who s been done up Hume Stabbed in the chest Shot you mean No I mean stabbed With a bayonet The man stared wonderingly G way he said They bid him good day and tramped down the three long flights to the street Pendleton was silent and walked with his head held down We have more than an hour of good daylight left said his friend as they reached the street And as I must have a good unrestricted look at Hume s apartments before everything is hopelessly changed about suppose we go there now We can get a taxi in the next street Just a moment said Pendleton Before we take another step in the matter Kirk I must ask a question Ashton Kirk put his hand upon his friend s shoulder Don t said he I know just what the question would be and at the present time I can t answer it At this moment except for some few theories that I have yet to verify I am as much puzzled as yourself But and there was a tremble in the speaker s voice you must answer me old chap and you must answer now The catch in his voice the expression upon the young man s face caused Ashton Kirk to grasp an astonishing fact The hand that he had laid upon Pendleton s shoulder tightened as he answered Yes Edyth Vale is concerned As a rule I do not speak of my clients to others but in view of what you have already heard and seen it would be a waste of words to deny it But see here there are lots of things we don t know yet about this business It may look very different in a few hours Come Pendleton gazed with sober eyes into the speaker s face for a moment Then he said Let us get the cab if you are to go over Hume s rooms before dark you haven t any too much time At the next corner they signaled a taxicab and in a short time they were set down in Christie Place Paulson the policeman was standing guard How are you he greeted them affably Been here all day asked Ashton Kirk Oh no Just come on I m the third shift since I saw you last Nobody has been permitted to go upstairs I presume Only the coroner s man who came for the body And they touched nothing but the body Our orders were strong on that Has anything been heard as the result of the post mortem It showed that Hume was in bad shape from too much drink Then he had a hard knock on the head and the wound in his chest But there was no sign of a bullet wound No said Paulson surprised Nothing like that Just a moment said the investigator to Pendleton He crossed the street walked along for a few paces then paused at the curb and looked back toward Hume s doorway Then he returned with quick steps and an alert look in his eyes Now we ll go upstairs he said But before doing so he stopped and examined the lock of the street door closely then he mounted the stairs slowly his glances seeming to take in everything At the top he paused his head bent apparently in deep thought Then he lifted it suddenly and laughed exultantly That s it he said I m quite sure that is it I wouldn t doubt your word for an instant said Pendleton in something like his old voice Whatever it is I m quite sure it is if you say so The policeman on guard in the hall examined them carefully All right said he after they had explained and he had verified it by calling to his mate at the street door Go right to work gents I m here to see that nobody gets in from above by way of the scuttle and I guess I won t be in the way There were three gas branches at intervals along the length of the dim hall each with a cluster of four jets Ashton Kirk lighted all three of these and began making a careful examination of the passage Along toward the rear was a stairway leading to the floor above Next this was a small room in which there was a water tap At the extreme end of the hall was a window with a green shade drawn to the bottom Ashton Kirk regarded this for a moment intently Then he reached up and turned off the gas at the branch nearest the window Daylight could now be seen through the blind the investigator pointed and said This shows us something About six inches of the bottom of the blind is of a decidedly lighter color than the remainder This is caused by exposure to the light and indicates that this blind has seldom been drawn in daylight as it is now He drew back the blind and looked at the side nearest the window At the top of the faded space was a heavy dark line I ll modify that last statement said he with satisfaction I ll go as far as to say now that the blind has never been drawn since it was put up This thick line marks the part that lay across the top of the roller and the dust seems never to have been disturbed The gas was lighted once more Hume did not draw that curtain said Ashton Kirk decidedly He was too careless a man apparently to think of such a thing The intruders whoever they were did it they had a light perhaps and did not want to be He paused abruptly here and Pendleton heard him draw his breath sharply between his teeth his eyes were fixed upon the lowermost step of the flight that led to the floor above One of the gas branches hung here its full glare was thrown downward Following the fixed gaze of his friend Pendleton saw two partly burned matches the stump of a candle and some traces of tallow which had fallen from the latter upon the step To Pendleton s amazement his friend dropped to his knees before these as a heathen would before an idol With the utmost attention he examined them and the step upon which they lay Then he arose enthusiasm upon his face Beautiful he cried I do not recall ever having seen anything just like it He slapped Pendleton upon the back with a heavy hand Pen that stump of candle sheds more light than the finest arc lamp ever manufactured I m watching and I m listening spoke Pendleton Also I m agitating my small portion of gray matter But inspiration it seems is not for me So I ll have to ask you what these things tell you Well they give me a fairly good view of the man who while he may not actually have murdered Hume had much to do with his taking off He bent over the lower step once more then looked up with a smile upon his face What would you say asked he if I told you that I draw from these things that the gentleman was short well dressed near sighted and knew something of the modern German dramatists I should say replied Pendleton firmly that you ought to have your brain looked at It sounds wrong to me Ashton Kirk laughed and started up the stairs toward the third floor I ll return in a moment he said Don t trouble to come up He was gone but a very little while and when he returned his face wore a satisfied look The bolt of the scuttle is broken just as Osborne said he reported And anyone who could gain the roof would have little difficulty in effecting an entrance He led the way down the hall saying as he went Now we ll browse around in the rooms for a while then we ll be off to dinner The storage room was entered first as upon the earlier visit but Ashton Kirk wasted but little time upon it In the front room however he examined things with a minuteness that amazed Pendleton And yet everything was done quickly like a keen nosed hound the investigator went from one object to another nothing seemed to escape him nothing was too small for his attention One of the first things that he did was to get a chair and plant it against the lettered door that led directly into the hall At the top was a gong with a spring hammer one of the sort that rings its warning whenever the door is opened and this the investigator examined with care He then passed into the railed space where the body had lain and where the darkened trail of blood still bore ghastly testimony to what had occurred The man s singular eyes scanned the floor the walls the flat topped desk On this last his attention again became riveted and once more Pendleton heard his breath drawn sharply between his teeth When Hume was struck upon the head said Ashton Kirk after a moment he was standing at this desk He had just sprung up probably upon hearing a sound of some kind See where the chair is pushed back against the wall just as he would have pushed it had he arisen hastily When he struck he fell across the desk He pointed to a dark trickle of blood down the back of the piece of furniture in question That is the result of the blow upon the head and probably flowed from the mouth or nostrils After the first senseless lurch the body settled back and slid to the position in which it was found Here is a blotting pad a small pair of shears a box of clips and a letter scale upon the floor where the sliding body dragged them The top of the desk is of polished wood it is perfectly smooth there are no crevices or anything of the sort to catch hold of anything When the body slipped from it it must have swept everything with it cleanly And yet bending forward over the desk and picking up a minute red particle here directly in the center we find this What is it asked Pendleton eagerly Ashton Kirk placed the red particle on his palm and held it out It was shaped like a keystone and had apparently been cut from something that had been printed upon It is that portion of a railroad ticket which a conductor s punch bites out and which litters the floor and the seats in trains Have you never had one fall from your clothes after a railroad journey Pendleton looked at the tiny red fragment and then at the desk If Hume fell across the desk as you ve just said he remarked slowly and pulled all these other things to the floor with him why Kirk this bit of card in the very center of the polished top it must have dropped there afterwards Exactly said Ashton Kirk And now if you don t mind just step out into the hall and ask Paulson to come up Pendleton did so and while he was gone Ashton Kirk placed the red fragment carefully in his card case When the other re entered with Paulson at his heels he asked Have any of the policemen detailed here been out of town recently No replied Paulson There have been five besides myself and they have been on duty every day Thank you said the investigator And as the policeman went out he made his way into the kitchen Here however his examination was brief as was that of the bedroom also At length he paused his hands in his pockets his head thrown back satisfaction lighting his dark keen face That is all I think said he There have only been a few pages but the print has been exceedingly good and the matter of much interest He looked at a clock that ticked solemnly upon a shelf We have half an hour to reach my place and dress he said I m afraid that we ll be late and that Edouard will be annoyed His cookery is so exquisitely timed that it is scarcely the better for delay Wait a minute said Pendleton grasping his friend s arm What part did Edyth Miss Vale play in all this I can see you have formed in your mind some sort of completed action Where does she come into it Completed Ashton Kirk smiled into the pale set face of his friend You give me too much credit old chap I have some undoubted scenes from the drama but most of the remainder are merely detached lines and bits of stage business As to Miss Vale here the smile vanished I have been unable to make up my mind just how far she is concerned if at all However perhaps twenty four hours will make it all clear enough In the meantime I will say this to you Don t jump to harsh conclusions Pen You know this young lady well How far do you suppose she would go to the perpetrating of a downright crime Not a step answered Pendleton promptly Then said Ashton Kirk until we know positively that she has done so stick to that CHAPTER VII THE SCHWARTZ MICHAEL BAYONET As Ashton Kirk and Pendleton sat in the former s library that evening after dinner there came a knock upon the door and Fuller entered briskly In his hand he carried a paper parcel which he laid upon a stand at the investigator s elbow This is the bayonet sir said he mister Stillman the coroner objected to letting me have it at first but changed his mind after I had talked to him for a while Did you take the photograph to Berg in Christie Place Yes sir He recognized it at once as that of the person in question And you made inquiries upon the other point I did Neither mister Stillman nor any of the men who removed the body of Hume have been out of town within a week I also questioned mister Osborne his answer was the same Brolatsky s reply was similar and he also said that Hume had not ridden on a railroad in years That will be all Fuller thank you The brisk young man had reached the door when the investigator added One moment He scribbled something upon a pad tore off the leaf and handed it to his aid Look these things up at once Fuller took the paper glanced at it and then replied Very well sir Seated in his big chair with the jar of Greek tobacco and sheaf of brown paper wrappers before him Ashton Kirk did not display any haste in removing the covering from the bayonet that had let the life out of the art dealer Rather he sank deeper into the arms of the chair the cigarette end became gray and dead between his fingers the strangely brilliant eyes closed as though he had fallen asleep But Pendleton who understood his friend s ways knew better the keen swift moving mind was but arranging the developments of the day weighing them giving to each its proper value A little later and the eyes would unclose more than likely alight with some new idea some fresh purpose drawn from his reflections And as Pendleton waited he too fell into a musing state and also began marshaling the facts as he saw them Ashton Kirk during dinner had told him those regarding the visit of Edyth Vale the day before Pen you know I don t usually do this the investigator had informed him But as you know so much already and your feelings in the matter being what they are I think it best that you should know more And now Pendleton as he rolled and consumed cigarette after cigarette went over the facts as they had been laid before him And Morris said he to himself as he reached the end of his friend s recital now what sort of a mess has Allan Morris got himself into And after he had got into it why in heaven s name didn t he keep quiet about it What good could come from Edyth s knowing it Then the fact that Morris had apparently tried to keep his secret from Miss Vale presented itself But Pendleton dismissed it with contempt Tried he said to himself Of course but how By marching up and down the floor By a great parade of tragic despair by sighs and the wringing of his hands I ve always suspected Morris of being a bit theatrical and now I am sure of it He roused himself for a moment lighted a fresh cigarette and settled back once more I m not Kirk by any means he reflected and this sort of thing is altogether out of my line But it seems clear that Edyth after leaving here yesterday received some unexpected news When she was here consulting Kirk she was to all appearances in a quandary helpless She did not know how to proceed she understood nothing But her darting off alone that way after midnight proves that some sort of a crisis had come up She had heard something more than likely through Morris He probably with great contempt became hysterical again couldn t contain himself and blabbed everything whatever it was Then he burst out aloud angrily She went to Hume s last night because she had reason to think Morris would be there And if the truth were known Morris was there My dear fellow said the voice of Ashton Kirk the truth upon that particular point at least is known Allan Morris was at Hume s last night He was the man whom Berg saw enter after the musician How do you know asked Pendleton astonished Fuller with a report which he recently made upon Morris handed me a photograph of that gentleman While we were at dinner Berg identified the portrait as being that of Hume s secret visitor I was right then Edyth did go there expecting to meet him to protect him perhaps If you knew her as well as I do Kirk you d realize that it s just the sort of thing she d do But positively she did not find him there What makes you think that There was still one of Hume s visitors left when she got there It may have been Morris It was Spatola answered Pendleton with conviction The scream of the cockatoo which came from Hume s rooms when the pistol was discharged proves it When Spatola went in Berg said he was carrying something under his coat Brolatsky told the coroner this morning that the Italian sometimes brought his trained birds with him when he called at Hume s That s what he had last night But Ashton Kirk shook his head At this time he said it will scarcely do to be positive on some things Indications are plenty but they must be worked out I have some theories of my own upon the very point that you have just covered but I will not venture a decided statement until I have proven them to the limit It s the only safe way Pendleton discontentedly hitched forward in his chair I thought said he that you worked entirely by putting this and that together That is precisely what I do returned Ashton Kirk But I have found through experience that there must be no loose ends left to hang Such things are treacherous you never know when they ll trip you up and upset all your calculations He paused a moment and regarded his friend steadfastly Then he continued But just now I think we had better not trouble ourselves about Edyth Vale and Allan Morris To be sure the latter s connection with the affair is peculiar Miss Vale s visit to Hume s last night the sounds which Sams heard immediately after she had gone in her turning out of the gas and hurried flight are also strange and significant enough But they are perhaps the very end of the story and it is best never to begin at the end Is there any way by which you can begin at what you think is the beginning asked the other Ashton Kirk took up the parcel which Fuller had laid at his elbow Here is one way he answered Let us see where it leads us He stripped off the wrapper and the bayonet which had killed the numismatist was revealed blood clotted and ugly Carefully the investigator examined the broad powerful blade and heavy bronze hilt A Schwartz Michael just as I thought he said The maker s name is upon it then said Pendleton But the other shook his head No said he But it happens that I have given some attention to arms and the bayonet though a weapon that is passing came in for its share He balanced the murderous looking thing in his hand and proceeded There are not many types of bayonets The first was what they called a Plug because it was made to fit into the muzzle of a flint or match lock Then there was the socket bayonet the ring bayonet and an improved weapon invented by an English officer named Chillingworth which met with much favor in the armies of Europe But the latest development is the sword bayonet of which this is an example Its form is a great improvement over the older makes it is an almost perfect side arm as well having a cutting edge a point and a grip exactly like that of a sword There are a number of makes of this type the Schwartz Michael is one of the least known of these Upon its being placed on the market it was adopted by three governments Bolivia Servia and Turkey and there it stopped He laid the weapon upon the table and settled himself back in his chair It struck me when I first saw the thing he went on that it was a little singular that a Schwartz Michael should even find its way into the United States Now it would not surprise me to find an English revolver in Patagonia or an American rifle in Thibet because they are universally known and used Any one might carry them But a bayonet is different of course it is a strictly military arm and its utility is limited That a criminal should select one with which to commit a murder is unusual and further the fact that the make is one never introduced into the United States is rather remarkable It is a little agreed Pendleton It is a small thing but all clews are small things Now there are many ways in which such a weapon might find its way into the country but I took the most likely of these as a beginning Before I dressed for dinner I ran over a rather complete card index system which I maintain and within a few minutes learned that the republic of Bolivia had within the past year changed both the rifle and bayonet used by its army Well asked Pendleton with interest When a nation makes such a change the discarded arms are usually bought up by some large speculator or dealer in such things And in the course of time they find their way to the military goods dealers who exist all over the world Here Fuller entered the room and Ashton Kirk turned to him inquiringly Well In the morning Standard of April ninth announced the young man I find an advertisement of Bernstine Brothers relative to a sale of condemned army equipment Is anything specified They considered it important that high power modern rifles were to be sold at a very small price And they also lay some stress upon the fact that the stuff had been in use by the Bolivian army Pendleton saw a look of satisfaction come into his friend s eyes But there was no other evidence of anything unusual And now said the investigator quietly with regard to this other matter I find that there are two schools for mutes in this section answered Fuller But both are some distance out of town The satisfaction in Ashton Kirk s singular eyes deepened Excellent said he One is on the main line Kittridge Station the other is on the Hammondsville Branch at a place called Cordova Thank you said Ashton Kirk And when the door had once more closed behind his aid the investigator continued to Pendleton I figured upon some of the equipment reaching here Military goods houses such as Bernstine s usually advertise each lot they receive and I considered it possible that the murderer might have been attracted by this notice and procured the weapon from them If he did we may get some trace of him by inquiring at Bernstine s But flinging his arms wide and yawning as though weary of the subject that is work for to morrow To night we will rest and prepare for what is to come But in the meantime arising with enthusiasm let me show you a first edition of the Knickerbocker s History of New York which I picked up recently He went to his book shelves and took down two faded volumes With eager hands Pendleton took them from him Original covers cried he Binding unbroken in perfect condition inside not a spot or a stain anywhere Then he regarded his friend with undisguised envy Kirk said he you re a lucky dog You can dig up more good things than anybody else that I know CHAPTER VIII THE NEWSPAPERS BEGIN TO PLAY THEIR PART Next morning Ashton Kirk lounged in a comfortable window seat almost knee deep in newspapers The published accounts of the assassination were in some instances very sensational Drawings by special artists of persons concerned were much in evidence also half tones of the exterior of four hundred seventy eight Christie Place The names of Osborne and Stillman figured largely in the types but what interested the investigator most was a portrait of the musician the violinist Antonio Spatola and the story of his arrest The pictured face was that of a young man with a great head of curling hair The features were regular the expression eager and appealing I would have pronounced him a musician even if I had not heard that he was one said Ashton Kirk The head and face formations have all the qualities Then he ran over the story of Spatola s arrest and the causes that led up to it At the finish he smiled They have tried and convicted him on the first page If there was any way for them to do it they d execute him in the evening editions and print his dying words in the sporting extra But and he nodded his head appreciatively Osborne has a good case against him at that Both the clerk Isidore Brolatsky and Berg seemed to have talked freely to the newspapermen The character of Hume was treated in a highly colored manner The visits of the Italian musician to the numismatist his ambition to shine as another Kubelik his ungovernable temper the high words that followed Hume s frequent sneers at his ambition and the fact that he once drew a knife upon his tormentor were presented in full But what appealed to the space writers most was Brolatsky s story of how Hume had once called Spatola Mad Anthony and afterward showed him the portrait of General Wayne This apparently drove him frantic wrote one reporter and noting this Hume frequently applied the name to him and more than likely displayed the portrait as well The last time that Spatola visited Hume was upon the night of the murder He evidently went to regale the numismatist with music for the delicatessen dealer Berg saw under his coat what was evidently his violin During the course of the concert Hume probably resumed his sneers unable any longer to bear it the Italian apparently struck him down and then in blind rage of resentment smashed and otherwise destroyed every one of the Wayne portraits he could find Fuller came in with another newspaper just about this time and Ashton Kirk showed him the story The Standard then seems to ignore the theory held by Osborne and Stillman that the murder was done in an attempt to steal the portrait found partly cut from the frame said the assistant after studying the account Then inquiringly he added What do you think of it sir As a piece of sensational writing I have no fault to find with it said the investigator But the Standard s young man is no deep thinker The single fact that Hume was a lover of real music should have shown him that his theory was wrong Fuller considered a moment I don t think I quite get that said he It is simple enough Hume being sensitive to harmony asked Spatola very frequently to play for him and according to Brolatsky paid him rather well for each performance To furnish good music Spatola must have not only talent but also a violin that was at least fairly good Yes sir I see that Having a violin that was at least fairly good Spatola being a poor man would take care of it He would carry it in a case he would especially do so in wet or damp weather And it rained on the night of the murder If he carried his violin in a case there was no need of his putting it under his coat And another thing a violin case is of such size as to prevent its being so carried isn t it Fuller nodded I think that s very good said he It would have been a very easy thing for the Standard s man to have made a few inquiries as to whether Spatola used a violin case or no If he had done so I am inclined to think that the answers would have been in the affirmative But there is another and more vital point upon which I would base an objection to the reporter s theory He says that goaded into a rage Spatola struck his tormentor down But he forgets that If the murderer did not visit Hume s with the intention of doing murder it was rather a freakish thing for him to provide himself with a bayonet However that is a point that I discussed with mister Stillman yesterday at first he was inclined to assume a somewhat similar position But the broken and cut portraits questioned Fuller Ashton Kirk smiled a little Probably I shall be able to properly account for them when I return from a little trip that I am about to take to day said he That is as a sort of afterthought if some things turn out as I think they will Fuller unfolded the newspaper that he had brought in It is a late edition of the Star he said The paper seems to have scored a beat for it has some developments that may put a different face upon everything Ashton Kirk took the sheet and as he glanced at the flaring headlines he whistled softly The lines read MYSTERIOUS WOMAN IN A MOTOR CAR She Visits four hundred seventy eight Christie Place on the Night of Murder DID A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN S HAND DEAL THE DEADLY BLOW A New Element Added to the Hume Sensation The Star man seems to have struck up an acquaintance with Sams said Ashton Kirk with interest He thought for a moment and then added to Fuller Tell Stumph when Miss Edyth Vale arrives to show her here at once Oh you have been expecting her then No I have not But I am now After Fuller left the room the investigator turned eagerly to the Star s leaded narrative This laid great stress upon the evident wealth and dazzling beauty of the mysterious midnight visitor in Christie Place and second only to her did they feature the well dressed stranger whom Berg had seen enter at Hume s door before he had closed his own place for the night The revolver shot that had followed the woman s entrance and the parrot like scream which had in turn followed that lost nothing in the telling Who was the woman That is the mystery the newspaper said in conclusion The hack driver caught but a glimpse of her and in the excitement of the moment failed to take the number of the car But that the latter was a Maillard he is positive There are several headquarter s men following up the clew as this goes to press and startling developments are expected at any moment As to the second man whom the fancy grocer Berg saw go into Hume s there is a well founded belief that he is very well known in select circles and had called at Hume s frequently upon a matter concerning which both he and Hume were always very secretive The Star called up both his apartments and his office but he had not been seen at either place on the day after the murder The clubs of which he is a member were resorted to but with no more success As this gentleman is known to be engaged to the beautiful heiress of a huge fortune the Star s well known special writer Nancy Prindeville was detailed to get her statement But a man servant stated that his mistress had given positive orders that she could not be seen The investigator threw down the paper Well said he to himself with a shrug that makes it a little annoying for the young lady The fact that they refer to Morris when they speak of a young man well known in select circles will be plain to everyone for the facts of Morris visits have been rather well exploited in all the other papers And as newspaper men are not without daring in their conjectures I wonder how long it will be before one of them openly associates the beautiful unknown with Allan Morris betrothed I would I think offer even money that the thing is hinted at before night He sat for some time in the midst of the scattered sheets thinking deeply then he pressed the bell call and Fuller presented himself I want you to take up the investigation of Hume and Allan Morris where you left off the other day Put Burgess O Neill and any others that you desire on the matter I want complete information and I want it quickly Yes sir answered Fuller Follow up anything that promises results concerning Morris father Especially find out if he ever knew Hume Get every fact that can be gathered about the latter You or rather Burgess hinted in the preliminary report that it was thought that he had at one time lived abroad If it is possible establish that fact In any event go into his history as deeply as you can Very well said Fuller with the easy manner of a person accustomed to carrying out difficult orders As the young man went out at one door Stumph knocked upon another then Miss Edyth Vale very pale but entirely composed was shown into the room CHAPTER IX MISS VALE TELLS WHAT SHE KNOWS Ashton Kirk arose kicked aside the litter of newspapers and placed a chair for his visitor Your man told me that I was expected she said How did you know that I would come this morning I knew that you d be sure to read the newspapers said he And I was pretty confident as to the effect the Star s account would have She sat down quietly and for a few moments did not speak A slight trembling of the lower lip was the only indication of the strain under which she was laboring Finally she said I am very sorry that I deceived you yesterday morning He waved his hand lightly I was not deceived so there was no harm done he explained She began tugging nervously at her gloves much as she had done a few mornings before Her face was still composed but deep in her beautiful eyes was an expression of fear I might have known that I could not do it she said But the impulse came to me to deny everything as the easiest and safest way out of it all and I obeyed it I was not calm enough to consider the possible harm that it might do However and her firm voice broke a little I suppose the newspapers would have ferreted out the facts in any event They are very keen in the pursuit of anything that promises a good story agreed the investigator But if you had given me the facts as you intended doing when you called me on the phone yesterday morning I d have had twenty four hours start of them at least She leaned toward him earnestly I am going to be frank with you now she said And perhaps it is not yet too late I did intend telling you everything when I telephoned you but as I have said the impulse came to hide it instead It was fear said Ashton Kirk and was perhaps perfectly natural under the circumstances When I left you two mornings ago said Miss Vale I felt easier in my mind than I had in months before From what I had heard of you I felt sure that the little problem which I had set you would prove absurdly simple This feeling clung to me all day I was light and happy and astonished my aunt missus Page by consenting to go with her to missus Barron s that night a thing that I had been refusing to do for a long time Late in the afternoon Allan mister Morris came As soon as I saw him I knew that something had happened or was about to happen There was no color in his face his eyes had a feverish glitter his voice was high pitched and excited But I did not let him see that I noticed this I talked to him quietly about a score of things and by a most circuitous route approached the matter that interested me most our marriage To my surprise he plunged into the subject with the greatest eagerness Before that as I have told you he always did his best to avoid it the least mention of it seemed to sadden him to cause him pain But now he discussed it excitedly apparently it was no longer a dim far off thing but one which he saw very clearly As you may imagine I was both astonished and delighted But this was only at first In a little while I noticed something in his tone in his manner in his feverish eyes that I did not like She paused for a moment Ashton Kirk clasped his knee with both hands and regarded her with interest It was a sort of subdued fierceness continued Miss Vale as though he were setting his face against some invisible force and defying it When he mentioned our happiness that was to be I could see his hands close tightly I could read menace in the set of his jaw As he was going he said to me There has been something a something that you ve never been able to understand keeping us apart But it is about at an end Human nature endures a great deal sometimes but it s endurance does not last forever To night my dear puts an end to my endurance I am going to show what I should have shown long ago that I m a man Then he went away and I was frightened All sorts of possibilities presented themselves to me vague indefinite formless terrors I tried to shake them off but could not It became firmly fixed in my mind that something was going to happen that Allan was about to to here the steady voice faltered once more to take a step that would bring danger upon him And that night I went to missus Barron s as I had promised I talked to people I laughed I even danced But never for a moment did the fear cease gripping at my heart At last I could stand it no longer I felt that I must go to where this danger was confronting Allan and as the house in Christie Place was the first that arose in my mind I went there I saw the cab upon the opposite side of the street and the driver of it looked at me so hard that I drove on without stopping as the newspaper states But my courage came back in a few moments I returned and went in You halted on the stairs said Ashton Kirk Why Because I saw a light moving about in the hallway above answered Miss Vale Then she added But how did you know that I stopped upon the stairs I did not know it replied Ashton Kirk In his story the cab driver says you entered at Hume s door and went upstairs I have found that the position which his cab occupied at the time was fully fifteen feet west of Hume s doorway making it impossible for him to see whether you went up at once or not In the face of what immediately followed your entrance or rather what is said to have followed it I thought it reasonable to suppose that you had stopped Thank you said Miss Vale You say there was a light moving about but what else did you see Nothing But you heard something Yes the revolver shot and then the dreadful cry that followed it Ashton Kirk unclasped his hands from about his knee placed them upon the arms of his chair and leaned forward But between the two after the shot and before the cry you heard a door close he said She gave a little gasp of surprise I did she said I remember it distinctly now that you mention it It closed sharply but not very loudly The investigator leaned back and began drumming upon the arm of his chair with his long supple fingers Experience never quite takes away that comfortable feeling of satisfaction that the proving of a theory gives one said he I suppose it is a sort of reward that Nature reserves for effort And he smiled at his beautiful visitor s puzzled look and went on The cab driver says that the cry resembled that of a parrot or cockatoo What do you think It was not unlike their scream said Miss Vale But I was too much startled to think of comparing it to anything at the time What happened after you heard this cry I waited for some little time part way up the stairs Then the light which I had seen glancing over the walls and across the ceiling seemed to halt and die down After this there was a pause a stoppage of everything and fear took possession of me Suppose Allan had really intended visiting the place suppose he had preceded me suppose something dreadful had just happened something in which he had had a part Filled with thoughts like these I ascended the remaining stairs There was a light shining through the lettered glass of the door at the front but the hall was deserted the far end was thick with shadows I tried the door where the light was but it was fast the door nearest the stairs was open I entered by that and passed into the front room through a communicating doorway Then I saw the the body turned out the light ran stumbling through the rooms and down the stairs Why did you turn out the light asked the investigator I don t know Partly I suppose to shut the awful thing upon the floor from my sight and partly She stopped but Ashton Kirk completed the sentence for her And partly with the confused idea that you might hide the deed from public gaze and in that way save Allan Morris from the consequences of his crime said he At this she sprang up her hands outstretched appealingly the fear now plain in her face No no she cried He is not guilty He did not do it My dear young lady said Ashton Kirk soothingly control yourself Don t forget that before this thing is ended you will probably need all the self command you can summon Then as she resumed her seat he added I did not say that he was guilty I was merely telling you of the formless thought that you had in mind when you turned out the light She sat staring at him the horror of it all still in her eyes Then she nodded her head slowly and said in a husky voice Yes that is what I thought and that is why I called you on the telephone I thought you would pity me and show me some way of covering it all up But after I had your promise to come I was seized with the fear that you might that you might betray him That is I suppose the real reason why I tried to deceive you In my terror I myself thought Allan guilty But of course now that I have had time to calmly think it over I know he was not that he couldn t be No one who knows him will believe he did it What reason had you for thinking that he might be guilty His manner during the afternoon before the murder He seemed so fiercely resolved so different from his usual self I understand And what makes you think now that he is innocent I believe it because I understand his nature said Miss Vale earnestly He might be finally aroused under provocation he might even be violent But he could never do a thing like this it is too utterly horrible You have judged that it was probably he who was seen to go into Hume s before the murder Yes Hume was alive when Berg closed up his shop he was dead when you entered his showroom a half hour or so later Therefore he must have met his death while the cab driver Sams sat on his box across the street Now while Morris was seen to go in it is not at all positive that he was the man who came out We are not sure that he was not present when the crime was committed Miss Vale reared her head proudly Is it possible she said that you are trying to fix this deed upon Allan Morris I am trying to find the real truth answered Ashton Kirk gravely The police said Miss Vale according to the newspapers thought that the criminal gained admission by way of the roof This may or may not be so but I think it is pretty evident that he made his way out in that manner I was on the stairs while he was in the hall He fled but as he did not pass me he must have gone upwards If Allan Morris had done this murder he would not have thought of this not knowing the section he would have been ignorant as to where the roof would lead But if Spatola were the man who remained it would have been different Do the papers not say that he lives in a garret or loft in the same block How easy it would have been for him to pass out upon the roof of four hundred seventy eight after the crime and then over the housetops of the block until he came to a scuttle which perhaps led into his very attic That said Ashton Kirk is very well conceived But it has one weakness You are not sure that the murderer did ascend to the roof after the crime He may have been lurking in the shadows which you say were lying so thickly at the end of the hall He may have been watching you as you discovered the body while you ran down the hall once more and down the stairs To be sure you slammed the door behind you and so locked it But like all spring or latch locks it could be readily opened from the inside No one else came out while the cab driver waited but that was only for another fifteen minutes according to his own statement The murderer could easily have waited until he had gone and then slipped out also locking the door after him Miss Vale sat staring at the speaker dumbly for a space then she asked in a dry expressionless way And do you really think this is what happened Ashton Kirk shook his head No said he I merely mentioned it to show you that it is difficult to be sure of anything in a matter like this until with a smile you are sure It is one of the things that may have happened but it is also open to question A criminal whose crime has been discovered does not ordinarily linger upon the scene You had just fled with the terror of the thing fresh upon you How did he know but that you might scream it out to everyone you met Again she looked at him mutely Then she said What then is your theory of the crime I have a number of possibilities at this moment he said Of course there is one to which I give the preference but until a thing is proven beyond question it is my rule never to outline my theories Before Miss Vale left she had implored him to do all he could to clear the matter up for her sake and for Morris s Of course she said in conclusion I now understand that the entire matter will get into the papers It is too late to prevent that But it is not too late for you to fix the guilt where it belongs And I have every confidence that you will do it If I had not and her voice quavered pitifully I don t know what I should do I will do what I can Success sometimes comes easily sometimes one is forced to fight hard for it But rest assured that I will do what I can She was going he held the library door open for her while the grave faced Stumph waited in the hall It will perhaps be necessary for me to see mister Morris sometime during the course of the day said Ashton Kirk as an afterthought Would it be convenient for you to let him know that I can be seen at six The fear that his soothing words had driven from her eyes swept back into them he saw her tremble and steady herself against the door frame I cannot let him know she said I have not seen him since since the time I have mentioned I have waited telephoned sent messages even gone in person But I could not find him No one seems to know anything of his whereabouts CHAPTER X ASHTON KIRK ASKS QUESTIONS For some time after Miss Vale had gone Ashton Kirk stood at one of the windows and looked down at the sordid surging dirty crowd in the street The worn horses went dispiritedly up and down the throaty voiced men clamored strangely through their beards children played in the black ooze of the gutters women bundled in immense knitted garments and with their heads wrapped in shawls haggled over scatterings of faded weak looking vegetables The vendors grew frantic and eloquent in their combats with these experienced purchasers their gestures were high sharp and loaded with protest Then Pendleton came He was burdened with newspapers and wore an excited look I brought these thinking that perhaps you had not seen them he exclaimed throwing the dailies among the others upon the floor But I note that your morning s reading has been very complete Now tell me Kirk what the mischief do you think of all this I suppose you refer to the published reports of the Hume case Of course As far as I am concerned there is not just now any other thing of consequence on earth Then he struck the table with his fist And it s all the fault of that cur Allan Morris Every bit of it There is not a space writer or amateur detective on a single paper in the city that hasn t his nose to the ground at this minute hunting the trail They are all at it I stopped at the Vale s on my way here but they told me she was not at home From the top step to the curb on my way out I was stopped four times by stony faced young men all anxious to make good with their city editors Was I a friend of the family Did Miss Vale seem at all upset by the matter Where was Allan Morris What brought him so frequently as Brolatsky said to see Hume I believe they d have come over the back of my car even after I started if I had given but an encouraging look The evening papers will be a trial to Miss Vale for the next few days Well don t neglect the morning issues if you are going to mention any In to morrow s Star there will be a portrait of Edyth four columns wide and eight inches high I ll expect such expressions as beautiful society girl a recent debutante heiress to the vast fortune of the late structural steel king charming manner and brilliant mind And at those odd times when they are not praising her gowns her wealth or her good looks they ll be rather worse than insinuating that she knows all about the crime if she didn t commit it herself He paced up and down the floor his huge motoring coat flapping distressfully about his legs His face was flushed If I had Morris here he threatened I d show him a few things the pup Then suddenly he stopped his tramping and faced his friend But now that it is as it is he demanded what are we going to do about it There are quite a number of very sensible things for us to do replied Ashton Kirk good humoredly And the first of them is to keep our tempers the second to keep cool All right sulked Pendleton I know well enough that I need to do both But what next Is your car still outside Yes Good We ll have a little use for it to day if you re not otherwise engaged Kirk said Pendleton earnestly until this matter is settled don t hesitate to command me I know that I m not generally credited with much serious purpose but even the lightweight feels things sometimes Within half an hour Ashton Kirk in a perfectly fitting carefully pressed suit of gray tan shoes and a light colored knock about cap led the way down to the car As they got in he said We d better go to Bernstine s first It s the nearest and on our way to the station A twenty minute s run through a baffling maze of vehicles brought them to the curb before a store with a very conspicuous modern front of plate glass and metal Inside they inquired for one of the Messrs Bernstine and upon one of the gentlemen presenting himself Ashton Kirk handed him his card mister Bernstine was stout bald and affable I have heard of you sir said he and I am delighted to be of service Within the last few weeks said Ashton Kirk you have had a sale of rifles and other things condemned by the military authorities of Bolivia mister Bernstine wrinkled his smooth forehead in reflection Bolivia said he Now let me see He pondered heavily for a few moments and then sighed You see he explained we sell so many lots from so many different places that we can hardly keep the run of them But our books will show proudly everything we do is in our books He looked down the long table crowded store and called loudly Sime Sime instantly put in an appearance He was small sandy haired and freckled he wore an alert expression and carried a marking pencil behind his ear This is our shipping and receiving clerk said mister Bernstine He s up to everything around the place Then he lowered his voice and jerked his fat thumb toward the newcomer secretly addressing Pendleton Clever Just full of it Sime listened to Ashton Kirk s question attentively Yes he said in answer we had some of that stuff lately Sold well too considering the time of the year He pulled open a drawer and took out a fat canvas covered book Two gross rifles one hundred gross cartridges He closed the book tossed it into the drawer and then slid the drawer shut There were a few bayonets too About half a dozen With his round fat countenance shining with admiration mister Bernstine once more caught Pendleton s eye Just full of it he murmured sotto voce As full as he can be The bayonets said Ashton Kirk are what we are after They were all sold I suppose Yes replied Sime I remember when the last one went saying to one of our men that we were lucky You see bayonets don t sell very well except to military companies and they are not organizing every day Do you know who bought them Sime took the marking pencil from behind his ear and proceeded to scratch his head with its point mister Bernstine watched him anxiously But when the shipping clerk pulled open the drawer once more the employer s face lighted up Ah said he to Pendleton The books Now we ll have it They were all taken away by the people who bought them announced Sime after a great flipping of ink spattered pages All except one And that one It went by our boy It was sold to mister Cartwright the artist and was sent to his studio up here in Fifth saint But there was another the last one that we had suddenly and now that I get thinking of it I remember we had some trouble about it The man that bought it was a Dago Pendleton darted a swift look at Ashton Kirk but the investigator s expression never changed He looked steadily at the clock When he asked for the bayonet proceeded Sime I knew we had one left but I could not just lay my hands on it He paid for it and I said we d send it to him He started to give me his address and then changed his mind and said he d come back again And he did Yes the same afternoon I had found the thing by that time and he took it with him You don t recall the address To his employer s evident mortification Sime shook his head Look in the books suggested mister Bernstine with confidence Look in the books It ain t there answered Sime He said he d come back so I didn t put it down Was it Christie Place Sime pointed at Ashton Kirk with his pencil You ve got it said he That was it sure enough And you think the man was an Italian Well he talked and looked like one Rather well educated too I think Ashton Kirk thanked the clerk and the now beaming mister Bernstine and with Pendleton left the place Well said Pendleton as they climbed into the car this about fixes the thing doesn t it The musician Antonio Spatola is the guilty man beyond a doubt The investigator settled back after giving the chauffeur his next stop Beyond a doubt said he is rather an extreme expression The fact that the bayonet was purchased by an Italian who gave his address as Christie Place is not enough to convict Spatola All sorts of people live in that street and there are perhaps other Italians among them Pendleton called out to the chauffeur to stop We ll settle that at once said he Spatola s picture is in the papers We ll ask the clerk if it is that of the man to whom he sold the weapon But Ashton Kirk restrained him I thought of the published portraits while Sime was speaking said he And I also thought that it was very fortunate that neither he nor his employer were readers of the newspapers How do you know that they are not If they had read to day s issues they would have at once connected the Italian who purchased the bayonet with the one who is said to have used it wouldn t they especially as both Italians lived on the same street Bernstine and Sime said nothing because they suspect nothing And as I have said this is fortunate because suspecting nothing they will continue with a smile to say nothing If the police or reporters got this they d swoop down on the trail and perhaps spoil everything But Bernstine or his clerk will hear of the matter sooner or later complained Pendleton And the police and reporters will then get in on the thing anyhow But there will be a delay said his friend And that may be what we need just now Perhaps a few hours will mean success You can never tell The best that we could get by explaining matters to Sime would be a positive identification of Spatola or the reverse And we can get that from him at any time So you see we lose nothing by waiting I guess that s so Pendleton acknowledged and again the car started forward At the huge entrance to a railroad station they drew up once more Within Ashton Kirk inquired for the General Passenger Agent and was directed to the ninth floor The agent was a slim little man with huge whiskers of snowy whiteness and a most dignified manner Oh yes he said after glancing at the investigator s card I have heard of you of course Who with a little bow has not Indeed if I remember aright this road had the honor to employ you a few years ago in a matter necessitating some little delicacy of handling Am I not right And I think it was you said Ashton Kirk smoothly who provided me with some very clearly cut facts which were of considerable service The little General Passenger Agent looked pleased and smoothed his beautiful whiskers softly I was most happy said he Just now said Ashton Kirk I am engaged in a matter of some consequence and once more you can be of assistance to me Sit down invited the other readily Sit down and command me Both Pendleton and the investigator sat down The latter said to the passenger agent I understand that every railroad has a system by which it can tell which conductor has punched a ticket Oh yes A very simple one You see the hole left by each punch is different One will cut a perfectly round hole another will be square still another will be a triangle and so on indefinitely From his card case Ashton Kirk produced the small red particle which he had found upon the desk of the murdered man Here is a fragment cut from a ticket he said It is shaped like a keystone I should like to know if you can tell me what train is taken out by the conductor who uses the keystone punch The agent touched a signal and picked up the end of a tube The head ticket counter said he At once Then he laid down the tube and continued to his visitors He is the man who can supply that sort of information instantly The ticket counter was a heavy set young man in spectacles and with his hair much rumpled He peered curiously at the strangers Does any conductor on our lines use a punch which cuts out a keystone inquired the General Passenger Agent Yes Purvis replied the heavy young man Runs the Hammondsville local I am obliged to you both said Ashton Kirk This little hint may be immensely valuable to me And now to the agent if I could have a moment with Conductor Purvis I would be more grateful to you than ever His train is out in the shed now said the ticket counter looking at his watch Leaves in eight minutes I m sorry that I can t have him up here for you said the passenger agent Just now that is impossible But inquiringly couldn t you speak to him down on the platform Of course replied Ashton Kirk He and Pendleton arose the little man with the large white whiskers was thanked once more as was the heavy young man with the rumpled hair You ll find the Hammondsville train at Gate E the latter informed them Then the two shot down to the platform level and made their way toward Gate E CHAPTER XI PENDLETON IS VASTLY ENLIGHTENED The Hammondsville local was taking on its passengers It was a sooty train made up of three coaches and a combination baggage and smoking car The gateman pointed out its conductor inside and the two approached him He was a spare elderly man with a wrinkled shrewd face and a short pointed manner of speech Oh the General Passenger Agent sent you said he examining them All right What s wanted Your train stops at a station called Cordova does it not It stops at every station on the run Cordova s one of them There is an institution at Cordova I believe For deaf and dumb kids yes Of course some of the people from there ride in and out with you at times I don t get many of the youngsters But the folks that run the place often come to the city You are acquainted with them of course I mean in the way that local conductors come to be acquainted with their regular riders Purvis grinned Say said he It s hard to get acquainted with some of them asylum people There s only a couple of them that can talk I see Pendleton noted Ashton Kirk s dark eyes fixed steadfastly upon the man s face as though he desired to read the remainder from his expression There is one of them continued the investigator whom perhaps you have noticed He s rather a small man and wears thick glasses He also dresses very carefully and he wears a silk hat Oh yes said the conductor I know him He goes in and out quite often Very polite too Always says good day with his fingers if the train is crowded he s a great little fellow for getting up and giving his seat to the ladies Have you ever heard his name Yes It s Locke He s some kind of a teacher Ashton Kirk thanked the man and with Pendleton walked through the gate As they were descending the stairs to the street Pendleton said And now he wears a silk hat does he But you have not made sure of the man You forgot to inquire if mister Locke favored the German dramatists For a moment Ashton Kirk looked puzzled then he burst into a laugh Ah said he you remember that Of course I remember it How can I forget it You go prancing about so like a conjurer that there s not a moment that I don t expect something If you finish by dragging the murderer from your sleeve I ll not be at all astonished Your methods lead me to expect some such a finale To explain each step as I take it said the investigator would be much more difficult than the work itself However the time has now arrived for me to enlighten you somewhat upon this point at least I am quite convinced that this man Locke played a leading part in the murder of Hume He is in a manner definitely placed and I can speak of him without fracturing any of my prejudices They got into the car and Ashton Kirk continued to the chauffeur Christie Place Then to Pendleton he added as the machine started I want to make some inquiries at the house where Spatola lived and in order to make the matter clearer we ll just drop in at four hundred seventy eight As they proceeded along at a bounding pace the investigator related to Pendleton what had passed between Edyth Vale and himself a few hours before Pendleton drew a great breath of relief Of course I knew that her part in the matter was something like that he said but I m glad to hear it just the same He looked at his friend for a moment and then continued But how did you know that Edyth heard a door close immediately after the pistol shot They had just drawn up in front of Hume s and as Ashton Kirk got out he said If you had only used your eyes as we were going over the place said he you d have no occasion to ask that question There was a different policeman at the door but fortunately he knew the investigator and they were allowed to enter at once When about half way up the stairs Ashton Kirk said This I think is about the place where Miss Vale stopped when she saw the light rays moving across the ceiling and wall of the hall You get the first glimpse of those from this point Remain here a moment and I ll try and reproduce what she heard with the exception of the cry Pendleton obediently paused upon the stairs Ashton Kirk went on up and disappeared In a few moments there came a sharp ringing report and Pendleton dashing up the stairs saw his friend standing holding open the showroom door the one with Hume s name painted upon it It s the bell said Ashton Kirk pointing to the gong at the top of the door frame When I examined it this morning I saw that it was screwed up too tight and knew that it would make a sound much like a pistol shot to ears not accustomed to it Pendleton stared in amazement at the simplicity of the thing I see said he While Edyth stood listening on the stairs someone opened this door Yes someone unacquainted with the place Otherwise he would have known of the bell But how did you know that Edyth heard a door close Whoever rang the bell closed the door after him It has a spring lock like the street door and was locked when Miss Vale tried it a few moments later You say that the ringing of the bell shows the person who rang the bell to have been unacquainted with the place I think you must be wrong here Spatola is acquainted with the place he was here at the time This is proven by the scream of the frightened cockatoo which followed the ringing of the bell It was not a cockatoo that made the sound said Ashton Kirk Give me a moment and I think I can convince you of that The gas in the hall was lighted the investigator stopped at the foot of the stairs leading to the fourth floor Persons he continued who secretly enter buildings as a rule never trust to the lighting apparatus of the buildings One reason for this is that it is not under their control another that they cannot carry their light about with them He pointed to the lowermost step of the flight there as before were the stump of candle the burnt matches the traces of tallow upon the wood There were two or more men concerned in this crime proceeded Ashton Kirk and that is the method of lighting that they chose a candle Two men How do you know that asked Pendleton You shall see in a moment replied the investigator Then he continued And the candle was used not only for illumination it served another purpose and so supplied me with the first definite information that my searching had given me up to that time Pendleton looked at the discouraged little candle end with its long black wick the two charred splinters of pine wood and the eccentric trail of tallow droppings Then he shook his head How you could get enlightenment from those things is beyond me he said But tell me what they indicated The candle and the match sticks count for little said Ashton Kirk It is the tracings of melted tallow that possess the secret Look closely at them At first glance they may seem the random drippings of a carelessly held light But a little study will show you a clearly defined system contained in them Well you might say there were three lines of it said Pendleton after a moment s inspection Right said Ashton Kirk Three lines there are and each follows a row of tack heads These latter were apparently once driven in to hold down a step protector of some sort which has since become worn out and been removed The speaker took a pad of paper and a pencil from his pocket Across the pad he drew three lines one under the other Then with another glance at the candle droppings upon the step he made a copy of them that looked like this Illustration sketch of clue Pendleton bent over the result under the flare of the gas light and as he looked his eyes widened Why cried he they look like a stenographer s word signs Good said Ashton Kirk And that my dear fellow is exactly what they are There scrawled erratically in dripping tallow is a three word sentence in Benn Pitman s phonetic characters It is roughly done and may have occupied some minutes but it is well done and in excellent German I ll write it out for you Then he wrote on the pad in big plain Roman letters HINTER WAYNE S BILDNISSE There it is said the investigator done into the German language line for line Brush up your knowledge now let me see you turn it into English Pendleton whose German was rusty from long disuse pondered over the three words Suddenly a light shot across his face then his eyes were in a blaze Behind Wayne s Portrait He fairly shouted the words Astonishment filled him he was trembling with excitement By Heaven he gasped you have it Kirk Now I understand the smashing of the portraits of General Wayne There was something of value hidden behind one of them between the picture and the back But what It was nothing of any great bulk the hiding place indicated points that out surely said Ashton Kirk composedly A document of some sort perhaps Pendleton stood for a moment lost in the wonder of the revelation then his mind began to work once more But I can t understand the writing of the thing upon the step said he It was the fact that it was written that proved to me that there were at least two men concerned One knew the hiding place of the coveted object and this is how he conveyed the information to his companion pointing to the step But protested Pendleton why did he not put it into words Surely it would have been much easier Not for this particular person As it happens he was a mute Again Pendleton s eyes opened widely then recollection came to him and he said It was Locke the man concerning whom you were making inquiries of the railroad conductor Ashton Kirk nodded and replied And it was he who shrieked when the door of the showroom opened The out cry of a deaf mute if you have ever heard one has the same squawking senseless sound as that of a psittaceous bird like the parrot or cockatoo But said Pendleton the fact that the man who scrawled these signs upon the step was a deaf mute scarcely justifies the eccentricity of the thing Why did he not use a pencil as you have done I can t say exactly of course But did it never happen that you were without a pencil at a time when you needed one rather urgently This thing has sort of knocked me off my balance I suppose said Pendleton rather bewildered Don t expect too much of me Kirk He stuffed his hands in his pockets dejectedly and continued You now tell me that this man was a mute Yesterday you said he was small that he was near sighted that he was well dressed and knew something of the modern German dramatists You also told the conductor that he wore thick glasses and a silk hat Now I suppose I m all kinds of an idiot for not understanding how you know these things about a man you never saw But I confess it candidly I don t understand It all belongs to my method of work said Ashton Kirk It s simple enough when you go about it the right way I have already given you my reasons for thinking the man who did this pointing to the step to be a mute I judged that he was of small stature because he chose the bottom step upon which to trace his word signs Even an ordinary sized man would have selected one higher up All right said Pendleton That looks good to me so far The deductions that he was well dressed and also near sighted were from the one source His hat fell off while he was tracing the signs that showed me that he was forced to stoop very close to his work in order to see what he was about You see that don t you How did you know his hat fell off asked Pendleton incredulously missus Dwyer is evidently paid to clean only the hall and lower stairway replied Ashton Kirk composedly And that she sticks closely to that arrangement is shown by the condition of this upper flight The dust upon the step is rather thick If you will notice and he indicated a place on the second step here is a spot where a round flat object rested That this object was a silk hat is positive You can see the sharp impress of the nap in the dust here is the curl in the exact center of the crown as seen in silk hats only And men who wear silk hats are usually well dressed men But how can you be at all sure that the hat fell off Isn t it possible that he took it off and laid it there Possible yes but scarcely probable A well dressed man is so from instinct And his instinctive neatness would hardly permit him to put his well kept hat down in the dust Go on said Pendleton The stairs have been used since the hat fell there but the dust has not been disturbed There is a hand rail on the other side of the flight and consequently all went up and down on that side I can understand the thick glasses said Pendleton his being near sighted suggested those But what made you think he cared for the modern German dramatists That was a hazard merely and the investigator laughed He knew German and was apparently a man of intelligence No man who combines these two things can fail of admiration of Hauptmann Sudermann and their brothers of the pen And then a mute who knew shorthand well enough to have such ready recourse to it struck me as being unusual They all know the digital sign language but German and phonography classed him as one above the ordinary This knowledge brought the suggestion of an institution Then came the suggestion that he might be an instructor in such an institution The fragment from the railroad ticket hinted that the institution might be out of town Fuller s research placed two such institutions The ticket counter at the railroad office narrowed it down to one The conductor of the train all but put his hand on the man There was a short silence Then Pendleton drew a long breath Well Kirk said he I don t mind admitting that you have me winging I ll tell you now it s clever but if I can think of a stronger word later I ll work it in instead We have a pretty positive line on one of the criminals and we will now turn to the other said the investigator briskly It was this other who committed the murder The infirmities of Locke the mute made it impossible for him to venture into the rooms The risks for a deaf and short sighted man would be too great Danger might creep upon him and he neither hear nor see it For some reason which I have not yet discovered but it may have been distrust he had not informed his confederate as to the whereabouts of the object of their entrance When they got as far as this hall he concluded to do so but as neither man had a pencil he conveyed the information as shown then the confederate entered Hume s apartments by the door which missus Dwyer found open This by an oversight may have been left unlocked or the criminals may have had a key However that does not affect the case one way or another It is my opinion that Hume was seated at his desk at this time and heard the intruder enter the storage room then pushing back his chair as we saw it he arose The criminal however sprang upon and struck him so expertly that he collapsed without a sound Then the bayonet came into play A search followed for the thing desired a search short sharp and savage The murderer either found what he sought or the footsteps of Miss Vale upon the stairs frightened him At any rate he pulled open the showroom door the one with the gong Locke still in the hall screamed and both fled up these stairs to the roof and away Pendleton had waited patiently until his friend finished Then he said with a twinkle in his eye You say the murderer opened the show room door the gong rang and then Locke screamed Now old chap that s not possible If Locke is deaf he couldn t hear the gong and so there would be no occasion for him to cry out I think if you ll go back over what I ve really said spoke Ashton Kirk you will find that I have made no mention of Locke crying out because of the gong I said the murderer opened the door that has the gong Then Locke screamed not because he heard anything but because of the sight he saw Ah He caught a glimpse of Hume upon the floor as we saw him You think then that Locke s intentions were not murder At the present time I am led to think so The confederate either was forced to kill to save himself or he had nursed a private scheme of revenge And the ferocity of the blow with the bayonet inclines me to prefer the latter as a theory That brings us back to both Morris and Spatola said Pendleton gravely By all accounts both bore Hume a bitter grudge But the fact that both criminals escaped by the roof shows familiarity with the neighborhood as Miss Vale pointed out to you This seems to point to Spatola So does the purchase of the bayonet and in the same indefinite fashion said Ashton Kirk But come we motored to Christie Place more to inquire about this same Italian than anything else So let s set about it They thanked the policeman in charge and left the building As they proceeded down the street toward the house in which the newspapers had informed them Spatola lived the investigator paused suddenly I think said he it would be best for us to first see Spatola himself and ask a few questions This might give us the proper point of view for the remainder And so they once more got into the car and away they sped toward the place where the violinist was confined CHAPTER XII ANTONIO SPATOLA APPEARS Ashton Kirk and Pendleton were admitted to the cell room at the City Hall without question but a distinct surprise awaited them there 
7463-99909-0001	train-other-500	Through a private door leading from the detectives quarters they saw the bulky form of Osborne emerge and at his heels were Bernstine and his sandy haired clerk
7463-99909-0002	train-other-500	When Osborne caught sight of Ashton Kirk he expanded into a wide smile of satisfaction
none	none	 Hello 
7463-99909-0003	train-other-500	greeted he Glad to see you You re just in time to see me turn a new trick Here s the people that Spatola bought the bayonet from How does that strike you But Bernstine leaned over and said something in a low tone
7463-99909-0004	train-other-500	and the smile instantly departed Oh said Osborne ruefully this is the party who called to see you is it Then turning to Ashton Kirk he asked
7463-99909-0005	train-other-500	How did you get onto this bayonet business Just through thinking it over a little that s all answered the investigator mister Bernstine now approached the speaker a hurt look upon his face
7463-99909-0006	train-other-500	mister Ashton Kirk said he why did you not tell us about this piece of business Why did you not enlighten us How could you go away and leave us in the dark We are very much occupied and have little time to look at the newspapers
7463-99909-0007	train-other-500	It was only by accident that Sime happened to see one Lowering his voice he added There s a smart fellow for you he saw the whole thing in an instant And so we came right here to do what we can to help justice
7463-99909-0008	train-other-500	He squared his shoulders importantly He s seen the bayonet and is prepared to swear to it stated Osborne elated What of the picture of Spatola in the paper asked the investigator
7463-99909-0009	train-other-500	Does he recognize that Osborne s face fell once more These half tones done through coarse screens are never any good said he
none	none	 They d make Gladstone look like Pontius Pilate He s going to have a look at the man himself 
7463-99909-0010	train-other-500	and that ll settle it With that a turnkey was dispatched and in a few moments he returned accompanied by a half dozen prisoners one was a slim dark young man
7463-99909-0011	train-other-500	with a nervous expressive look and a great tangle of curling black hair The face was haggard and drawn the eyes were frightened the whole manner of the man had a piteous appeal
7463-99909-0012	train-other-500	Osborne turned to Sime Look them over carefully directed he Take your time I don t need to answered the freckled shipping clerk He pointed to the dark young man
none	none	 That s the man of the picture but I never seen him before anywhere Osborne put his fingers under his collar and pulled as though to breathe more freely 
7463-99909-0013	train-other-500	then he motioned another attendant to take the remaining prisoners away I see said he He was too foxy to buy the thing himself He sent someone else
7463-99909-0014	train-other-500	Then he fixed his eye on the prisoner and continued We ve got the bayonet on you so you might as well tell us all about it I don t understand said Spatola anxiously
7463-99909-0015	train-other-500	The easier you make it for us the easier it will be for you Osborne told him If you make us sweat fitting this thing to you we ll give you the limit Don t forget that I have done nothing said Spatola earnestly
none	none	 I have done nothing And yet you keep me here 
7463-99909-0016	train-other-500	Is there not a law There is said Osborne grimly That s what I m trying to tell you about Now who bought the bayonet The bayonet Spatola stared
none	none	 The bayonet that Hume was killed with 
7463-99909-0017	train-other-500	With a truly Latin gesture of despair the Italian put his hands to his forehead
none	none	 Always Hume he said 
7463-99909-0018	train-other-500	Always Hume I can not be free of him
none	none	 He was evil in a sort of shrill whisper 
7463-99909-0019	train-other-500	Even when he is dead I am mocked by him He was all evil I believe he was a devil That was no reason why you should kill him said Osborne in the positive manner of the third degree
none	none	 I did not kill him protested Spatola There were many times when it was in my heart to do so But I did not do it 
7463-99909-0020	train-other-500	I ve heard you say all that before stated Osborne wearily Then to the turnkey Take him away Curtis Just a moment interposed Ashton Kirk I came here to have a few words with this prisoner
7463-99909-0021	train-other-500	and by your leave I ll speak to him now All right replied Osborne Help yourself He led Bernstine and Sime out of the cell room the turnkey with professional courtesy
none	none	 moved away to a safe distance 
7463-99909-0022	train-other-500	and Ashton Kirk turned to the Italian You were once first violin with Karlson said he I remember you well I always admired your art
7463-99909-0023	train-other-500	An eager look came into the prisoner s face I thank you he said
none	none	 It is not many who will remember in me a man who once did worthy things 
7463-99909-0024	train-other-500	I am young with despair yet how I have sunken It is something of a drop admitted Ashton Kirk
7463-99909-0025	train-other-500	From a position of first violin with Karlson to that of a street musician How did it happen Sadly the young Italian tapped his forehead with one long finger The fault
7463-99909-0026	train-other-500	he declared is here I have not the what do you call it sense What happened with Karlson happened a dozen times before in Italy in France in Spain I have not the good sense
7463-99909-0027	train-other-500	But justification came into his eyes and his hands began to gesticulate eloquently Karlson is a Swede with contempt The Swedes know the science of music but they are hard they are seldom artists
7463-99909-0028	train-other-500	they cannot express And when one of this nation a man with the ice of his country in his soul tried to instruct me how to play the warm music of my own Italy I called him a fool I see
7463-99909-0029	train-other-500	said the investigator I am to blame said Spatola contritely
none	none	 But I could not help it He was a fool 
7463-99909-0030	train-other-500	and fools seldom like to hear the truth The Germans now said Ashton Kirk insinuatingly are somewhat different from the Swedes Were you ever employed under a German conductor
7463-99909-0031	train-other-500	Twice replied the violinist with a shrug Nobody can deny the art of the Germans But they have their faults They say they know the violin
none	none	 And they do 
7463-99909-0032	train-other-500	but the Italian has taught them The violin belongs to Italy It was the glory of Cremona was it not The tender hands of the Amatis of Josef Guarnerius of old Antonio Stradivari
7463-99909-0033	train-other-500	placed a soul within the wooden box and that soul is the soul of Italy Haupt a German wrote a treatise on the violin said Ashton Kirk If you would read that
none	none	 I have read it cried Spatola I have read it It is like that 
7463-99909-0034	train-other-500	and he snapped his fingers impatiently But you ve probably read a translation in the English or Italian insisted the investigator smoothly And all translations lose something of their vitality you know
7463-99909-0035	train-other-500	I have read it in the German declared the Italian in his own language just as he wrote it
none	none	 It is nothing 
7463-99909-0036	train-other-500	Pendleton looked at Ashton Kirk admiringly the manner in which his friend had established the fact that Spatola knew the German language seemed to him very clever But Ashton Kirk made no sign
7463-99909-0037	train-other-500	other than that of interest in the subject upon which they talked A race that has given the world such musicians as Wagner Beethoven and Mozart said he must possess in a tremendous degree the musical sense
7463-99909-0038	train-other-500	The German knowledge of tone and its combinations is extraordinary and their music in turn is as complex as their psychology and as simple as the improvisation of a child
none	none	 Spatola seemed surprised at this apparent warmth he looked at Ashton Kirk questioningly And with all their scholarship the Germans are so practical went on the latter 
7463-99909-0039	train-other-500	Only the other day I came upon a booklet published in Leipzig that dealt with the difficulty a composer sometimes encounters in getting the notes on paper when a melody sweeps through his brain The writer claimed that the world had lost thousands of inspirations because of this
7463-99909-0040	train-other-500	and to prevent further loss he proffered an invention a system of so to speak musical shorthand A sullen look of suspicion came into Spatola s face
7463-99909-0041	train-other-500	he regarded the speaker from under lowered brows Perhaps you don t quite understand the value of such an invention proceeded Ashton Kirk But if you had a knowledge of stenography and the short cuts it But the Italian interrupted him brusquely
7463-99909-0042	train-other-500	I know nothing of such things said he and what is more I don t want to know anything of them Then in a sharp angry tone he added
none	none	 What do you want of me I am not acquainted with you Why am I annoyed like this 
7463-99909-0043	train-other-500	Is it always to be so first one and then another At this sudden display of resentment the turnkey approached I will go back to my cell Spatola told him and please do not bring me out again My nerves are bad
7463-99909-0044	train-other-500	I have been worried much of late and I can t stand it The turnkey looked at Ashton Kirk who nodded his head And as Spatola was led gesticulating away Pendleton said in a low tone of conviction
none	none	 I tell you Kirk there s your man Besides the other things against him he knows German But what of the phonographic signs He knows them also His manner proved it 
7463-99909-0045	train-other-500	As soon as you mentioned shorthand he became suspicious and showed uneasiness and anger I tell you again
none	none	 with an air of finality he s your man CHAPTER XIII A NEW LIGHT ON ALLAN MORRIS From the City Hall the car headed for Christie Place once more it halted some half dozen doors from Hume s and the occupants got out The first floor was used by a dealer in second hand machinery but at one side was a long dingy entry with a rickety twisting flight of stairs at the end Ashton Kirk rang the bell here and while they waited a man who had been seated in the open door of the machine shop got up and approached them He wore blue overalls and a jumper liberally discolored by plumbago and other lubricants a short wooden pipe was held between his teeth and a cloth cap sat upon the back of his head Looking up the Dago asked he with a grin He jerked a dirty thumb toward the stairs Ashton Kirk nodded the man took the wooden pipe from his mouth blew out a jet of strong smelling smoke and said I knowed he d put a knife or something into somebody some day These people with bad tempers ought to be chained up short Do you know him well inquired the investigator Been acquainted with him ever since he s been living here and that s going on three years Did he have many visitors do you know The man in the cloth cap pulled at his pipe reflectively I can t just say he replied But I ve been thinking he paused here and examined both young men questioningly Then he asked You re detectives ain t you Something of that sort replied Ashton Kirk The man grinned at this Oh all right said he You don t have to come out flat with it if you don t want to I ain t one of the kind that you ve got to hit with a mallet to make them catch on to a thing Here the wooden pipe seemed to clog he took a straw from behind his ear and began clearing the stem carefully At the same time he added As I was saying I ve been thinking That said Ashton Kirk giving another tug at the unanswered bell is very commendable And queer enough it s been about visitors here and the man pointed with the straw toward the doorway Funny kind of people too for a house like this Take a cigar said Ashton Kirk That pipe seems out of commission Then as the man put the pipe away in the pocket of his jumper and lighted the proffered cigar he added What do you mean by funny kind of people The cigar well lighted the man in the overalls drew at it with gentle relish There s a good many kinds of funny people said he Some of them you laugh at and others you don t These that I mean are the kind you don t Now missus Marx the woman that keeps this place is all right in her way but it ain t no swell place at that Her lodgers are mostly fellows that canvass for different kinds of things they wear shiny coats and their shoes are mostly run down at the heels So when I see swell business looking guys coming here I got to wondering who they were That s only natural ain t it Ashton Kirk nodded but before he could reply in words there came a clatter upon the rickety stairs at the far end of the entry A thin slipshod woman with untidy hair and a sharp face paused on the lower step and looked out at them What do you want she demanded shrilly Ashton Kirk followed by Pendleton stepped inside and advanced down the entry Are you missus Marx he inquired Yes snapped the woman What do you want A little information You re a reporter accused the sharp faced woman And let me tell you that I don t want nothing more to say to no reporters But Ashton Kirk soothingly denied the accusation I dare say you ve been bothered to death by newspaper men spoke he But we assure you that It don t make no difference stated the woman rearing her head until her long chin pointed straight at them I ain t got nothing to say to nobody I don t want to get into no trouble The only way you can possibly get into trouble in this matter said the investigator is to conceal what you know An attempt to hide facts is always considered by the police as a sort of admission of complicity The woman at this lifted a corner of a soiled apron and applied it to her eyes Things is come to a nice pass she said vainly endeavoring to squeeze a tear from eyes to which such things had long been strangers when a respectable woman can t mind her own business in her own house At this point Pendleton who looked discreetly away caught the rustle of a crisp bill and when missus Marx spoke again her tone had undergone a decided change But of course she said if the law asks me anything I must do the best I can I ve kept a rooming house for a good many years now gentlemen and this is the first time I have had any notoriety It is I assure you As Ashton Kirk had seen at a second glance missus Marx was a lady fully competent to confront any situation that might arise so he wasted no time in soothing her injured feelings We desire any information that you can give us regarding your lodger Antonio Spatola said he Tell us all you know about him He wasn t a bad hearted young man said the landlady but for all that I wish I d never seen him If I hadn t then I d never had this disgrace come on me Here she made another effort with the corner of her apron but it was even more unsuccessful than the first She gave it up and went on acidly mister Spatola came here almost three years ago He was engaged in one of the vaudeville theaters near here in the orchestra and he rented my second story front at six dollars a week Except for the fact that he would play awfully shivery music at all hours of the night I was glad to have him He was quiet and polite he paid regularly and smoothing back the untidy hair he gave a kind of tone to the house But then he lost his position Had a fight I understand with somebody For a long time he had no work he moved from the second story front at six dollars a week into the attic at two When he could get no place he went on the street and played afterwards he got the trained birds I didn t like this much It didn t do the house no good to have a street fiddler living in it and then the birds were a regular nuisance with their noise But he paid regular and after a while he took to keeping the birds in a box in the loft so I put up with it We ll look at his room if you please said the investigator Complainingly the woman led the way up the infirm staircase At the fourth floor she pushed open a door and showed them into a long loft like room with high ceiling and mansard windows There came a squawking and fluttering from somewhere above as they entered Them s the cockatoos said the landlady They miss mister Spatola very much When I go to feed them with the stale bread and seed he has here for them would you believe it they ll hardly eat a thing The room was without a floor covering Upon some rough shelves nailed to the wall were heaps of music A violin case also lay there There were a few chairs a cot bed and a neat pile of books upon a table Ashton Kirk ran over these quickly they were mostly upon musical subjects and in Italian But some were Spanish English German and French He was the greatest hand for talking and reading languages said missus Marx wonderingly I don t think there was any kind of a nationality that he couldn t converse with mister Sagon that lives on the floor below says that his French was elegant and mister Hertz my parlor lodger used to just love to talk German with him He said his German was so high Ashton Kirk opened the violin case and looked at the instrument within Spatola always carried his violin in this when he went out I suppose he said inquiringly Oh yes that one he did But the one on the wall there pointing to a second instrument hanging from a peg he never took much care of that It s the one he played on the street you see Her visitors followed the gesture with interest That was just to clinch a point I made with Fuller this morning said the investigator to Pendleton in explanation Then to missus Marx he continued mister Spatola had visitors from time to time had he not But the woman shook her head Sometimes he had a pupil who came in the evening But they never came more than once or twice he generally called them thick heads after a little and told them they d better go back to the grocery or butcher s shop where they belonged Are you quite sure that no one else ever called upon him The woman nodded positively I m certain sure of it she said I remember saying more than once to my gentlemen on the different floors that mister Spatola must be awfully lonely sometimes mister Crawford would often come up here and smoke with him and play a game or two of Pedro mister Hertz tried it a couple of times but him and mister Spatola couldn t hit it very well How many lodgers have you I have rooms for nine Just now there are seven But only four are steadies mister Hertz mister Crawford mister Sagon and mister Spatola mister Hertz is an inspector of the people who canvass for the city directory he took the parlor after mister Spatola gave it up He drinks a little but he s a perfect gentleman for all that mister Crawford is a traveling man and is seldom home but he pays in advance so I don t never worry about him mister Sagon is what they call an expert He can t speak much English yet but sometimes even the government in an awed tone sends for him to come to the customs house to tell them how much diamonds are worth that people bring in He works for Baum Brothers and Wright The others bulking them as being of no consequence are all gentlemen who are employed on the directory under mister Hertz Have you any Italian lodgers other than mister Spatola The woman shook her head No she said and I don t want none if this is the way they carry on Are there any other rooming houses in the street No sir It s only a block long and I know every house in it I m the only one as takes lodgers Are there any Italians in business in the block or employed in any of the business places missus Marx again shook her head positively Not any You speak of a mister Sagon Of what nationality is he Oh he s French but he s lived a long time in Antwerp That s where he learned the diamond business And he must have lived in other places in Europe mister Spatola says he has spoken of them often Just then there came from below the sound of a heavy voice singing The words were French and the intonation here and there was strange to Ashton Kirk Who is that he asked It s mister Sagon replied the woman He s the greatest one for singing them little French songs Ah I have it said Ashton Kirk after a moment He s a Basque of course I couldn t place that accent at first A narrow ladder like flight of stairs was upon one side Ashton Kirk mounted these and found himself in a smaller loft a number of well kept cockatoos in cages set up a harsh screaming at sight of him Opening a low door he stepped out upon a tin roof missus Marx and Pendleton had followed him and the former said The police was up here looking They said mister Spatola came through the trap door at Hume s place that night and walked along the roofs and so down to his own room That would he very easily done answered Ashton Kirk as his eye took in the level stretch of roofs After a little more questioning to make sure that the landlady had missed nothing they thanked her and left the house At his door they saw the man in the cloth cap and overalls A second and very unwieldy man with a flushed unhealthy looking face had just stopped to speak to him He supported himself with one hand on the wall Hello called the machinist to Ashton Kirk and as the two approached him he said to the unwieldy man I stopped you to tell you these gents had gone in They re detectives Oh said the man with interest in his wavering eye That so He regarded the two young men uncertainly for a moment and then asked Did missus Marx tell you anything She didn t seem to know much answered the investigator The unwieldy man swayed to and fro an expression of cunning gathering in his face The machinist winked and whispered to Pendleton I don t know his name but he s one of the lodgers Marx declared the unwieldy man is a fine lady But with an elaborate wink she knows more n she tells sometimes The wavering eye tried to fix the investigator but failed signally It don t do he added wisely to tell everything you know Ashton Kirk agreed to this Marx could tell you something maybe said the man And then maybe she couldn t But I know I could give you a few hints if I had the mind and maybe they d be valuable hints too Here he drew himself up with much dignity and attempted to throw out his chest I m a gentleman he declared My name s Hertz And being a gentleman I always try and conduct myself like one But that s more n some other people in Marx s household does Yes Yes sir When a gentleman tries to be friendly I meets him half way But that fellow and he shook a remonstrating finger at the door of the lodging house thinks himself better n other people And mind you with a leer maybe he s not as good Who do you mean the Dago asked the machinist No I mean Crawford A salesman eh The speaker made a gesture as though pushing something from him with contempt Fudge Travels does he Rot He can t fool me And then with energy what did he used to do so much in Spatola s garret eh What did they talk about so much on the quiet I ain t saying nothing about nobody mind you I m a gentleman My name s Hertz I don t want to get nobody into trouble But if Crawford was such a swell as not to want to speak to a gentleman in public why did he hold so many pow wows in private with Spatola That s what I want to know Seeing that the man s befogged intellect would be likely to carry him on in this strain for an indefinite time Ashton Kirk and Pendleton were about to move on But they had not gone more than a few yards when the investigator paused as though struck with an idea He stepped back once more and drew a photograph from his pocket Do you know who this is he asked abruptly holding it up The unwieldy man swayed gently and waveringly regarded the portrait Sure said he surprisedly it s Crawford Ashton Kirk rejoined his friend and as they made their way to the waiting automobile the latter said That is a step ahead of me Kirk I think Where did you get a portrait of this man Crawford By way of an answer the investigator held up the photograph once more Pendleton gave a gasp of amazement Allan Morris said he Allan Morris by George CHAPTER XIV MISS VALE UNEXPECTEDLY APPEARS Edouard Ashton Kirk s cook was astonished and somewhat grieved that day to receive orders that dinner was to be served an hour earlier than usual And Stumph grave and immobile was betrayed into an expression of astonishment when his master and guest sat down to the same dinner in their work a day attire And at best Edouard s delicate art that day received but scant attention Stumph could hardly conceive of a more important thing than the proper and gentlemanly eating of one s dinner Nevertheless other things engaged the attention of the two young men they talked earnestly and in incomprehensible terms mysterious allusions were sprinkled thickly through it all I do not think Stumph told the mortified Edouard in the kitchen that mister Pendleton has tasted the flavor of a single thing he has eaten He listens to mister Ashton Kirk talk he is surprised at everything that he is told there is a trembling in his hands he is so eager No I don t know what it s about But then I never know what mister Ashton Kirk is about He is a very remarkable gentleman And no sooner was the dinner completed than Ashton Kirk s big French car was brought to the door and both young men got into it You ve looked up the road to Cordova inquired Ashton Kirk of the chauffeur Yes sir answered the man Very good road and almost parallel with the railroad No trouble getting there by dark All right Get there as soon as you can They cut into a broad asphalted avenue which eventually led them through the north suburbs into the country The April dusk was settling upon the fields as they raced along in the isolated houses lights were beginning to twinkle there was a swaying among the trees and roadside bush the hum of the flying car must have been borne long distances for far away people raised their heads from the finishing tasks of the day to look at it as it flashed by Pendleton lay back comfortably digesting his dinner and ticking off in his mind the case which engrossed him so much It all tapers down to this he said to himself Hume was murdered by Locke and a confederate in order that they might gain possession of something the nature of which is unknown Kirk is confident of Locke I think he d even go so far as to give him into custody if he had the tangible proofs that the police require But he lacks enthusiasm in the matter of the confederate To my mind it s Spatola or Morris or both Both bore Hume no good will Morris has been spending at least part of his time with Spatola under an assumed name they are known to have been very much engaged in some secret matter Both visited Hume s on the night of the murder An Italian purchased the weapon with which the deed was done A German sentence was written in shorthand by Locke for his confederate Spatola admits he knows German he grows suspicious when shorthand is mentioned And to wind it up Morris has not been seen at his apartments his office or by his friends since the murder was committed At a little unpainted railroad station the investigator broke in on Pendleton s thoughts by calling on the chauffeur to stop There were the usual signboards on each side of the structure announcing that the place was Cordova and there was the usual knot of loungers that are always to be found about such places watching with interest the incoming trains Ashton Kirk called to one of these He was a lanky fellow in a wide brimmed hat and with a sheep like look of complacency What s the best way to doctor Mercer s place asked Ashton Kirk The lanky man reflected There s three or four ways of getting there he stated You can go up the pike and turn at Harbison s store or you can turn down the lane along there a piece and go along until you come to Which is the nearest I ain t never passed no judgment on that but I think the clay road down toward Plattville would get you there the quickest if you didn t get stuck in the ruts I think we d better stick to the pike suggested Pendleton The pike s the best road said the lanky man All the people from Mercer s place use it when they drive here to the station Once more the big French car now with its lamps lighted sped along the road about a mile further on they came to the store referred to by the man as Harbison s Here they received instructions as to how to proceed by the store keeper and after running about four miles along an indifferent wagon road they caught the twinkle of many lights off in the middle of a wide clearing That must be it said the investigator We ll leave the car here to flash up to the door in the quiet of the evening would attract more attention than would be good for us perhaps It was now quite dark but they found a gate a trifle farther on which opened readily and so they proceeded along a walk toward a building which lay blinking at them with its yellow eyes A deep throated dog scented them from off in the distance and gave tongue As they drew near to the institution they heard a man calling to the brute to be still A little further on the man himself suddenly appeared from around the corner of a building with a lantern he flashed this in their faces as he said Well sirs this is against the rules We have no visitors except on Saturdays and then only within reasonable hours We would like to speak to doctor Mercer said Ashton Kirk doctor Mercer is at dinner explained the man with the lantern He don t like it much if he s disturbed at such times We will wait until he has finished we are in no great hurry The man seemed puzzled as to how to act With the light held aloft so that not a feature escaped him he examined them closely Apparently he could see nothing with which to find fault and so he sighed in a perplexed fashion He does not care to have people wait for him complained the man He gets very angry if he is worried by such things while dining You need not announce us until he is through said Ashton Kirk composedly The man hesitated but finally resolved upon a course and led them up a flight of stone steps and into a wide hall The night was raw and a brisk fire of pine knots burning in an old fashioned hall fireplace made the place very comfortable If you will be seated gentlemen requested their guide I will tell doctor Mercer of your presence as soon as he has finished They seated themselves obligingly in a couple of low heavy chairs near the fire and then the man left them The hall was high and rather bare the hardwood floor shone brilliantly under the lights save for the faint murmur of voices from a near by room everything was still I should imagine that a place of this sort wouldn t be at all noisy observed Pendleton in a heavy attempt at jocularity Except for a word now and then they waited in silence for a half hour then a door opened and steps were heard in the hall Both turned and saw a remarkably small man perhaps well under five feet dressed with great care and walking with a quick nervous step His head was very large and partly bald rearing above his small frame like a great bare dome he carried a silk hat in his hand and peered abstractedly through spectacles of remarkable thickness Locke breathed Pendleton as his heart paused for a moment and then went on with a leap The little man apparently did not see them until he was almost beside them then he paused with a start and his eyes grew owlish behind the magnifying lenses as he strove to make them out That he did not recognize them seemed to worry him his thin gray face seemed to grow grayer and thinner with a diffident little bow he passed on and out at the front door Not a very formidable looking criminal commented Ashton Kirk quietly However you can seldom judge by appearances The most astonishing crime that ever came to my notice was perpetrated by the meekest and most conventional man I had ever seen They waited for still another space and then the man who had shown them in presented himself He was now without the lantern but wore a melancholy look doctor Mercer will see you said he in a low voice He is very much vexed at being disturbed He ll remember it against me for weeks He appeared very much disturbed Ashton Kirk placed a coin in the speaker s hand this seemed to have a bracing effect for he led them into his employer s presence in a brighter frame of mind doctor Mercer was seated at the table in his dining room A napkin was tucked in his collar his fat hands were folded across his stomach and he was breathing heavily Gentlemen spoke he rolling his eyes around to them I trust you will pardon my not rising But to exert myself after dining has a most injurious result sometimes My digestion is painfully impaired the slightest excitement causes me the utmost suffering I appreciate the fact that we are intruding at a most inconvenient time said Ashton Kirk And I beg of you to accept our apologies The eyes of doctor Mercer which had the appearance of swimming in fat were removed from his visitors and fixed themselves longingly upon a great dish filled with a steaming heavy looking pudding His breath labored in his chest as he replied The hour is somewhat unusual but as it happens I have about finished my dinner and if your errand is not of a stirring nature I should be pleased to have you state it The man placed chairs in such a position that the doctor would not have to stir to fully observe his visitors This done he was about to withdraw but his employer stopped him at the door Haines complained he you have not taken my order for breakfast The man paused and seemed much abashed at his neglect I really beg your pardon sir said he And with that he produced a pencil and a small book and stood ready I will have one of those trout that I purchased to day directed the doctor Let it be that large fine one that I was so pleased with his swimming eyes ready to float out of his head with anticipation Then I would like some new laid eggs some hot cakes and perhaps a small piece of steak if there is any that is tender and tasty And mind you in an nervous afterthought tell missus Crane to have it but rarely done I will not tolerate it dry and without flavor He pondered awhile apparently much moved by this painful possibility then he added I may as well have a cereal to begin with I suppose And that will be all with the exception of a few slices from the cold roast and some white rolls Carefully Haines had taken this down and after he had read it over at his employer s order and noted a few alterations and additions he departed For a few moments the doctor s eyes were closed in expectant rapture his breathing grew so stertorous that his callers were becoming alarmed but he spoke at last reluctantly resentfully I am now ready to hear you gentlemen if you please And kindly remember that I prohibit anything of an exciting nature at this time We have heard your school highly spoken of said Ashton Kirk And have come to make some inquiries before making up our minds Ah breathed doctor Mercer solemnly you have an afflicted one Too bad Tut tut tut too bad There are many institutions of the sort proceeded the investigator But for the most part they stop at the threshold so to speak of knowledge doctor Mercer roused himself so far as to unclasp his hands and point with one finger at the speaker Sir said he in a voice full of grave significance they seldom reach the threshold A large majority of them are conducted by dishonest persons Afflicted youth left in their charge are rarely properly directed they rarely acquire that digital dexterity so necessary to success in their limited lives The isolated brain so to call it is seldom more than half awakened Unless it is intelligently approached the shadows are never thoroughly dispelled Here he paused panting distressedly his eyes were filled with reproach as he relapsed into his first attitude and his manner was that of one who mutely begged that no further tasks be thrust upon him The difference in institutions of this type lies mainly in the methods employed I believe said Ashton Kirk In the methods and in the persons who apply them replied doctor Mercer in a smothered tone To be sure I have heard something of your teaching staff It is a very excellent one is it not The best in the world The soft fat white hands of the doctor again unclasped themselves and this time both of them were employed in a faintly traced gesture We employ scientists We do not stop at what you have correctly called the threshold We explore the entire structure of the intellect Our Professor Locke himself an afflicted one is a man of vast erudition a scholar of an advanced type a philosopher whose adventures into the field of psychology and natural science is widely known He has charge of the practical work of the Mercer Institute and under him its results are positive and unique We have heard of Professor Locke and drily have seen some of his work If you had stated your business before ah coming in to me spoke the doctor you might have had an opportunity of consulting him He left for his cottage immediately after dining He does not live here then Not in this building no There is a detached cottage at the far end of the grounds which he occupies If you d like to see him and the heavy jowls of the speaker trembled with eagerness Haines will show you there at once If it is no trouble said Ashton Kirk smoothly Not in the least The doctor rang for his man and when he entered said These gentlemen would like to speak to Professor Locke Show them the way to his house And gentlemen to the callers with anxiety the professor can arrange everything with you It is my habit to nod for a half hour after dinner My system has grown to expect it and if I am deprived of it I suffer considerably in consequence We will not trouble you again doctor Ashton Kirk assured him Thank you and good night Once more outside the man led them along a foot path that seemed to cut the institution grounds in two The rays of his lantern danced along the carefully kept lawn the shadowy trees seemed to move backward and forward as the thin beams wavered among them The professor lives a good piece away the man informed them Away over on the county road Prefers to be alone eh I suppose so sir And then he has his laboratory and work shop there well away from interruption He don t like to be much disturbed while he is engaged in his studies Few of us do said Pendleton Quite right sir They walked along in silence for a time then they caught a clear humming noise from some distance ahead A motor car said Pendleton It s on the county road said the man with the light We always hear them when the wind blows from that direction After some fifteen minutes steady walking they saw a long twinkling shaft of light coming from among the trees That s the house said Haines I hope the professor ain t busy you wouldn t believe what a blowing up he can give a body with his fingers when he s vexed I d almost rather have the doctor himself though as a rule the professor is a very nice gentleman The house was a brick structure of two stories and dimly lighted on the lower floor Near by was a long shed like building the windows of which were brilliantly lighted He s at work said Haines in a troubled tone And in the shop too If it was even the laboratory it wouldn t be so bad But he does get so interested in the shop That machine means more to him whatever it is than anything else about the place There came a harsh burring sound from within both the shop and the house Haines seemed surprised Visitors he said He seldom has one and I never knew any to come at night before They saw the figure of Locke cross one of the shed windows toward a door And just then Ashton Kirk stumbled rather heavily against Haines the lantern dropped to the ground and was extinguished I beg your pardon said the investigator in a rueful tone then he began to rub his shins That was rather hard whatever it was The door of the building opened and Locke appeared his great bald head shone in the light that streamed after him and it was thrust forward as he strove to penetrate the darkness ahead He feels the vibrations of those buzzers Haines told them and knows right away when anyone wants to get in He began fumbling with the lantern as Locke disappeared but Ashton Kirk said to him You need not light that We can see very well And on second thought you need not wait either We can introduce ourselves to Professor Locke without troubling you further Thank you sir said the man vastly relieved They all have queer dispositions you see and I don t like to trouble them At once Haines made his way back along the path by which they had approached some distance away they saw him kindle his lantern and then watched the yellow spark as it glanced fitfully away across the grounds The cottage and work shop of Professor Locke appeared to be set back some little distance from what Haines had called the county road a grove of tall trees thickened the shadows all about and it was into these trees that the professor had gone The buzzer must have the button that sounds it attached to a gate opening upon the road said Pendleton They stood for a short time in silence then Pendleton nudged his friend with an elbow Look he whispered There at the door of the shed Ashton Kirk did so And he was just in time to see a large iron gray head a craggy powerful face and a pair of thick shoulders the expression and attitude were those of a man listening intently Almost instantly as Ashton Kirk s gaze fell upon him the man withdrew Humph exclaimed Pendleton under his breath Who s that I wonder They waited for some time longer in silence But the little man did not return nor did the head appear again at the shop door Ashton Kirk appeared puzzled Locke intended returning at once he said to Pendleton Otherwise he would have closed his work shop door Then his eyes wandered toward the house and his grip closed tightly upon his companion s arm Look whispered he in his turn Pendleton s gaze flew toward the house The lower windows had been dimly lighted when they approached but now the glow from them was high and brilliant In one of the rooms they saw Locke he was striding up and down his hands clinched and gesturing his face upturned writhing hideously Seated at a table calmly engaged in examining something traced upon a sheet of paper and apparently not paying the slightest attention to the gesticulating man was a young woman And Pendleton felt himself grow suddenly faint and sick as he recognized Edyth Vale CHAPTER XV MISS VALE DEPARTS SUDDENLY For a moment there was a silence between the two men then Ashton Kirk said dryly 
7463-99912-0001	train-other-500	Miss Vale has apparently not been altogether frank with us in this matter You think then began Pendleton in a voice of terror But Ashton Kirk stopped him
7463-99912-0002	train-other-500	I think many things said he But they are neither here nor there Facts are what count Put the circumstances together for yourself and see where they lead you
none	none	 Miss Vale has been from the first mixed up more or less in this crime She explained As far as I knew the explanation was made in good faith Now we find her here in this lonely place 
7463-99912-0003	train-other-500	quietly engaged with a man whom I have convinced myself is one of Hume s murderers There was another pause this time it was Pendleton who broke the silence As you say
7463-99912-0004	train-other-500	spoke he in a strange throaty sort of tone she has not been quite frank Take all the circumstances together and they seem to point He paused as though quite unable to finish
7463-99912-0005	train-other-500	Ashton Kirk laid a hand upon his shoulder Imagination is a thing that is vitally necessary in this sort of work said he But it must be held in check by reason
none	none	 The great trouble with an amateur is that he reasons up to a certain point 
7463-99912-0006	train-other-500	then he allows his imagination to take a long leap toward a result The upshot is that his results have seldom anything to support them The correct method I think is to allow the imagination to scurry ahead
7463-99912-0007	train-other-500	in the way that is natural to it but reason must follow close behind proving each step of the way To be sure you may have theories hypotheses ideas without end but you must never take them for granted
7463-99912-0008	train-other-500	Select each in its turn place it in a tube as the chemist does add a few drops of reason and you may produce a fact It is the only way to go about it
7463-99912-0009	train-other-500	Once a man becomes fixed in a belief be there ever so little foundation for it his mind stops revolving the subject further procedure is hopeless I understand all that well enough
7463-99912-0010	train-other-500	said Pendleton But and he waved his hand toward the house what does this mean I don t know said Ashton Kirk And neither do you So that being the case
7463-99912-0011	train-other-500	there is but one thing to do find out They gazed toward the window once more Miss Vale had apparently mastered the contents of the paper and was now engaged in writing rapidly
7463-99912-0012	train-other-500	As the young men watched she stopped read carefully what she had written and then handed it to Locke The mute carried the paper to the light and holding it very near to his eyes read it with much attention
none	none	 then he tore it into strips 
7463-99912-0013	train-other-500	placed it upon the red coals of a stove which stood near him and watched it burn Facing Miss Vale his fingers began to fly rapidly in intricate signs This only lasted a moment however for he stopped
7463-99912-0014	train-other-500	gestured passionately seized a pad of paper and began to write While he was thus engaged Ashton Kirk said to Pendleton in a low tone Remain here for a moment Then
7463-99912-0015	train-other-500	slowly carefully the investigator made his way toward the window through which Miss Vale and Locke were to be seen Heavy beams of light shot across the ground from the windows
7463-99912-0016	train-other-500	but here and there were trails of shadow He clung to these until he had reached the shelter of the walls then to Pendleton s amazement he stepped directly in front of the window through which the two were to be seen
none	none	 rapped smartly upon the glass and remained standing in full view of the two in the room Illustration HE RAPPED SMARTLY ON THE WINDOW Pendleton saw the pad drop from Locke s hands he saw the mute wheel as he felt the vibrations and stare at the window his eyes puckered and straining He also saw Miss Vale rise saw her hands thrown out in a gesture much like despair 
7463-99912-0017	train-other-500	and also he heard the cry that she uttered muffled by the confines of the room but full of fear Then the room was plunged into darkness
none	none	 an instant later a door was heard to open 
7463-99912-0018	train-other-500	the sound of quick moving feet came to him there followed the pulsations of a motor and the racing of a car away into the night She s off breathed the young man
7463-99912-0019	train-other-500	and there was undoubted relief in the knowledge She s off and I really believe that s what Kirk was after He walked toward the house and found his friend standing in the shadows Well chuckled the investigator
7463-99912-0020	train-other-500	it did not take her long to make up her mind eh You had some motive in doing that accused Pendleton What was it Ashton Kirk was about to reply
7463-99912-0021	train-other-500	but just then the small figure of Locke made its appearance He carried a lantern and was approaching with stumbling steps his eyes peering and blinking in their efforts to pierce the gloom Not until he was well upon the two did he make them out
7463-99912-0022	train-other-500	then he halted lifted the light above his head and surveyed them intently In the rays of the lantern Ashton Kirk smiled urbanely and bowed
none	none	 The supple fingers of the mute writhed inquiringly 
7463-99912-0023	train-other-500	Each of them forms itself into a wild note of interrogation said Pendleton They are fairly screaming questions at you Ashton Kirk smiled even more agreeably at Locke and shook his head
7463-99912-0024	train-other-500	Then he went through the pantomime of one writing and finished by pointing to the house Carefully eagerly fearfully the mute examined them
7463-99912-0025	train-other-500	his near sighted eyes and the wavering light must have made it all but impossible for him to make them out However he at length motioned for them to follow him and started back by the way which he had come
7463-99912-0026	train-other-500	But after a few steps he halted He indicated that they were to remain where they were then he went to the shed like building closed the door and locked it placing the key in his pocket
7463-99912-0027	train-other-500	It would seem observed Ashton Kirk that we are not to be trusted implicitly Also replied Pendleton that there is something of value in the shed
7463-99912-0028	train-other-500	Returning Locke led the way to a door upon the other side of the house Showing them into a small room furnished with books and scientific apparatus and evidently a study
7463-99912-0029	train-other-500	he set down the lantern and with a sign bade them be seated Upon their doing so he produced a small pad of paper and a pencil handing these to Ashton Kirk he stood peering at them expectantly
7463-99912-0030	train-other-500	With the swift accurate touch of an expert the investigator wrote in the Pitman shorthand We ask pardon if we have startled you Then he tore off the sheet and handed it to Professor Locke
7463-99912-0031	train-other-500	The man seemed surprised at the medium selected by his visitor nevertheless he quickly traced the following in the same characters Who are you What is your errand We were sent to you by doctor Mercer
7463-99912-0032	train-other-500	replied Ashton Kirk with flying pencil Our business is to secure the admission of a new pupil Locke read this and regarded them for a moment doubtfully Why did you not press the button at the door
7463-99912-0033	train-other-500	he demanded in writing I hardly expected you to have such a thing as a bell answered Ashton Kirk on the pad And so seeing you I attracted your attention as best I could
7463-99912-0034	train-other-500	Professor Locke read this and stood with his pencil poised when the buzzer sounded harshly he went at once into the hall they heard him open the door and in a few moments he returned
7463-99912-0035	train-other-500	followed by Haines The fingers of the two flashed their signals back and forth then a look of relief came into Locke s face he even smiled and nodded understandingly at the two young men
7463-99912-0036	train-other-500	I beg pardon gentlemen said Haines But when I got back to the hall doctor Mercer made me return and make sure that you had got to see the Professor Thanks replied the investigator We had not the slightest difficulty
none	none	 I m glad to hear it sir 
7463-99912-0037	train-other-500	said the man Good night to you He flashed the same wish to the mute who answered readily then he went out and through the window they saw his light again go bobbing away in the darkness
7463-99912-0038	train-other-500	Then the professor began to write once more I beg your pardon was his message in long hand The man tells me that it was quite as you say But I must confess I was a trifle startled
7463-99912-0039	train-other-500	The lady wrote Ashton Kirk seemed startled too For the fraction of a moment the mute halted in his reply Then the pencil with much assurance formed the following
7463-99912-0040	train-other-500	It was my niece She was about to go just as you came so do not reproach yourself for having driven her away For some time the penciled conversation continued between the two
7463-99912-0041	train-other-500	but as it was all based upon the fanciful pupil whom the investigator stated he desired to place in doctor Mercer s care Pendleton paid little heed to it At last however they bid the Professor good by and left him upon the threshold
none	none	 his massive head nodding his adieus 
7463-99912-0042	train-other-500	his frail little body sharply outlined by the glow from the hall The two had reached their own car around on the other road before Pendleton spoke Then he inquired Well
none	none	 have you learned anything from him I think I can say yes to that answered the other But I m not yet sure I ll have to put it to the proof first according to the formula which I gave you a half hour ago 
7463-99912-0043	train-other-500	If it succeeds I ll tell you what it is if it does not I ll say nothing and it will go upon the scrap heap devoted to broken fancies And now Dixon to the chauffeur
none	none	 we ll go home CHAPTER XVI STEEL AGAINST STEEL Shortly before noon next day Ashton Kirk in an immaculate morning suit was ushered into the presence of Miss Edyth Vale If he expected confusion embarrassment or anything of that sort he was disappointed for she greeted him eagerly and with outstretched hand This is a surprise she said He held her hand and looked meaningly at her My appearances are sometimes surprising he said But I usually select the night for them the effect is better then you see She smiled into his eyes I have no doubt but that you are dreadfully mysterious she said But please sit down She seated herself near the window holding a book in her hand she fluttered the leaves to and fro The composure thought the investigator as he sat down is somewhat overdone I wonder said Miss Vale looking at the book if you are an admirer of Ibsen And as he nodded she proceeded with a slight smile I know that he is scarcely the usual thing for a spring morning But there are times when I simply can t resist him He s a strong draught at any time said Ashton Kirk But his tonic quality is undoubted His disciples claim that for him at any rate she answered But sometimes I question its truth Where is the tonic effect of Rosmersholm I think it full of terrors She shuddered and added The White Horses will haunt me for weeks It s the atmosphere of crime said he That quiet home on the western fiords reeks with it She made a gesture of repulsion It s ghastly she exclaimed And somehow one feels it from the very first before a word is spoken Imagine Rebecca at the window watching through the plants to see if Rosmer uses the footbridge from which his wife once leaped to her death She paused a moment her eyes upon the open pages then lifting her head she asked What do you think of Rebecca A tremendous character of wonderful strength It was just such proud dark purposeful souls that Byron delighted to draw but the only one in literature to whom I can fully liken her is the wife of Macbeth There was the same ambition the same ruthless will the same disregard of everything that stood in her way And like Cawdor s wife she weakened in the end She regarded him fixedly Would you call it weakness she asked She fell in love with Johannes did she not That was weakness for her She herself recognized it as such The girl looked at him thoughtfully for a moment That is true she said Some of the world s most daring and accomplished criminals have been women he went on But Nature never intended woman to be the bearer of burdens there is a weakness in her soul structure somewhere she usually sinks under the consciousness of guilt More so than men do you think As a rule yes She put down the book and clasped her hands in her lap There is no need to sympathize with Rebecca she said She was brave and strong even in her love for Johannes But he and there was a note in her voice that recalled the night he had listened to it over the telephone he was different There is no more dreadful thing in the play to me than the character of Rosmer To think of him sitting quietly in that charnel house prospering in soul growing sleek in thought becoming stored with high ideas Perfect peace came to him in spite of the stern faced portraits which shrieked murder from the walls He dreamed of freeing and ennobling mankind and all the time Fate was weaving a net about him that was to drag him from the mill bridge after his dead wife Kroll knew him said the investigator And he said Rosmer was easily influenced It is usually men of that type who are drawn into the vortex which swirls at every door Her face was a little pale but she now arose with a laugh and began rubbing her finger tips with a handkerchief I think we d better remove the dust of the Norwegian she said and I make a vow never to read him again in the morning She stood looking down at her caller good humoredly and continued I suppose it is my fault but you have a dreadfully gloomy expression Or maybe as an afterthought you ate an unwholesome dinner last night Were you at the Perrings by any chance He shook his head his keen eyes searching her face No said he I had much more important matters on hand She held up her hand It was something about this Hume affair she said Yes he replied The smile was now gone she leaned back against a heavy table her fingers tightly clasping its edge I have been trying to forget that dreadful thing she said I ve stopped looking at the papers because I would be sure to see it mentioned And with never a faltering in her eyes because I might be reminded of it in some other way I now remain indoors Last night was an exception perhaps suggested he smoothly Last night There was a questioning look in her beautiful eyes the finely posed head with its crown of bright hair bent toward him inquiringly An expression of chagrin crept into his face You were not out last night then said he What makes you think so smilingly It was dreadfully dull here too But then with a shrug anything is better than a constant reminder of that Christie Place affair He nodded understandingly I suppose it is very distressing He frowned gloomily at the tips of his shoes and she could see that he bit his lip with vexation After a moment or two he said It s very strange but I was quite sure I saw you last night Yes Her tone was one of careless interest However he went on I had but a glimpse of the lady and could easily have been mistaken He wore a baffled look but smiled as he got up And said he my visit of this morning was based upon the sight I fancied I had of you last night She laughed amusedly It was something interesting she said Please tell me about but no no hastily If it has anything to do with the Hume case I d rather not hear it She had pressed the bell call for the footman when he said mister Morris still keeps himself well concealed I note Like a tigress leaping to defend her young she met the accusation mister Morris has done no wrong she declared spiritedly And there is no need of his concealing himself Of course I will not say as to that His voice was soothing and low But he makes a mistake in not coming forward His name you have noticed has already appeared in the papers in direct connection with the murder He glanced at her keenly once more It may be that he has gone away upon some urgent business she said And the chances are that he has not heard anything of the matter If he had gone away on business don t you think he would have mentioned it to someone Perhaps he did not think it necessary And again maybe he did not expect to be gone so long Such things frequently happen you know They do admitted Ashton Kirk But in the case of Allan Morris they somehow fail to fit I am convinced that he is in hiding She regarded him steadily for a moment then she said You are convinced you say I am May I ask upon what your conviction is based Not now no There was another pause the man was at the door ready to show the investigator out Perhaps and her tone was very low you even fancy that you know his hiding place Not just yet said he but in a few hours at most I will Her lips formed the good by as he stood in the doorway but she made no sound And Ashton Kirk as he walked down the hall smiled quietly to himself CHAPTER XVII WHAT HAPPENED ON THE ROAD About half an hour after Ashton Kirk had left the Vale mansion a Maillard car drew up before the door As it did so an Italian laborer arose from the curb not far away where he had been comfortably seated with his back against a tree then throwing his arms wide in a luxurious yawn he started leisurely down the street Five minutes later a veiled dust coated female figure descended the step the driver of the Maillard was dismissed and Miss Vale composedly took his place at the wheel As the car started forward the gauntleted hands guided it firmly the steady eyes were set straight ahead as the lever was pushed first to one speed and then another And as the rapid pulse of the motor was borne along the quiet avenue the Italian laborer calmly appeared from around a corner pushing a powerful looking motor cycle before him Another moment and the machine was sounding its wild fusillade the Italian sped away in the same direction as the Maillard his battered soft hat set jauntily upon the back of his head his gay colored neckkerchief streaming in the wind The car kept to the avenue for a long time but finally in the far suburbs it made a sharp turn to the left and a few miles further on shot into a broad highway that ran parallel with the railroad Bending forward so as to offer the least resistance to the wind the Italian s swarthy face relaxed at this his fine white teeth showed in a smile Cordova I think muttered he in very good English If not then somewhere very near to it Once upon the highway which was hard level and practically deserted the Maillard increased its speed Eddies of dust curled in its wake its hum resembled that of a gigantic top its shining brass and smooth gloss made it look like a streak of light But the motor cycle was of the best its compact powerful mechanism answered bravely to each call that was made upon it by the dark faced man in the saddle its explosions had merged into one long volley At a small and not very firm looking bridge the Maillard slowed down apparently for the first time Miss Vale heard the cycle in the rear for she turned and gave it a quick look But the dust of her own progress hung thickly in the air and she could not see very clearly Passing the bridge at a low rate of speed she turned again The dark face of the rider his battered hat and flying kerchief seemed to satisfy her for once more she gave attention to her course and again the car increased its speed A mile or two further on there was a rather broken stretch of road and she was forced to slow down As the sound of her own vehicle diminished she as before caught the volleying of the motor cycle and as she turned the eyes that looked through the veil were intent and searching This time she appeared not so well satisfied for upon reaching the end of the broken stretch she drew her car to one side and stopped As the hammering explosions of the motor cycle grew plainer and plainer she sat rigidly erect upon her seat her face turned directly ahead But a close observer would have noted a slow movement of her right hand among the folds of the dust coat and if he was also an experienced observer he would have immediately understood that Miss Vale did not venture alone and unarmed upon the road However the Italian never even gave her a glance as he came up his machine flew by with a swirl amid a crashing crescendo then it disappeared in the dust of the distance But Miss Vale when she once more resumed her journey had not gone much more than a mile when she came upon the same swarthy son of the south and his vociferous machine But the latter was now silent enough it leaned against a fence and its rider knelt beside it a wrench in his hand testing its parts carefully and intently The Maillard was less than a quarter of a mile away when Miss Vale caught the rapid series of explosions once more With a quick glance ahead she threw the lever forward and the car tore along at a breathless rate Fences ran by in a giddy staggering line trees seemed merged into one tangle of branches the dust arose in solid towers behind her However she held to this but a scant five minutes her breath was short when she decreased the power the hands upon the wheel shook a little but her head was held erect her face was still purposefully set forward Above the decreasing hum of her car came the swift brave shocks of the motor cycle But if there was a dread that fell to tightening at her heart she showed it little The Maillard still bore swiftly on she did not once turn her head A little further on there came into view a post with a series of white pointing sign boards that indicated a cross roads When still a hundred yards from this the car stopped once more again the Italian flew by again he vanished this time around a bend beyond the cross roads But once hidden by the bend he stopped and got down the smile again appeared upon his face the brilliant teeth shone good naturedly A simple little ruse he said to himself And one that I ve seen used with effect more than once Evidently Miss Vale has her wits about her Leaning against his machine he waited and listened From around the bend came the low sound of the Maillard nearer and nearer it came for a time then it began to recede At this the Italian remounted the explosions of his motor were muffled as he went swiftly along upon the way by which he had come At the cross roads he slowed up and examined the ground Deep in the dust was the broad impress of the tires showing the car to have taken the turn to the left Then swiftly the cycle turned into the same road and took up the trail once more Some three miles further on the track veered back toward the highway along a badly cut dirt road Slow going for a heavy car said the pursuer calmly It will not be long before I sight it again There was a hard beaten footpath at one side of the road taking to this the man on the motor cycle found it easy traveling enough Shortly after he caught the laborings of the Maillard as it made its way through the binding ruts then he slowed down and ran easily along the path content apparently to keep in sound of the chase But upon finally reaching the highway he increased his speed until he sighted the dust of the car this he hung to like a beagle but never once allowed the car itself to come into view At last the sounds of the Maillard ceased and the pall of dust thinned and dissolved itself in the air The motor cycle ran swiftly on until the car now at a standstill became visible then the Italian got down took out a pair of field glasses and swept the highway before him What he saw must have satisfied him that there would be no more use for his machine for a time at least for he pushed it to a place where there was a break in a fence and concealed it behind a musty looking corn shock left from the fall before Then placing the glass under his arm he walked guardedly along the road in the direction of Miss Vale s car Some distance further on there was a tall swamp maple growing by the roadside it was an easy task to mount into its branches from the top fence rail then resting snugly in a high fork he leveled his glass and proceeded to scan the scene before him Miss Vale had descended from her car her veil was raised and she was gingerly picking at the mechanism with hands sheathed in canvas gloves With apparent intentness she took out tools small parts were inspected minutely And yet for all that there was something unusual in her manner every now and then she would lift her head casually so it seemed and glance away across the fields And always to the right murmured the man in the tree top after a little At once the big glass swept around in that direction A house added the watcher with great satisfaction The building was almost buried in a thick growth of trees its white sides and red roof shone in the sun through branches abud with April Suddenly in the midst of her labor Miss Vale paused her manner changed the tools were dropped the parts lost interest Facing the house she yawned with arms thrown wide after the manner of one much wearied with a task then she took off the gloves unpinned her hat and smoothed her hair This was gone through with careful elaboration and afterwards there was a pause the girl then gathered up the things got into the machine placed the hat upon the seat beside her went careening away with never a backward glance But the man in the tree seemed in no haste to follow instead he covered the distant house with his glass and waited patiently Five ten fifteen minutes passed then half an hour and finally an hour At the end of that time however a figure emerged from the trees about the house and walked hastily toward the road the eyes of the watcher glistened his fine teeth shone in an appreciative smile Reaching the road where the car had stopped the newcomer who was young well dressed and rather good looking suddenly paused stooped and lifted something from the ground He held in his hands the work gloves of Miss Vale which she had dropped after taking them off For a moment the young man stood looking at them as though hesitating what to do then he turned went to the roadside and placed them carefully upon the top rail of the fence Then trudging along on his way he unsuspectingly passed beneath the maple which concealed the man with the glass When he was out of sight the Italian slipped down the tree and ran lightly along the road to the place where the gloves lay He took up one and looked within but it was empty However in the thumb of the next was a slip of paper which bore a single line of writing Tobin Rangnow Studying this for a moment the Italian made a copy of it Then he slipped it back into the thumb of the glove and replaced both exactly as they were after which he made his way back to the motor cycle and mounting went flying toward the city CHAPTER XVIII ASHTON KIRK TELLS WHY It was about four in the afternoon and young Pendleton sat in Ashton Kirk s big chair reading the newspapers and waiting Finally he rang a bell and Stumph gravely appeared Are you sure that he said three asked Pendleton About three sir replied the man Oh I suppose he s been detained then That will be all Stumph When the man disappeared Pendleton lighted a cigar and resumed his reading The Hume case was still holding its place as the news feature of the day Nothing had occurred to equal it in sensation and the huge headings flared across the front pages undiminished and undismayed Why screamed the Standard in a perfect frenzy of letter press did Miss Edyth Vale visit Hume on the night of the murder The girl s name had crept into the paper on the day before with each edition it appeared in larger type and that afternoon the Standard was printing it in red ink Allan Morris was not neglected on the contrary he figured a very close second to his betrothed in the types Where is Allan Morris One paper asked this question perhaps fifty times on each page It peered at one in square heavy faced type from the bottoms of columns and between articles There were interviews with his clerks the opinions of his stenographer were given in full together with her portrait and what his man servant had to say was treated as being of great consequence Another sheet which made a point of appealing to the tastes of the vast foreign element of the city grew very indignant as to the arrest of Antonio Spatola Why it inquired is this man detained and no attempt made to take those higher up into custody If the Police Department is so ready to incarcerate a poor musician why should it hesitate upon the threshold of the rich man s mansion or the rich woman s for the matter of that This item incensed Pendleton beyond measure he threw the paper aside and stormed up and down the room Of all the blatant wretched twaddle I ever did read he exclaimed this is positively the worst Why the rag would have the police arrest Edyth arrest her for Well demanded a sharp aggressively pitched voice what for you make a da blame eh Da cops pinch a Spatola and for why eh Because he s da wop da Ginney da Dago and got a no friends At the first word Pendleton had whirled about in astonishment and faced the speaker who stood in the doorway pointing with one hand in the attitude of melodrama Well asked the young man who the deuce are you By way of an answer the other burst into a laugh that showed his brilliant teeth then he threw off his battered soft hat and gayly colored handkerchief after which he sank into the chair which Pendleton had lately vacated Pen said he in an altered voice if you appreciate my friendship at all give me one of the blackest cigars in the case over there Pendleton stared for a moment then a grin crept over his face and he said Oh it s you is it He went to the cabinet and took out a box Here s a brand that looks like black Havana he said And now what the dickens are you doing in that rig I ve been taking a long ride in the country on a motor cycle answered Ashton Kirk crossing his shabbily clothed legs and striking a match Any time you feel disinclined to face your meals Pen I recommend you heartily to do the same It is a greater bracer At this moment I really believe I could do complete justice to even the very best culinary thoughts of our friend doctor Mercer Pendleton sat down and regarded his friend with questioning eyes It wasn t to acquire an appetite that you made up this way You ve been working Ashton Kirk comfortably blew one smoke ring through another before he answered Will you be surprised to hear that I have been following Miss Edyth Vale on a little voyage to the neighborhood of Cordova Again But this time she did not pay a visit to Professor Locke To day the favored one was Allan Morris Morris Then she knows where he is So it would seem But she told you the other day that she did not Ashton Kirk shrugged his shoulders Things happen swiftly and unexpectedly said he Perhaps she did not know it then And perhaps she did not know Locke or his whereabouts either said Pendleton with bitter irony Who knows replied Ashton Kirk composedly At any rate it was just a supposition that led to my labors of to day I don t think I understand said Pendleton after a moment Last night said the investigator you asked me if I had learned anything from Professor Locke And I replied to the effect that I thought I had Now after a pause devoted to the grateful smoke when one sees a girl circumstanced as Miss Vale assuredly is in this case paying a secret visit to a man who is rather more than suspected of the murder what does one suppose That she is leagued with him somehow replied Pendleton reluctantly Exactly But on the other hand when the same girl upon sight of us rushes off and leaves the man to face us without giving him a hint as to who we are what does one suppose But Pendleton rose gloomily and strode over to the window I don t know said he One supposes proceeded Ashton Kirk that she has not much interest in him Here Pendleton faced about again If she had been leagued with him as you put it you may be sure that she would have managed to warn him in some way as to our identity But that she had not done so the mute s manner told me as plainly as words could have done Seeing this I began figuring what it meant If she was not associated with Locke in the crime why was she there Immediately came the answer through Morris But when I saw her last she denied any knowledge of Morris s whereabouts Then I reasoned she had seen him in the interim That s it cried Pendleton as he stepped forward and slapped the table with his palm that s it beyond a doubt He s managed to get word to her she s seen him he s told her all or part of the truth and once more she s trying to help him Why Kirk I ll venture to say hot with indignation that she was led to visit this little scoundrel Locke last night much as she was led to visit Hume s place on the night of the murder completely in the dark and merely with some sort of a vague notion of protecting Morris Perhaps you are right but I can t exactly say But that she has seen Morris I have made quite sure How Last night when I appeared at Locke s window I established a reason for calling upon her this morning also I laid a foundation for what followed Before the call I made certain preparations for a quick change of front with a gesture that called attention to his costume in our conversation I managed to tell her that Morris s hiding place was discovered Then I left As I expected she at once called her car and set off to warn him and I followed close behind upon the motor cycle I see I see And did you get sight of him Ashton Kirk nodded Then he proceeded to relate the story of the noon day run to the country house which Morris had selected as a hiding place When he had finished Pendleton sat frowning blackly Secret signals said he He fears discovery so much that he has forbidden her approaching the house A regular code has been arranged eh And the gloves were dropped in the road purposely he slipped his answer into one of them on her way back she discovers her supposed loss looks for the gloves and finds them It is quite ornate with a bitter sneer Then he took from the investigator s hand the card upon which he had copied the message of Allan Morris Tobin Rangnow he read Then looking up he inquired with a wan smile More secret writing eh Or is it a man s name There is a decided Irish flavor to Tobin answered Ashton Kirk But Rangnow is unfamiliar to me and if it is a name at all it is of Eastern European origin In that case laughing it could scarcely be expected to share the honors with Tobin He took the card from Pendleton and looked at it thoughtfully Then he glanced up in a satisfied sort of way As you suggested Miss Vale no doubt returned recovered her gloves and read the message said he As she had just warned him that his hiding place was discovered it is only natural to suppose that his answer would have something to do with his future movements That seems likely enough said Pendleton Look here if we put a comma between the two words went on the investigator taking out a pencil and doing so the thing takes on the appearance of a name and address Once more he gave the card to Pendleton then rising he went to the telephone stand and took up the directory Skimming rapidly through this he paused at a page and went down its columns carefully Then with a laugh he slapped it shut We have it declared he When we so desire we can call at an apartment house known as the Rangnow and inquire for mister Tobin And when we see that gentleman we shall be looking upon one in the confidence of Allan Morris There was a long pause on the part of Pendleton Ashton Kirk rang for Stumph and directed him to turn the water into his bath and get him out some fresh linen It was after the man had gone that Pendleton spoke When you came in Kirk he said you said something which conveyed the notion that you would not be much astonished if the police took up the Hume matter with Edyth Vale It is only the fact that the newspapers were first in discovering her apparent connection with it that has kept Osborne and his fellows from visiting her before this Jealousy you know does many strange things Pendleton did not reply he bent his head and covered his face with his hands Ashton Kirk went on The reasonable thing for her to do would be to come forward and tell the plain truth Pendleton roused himself But don t you see that that is the very thing that her brave nature will not do She s protecting Morris and she ll go on protecting him no matter what the consequence to herself In that event said the investigator slowly we can not be in too great a hurry in removing the cause that keeps Morris in hiding You ll have a task in that said Pendleton As far as I can see the man is up to his eyes in the crime and that s why he is lying low I have warned you before now against jumping at conclusions said the other quietly Allan Morris may be a confederate of Locke s or he may not We have yet to establish the fact either way And now pardon me while I take a plunge and get into something presentable CHAPTER XIX THE TWO REPORTS After dinner the two young men settled themselves in the library Stumph served their coffee and they renewed their acquaintance with the Greek tobacco After a little time there came a knock upon the door Come called Ashton Kirk A short man with remarkable breadth of shoulder and depth of chest entered he was smooth shaven and salient of jaw and wore the air of one who was not easily balked in anything that he undertook How are you Burgess said the investigator Good evening returned Burgess He advanced and laid some neatly folded sheets at the elbow of his employer Fuller was busy and I thought I d bring these in myself It s my report on Hume Ah thank you Ashton Kirk took up the sheets and began running his eye through them As you get deeper into this record did Hume keep his promise Burgess smiled As to possibilities do you mean Why yes Indeed I rather think he exceeded them The man lit the cigar which the investigator handed him and drew at it appreciatively I went it alone on the first day but after that I took O Neill and Purvis on Between us we managed to get at something pretty definite Has Fuller finished with Morris He is typing his report at this moment It will be ready in a half hour I should think Please tell him to bring it in as soon as it is finished Burgess nodded and went out Ashton Kirk continued to dip into the report here and there Among three of them said Pendleton they should have sifted the man s life and adventures pretty well As Ashton Kirk continued to scan the pages a peculiar expression slowly came into his eyes They seem to have done so indeed And rather cleverly too I think Would you care to hear the report By all means eagerly The sheets were shifted into their proper order once more Then Ashton Kirk read A Further Investigation into the Affairs of David Purtell Hume No record was to be had of Hume beyond his settlement in the city in eighteen ninety nine People in the same line of business were questioned closely and those who knew anything of him at all clung to the idea that he was an American who had lived for many years abroad So we had another look at the old passenger lists of the steamships but this time we went further back We knew that the simple ruse of a fictitious name would cover Hume completely but it seemed the only thing to do and we set at it systematically In the records of the steamer Baltic of the Netherlands Steamship Company for the year eighteen ninety seven we came upon the name of D Purtell Without much hope of learning anything definite after such a lapse of time I inquired after this passenger Luck was with us in the shape of an old clerk with a long memory He faintly recalled something of the man and after some talk got out still another book And there it was D Purtell so it seemed had been involved in an attempt to smuggle a quantity of diamonds Our next step was to visit the customs people Their records were very complete They even had a portrait of Purtell which proved him to have been Hume beyond a doubt Only a trifle of evidence had been secured against him not enough to convict and they were forced to release him This seems to have been Hume s specialty However through the customs services of other countries they had learned quite a lot about him The authorities of Holland Spain and France knew him as one of the leading spirits in a system of smuggling that had been going on for years Once Hume had been located in Antwerp once at Hamburg and for a long time at Bayonne This system of contraband had been broken up just before he had been arrested by the United States service A number of the criminals had been convicted but Hume with his usual luck had escaped once more because of lack of evidence against him Nothing could be learned of the movements of Hume between his arrest on the Baltic and his location here as a dealer in the curiosities of art And after his going into business here he kept to himself a great deal But the drink habit caused him to frequent certain resorts and it was at one of these that he first met Richard Morris father to Allan Morris Ah said Pendleton So Hume knew Morris s father I asked Fuller in giving him his instructions to have this fact established if he could said Ashton Kirk That both Hume and the elder Morris were heavy drinkers caused me to think it possible Is that all there is to the report Almost The investigator turned to the pages once more and proceeded Hume and the elder Morris became quite intimate and were often seen together But what it was that formed the bond between them no one knows unless it be a deaf mute named Locke who was frequently seen in their society and who seemed upon close terms with both But within a year after their first meeting Hume broke with Morris This must have been serious for it caused a marked enmity to spring up between them A number of people recall that Richard Morris frequently made threats against the other threats of personal violence and also of the law But before anything could come of these if he really meant them he died Thinking that Locke might be able to throw some light on this phase of the case we have endeavored to locate him Up to this time we have met with no success but we hope to learn something of him at an early date Ashton Kirk laid the sheets down upon the table There follows a list of the names of the people who have supplied this information and their addresses said he Burgess is very thorough in his work Outside the fact that Hume was a scoundrel which we knew before and that he was acquainted with Locke and Allan Morris s father what does this report tell you There was discontent in Pendleton s voice as he asked this question and the investigator smiled as he made answer That Hume knew the elder Morris supplies us with a theory as to the possible part which the younger Morris has taken in this drama Whatever passed between Hume and the father has probably been taken up by the son Why yes said Pendleton I hadn t thought of that Another thing added Ashton Kirk The report has swung like the needle of a compass and indicated a fact that my imagination suggested days ago And that is That Hume once lived in the French town of Bayonne Pendleton frowned impatiently I don t know what ever made you imagine that he said But now that you find that it is so of what service is it We will speak of that later answered Ashton Kirk Pendleton was about to say something more but just then Fuller knocked and entered The report on Allan Morris said he Ah thanks The investigator took the compactly typed sheets and then he continued Tell Burgess that he need not bother about the man Locke whom he mentions Say that I have already located him Very well and Fuller left the room For a space there was no sound save that which came from the street and the rustle of the pages as Ashton Kirk went through them Well asked Pendleton finally What now Morris replied his friend does not develop like Hume Fuller suspected that he d prove colorless and so it has turned out However I ll read what he says It s headed A Second Report on Allan Morris A very careful inquiry failed to uncover anything in connection with this young man s personal affairs that was not mentioned in my first report on the same subject He has led a very even uneventful life attending strictly to business and making every movement count in the direction of distinction as a marine engineer However there has been something in his manner for the last few years that has attracted the attention of those who knew him best or came in contact with him This took the various forms of eagerness of manner irritability long fits of reveries a feverish desire for work At his place of business I learned that he has for some time had a deep interest in the reports of the patent office His clerks say that he d read these for hours at a time one of them told me of how he the clerk once forgot to call Morris s attention to the report until the day after its arrival Morris has always been very tolerant with his employees but that day he burst out in a fury and threatened to discharge them all Richard Morris father to Allan was a most erratic genius as my first report indicated His propeller his smoke consumer and his automatic brake were valuable commercial properties but had all slipped from his control Toward the end of his life he engaged in the perfection of an invention of which he talked a great deal and of which he declared that he alone would reap the benefit As Burgess will already have told you Richard Morris knew Hume The latter was a frequent visitor to a shop which the inventor maintained in the outskirts as was the mute Locke I have talked with an old mechanic who worked for Morris at the time he told me that the inventor had made a stubborn fight against the drink habit and seemed likely to conquer it up to the time that he became acquainted with Hume After this however he became as much a slave to it as ever The invention or whatever it was never got beyond the paper stage for thereafter Richard Morris spent his days in sleep and his nights at the once famous Coffin Club Ashton Kirk arose eagerly There is more said he but it is scarcely of interest Placing the report upon the table he added You have heard of the Coffin Club Pen Of course It met in an underground place somewhere didn t it And if I remember right it was fitted up like the Cafe Au Mort in Paris Something of the sort The investigator went to a huge card system and pulled out a drawer labeled TO But I recall it best by the steward whose philosophy and Irish turns of speech were so frequently quoted by the newspapers during the heydey of the establishment Can you recall his name I know whom you mean answered Pendleton but the name has slipped me Ashton Kirk paused in the fingering of the cards It was Tobin said he It came to me that it was but I wanted to be sure He pushed the drawer into place looked at his friend inquiringly and added Suppose we go around to the Rangnow and see him CHAPTER XX ONE OF THE OLD SORT Pendleton looked at his friend in bewilderment You don t mean to say that the philosopher of the Coffin Club and this Tobin of young Morris s are the same cried he I only think they are said Ashton Kirk quietly But we can make sure by paying a short visit to the apartment house Now There is no time like the present And so the end of a half hour found them stepping out of a cab at the extreme west end of the city It was only a little after nine o clock but the streets were almost deserted the arc lamps clicked and hissed lonesomely rows of darkened windows and shadowy doorways ran away on both sides There is the place we want said the investigator pointing at an illuminated sign which hung out over the sidewalk some little distance away When they reached the place they found it was rather a large building of the modern type pushing open the swinging doors and making their way through a brilliantly lighted passage they found themselves in an equally brilliant office Here they saw a dozen or more men seated in tilted chairs all wore their hats and for the most part smoked cigars Behind a polished counter on which rested a nickeled cash register and a huge book stood a white haired man with a smooth Irish face and a pair of gold eyeglasses hanging by a black cord The air was heavy with disputation long tailed words boomed sonorously red faced and earnest one of the occupants of the chairs assailed the man behind the counter with soft sweeping eloquent gestures the latter defended himself And what demanded he placing his hands upon the shining top of the counter and shoving his head forward inquiringly is all this that we do be hearing about your suffragette Who is she What is she The newspapers are filled to the top with her but sorra the sight of her did I ever see If she has any existence outside of the comic supplement gentlemen I d like to have ye show me where Did ye ever hear a whisper of her till she began to send herself by registered mail and chain herself to lamp posts Niver the one of ye Is your wife a suffragette She s not Is your mother No Your sister Again it s no Then who is it that composes the great army of female ballot seekers Is it the cook The chambermaid The woman that does the plain sewing I ll wager tis not They have too much to do already it s not looking for additional burdens they are Then where does this advanced woman flourish and have her being Here one hand went up and descended with a slap In the mansions of the rich he declaimed positively in the lap of luxury Among the feminine descendants of successful gum shoe men Here the man with the flushed face attempted to speak but an eloquent sweep of both hands silenced him They have nothing to do stated the orator but to invent ways of pleasing themselves Monkey dinner parties diamonds automobiles and boxes on the grand tier have no more attraction private yachts and other women s husbands have grown passe They want a new toy and faith nothing will please them but the destinies of the nation Their reasoning is simple and direct If a man who wheels scrap iron at a blast furnace is competent to handle the At this point the speaker was interrupted by Ashton Kirk advancing to the counter Pardon me said the investigator but can you tell me where I can find mister Tobin Is he in A look of great dignity came upon the face of the other and he drew himself up stiffly You are speaking to him sir replied he I thought so smiled Ashton Kirk My old friend Dan O Connor has mentioned you so often that I felt sure that I recognized the manner The dignity vanished from mister Tobin s face and the stiffness of demeanor fell from him instantly Do you know Dan asked he eagerly Ah there is the lad for you A credit to his country and to his name Faith he is the best judge of whiskey in the city and has a heart as large and as mellow as a barrel of it If it would not be putting you about in any way we d like a few moments in private with you At once mister Tobin touched a button A young man presented himself and to him the conducting of the house was transferred for the time being Then the two friends were led into a small sitting room where chairs were placed for them and mister Tobin seated himself opposite them with some expectation Since I became manager here explained he I seldom hear of any of the old lads Ye see it s so far from the center of the city regretfully they seldom get along this way so they do Yes I suppose they cling to their old haunts said Ashton Kirk Dan sticks to his school of boxing these days pretty closely I often drop in for a round or two with him He s as clever as ever but he s slowing up Tobin shook his white head sadly Tut tut tut said he And do you tell me that Faith he s a young man yet not much over sixty and what call have he to be takin on the ways and manners of age Even as late as the last year of the Coffin Club he was as swift as the light He frequently spoke of that club to me observed the other A queer place I understand Tobin nodded Queer enough he answered and the members was as queer in some ways Nothing would do them but they must spend their time underground sitting at tables shaped like coffins and drinking their liquor out of mugs shaped like skulls I was steward there a long time and got good pay but I never approved of the notion It always seemed like divilment to me did that Some very well known people frequented it did they not Many s the time I ve seen the governor of the state himself sitting there with a mug in his fist The liquors was of the best do you see with a pleased light in his eyes I know that for it were meself that selected them And a good sup of drink is a great attraction so it is I don t think that can be successfully denied admitted the investigator Some very brilliant men have proved it to their sorrow True for ye said Tobin Don t I know it We had actors and writers and editors the cream of their professions and every one of them a devotee so to speak of Bacchus Sure the finer the intellect the greater the sup of drink appeals to them if it does at all One of the greatest frequenters of the club was a man whose inventions with a grandiloquent gesture revolutionized the industries of the world And when he was mellow with it boys o boys but he could discourse His name was Morris added the speaker and he was the father of the young man whose name has been mixed up with this Hume affair which is so occupying the public mind just now Indeed There was a pause Tobin s mobile face looked back upon the past his eyes had an introspective light in them To think said he how the natures of men differ Some are like the gods of old and others again are like well like anything you choose to call them And yet with philosophic speculation these two widely diversified types are sometimes friends To the surprise of everyone they occasionally take up with one another It s hard to say why but it is so I ve noticed it myself said Ashton Kirk Tobin nodded Never said he did I see it so exemplified as in the case of Richard Morris and this felly who has just been killed Never were two men more unlike but sorra such an intimacy did I ever see afore as there was between them Morris when he had the drink in him was a poet His ideas soared to the starry skies he flew about upon the wings of the wind faith I believe he thought the sun was not beyond his reach But Hume was a divil God save us that I should say the like about any human creature but he had the imp in him for many s the time I see it grinning and looking out at his two eyes I ve heard it said that he was an unpleasant sort of chap agreed the other Unpleasant said Tobin does not do credit to his capabilities though tis a good word enough There was never a man came into the Coffin Club during the five years that I were there that looked as though the place fitted him but Hume The others were like bad little boys who wouldn t take a dare But Hume was just right To see him lift one of the stone skulls to his lips and grin over it at you would make your blood run cold And bless us and save us gentlemen how he would jeer and snarl and laugh all at the one time Many s the time I ve listened to poor Morris rave and paint his pictures of what he was going to do in times to come and on the other side of the coffin table Hume would urge him on leerin and grinnin like Satan himself and making all manner of game of him Bedad me gorge rose at it more than once and it was all I could do to keep from takin him by the scruff of the neck and throwin him intil the street Almost every man has some spark of good in his nature however faint said Ashton Kirk And Hume may have had one too though no one seems to have discovered it Tobin smiled and returned An Irishman always has a good deal of respect for the fighting strain no matter if it be in a man or a beast or a bird Old Nick himself must be a grand two handed man and as such we must give him credit And twas the same way with this felly Hume He had real fighting blood so he had and sorra the man ever undertook to impose on him the second time And as a true Celt you held this to be a credit mark laughed Ashton Kirk I did And indeed he seemed to consider it so himself though he was not one to care a snap what others thought of him But often he d boast of the stock he came from Fighters they were to the core he said fighters who never knew when they were whipped and who d go on fighting while they had a leg to stand on an eye to see and an arm to strike a blow Tobin here paused and stroked his smooth shaven chin reflectively He claimed descent from someone who was rated a real man in his day he continued Twas an officer I think who fought with faith yes smiling in recollection at the side of sorra the one less than Washington himself Pendleton listening with dwindling interest saw Ashton Kirk s hand clench and saw a gleam shoot into his eyes Then he saw him bend toward Tobin his elbows on his knees his clenched hands beneath his chin Ah said the investigator and his voice was calmer than Pendleton remembered ever hearing it before he claimed a pedigree did he And from a Revolutionary officer Such things are always interesting It s a pity you can t remember the soldier s name Tobin pondered I can t confessed he at length but there is one thing that I remember hearing Hume tell about him it seemed laughable at the time and I suppose that s why it s stuck to me It seems that the supposed ancestor were a great felly for dress and expected the like of all the men under him and though he often had niver a crust of bread to put into their mouths he always managed to have a pinch of white powder for them to dress their hair Ashton Kirk laughed suddenly and leaned back in his chair The gleam died out of his eyes and a twinkle of satisfaction replaced it That said he sounds amusing enough to be true mister Hume s ancestor was at least consistent But and his tone changed we must not keep you from your duties mister Tobin and so we ll get to the matter in hand If it is not hurrying you agreed Tobin A while ago spoke Ashton Kirk you mentioned young Allan Morris and during your conversation you have led me to think that you were his father s friend I were said Tobin He were a decent man Then perhaps your friendship extends to the son as well Perhaps it does and a note of perceptible caution crept into Tobin s voice I am glad to hear it said the investigator He seems badly in need of friends of the right sort just now and I am confident mister Tobin that you are of that sort A man who has disappeared as completely as this one has done stated Tobin is out of the reach of even the best of friends Have you not heard from him since the murder No replied the other with a readiness that carried conviction Then you will and before long Ashton Kirk arose and stood looking into the old man s face Perhaps it will be to night but it will be by to morrow night at latest And when you do you can best show your friendship for him by telling him not to be a fool You mean said Tobin shrewdly that I m to advise him to give over hiding Exactly I ll do that willingly enough if I hear of him An innocent man has no call to hide himself like a rat But inquiringly after I tell him that what will I do Ashton Kirk took out a card handing it to the other he said Ask him to come see me Tobin gave the card one glance then his face lit up and his hand went out Let me shake your hand sir said he And I ll tell the lad what you say with a heart and a half CHAPTER XXI ASHTON KIRK BEGINS TO PLAN As Ashton Kirk and Pendleton left the Rangnow the latter said You surely do not suppose that Morris will call on you Why not It does not sound reasonable A day or two ago I would have said the same But things are taking on a different aspect And with their change Morris will change He had no idea of what was to come or he would not have done what he has done No criminal would said Pendleton Ashton Kirk shrugged his shoulders at this but made no direct reply And now if these newspapers with all their pointed references to Edyth Vale do not make the man come forward he went on what is about to happen say within the next forty eight hours will be sure to do so Pendleton turned a surprised look upon him You think then that something unusual is about to happen I know there is was the quiet reply To night old chap has been most prolific in results It has indicated why the murder was done it has suggested the identity of the actual murderer it has even pointed out the spot upon which we shall finally take him You really mean all that cried Pendleton incredulously I do Then you must have learned it at some time while I was not here Pendleton paused and then proceeded in another tone But you have not been out of my sight since dinner Everything you have heard I have heard all that you have seen I have seen Just so said Ashton Kirk There was a pause they walked along toward the place where they were to get a street car At length Pendleton spoke once more And from the rather bald reports of your two assistants and the talk of this man Tobin you have gathered these most vital facts We can hardly call them facts as yet said the other but I have every confidence that we can do so within the time specified A gong sounded sharply and a car crossed the street Pendleton placed his hand upon his friend s shoulder Kirk said he I am not going to ask another question I m just going to wait and if it turns out as you say I ll never question a statement of yours as long as I live I ll swallow them all as the Mussulman swallows the Koran They boarded the car and Ashton Kirk settled himself in a corner His arms were folded across his chest his head gradually sank forward To all appearances he was asleep but Pendleton knew that he was merely turning over some plan of action that would in a little time begin to reveal itself However he was not prepared for such quick action as resulted for suddenly Ashton Kirk jumped up glanced out at the car window then darted to the platform and leaped off Pendleton followed at once and came up with him part way down an intersecting street Where to now he asked City Hall replied Ashton Kirk briefly It was no great distance to the municipal buildings they shot up in the elevator and entered the police department I d like to see Superintendent Weagle said the investigator to the officer who came forward to speak to them He s just getting ready to go home answered the man but I ll see what I can do The superintendent of police happened to be in an obliging humor and they were shown into his office a few moments later Weagle stood in the middle of the floor drawing on a light over coat the end of a black cigar was clenched between his teeth How are you greeted he Anything doing in my line Not just yet replied Ashton Kirk but I have some hopes The official laughed We all have them said he If we didn t we might as well put up the shutters He threw the cigar end away and wiped his stubby moustache with a large handkerchief You ve come for something said he What is it My wife and kiddies are expecting me and I must get home How long are you going to maintain the police guard at four hundred seventy eight Christie Place inquired the investigator I hadn t thought of it replied the superintendent However we are in the habit of keeping such details up for some little time Another thing there is a lot of valuable stuff there which must be looked after Beginning with to morrow night said Ashton Kirk I want you to withdraw your men And further I want your permission for my friend mister Pendleton and myself to watch in their place The official opened his eyes at this Well said he after a moment s silence I don t just understand your reasons and the thing is most unusual But and he nodded his head approvingly I ve always noticed that you have reasons behind everything you do and if this thing is expected to throw any further light on the Hume case why it shall be as you say Thank you said Ashton Kirk Unless I am much mistaken it will close the matter finally as far as your department is concerned and put the whole thing up to the District Attorney You mean said the superintendent with interest that you ve got something new on Spatola and perhaps on Morris and the girl I mean answered Ashton Kirk that I hope to place the murderers of the numismatist Hume in your hands in a few days whoever they may be Weagle waved his hand That s all we want said he with a laugh Give us the right ones and we ll make no complaint And now if you have nothing more to say I ll say good night They parted with the superintendent in the corridor then Ashton Kirk led the way into a room where some police officials and a number of young men were lounging about Oh how are you greeted a stout sergeant affably And how s the work While the investigator was speaking to the sergeant one of the alert looking young men approached Pardon said he But is there anything you d like to say to the Star No replied Ashton Kirk You are working on the Hume case are you not asked the reporter with professional insistence Oh I have had a little interest in it as an outsider that is all returned the other However as he was passing through with Pendleton I can give you a piece of official police news on the case which I just got from the superintendent After to night the guard will be removed from Hume s place Weagle thinks the regular policeman on the beat is all that is needed from now on As they left the building by the main door Pendleton said A little while ago I rashly promised to ask no more questions If you ll release me from that I ll unburden myself of one or two which will otherwise keep me awake to night Go ahead said Ashton Kirk with a smile Why asked Pendleton do you want the police called off at Hume s and why should we place ourselves on watch instead At the very first we made up our minds that the men who murdered Hume were in search of something didn t we Up to this time I have been unable to say whether they had succeeded or not Now however I am convinced that they failed Ah To morrow the newspapers will announce that Hume s place is to be no longer guarded It may be that the criminals are desperate enough to venture another visit in order to gain possession of the thing they covet If they do we shall be awaiting them But how do you know that they failed of their object on the night of the murder You and I said Ashton Kirk laughingly are perhaps going to spend considerable time in Christie Place beginning with to morrow evening And while there we may find it dull enough old boy a little amusement of a practical sort might not be found out of place So I ll not answer your question now I ll allow it to stand until to morrow night and then I ll give it to you compact and complete with practical illustrations as I go along CHAPTER XXII ASHTON KIRK IS ANNOYED On the following day at about noon Ashton Kirk s big French car glided up to the curb before the Vale house A man with a thick neck and a small head nodded to the investigator another waved a hand from across the street Plain clothes men he murmured and at watch upon the house That means that this matter can be brought to an end none too soon for Miss Vale s comfort He was getting out of his car when a brace of eager reporters accosted him The Standard would like to have you say a few words for publication said one The Herald will give you what space you require for a statement at any time you see fit to make use of it declared the other I m very sorry said Ashton Kirk brushing a speck of dust from an immaculate sleeve but I have nothing to say that would interest your city editors or the public I have no doubt but that the police officials will be glad to acquaint you with anything new that has transpired if there has been anything new The newspaper men pulled wry faces The police hang onto the Italian musician and profess to think he s the guilty party said one If they have taken any steps beyond this before to day we have not known of it Why have the detectives been placed to watch Miss Vale s house asked the other And what has Osborne gone in to talk about Ah said Ashton Kirk with interest Osborne is within is he Yes and why are you going in What has been learned regarding Miss Vale s connection with the case that has not already been made public I would hardly undertake to answer that last laughed Ashton Kirk So much has been made public in one way and another that I haven t been able to keep track of it all My own visit is merely a friendly call Why mister Osborne is here I of course cannot say Leaving the newspaper men disappointed and dissatisfied the investigator rang the bell and was admitted In the hall pulling on his gloves was Osborne Hello exclaimed the latter So you thought you d have a try too eh The big man s tone showed that he was none too well pleased with his own visit he jerked at his gloves viciously and his brow was creased with vexation And seeing that the other was disposed to do nothing more than nod he went on Well you ll have to have a lot better luck than I ve had to have any at all Miss Vale it seems is a young lady who knows very well how to say nothing I ve been here something like an hour and have put her through a regular third degree but I ve had my labor for my pains as the saying is She has told me nothing except her opinion of the newspapers and the police Miss Vale will see you sir said the man servant returning And so you ve given it up queried the investigator of Osborne The big headquarters man shrugged his shoulders Hardly said he I ve set a time on the thing We scarcely like to go to extremes as you perhaps know but unless a clean breast of the matter is made as far as the party knows modifying his language because of the listening servant the same party will know what the inside of a cell is like by this time to morrow You really mean to make an arrest If we are forced to yes Ashton Kirk followed him to the door Extend the time limit suggested he Make it the day after to morrow and elevating his brows I don t think that you ll need to do anything unpleasant Ah said Osborne you re onto something He regarded the other questioningly for a moment then broke into a grin No use to ask what it is I suppose I thought not Well reflectively and in a lowered tone it won t do any harm to oblige you if the front office is willing The party can t make a move that we won t know about and the fact is I ve just advised that no going out of any kind be ventured on So long and good luck The door closed behind Osborne and then Ashton Kirk followed the soft footed servant down the hall up the stairs and into the presence of Edyth Vale The girl received him smilingly I m getting to be a regular occurrence said he as he sat down But a welcome one nevertheless she returned Indeed if it were not for certain other depressing circumstances I d find your visits dreadfully exciting I suppose Osborne is one of the circumstances referred to I just met him in the hall and he seemed to be quite in a state of mind What have you been saying to him or rather smiling what have you not been saying to him He came on what he calls police business smiled Miss Vale I considered it quite an alarming expression and said so but that made no impression on him for he proceeded with a string of wonderfully conceived questions that must have covered my life from birth to the present time The police have about the same method for each case a sort of bullying insistence that breaks down denial by sheer weight I have read of it frequently in complaining articles in both magazines and newspapers I think I have even seen it very earnestly compared to the Inquisition The smile was still upon the girl s lip but as she continued her voice shook a little However I never thought to go through even a part of it myself What the police say may be embarrassing and mortifying said Ashton Kirk gravely but it is nothing at all compared with what they might do Miss Vale drew in her breath in a little gasp of terror but she made an effort to conceal it with a laugh I know what you mean she said lightly You think that they might go so far as to take me into custody as an accessory to the crime or even as the actual criminal mister Osborne told me that such was their intention if you do not explain clearly your connection with the case I don t think that the Department is at all anxious to draw you into the matter but some of the newspapers as you no doubt have noted have grown very insistent They say that a poor musician is jailed instantly while the woman of fashion who is perhaps equally guilty is allowed to go free Such ways of putting things have a great effect upon public opinion the politicians who conduct the municipal departments know this and always move to protect themselves no matter in what direction the movement takes them Then said Miss Vale you really think they will do as mister Osborne said I have no doubt of it if the matter is not cleared up before the time arrives for them to act The girl arose and went to a window as though to look out the investigator saw her hand pressed to her heart and noted the trembling that had seized her Yet when she faced him once more a moment or two later she made a brave attempt to smile as before I think this is too bad of you she said Your point of view is almost as pessimistic as the detectives or the newspapers I had expected comfort and encouragement And I came to give it if you ll allow me said Ashton Kirk quietly She looked at him for a moment then both hands went out in a mock despairing gesture and she laughed But the laugh was unmistakably forced and a keen ear for such things would have detected a pathetic little catch in it Now she said you are becoming mysterious However I suppose I must not complain for it is entirely in character with your profession isn t it He disregarded both the observation and the tone there was a slight pucker between his keen eyes that spoke of impatience and resentment mister Osborne has been very plain with you Miss Vale said he you have perhaps become accustomed to it in a measure So I shall not hesitate to follow in his footsteps I am going to make you face some very plain facts Mercy She laughed Mercy mister Ashton Kirk I had not thought that you could be so deliberately cruel In the first place Miss Vale he began paying not the slightest attention to her laughter or the mocking light in her eyes if you had continued as you began this matter would have been cleared up before this the newspapers would never have printed your name in connection with it and you would have been spared the mortification of a detective at your doorstep Is there one outside There are several If you venture out you will be followed wherever you go The girl sank into a chair in a limp rumpled sort of way somehow the idea of surveillance affected her more than anything else Her face became ashen her hands shook distressfully as she clasped them tightly together When you allowed the fears and desires of Allan Morris to cloud your reason you made a mistake You admitted as much when you came to me after the murder but instantly upon seeing him again you were as before He was struck with fear and he communicated his terror to you as before you dreaded to trust anyone even myself I think you are inclined to take a great deal for granted said Miss Vale But in spite of the words her eyes were wide with alarm He told you of the deaf mute Locke said Ashton Kirk and also other things which seem to have induced you to visit Locke at the Institute near Cordova on the night before last Miss Vale elevated her brows in surprise her attitude was one of wonderment I don t think I understand And you did not seem to understand yesterday when I called upon you You fancied that I was not sure that I had seen you and had come expecting you to admit the visit to Locke And as I went away you also fancied that you had thrown me off the scent He smiled at the recollection in spite of his evident resentment of her position But the fact of the matter was that I knew your fiance had been the cause of your visit to the mute You had seen Morris you knew where he was and I thought it would be a useful thing for me to be also acquainted with his whereabouts But protested Miss Vale in a faint voice but still acting her chosen role to the best of her gifts if I had known and desired to conceal his whereabouts surely you did not expect me to tell you of it Not directly But if you remember I dropped a hint that his hiding place was about to be discovered This was true you were about to disclose it I had only to wait and follow as you rushed off to warn him She leaned back in her chair and regarded him strangely but he proceeded with evenness Your work upon the road was very clever I congratulate you upon it But it was scarcely sufficiently inspired to deceive an old hand Here he waited apparently expecting her to speak But as she did not take advantage of the pause he went on I called this morning to acquaint you with these things and to advise you on your future course I must admit that I rather admire your steadfastness in following out what Allan Morris has desired of you however it is a great mistake for a strong nature to submit to the clamorings of a weaker one She sat suddenly erect protest was in her eyes and one hand went up in denial But though her lips opened as though she were about to speak no words came once more she sank back in the chair with the air of one compelled to admit a bitter truth I am not so sure as to how deep Morris is in this murder continued the investigator but I have some ideas on the subject On the other hand I am quite sure that you are promised to aid him and that you feel duty bound to do so to the end according to his not very wise instructions He arose and stood looking down at her kindly My advice to you he went on and I speak with a fair knowledge of the facts is that you do nothing more Be content with what you have attempted allow me to act for you in anything further which you have in mind Or if you cannot give me your confidence let me carry the thing on in my own way as you proposed at the first There was a pause of some length then the girl spoke I am just a trifle bewildered at all this she said and I really cannot say mister Ashton Kirk that I altogether follow you He smiled but the disapproving wrinkle still showed between his eyes I see that you are still determined to hold to your attitude he said I am sorry of course but then one is called upon at times to do as one thinks best and I suppose that is what you are doing He turned toward the door and she arose and touched the bell Good by Good by she returned He stood for a moment in the doorway regarding her with mingled annoyance and admiration As he caught the steps of the approaching servant in the hall he said Possibly I can save you some little trouble You need not call at the Rangnow Apartments Up to last night Allan Morris had not notified mister Tobin as to his new hiding place However if you feel that you must see him you can call at my place at this hour on the day after to morrow I am not sure of course but it occurs to me that he will be there CHAPTER XXIII THE SECRET OF THE PORTRAIT The morning papers had all announced the fact that the detail of police would that day be withdrawn from the scene of the murder in Christie Place With them it had been a mere matter of fact news item but with the evening sheets it was different They had had time to digest the matter and their view of the order was one of surprise Two or three allowed this feeling to expand itself into headlines of some size a few also commented on the situation editorially Superintendent Weagle had been interviewed He stated that he could not be expected to maintain a detail at four hundred seventy eight indefinitely even with the police withdrawn from within so he maintained the place would be as effectually guarded as were other buildings What more was required Ashton Kirk read all this with some satisfaction in the late afternoon They have given the thing even more publicity than I had hoped for he said as he helped Pendleton in the details of a rough looking costume which that worthy was donning It must be a bad day for news and they have plenty of space At any rate anyone who is at all interested in the fact is now aware that after six o clock this evening four hundred seventy eight Christie Place will be unguarded except for the regular patrolman Of course with a glance at Pendleton and another in a mirror at himself if a brace of rough looking characters are hidden away within there will only be a few who know it He opened a drawer and took out two black shining objects the short barrels and blocky shapes told Pendleton that they were automatic revolvers They will throw ten slugs as thick as your little finger while you re winking your eye as many times said Ashton Kirk They each slipped one of the squat formidable weapons into a hip pocket then they made their way out at the rear of the house With the collars of their sack coats turned up and their long visored cloth caps pulled down they hurried along among the dull eyed throngs that bartered and quarreled and sought their own advantage And when in the uncertain dusk a wagon drew up at four hundred seventy eight and two sack coated cloth capped men began carrying parcels up the stairs is it any wonder that Berg watching from the window of his delicatessen store said to his clerk Dot furrier that rents der rooms by der third floor is putting some more things in storage over the summer yet And when the wagon finally drove away neglectfully leaving the two men behind it is not surprising that the fancy grocer did not notice it And then when the two policemen who had been on duty during the afternoon came out carelessly left the door unlocked looked up to make sure that they had left none of the windows open and then strode away with a satisfied air that follows a duty well done who so keenly watched as to suspect The shadows on the second floor lengthened and grew grayer they thickened in the corners pieces of furniture grew vague and monstrous as the darkness began to cling to them and their outlines became lost suits of armor loomed menacingly out of the gloom the last rays of light striking palely upon helm or gorget hideous gods of wood and stone smiled evilly at the two watchers There was food in the bundles which we carried up then commented Pendleton as he lay back on the old claw footed sofa Yes answered his friend The person or persons whom we expect will hardly come to night though we of course don t know if they fail to appear we shall be forced to stick close to these rooms during the whole of to morrow and also to morrow night Perhaps it will even be longer In that case said Pendleton a little disconsolately the eatables will be very welcome But I hope we won t have to stay long enough to finish them Perhaps said Ashton Kirk I ve let you in for too hard a task in this Pen The other rose up instantly You couldn t give me too much to do in this matter declared he earnestly I would do it alone if you were not here and I had brains enough Kirk The thing must end If it goes on much longer and I keep seeing those infernal insinuations in the papers I ll go completely off my chump There was a little silence then Ashton Kirk said I never knew that you were ah this way old chap until the other day How long has it been going on Why for years I think answered Pendleton Being very distantly related Edyth and I saw quite a deal of each other when she was a slip of a girl And she was a stunner Kirk even then Kid like I fancied I d get it all over with when the proper time came but somehow I never got around to it She turned out to be a dickens of a strong character you see and she expected so much of life that I got the notion that perhaps I wasn t just the right sort of fellow to realize her ideals You know old boy there are times when a man thinks quite a bit of himself This is more especially so before he s twenty five But then again there are times when he sees his bad points only and then of all the unutterable dolts in the universe he gets the notion that he is the worst When we were at college and I held down that third base position and hit three hundred twenty in the first season I was chesty enough I suppose you remember it And when I came into my money and began to make collections of motor cars yachts and such things I thought I had taken life by the ears and was making it say uncle Well we re only grown up boys after all I recall that I thought I d dazzle Edyth with my magnificence just as Tom Sawyer did the little girl with the two long braids of yellow hair do you remember And it was after I discovered that she was not to be dazzled that I sort of gave up I wasn t anybody I never would be anybody and Edyth would be the sort of woman who would expect her husband to take the front at a jump And no sensible person could imagine me at the front of anything unless it was a procession on its way to the bow wows I think said Ashton Kirk that you began to prostrate yourself before your idol and when a man takes to that he always gets to thinking meanly of himself The attitude has much to do with the state of mind I imagine Miss Vale is a courageous capable girl but you can never tell what sort of a man a woman will select for a husband Girls have fancies upon the subject and give voice to them sometimes but it is the man they choose and not the one they picture to whom you must give your attention I suppose that is true enough said Pendleton Miss Vale s evident strength awed you went on the other And then your timidity began to magnify her qualities No woman is what she seems to be to the man who loves her Miss Vale is not so difficult to please as you thought I fancy that her engagement to young Morris proves that There you have it cried Pendleton That s it Kirk I ve stood aside considering myself unworthy and allowed a fellow to slip by me who is as colorless as water Allan Morris is no more fit to be her husband than at loss for a simile he halted for a moment and then burst out Oh he s impossible So far as we have tested him certainly agreed Ashton Kirk he has shown no great strength of character He s acted like a frightened child all through this affair He s mixed up in it and through his weakness allowed Edyth to also entangle herself Again and again he s run to her or called to her to tell her of some fresh complication that he d gotten his frightened self into and to protect him she has dared and done what would have frightened an ordinary woman into fits I think observed Ashton Kirk that she has realized his position to some extent at least The fact that he is weak has I think dawned upon her already she may also see his evident selfishness before long If she does why might there not still be some hope for you Pen Pendleton shook his head in the gloom I m afraid not said he hopelessly Somehow a weak man makes a great appeal to the woman who has grown to care for him He arouses her mother instinct And Edyth is so strong that her pity May induce her to do her utmost to see him through this trouble interrupted Ashton Kirk But it may not carry her much further When once the thing is over a reaction may set in Who knows But Pendleton refused to be comforted For a long time they talked of Edyth Vale Morris and the killing of Hume Finally Pendleton said I suppose we can t smoke here to night can we No the lights might be seen and we can t tell what sharp eyes are watching the place Pendleton sighed drearily There were many clocks in the rooms the policemen must have amused themselves by winding and setting them for at the end of each hour they began to strike singly and in pairs The brisk strokes of the nervous little modern clock mingled with the solemn sonorous beat of an old New England timepiece whose wooden works creaked and labored complainingly Elaborate Swiss chimes pealed from others through the darkness a persistent cuckoo could be heard throwing open a small shutter and stridently announcing his version of the time It was some time after midnight that Pendleton began to yawn Then Ashton Kirk said Open some of those blankets Pen and lie down There is no need of two of us watching to night I scarcely expect anything to happen Pendleton did not expect anything either but he said All right I will if you ll wake me in a few hours and let me take a turn at it Ashton Kirk agreed Pendleton stretched himself upon the sofa and soon his deep breathing told that he was asleep As the night drew on the solitary watcher grew chilled in the unheated rooms and huddled himself into another blanket but he sat near the door leading to the hall which was slightly ajar and though his eyes closed sometimes in weariness he never lost a sound in the street or a tick of one of the clocks Through the entire night he watched and waited almost without moving it was not until the dawn of a gray dirty day began to somewhat lighten the room that he aroused Pendleton The latter expostulated sleepily when he noted the time but with scarcely a word the investigator took his place upon the sofa and dropped off to sleep About nine o clock he awoke and found his friend arranging their breakfast upon a small table I say Kirk said Pendleton admiringly you did this thing rather thoroughly There s quite a tasty little snack here and the thermos bottles have kept the coffee steaming At the water tap in the rear the investigator bathed his hands and face then he sat down with his friend and did complete justice to the breakfast Afterwards with their cigars going nicely and a feeling of comfort stealing over them in spite of the rather uncomfortable night Pendleton said You promised the other night to tell me what made you think that the murderers had failed to secure the thing they sought The words that the promise was couched in made me think that you had also something to show me and as we could not light up last night I ve waited patiently until to day Now you must ease my curiosity Come tell me a few things Ashton Kirk took his cigar from his mouth I told you said he that the reports of Burgess and Fuller together with the conversation we had with Tobin had enlightened me upon these points As he enumerated them he checked them off with his fingers Why the murder was done The identity of the confederate of Locke That the man would return to the scene of the crime Yes said Pendleton those I think were the points The first two went on the investigator I will allow to stand for a while But I promised to illustrate for you and I think I can do so Ashton Kirk here arose and passed through the storeroom and kitchen into the bedroom The writing upon the step in the hall said he facing his friend directed Locke s confederate to look for something behind Wayne s portrait As all the pictures of Wayne in the place were broken or otherwise showed traces of rough handling it seemed that the thing desired must have been found However I was not sure about that as I have told you If you will recall Tobin s remarks of the other night you will note that the only thing he could admire in the man s character was his fighting spirit Then it developed that Hume made a boast of having come by this naturally enough He claimed descent from one of Washington s officers Tobin could not recall the officer s name but he related an anecdote of him that was unmistakable The officer was General Wayne By George cried Pendleton The collection of Wayne portraits was in this way explained It was also suggested to me that Hume might be an assumed name that the numismatist might have once been known as Wayne and that Locke had known him by that name Of course it s quite likely that he was not really a descendant of Wayne But he probably called himself Wayne nevertheless I see said Pendleton his hands waving with excitement And in the stress of the moment Locke wrote the name Wayne upon the step in candle grease forgetting that his confederate only knew their proposed victim as Hume His eyes rested upon the walls and upon the sneering unpleasant portrait of the murdered man He meant that the thing he desired was there indicating the portrait with an exultant sweep of the arm And by George it must be there still He sprang forward with the evident intention of wrenching the picture from the wall but Ashton Kirk restrained him Don t said he We ll leave that for our expected visitor Surely protested the excited Pendleton you don t propose to leave the thing there Think of the risk You might lose it in the end for you know one never foresees what is to turn up A fisherman must always risk losing his lure answered the investigator composedly They spent the long hours of the day in smoking and talking and at intervals they ate the sandwiches and other things which had been smuggled in in the guise of packages of furs And finally the shadows gathered and thickened once again in Christie Place CHAPTER XXIV THE SECOND NIGHT The second night of the vigil in Hume s rooms wore on Unlike the preceding one the two young men were almost entirely silent when they did speak it was in tones so low as to be scarcely above a whisper There was a taut indefinable something in the air that kept the desire for sleep from both in the brooding darkness they were alert watchful expectant The tobacco loving Pendleton afterwards recalled with surprise that not once did he think of the weed But when the queer mysterious night sounds began to come those creakings of loose planks strainings of unseen timbers and untraceable snappings in the walls that are common in old houses he frequently thought of the automatic revolver and the chill of the polished metal always felt comforting enough The clocks announced the ends of the hours according to their temperaments coming in the midst of the total silence the din seemed to Pendleton to be terrific he pictured appalled criminals on their way through the dark halls crouching in fear at the sounds Eleven o clock struck and then twelve with its continued uproar It seemed a long time before one and then two sounded Pendleton s limbs were beginning to feel loggy and numb because of the chill and the continued inaction He had ventured to stir them a little and was wrapping the heavy blanket more closely about himself when he felt Ashton Kirk s hand upon his shoulder Hush h h said the investigator in a whisper Instantly Pendleton was motionless he listened intently but the silence of the place seemed complete What is it he finally ventured to breathe The hand upon his shoulder tightened warningly but there came no other reply Again Pendleton listened The door of the showroom stood open Ashton Kirk had placed it so in order that they might catch any sound that came from the hall All the other doors leading into the hall from Hume s apartments were securely locked anyone who ventured into the suite must first pass through the showroom where the two waited and watched After a space Pendleton s attention was rewarded a faint far off rustling came to him somehow it gave him the impression of hesitation non assurance timidity he was speculating upon the queerness of this impression when there came a faint momentary glow from the hall mysterious phosphorescent unreal and then it vanished Both young men were huddled upon the sofa which was placed facing the open door A huge Spanish screen was drawn before them but the black leather was cracked in places and through these they had a clear view of the hall A moment later the glow appeared once more but this time it was brighter Someone is on the stairs reasoned Pendleton his hand going to his revolver It looks as though he were lighting matches to show the way Between the sputters of light were spaces of darkness these were filled in by the faint guarded rustling But as the light upon each appearance grew brighter so did the sound become more distinct and at length a light resonance unmistakably a footstep came from the hall Then steadily softly the sound came on through the darkness nearer and nearer it drew until at length it became unmistakable The rustling was that of a woman s skirts Then so it seemed the darkness of the doorway grew denser the soft quick breathing of the newcomer became audible her hands were heard moving over the door frame as she blindly searched for the door Then apparently she learned that the door was open a deeper breath showed the relief she felt at this now she carefully entered the room Even before Pendleton s brain realized who it must be he began to feel a tightening at his heart and now as he pictured her advancing with outstretched groping hands into the darkened room a room horrible with crime and secret dread it was all that he could do to hold himself in check He had almost an overmastering desire to spring up to cry out to her to tell her not to fear He was still struggling with this feeling when he became aware that she had paused and also that Ashton Kirk was once more gripping his shoulder with a warning hand Becoming instantly alert his senses perceived a stoppage of everything the clocks seemed to tick more faintly he could no longer hear the woman breathe There was an instant that roared with silence then came the soft steady padding of feet descending the stair Then he heard the girl release her breath in a great trembling exhalation the rustle of skirts came quick and sharp in the darkness he heard the door through which she had entered the room squeak upon its hinges and then close with a click that proclaimed it fast After this there was a long pause Pendleton could hear the faint breathing of the girl and thought it rather odd that she did not catch the sound of his own He pictured her leaning against the locked door her heart throbbing with fear as she listened to the descending footsteps stronger and stronger grew his desire to leap up and assure her that friends were at hand But at the same time the warning grip of his companion who seemed to feel what was in his mind also grew stronger and stronger With the closing of the door the sounds from the stairs had ceased to reach them There was a long pause Pendleton during this grew sensible of a long wavering mental antenna which he projected into the shadows and its delicate sensitiveness told him of the silent approach of a fearful thing A long long time it seemed to him but in reality it was remarkably brief Then the steps were heard shuffling and secret in the hall and very near at hand A soft uncertain touch fell upon the smooth glass of the door down its length the inquiring fingers traveled then the handle was tried held a moment and quietly released The steps then receded lightly down the hall For some moments all was quiet then there came the scratch of a match from the hall and its accompanying flare seen through the glass of the door A little space more and a rending sound came to their ears followed by the falling of some metallic objects upon the floor Pendleton required no explanation of these sounds it was plain that the second intruder had come prepared and had forced one of the doors All the communicating doors of the suite had been left open through them came the pushing about of furniture and the drawing down of blinds then another match flared followed by a stronger and steadier light which showed that the second visitor had lighted the gas The light filtered palely through the various rooms into the one in which the two men and the woman were hidden by means of this the former could make the latter out in a dim uncertain sort of way She seemed unusually tall as she moved noiselessly across the floor and peered cautiously through the communicating doorways Illustration WHAT SHE SAW MUST HAVE STARTLED HER What she saw must have startled her for she drew quickly back her hand pressed to her heart Then softly she retraced her steps they heard the door catch slip quietly back and were conscious that the door was swung open the woman then crept inch by inch so it seemed down the hall It was the bedroom door that had been forced the two watchers noted the bar of light that slanted from it across the passage Nearer and nearer the woman approached to it Pendleton had at first thought that she was making for the stairs but this died away as she passed them unheeding The automatic revolver was in his hand instantly leaning toward his friend he breathed in his ear She s going in there The blanket slipped from him as he arose to his feet his legs were still cramped and stiffened he felt clumsy and unsure Ashton Kirk evidently agreed that the time had come for action for he whispered in reply Through the rooms I will take the hall Pendleton stepped from behind the screen like a shadow Through the door leading to the storeroom he had an uninterrupted view of a part of the bedroom and across the floor he saw thrown the shadow of a man Noiselessly he tip toed into the kitchen the revolver held ready just outside the bedroom he paused and drawing to one side waited Then he noted the shadow move slightly and heard a deep rumbling voice say in French You were a devil Even now as I look at you you laugh and jibe The shadow upon the floor here swung its arms threateningly But laugh away I have won and it is my turn to laugh Here the shadow slid along and up the wall peering around the edge of the door Pendleton saw a man with massive stooped shoulders and a great square head covered with thick iron gray hair and instantly he recognized him as the man whom they had seen that night in the doorway of Locke s workshop The stranger was standing just under the portrait of Hume he gazed up at it and his big shoulders shook with laughter What a mistake to make he said still in French How was I to know that the old devil once called himself Wayne He reached up and took the picture from its hook with thick powerful fingers he tore the backing away and a flat compact bundle of papers was disclosed The picture was thrown upon the bed and the man stood staring at the papers a wide smile upon his face So this is the secret eh Well Locke will pay well for it and it will be worth all the risks I ve taken He was fumbling with a coat pocket as though to stow them away when there came a swift light rush the packet was torn from his hands and Edyth Vale was darting toward the hall door and the stairway beyond But despite his bulk the man with the stooped shoulders proved himself singularly swift In two leaps he had overtaken her dragging her back to the center of the room he snatched the packet from her in turn Regarding her with calm pitiless eyes he said in English I am sorry mees that you have come eh Eet makes eet mooch harder for me And I am of the kind that would rather be off quietly is it not and say no words to no one Edyth Vale pale of face but with steady eye returned his look What are you going to do she asked I am sorry to do anything spoke the stranger I do not know you and you will onderstan will you not that I can t leave you behind to talk As he spoke a flashing something appeared from the girl s pocket he lifted one huge paw to beat her down but a clenched hand protected by a corded buckskin glove thudded against his jaw his knees weakened and he sprawled upon the floor Jimmie gasped Edyth Vale Jimmie Pendleton Oh Edyth Edyth was all the man could say He slipped his arm around her for she was tottering and as he helped her to a chair Ashton Kirk quietly entered at the hall door Miss Vale said he good evening Without waiting to note if she even gave him a look he bent over the fallen man and snapped a pair of handcuffs upon his wrists A very pretty blow Pen said he admiringly Beautifully timed and your judgment of distance was excellent He slipped the fallen papers into his pocket and continued Keep an eye on him for a moment Then he stepped swiftly through the hall a moment later they heard him throw up one of the windows overlooking the street and a whistle shrilled through the night Paulson is on duty said the investigator returning He ll be here in a jiffy Sure enough they soon heard heavy steps upon the stairs and then Paulson and a fellow patrolman appeared in the doorway Astonished the policeman gazed at Ashton Kirk who nodded to them smilingly then they turned their gaze upon Pendleton who was speaking soothing words to the white faced girl who now that the danger was over clung to him tremblingly But when their eyes centered upon the manacled stranger who was then dazedly struggling to a sitting position Paulson asked Who is this This answered Ashton Kirk is M Sagon a fellow lodger of Antonio Spatola formerly a very close friend of the late mister Hume and once a resident of Bayonne in France CHAPTER XXV APPROACHING THE FINISH Pendleton spent the night at Ashton Kirk s and after breakfast he wandered into the library a newspaper in his hand and an inquiring look on his face The investigator was seated in his usual big chair buried to the knees in newspapers and making vigorous inroads upon the Greek tobacco Fuller was just leaving the room as Pendleton entered and nodding toward the disappearing form Ashton Kirk said There is some rather interesting news I have had Locke as you perhaps know under observation for some time Last night he took the train at Cordova and Burgess followed him When he reached the city he went directly to Christie Place and was seen lurking about in the shadows Humph said Pendleton what time was this Perhaps about eleven o clock Burgess so Fuller tells me never lost sight of him He acted in a queerly hesitating sort of way finally however he seemed to form a resolution and went to the door of the Marx house He was about to pull the bell then paused and tried the door instead It was evidently not locked He seemed both surprised and pleased at this he lost no time however but went in at once Pendleton sat down What do you suppose all this meant he asked Well we can t be too sure replied Ashton Kirk but I think it probable that he also saw the news of the withdrawal of the police in the papers Perhaps he came to Christie Place with the intention of informing Sagon of the opportunity that then presented itself Or it might be that he had hopes of somehow over reaching his companion in crime His lurking about would seem to point rather in that direction said Pendleton And his preferring to enter the lodging house without ringing also indicates some such idea As I see it he hoped to gain the roof unobserved He knew the house and the habits of the people quite well No doubt he had a plan and a good one He s a thinker is mister Locke If he was noticed he could indicate that he had called to see M Sagon Exactly But I very much doubt his gaining the roof Perhaps after all he was detected for a few minutes later Burgess saw him leave the house Humph said Pendleton Then after some few moments spent in the examination of his paper he threw it down It s full of all sorts of allusions to monoplanes and such like grumbled he As I had to take Edyth home last night and you went bravely away with the police and Sagon I find myself as usual trailing some distance in the rear Ashton Kirk regarded the litter of newspapers ruefully I gave them the heads of the case very plainly said he but as it was almost the hour for going to press I suppose they did not get the finer points of my meaning Some of them have made a sad mess of it However the evening papers will have a coherent account I suppose If you think I am going to wait until the evening papers are issued to get to the bottom of this thing you re much mistaken declared Pendleton I demand a full and detailed explanation immediately Here a tap came upon the door Stumph entered and handed Ashton Kirk a card Let him come up said the latter and as the man went out he continued to Pendleton We will both probably be much enlightened now It is Allan Morris Just as you said spoke Pendleton It s really almost like second sight The investigator laughed A small feat of reasoning nothing more said he However an enthusiast might find some of the elements of second sight in our conversation in this room about a week ago Pendleton looked at him questioningly It was on the morning that you called to announce the coming of Miss Vale We were speaking of how it sometimes happened that very innocent things led to most weighty results and I remarked if you will remember that your visit might lead to my connection with a murder that would dwarf some of those which we had spoken of So you did agreed Pendleton That is rather remarkable Kirk And further smiled the investigator I recall that I expressed great admiration for Marryat s conception of a homicide in the matter of Smallbones and the hag The weapon used by Smallbones it turns out was identical in character to the one used by Sagon A bayonet cried Pendleton By George So it was Just then Stumph announced Allan Morris The latter was pale and haggard his clothes were neglected and there were some days beard upon his chin He seemed astonished at sight of Pendleton however he only nodded Then he said inquiringly to the investigator You are mister Ashton Kirk I am Will you sit down mister Morris Morris sat down dejectedly Tobin advised me to come see you he said I refused at first but in view of what the newspapers contain this morning I reconsidered it Ashton Kirk nodded If you had come to me in the first place said he you d probably not have fallen into this mess and you d have saved yourself a great deal of suffering He regarded the young man for a moment and then went on Miss Vale I suppose has told you of her dealings with me She has said Morris She s been very candid with me in everything If I had been the same with her bitterly I should have acted more like a natural human being You see we were to be married she was very rich while I had comparatively nothing But this in itself would not have been sufficient to have prevented our wedding for so long The fact was that I had gotten myself into trouble through speculation I had a fear that my position might even be considered criminal from some points of view And I allowed myself to get nervous over it However there was a way by which it was possible for me to extricate myself To explain this I ll have to go back some years Take your own time said Ashton Kirk Well my father had worked for years perfecting the plans of a heavier than air flying machine Morris resumed At the time of his death he told me that it was all complete but the constructing and that I had millions within my reach But Hume had the plans my father had borrowed money of him a considerable sum and had given him the plans as security Hume had always derided the idea of the monoplane Tobin who knew them both tells me that he was forever mocking my father upon the subject And when the time came when the plans could be redeemed Hume denied having them There was no receipt nothing to show that the transaction had ever occurred The man declared that the whole thing was a drunken dream He had never seen any plans he had never paid out any money he knew nothing about the matter Time and again the man reiterated this and each time so I ve heard he would go off into gales of laughter I have no doubt but that the entire performance on his part was to afford himself these opportunities he seemed to love such things Was it not possible for your father to duplicate the plans At an earlier time it would have meant but a few weeks application at most But at this period the thing was impossible The last long debauch seemed to have sapped his intellect it also was the direct cause of his death I see said Ashton Kirk I took the matter up with Hume at once went on the young man But I had no more success than my father In the man s eyes I had but replaced my father I was another patient subject for his mockery derision and abuse There were some scattered drawings of the monoplane in father s office I began a study of these thinking to chance upon the principal idea But I was unsuccessful All this you understand was before I had met Miss Vale and before I was tangled up in the trouble I have just mentioned The fear began to grow on me that Hume meant to use the plans to his own advantage I knew that he had long been familiar with Locke who was reputed to be a mechanical genius and between them I fancied they d take action I began a watch upon the reports of the Patent Office thinking that that would finally give me something tangible to use against them However I never gave up my visits to Hume or my efforts to make him admit possession of my father s property It was during one of these visits that I first met Spatola and I was much struck by the performance of his cockatoos My father had always held to the idea that the problem of flight would be finally solved by a study of the birds this gave me an idea and I took to visiting Spatola in his lodgings in Christie Place He d have the cockatoos fly slowly round and round the big attic and I d watch them and make notes It was about this time that I met Miss Vale and asked her to be my wife a very little later in an effort to raise money I got into the financial trouble which I have referred to After a little the question of a time for our marriage came up I was filled with fear and put it off this occurred several times and I was at my wits end I could not marry with that thing hanging over me Suppose it should turn out as I feared imagine the shock to a high spirited girl to discover that she had married a defaulter It was then that I turned to the matter of the plans as my only hope with a perfected idea I could readily secure a large sum of money in advance So I redoubled my efforts to have a settlement with Hume but he only derided me as usual Continued visits to Spatola to study the flight of the birds showed me that the Italian was a fine fellow well educated and with much feeling and appreciation We became fast friends and so little by little I told him my story About the invention asked Ashton Kirk Yes The investigator turned to Pendleton I think said he that I now understand why Spatola grew so uncommunicative and suspicious toward the end of our interview at City Hall We both thought it was because I spoke of shorthand But it was perhaps because I mentioned an invention in the way of writing music He feared that I was trying to incriminate mister Morris in some way Pendleton nodded That said he I think explains it As you no doubt know went on Morris after the investigator had once more given him his attention Spatola liked Hume none too well And he had reason for his hatred poor fellow Well he became interested in what I told him and when he learned that I believed my father s papers were in all probability somewhere in Hume s apartments he suggested that I come to live in Christie Place under an assumed name He thought that in time an opportunity would present itself to cross the roofs some night enter Hume s place by the scuttle and so possess myself of the plans On the day preceding the murder I had made up my mind to have one more try with Hume and if that failed I intended to follow Spatola s advice break in and take the plans by force I was so full of this resolution that I could not contain myself I hinted at it to Miss Vale and the result of that hint you know He leaned his face forward in his hands and seemed to give way to a bitter train of thought He was evidently despondent It was also some such hint upon your part that induced her to visit Locke at doctor Mercer s place wasn t it Morris raised his head and nodded Yes he said After the murder I suspected Locke at once of having something to do with it I told Miss Vale she went there without my knowledge seeing that I had not the courage to go myself he added bitterly and demanded the plans And she learned that they were still at Hume s behind the portrait Yes Locke told her he was overcome with horror at the murder He had merely desired to secure the plans having somehow learned their hiding place He had no intention of killing Hume But why did Sagon do it he must have had it in mind when he bought the bayonet at Bernstine s said Pendleton looking at Ashton Kirk He had Do you recall how Burgess report spoke of a league of smugglers in Europe of which Hume was a leading spirit and also of how they had been captured and nearly all but Hume were tried and convicted Yes Sagon was one of those convicted The diamonds which Hume tried to smuggle into this country were to have been turned into money at the time of the gang s arrest and the proceeds spent in their defense But instead of doing this Hume left his comrades to their fate and absconded When Sagon gained his freedom he began a search for Hume meaning to have revenge This search finally led him to Locke as a person who had known Hume and who would be likely to be able to tell where he could be found Sagon has told you this queried Pendleton Yes he talked freely after he saw that his case was hopeless and he too insisted that Locke did not intend to commit murder Locke even at the time of his meeting Sagon was looking for someone to aid him in gaining possession of the Morris plans The work shop which we saw beside Locke s house contained a monoplane in course of construction but there was something lacking which he felt Morris s plans could supply and so he was anxious to get hold of it by hook or crook Sagon whose purpose from the first was murder was not at all averse to combining it with something else He took the room at missus Marx s place after he had perceived that an entrance could probably be made at Hume s by way of the scuttle The well dressed business guys that the machinist on the first floor spoke about to us were no doubt Locke who frequently called upon Sagon and mister Morris here whom the man did not suspect of being a lodger To prove a theory that I had formed and which I have mentioned in a vague sort of way went on Ashton Kirk I asked Sagon why he had used a bayonet And it turned out as I had thought Sagon and Hume had first met at Bayonne the greater part of their operations had been carried on there the band had been finally rounded up and convicted there The bayonet so legend has it was first made in Bayonne and Sagon conceived that it would be a sort of poetic justice if the traitor were to die by a weapon so closely connected with the scene of his treachery There was a pause after this and then young Morris got up slowly and painfully I don t want it to be thought said he that I was directly responsible for Miss Vale s adventure of last night or for any of the others for the matter of that If I had known at the time that she proposed visiting Locke s or Hume s either upon the night of the murder or last night I would have prevented it Ashton Kirk nodded kindly the young man s position evidently appealed to him But Pendleton sat rather stiffly in his chair and his expression never changed I will now come into possession of whatever value there is in my father s invention went on Morris and added to that it turns out that the the other thing of which I stood so much in fear has turned out favorably But in a disheartened sort of way I don t care much now that my engagement with Miss Vale is broken Broken exclaimed Pendleton I saw her this morning said Morris During the past week he continued it gradually came to me that I was not the sort of man to make her a fitting husband I hid like a squirrel while she faced the dangers that should have been mine I knew that she realized the situation as well as I and I did what I could by making it easy for her He paused at the door If there is anything that I can do or say in the final settlement of this case he added to Ashton Kirk I will gladly place myself at your services sir Good bye CHAPTER XXVI THE FINISH For the first time said Pendleton as the door closed upon Allan Morris I can feel sorry for him To lose a girl like Edyth Vale is indeed a calamity Think of the courage she s shown of what she was willing to do Why Kirk she s one in ten thousand But Ashton Kirk only nodded he had arisen upon the departure of Morris and was now drawing on a pair of gloves The splendid qualities of Miss Vale apparently had little appeal for him at that moment Are you ready he asked in a business like way Ready repeated Pendleton surprised To be sure We can scarcely call this case complete until something has been done in the matter of Locke That s so But somehow I had the notion that your men had already attended to him I always prefer to finish my work in my own way said the investigator Osborne as soon as he heard of Locke through Sagon wanted to take up the trail But I convinced him that he d better leave it to me Pendleton clapped on his hat I m with you said he but where do you expect to find him Ashton Kirk rang for Stumph and ordered the car then he replied We ll more than likely find him at home Burgess followed him back to Cordova last night They went down and climbed into the car and were soon on the road A little distance from the Mercer Institute they came upon a compact looking man seated upon the top rail of a fence chewing at a straw He wore heavy much splashed boots and a sun scorched suit of clothes Ah said Ashton Kirk I see Burgess is still on the job Burgess echoed Pendleton He looked at the man upon the fence in surprise except for the very broad shoulders there was no resemblance However Burgess grinned amiably through a rather neglected growth of beard I expected you along about this time said he to the investigator Is everything all right asked Ashton Kirk He s still there answered Burgess and he nodded toward a house with a peaked and slated roof which stood some little distance up an intersecting road It was the same house through the window of which Pendleton had seen Edyth Vale some nights previously but somehow it seemed strange and unfamiliar in daylight I can see three sides of it from here went on Burgess And if he dropped out of one of the windows on the fourth side I could sight him before he d gone fifty yards You may be sure he s there all right You ve heard of what took place last night I suppose Burgess tapped a folded newspaper at his breast pocket So has Locke said he Apparently his orders are to furnish him with the papers as soon as they arrive A man from the Institute building brought one to him more than an hour ago Just then Ashton Kirk noted far up the road upon which Locke s house stood a very small buggy drawn by an equally small horse In the buggy sat a man whose huge bulk seemed to bulge out beyond its sides Arriving before Locke s house the small horse stopped as though from habit Then with a mighty effort the fat man rolled out and waddled to the gate He pressed and re pressed the button but no one answered Ashton Kirk looked at his assistant Are you quite sure that our man is there asked he Burgess chewed his straw calmly I m positive of it said he The fat man now entered at the gate and going to the front door tried it But it was evidently fast and he turned away Hesitating for a moment he laboriously approached the work shop the roof of which could be seen through the trees Apparently the result was the same here for in a very few minutes he was seen to waddle back to his buggy and climb in with much effort Then the small horse ambled forward while the fat man leaned back in great distress You recognize him do you not smiled Ashton Kirk I do now returned Pendleton It s our friend doctor Mercer When the buggy arrived at the spot where the motor car stood the doctor regarded its occupants with some surprise Good morning greeted Ashton Kirk Painfully gaspingly the other answered this in kind The round white face wore an expression of martyrdom I am pleased to see you once more said he You like driving in the morning then said the investigator The principal s flesh quivered with repulsion It is an exercise ordered by my physician he answered I protested against it strongly but he was obdurate And I am compelled to do it before I have had my breakfast hollowly It is scarcely short of barbarous Here the small horse stretched its neck and shook itself until the harness rattled Pendleton looking from master to beast thought they might exchange places much to the master s ultimate well being There was a short pause then doctor Mercer bent his head toward them When you visited the institute a few nights ago said he you also at my request visited Professor Locke Ashton Kirk nodded For some time proceeded the other I have fancied that there was something wrong with him Not of a physical nature as is unfortunately the case with myself but more in a mental way But since that night I have been sure that some sort of a derangement had fixed itself upon him or is in progress He can scarcely be called the same person More than once I have been afraid and here the speaker lowered his voice to a husky whisper that he is unbalanced That is very grave said Ashton Kirk It has occurred to me went on the doctor not without shrewdness that something happened that night which unsettled him The eyes seemingly floating in fat turned themselves first to Pendleton then to Ashton Kirk I suppose though you know nothing of it We noticed that he seemed greatly agitated replied the investigator And we are alarmed to hear that he seems disturbed It is our rule that no one leave the institute grounds after nightfall said doctor Mercer in a troubled voice Last night I had occasion to send for him but he was gone This morning I stopped to reproach him for his absence but apparently he has not returned You re mistaken there put in Burgess Look He indicated the house as he spoke The small figure of Locke was seen emerging at the front door he paused for a moment peering this way and that in his near sighted fashion then hastily made his way toward the work shop Evidently he had not seen them With great labor and much catching of breath doctor Mercer had turned sufficiently to see these things He seemed greatly astonished He was there all the time said he It is not possible that he did not feel the vibrations of the buzzer for he is very sensitive to such things His indignation appeared to swell him to even greater proportions than before It is an affront he stated in a choked tone It is a deliberate affront He felt the buzzer and he knew it was I But he did not consider me of enough importance to trouble himself about Panting he sought to turn the small horse but in a moment Ashton Kirk was out in the road and had the animal by the head I beg your pardon said the investigator but it would probably be more beneficial to yourself and others if you continued your drive and left Professor Locke to us Amazed beyond ability to stir the doctor sat and stared But finally he found his tongue Bless my soul and body exclaimed he with a great wheezing exhalation I scarcely understand this sir My dear doctor said Ashton Kirk soothingly it is not at all necessary that you do so The fact is to state it briefly there is a trifling matter for adjustment between Professor Locke and the commonwealth The commonwealth cried the doctor and he shook like a great mass of gelatine Nothing less So you see it will be as well for you to do as I suggest Then turning to Pendleton Ashton Kirk continued I think we had better walk the remainder of the way otherwise we might get Locke s attention before it is advisable Pendleton jumped down and without another word to doctor Mercer they set off toward the slate roofed house by the roadside However after they had gone about fifty yards Pendleton turned and looked back He saw the small horse jogging away while behind it helplessly fat and hopelessly befogged sat doctor Mercer swaying dispiritedly from side to side As Ashton Kirk and Pendleton advanced upon the house they bore in mind the possibility of Locke being on the watch so they kept out of sight as much as possible It s rather odd I think that he hangs on here knowing that his part in the murder of Hume must now be known said Pendleton I rather expected an attempt at escape That may come later said the investigator grimly The finish of a thing of this sort is always a matter for speculation I have seen desperate criminals who surrendered like lambs and I ve seen the other sort give a platoon of police a good day s work in their taking Do you think it possible that Locke is one of this latter type There is no knowing But I am inclined to believe that he is Pendleton shook his head It seemed impossible that this dapper little man with his peering short sighted eyes could be capable of any determined effort to escape the police when once driven into a corner However Pendleton had ample reason to respect Ashton Kirk s judgment and so when the latter deemed it necessary to approach with caution he acted accordingly They paused in front of the house It was now past ten o clock and the sun was shining brightly a little patch of garden filled with early flowering plants lay between the house and the wood all about the work shop were the tall trees which they had noticed upon their previous visit We had better not use the gate suggested the investigator There might be an attachment of some sort that will give him warning So under cover of the trees they scaled the fence then they carefully made their way toward the shop The windows and door of this were closed nothing was stirring Near the door was scattered some rubbish and loose paper The place had an utterly deserted look Do you think he is there asked Pendleton I will know in a few moments replied the other Wait here Pendleton expected Ashton Kirk to continue his cautious approach But to his surprise the investigator with cool assurance stepped out from behind a tree and advanced toward the outbuilding when he reached the door he opened it and calmly stepped inside The building was in one great room It had some windows at the side but the greater part of its illumination came from a huge skylight As he closed the door behind him Ashton Kirk had a vague impression of something huge made of steel rods and with far stretching wing like projections at the sides But he had no time to give the mechanism even a glance of greater interest was the small figure which sat at a wide work table upon which a litter of drawings was scattered It was Locke and as the slight jar of the closing door reached him he lifted his eyes and saw the intruder If Ashton Kirk expected any display of fear or other emotion he was disappointed upon each of his previous meetings with Locke the latter had shown great trepidation but now he simply nodded quietly and seemed not at all surprised But as Ashton Kirk made a step toward him he rose and raised his hand in a gesture that was peremptory and unmistakable The investigator paused then Locke pointed to a chair directly before his bench but some half dozen yards away and when Ashton Kirk smilingly seated himself Locke did likewise Then in heavy characters he scrawled upon the back of one of the blue prints I was expecting a visitor and fancied that it might be you This he held up so that the investigator might read it Ashton Kirk nodded Again the back of a plan came into service and this time the investigator read What has occurred is most unfortunate I had no hand in it though of course I do not expect anyone to believe me Here Ashton Kirk drew a note book from his pocket and was about to write but the other stopped him with a gesture Then the man once more wrote carefully heavily in order that the other might have no difficulty in reading it from the distance Pardon me But it is not necessary for you to go to any trouble Moreover I beg of you not to think me rude your opinions in the matter have no interest for me Ashton Kirk acknowledged this with a grave nod The pencil was instantly at work again As I have said I expected a visitor but I will now add that I did not expect to be here to receive him Ashton Kirk looked swiftly into Locke s face as he read this the expression was unmistakable and the investigator leaped to his feet But the mute uttered a strange parrot like cry evidently the same that Edyth heard that night in Christie Place and Ashton Kirk saw his hand go swiftly to a button at one side of the work bench Instantly the investigator paused once more a gesture bade him be seated Slowly he obeyed and once more Locke began to trace bold characters upon the stiff paper This message read You are a wise man I had arranged everything before you came in and had sat down to make an end of it This button at my hand once started an electric apparatus but now it is connected with a quantity of an explosive my own invention and a terrible one Believe me one touch and everything in this building is in fragments Ashton Kirk when he had finished reading nodded quietly Again the mute began to write I have no ill will toward you the words ran you have two minutes to leave here and get safely away When he saw that this had been read Locke threw down the paper and took out his watch Then he pointed toward the door and sat waiting It was strange to see the little man sitting there calmly with only the pressure of a finger between him and eternity But Ashton Kirk knew stern resolution too well to mistake the look on the mute s face There was nothing to do but to obey He waved his hand in a farewell Locke returned the gesture Then Ashton Kirk walked to the door opened it and stepped out Pendleton patiently watching among the trees saw him emerge and at once moved toward him to his amazement the investigator took him by the arm and broke into a run What the deuce is the matter now asked Pendleton after they had passed the gate and were racing down the road You ll know in a few moments returned Ashton Kirk grimly He permitted no pause until they reached the car the engine of which had not been stopped Quick for your lives he ordered as he leaped in Pendleton and Burgess followed instantly The car had scarcely begun its plunge forward when a horrible rending shock staggered them And as they sped away the debris of the deaf mute s work shop was falling all about them The evening papers were glaring with the news from Cordova by the time the two friends were once more alone in Ashton Kirk s library Pendleton seemed to be pondering I say said he at last was it Morris or Spatola who remained at Hume s the night of the murder I spoke to Spatola about that answered Ashton Kirk He said it was Morris who left first and whom Hume pursued by jeers through the open window Morris had according to his resolve called at the place to demand the plans but Hume was mad with liquor and was even worse in his manner than usual Unable to bear it Morris had rushed out Spatola later made his way out by way of the scuttle and across the roof as he frequently did The thing which Spatola had carried under his coat that night was a diploma which he had received from a musical conservatory in Rome It was in a frame and so made considerable bulk Hume had denied that afternoon that Spatola had ever studied in this particular conservatory frantic with rage but knowing that he was a fool for doing it the Italian had brought his diploma as proof Morris under the name of Crawford occupied a room on the floor below Spatola and as soon as the musician entered through the scuttle he descended the stairs and went immediately to his friend s room to console and encourage him Some time passed and while they were still talking they heard a step upon the stairs leading to the attic As no one lived there but himself Spatola looked and in the semi darkness saw two men descending He called and asked who they were and Sagon s voice replied that it was he and a friend They had gone up to have a talk and smoke a cigar with him but seeing that he was not in they had come down at once And now as he was apparently engaged they would not trouble him and with that they disappeared within Sagon s room Then said Pendleton they had gone up through the attic across the roofs committed the deed and returned while Spatola was with Morris It would seem so But suppose that on reaching the attic upon their return they had found Spatola there Sagon had calculated it all very nicely One night a week Spatola went to play with two compatriots at their rooms with piano harp and violin they gave vent to the harmony that was in them That was the night for the trio and Sagon knew it But In his rage and his desire to prove his standing to Hume Spatola had forgotten it When he descended to Morris s rooms the two criminals thought he had gone to make his usual visit to his friends Sagon says he almost lost his nerve when the Italian confronted them on the stairs But here s a thing I ve not been able to puzzle out According to your notion and you may have proved it since for all I know Locke was not in the showroom during or after the murder And yet it should have been he who dropped the little particle from the railroad ticket upon the desk It would seem that way admitted Ashton Kirk but the fact is that Sagon visited Locke at the Institute and rode to the city with him that afternoon The particle may be accounted for in that way Yes mused the other that s so But one thing more I should have asked this of Morris himself if he had not been in such a confoundedly miserable way Why did he take to hiding immediately after the murder He spent the night in his lodgings at Christie Place next day the papers told him that he was suspected He knew that if he appeared he d be arrested and as he desired to recover the plans before the murderers escaped with them he felt that this would be fatal to his chances Of course I am not sure of this but I think it more than likely Speaking of taking chances on the plans said Pendleton you were willing enough to take pretty long ones on them last night Why Sagon actually had them in his hands Ashton Kirk drew a flat packet from his pocket Opening it he showed that it contained nothing but blank paper This is what Sagon found behind the portrait said he with a smile The real papers I was very careful to remove two days ago One moment that s the telephone Pendleton sat rolling a cigarette and wondering while Ashton Kirk took down the receiver Well said he Then in a moment his expression changed Oh is it you Well how are you after your exciting experience Here Pendleton dropped the completed cigarette and listened You may consider yourself very fortunate to escape with a slight headache said Ashton Kirk Then there was a pause and he said apparently in answer to a question Oh yes he s with me now Will you speak with him Pendleton arose and took a step toward the stand But he halted as if shot when his friend continued in the transmitter No Pause Oh very well Good by Ashton Kirk hung up the receiver and turned to his friend So said Pendleton in a queer sort of voice she doesn t wish to speak to me Not over the wire no But she wants you to come to her at once She desires to hear all about what she calls the wonderful way we have handled this case and she wants to hear it from you Ashton Kirk looked at his watch It is now ten forty five You can get there by eleven if you rush Do you call doing that little distance in fifteen minutes rushing The young man s face was radiant and he was making for the door as he spoke If I don t do it in half that time I m a duffer Then the door slapped behind him and Ashton Kirk heard him bounding down the stairs

Gutenberg tm electronic works Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web
